                                    Preface

   I have had in view, in writing this Commentary on John, the wants of
   the ordinary reader, rather than critics, preachers and theologians,
   and have therefore aimed to write in plain and simple language,
   avoiding technical phrases and Greek words which would only be
   intelligible to the learned. While I have endeavored to avail myself of
   the studies of the great Biblical scholars I have sought to present in
   a popular form the results of their studies, rather than their methods.
   As it has been the aim of my life to speak or write for the benefit of
   the common people, so in this volume I have constantly had before my
   mind that class to whom the Great Teacher so adapted his instruction
   that "they heard him gladly." I have felt the more need of simple forms
   of speech, copious illustration and application, in that the Fourth
   Gospel itself, on account of its lofty themes, rises to an elevation
   far above the ordinary channels of human thought, and is less likely to
   be understood by the common reader than the more matter of fact
   treatises that precede it in the New Testament.

   It is fitting that I should acknowledge my indebtedness to those of
   whose studies I have freely availed myself. With most of the
   commentaries of note in the English language at hand for consultation,
   I have industriously compared them, often adopting their views, and
   even when I did not, frequently receiving suggestions that have aided
   me to a satisfactory conclusion. Where I have quoted an author I have
   given proper credit, but I cannot refrain from expressing my especial
   obligation to the critical Greek Testament of Dean Alford. I have found
   no other author whose calm and impartial temper and sound judgment were
   so generally trustworthy. I also place a high value upon the work of
   Canon Westcott.

   I have thought it would help to an understanding of the text to give
   the Revision and the Common Version, side by side. The former, while
   not likely to become the "Accepted Version" until it has undergone
   further revision, is probably the most accurate translation yet made,
   and often clears up obscure passages. While it is given, and used in
   the comment, it is not made the basis for the reason that it is not yet
   the Accepted Version of the English speaking world.

   On the difficult question of the Chronology of the ministry of our Lord
   I have, in the main, followed Andrews, from whose very careful
   arrangement, a departure is not lightly to be made, though in one or
   two instances I have thought there were sufficient reasons for a
   deviation. It will be seen that John, while passing many details,
   follows the natural order of events and, in order that each may be seen
   and studied in its proper connection, I have aimed to outline, in their
   place, the incidents of our Savior's history which are to be supplied
   from the other Evangelists.

   Whatever imperfections of style the reader may discover are to be
   ascribed, in part, to the fact that this work has been written at
   intervals snatched from a very busy life. While the study of the
   writings of John has been a pursuit and joy for years, the writer feels
   that the quiet and studious repose of the library would have been more
   favorable to satisfactory arrangement of the results than the hurry of
   an editorial career. Still he trusts that his labors may aid some of
   his fellow mortals to a fuller knowledge of Him whom to have seen and
   known is to have seen the Father. He commits this study of the last and
   greatest of the Gospels to the public with the prayer that it may be
   blessed as a means of leading men to "believe that Jesus is the Christ,
   the Son of God, and that believing, they might have life through his
   name."

The Authorship.

   The Fourth Gospel has in all ages been ascribed by the Church to John,
   the son of Zebedee, an apostle of Jesus Christ. Within less than an
   hundred years of the date of his death Christian writers living in
   different portions of the world, whose writings are still extant,
   indicate to us that this was the universal belief of the Church. The
   testimony to the authorship is stronger than can be furnished in behalf
   of almost any uninspired writing of antiquity, and it would hardly be
   worth while to allude to the question had not a class of modern critics
   arisen who decide the question of the authorship of a portion of
   Scripture by the agreement or non-agreement of its teachings with their
   own views. Since the Fourth Gospel is more emphatic in affirming the
   pre-existence and divine majesty of Jesus Christ than the other three,
   a school of recent rationalistic critics has held that it is not the
   work of an apostle. I will very briefly show the reasons why its
   authorship must be conceded to John.

   1. It is certain that it was written by a Jew. The familiarity which is
   constantly shown with Jewish locations proves that the author must have
   been a resident of Palestine. Places are named that are not spoken of
   elsewhere in the Old or New Testament, and of the existence of which we
   would have had no knowledge were it not for the fact that they are
   mentioned in this Gospel. Some of these, whose sites were unknown for
   ages, have been brought to light by recent exploration. "Ã†non near to
   Salim" is an example. Not only does the author exhibit the most
   intimate knowledge of places, but of Jewish rites, customs, prejudices
   and feelings. This is so constantly exhibited as to demonstrate that
   the Gospel could not be the work of a Gentile. Every ancient writer,
   not of the Jewish race, who attempts to describe the Jewish people
   falls into the greatest errors, and the exact acquaintance with Jewish
   life, portrayed in almost every chapter, leaves no doubt that the
   Fourth Gospel is the product of a man born and reared under Jewish
   influences. Not only does the author exhibit an intimate knowledge of
   Jewish life, usages, and religious views and feelings, but also of the
   Jewish Scriptures. These are quoted with great frequency and it is
   noted by scholars that these quotations are often not taken from the
   Septuagint, the version into the Greek language, in which only these
   writings were known to the Gentile world. They are at times from the
   Hebrew, where it differs from the Septuagint, and at times the
   translation is original, instead of that of the Greek version. This
   establishes beyond a doubt, not only that the author was a Hebrew, but
   a Hebrew of Palestine. Among the Jews dispersed abroad (The Dispersion)
   the service of the synagogue was conducted, not in Hebrew, but in Greek
   by means of the Septuagint version. To Gentiles of all conditions of
   life and to Jews of the Dispersion with rare exceptions, the Hebrew
   Scriptures were, even in the Apostolic Age and earlier centuries,
   unknown. No instance is known of a Gentile in those times becoming
   possessed of such knowledge.

   To the same conclusions the Hebraic style of the book bears testimony.
   Dr. Ewald, the greatest Hebrew scholar of the nineteenth century,
   declares "The Greek language of our author bears the strongest marks of
   a genuine Hebrew who, born among the Jews of the Holy Land, and having
   grown up among them, had learned the Greek language in later life, but
   still exhibits in the midst of the whole the spirit and air of his
   native tongue."

   2. The Jewish author must have been a personal attendant of the Savior
   and a witness of the scenes which he describes. There is a life-like
   portraiture and an attention to details that could not come from
   hearsay. The first chapter furnishes an illustration in its account of
   the witness of John, the disciples directed to the Lamb of God, the
   disciples gathering around Jesus, and the conversation with Nathanael.
   The same characteristic is seen in the account of the wedding feast at
   Cana of Galilee, at the feeding of the Five Thousand, in the
   conversation at the Passover Supper, and on many other occasions. The
   writer must either describe as an eye-witness what he saw and heard, or
   he must have manufactured the details, a hypothesis utterly improbable,
   for reasons that will be given elsewhere. He claims to have been an
   eye-witness, and the internal evidence declares that his claim is true.

   3. If the writer was a Jew, an attendant on Christ and a disciple, he
   must have been an apostle. There were none others who were with him
   from the beginning to the end of his earthly ministry. He must have
   been an apostle, too, who was admitted to the most sacred intimacy with
   the Lord, and who shared his thoughts to a degree not common even to
   the apostolic band. There is no other portion of the Scriptures, not
   excepting the other Gospels, that so completely reveals the inmost
   thoughts of our Lord. Elsewhere we have the Savior portrayed as the
   teacher of Israel and as He appeared in his conflicts with his
   adversaries. Here, in addition, we hear his confidential counsels to
   his chosen disciples, his tender consolation and intense solicitude; we
   behold the very pulsations of his loving heart as he stands revealed as
   Lord and Master, Friend and Brother. Of the apostolic band only three,
   Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, were admitted to the inner circle of
   the Savior's confidence. Peter could not have been the author, because
   (1) the style and mode of thought differ materially from what we
   observe in Peter's addresses and the two Epistles of which he was the
   author, and (2) all antiquity holds that the Gospel of Mark was written
   under the supervision of Peter. James could not have written it, for he
   suffered martyrdom at the hands of Herod long before the date to which
   it must be assigned. John only, remains, and it follows from this
   induction that it must have been written by John the Apostle.

   4. This harmonizes with the statements made in the Gospel itself and
   with its internal character. Certain facts should be noted. (1) The
   author never mentions John the Apostle by name, and barely once names
   the sons of Zebedee. When he names John the Baptist, he calls him
   simply John, as if no other John was worthy of mention. (2) The author
   was an intimate companion of Peter. It was to him Peter whispered at
   the Supper; he and Peter came to the sepulcher together; they were
   fishing together in Galilee when the risen Savior appeared; it was of
   his future fate that Peter asked the Lord on this same occasion. When
   we turn to the history of Peter and John we find that the same intimacy
   existed, they were fishermen together and partners before they became
   disciples of Jesus; they were constant companions and fellow-workers in
   the early preaching of the Gospel as recorded in Acts.

   5. There can be no doubt but that the same person was the author of the
   Fourth Gospel who wrote the First Epistle of John. There is an identity
   of thought and a similarity of phraseology that are unmistakable. If it
   is from the hand of John, as is generally conceded, so must be the
   Gospel also.

   We have now considered the internal evidence of authorship which points
   unmistakably to the younger of the two sons of Zebedee. It will be of
   service to inquire whether this view is confirmed by the testimony of
   antiquity. As stated by Lucke, who has made an exhaustive examination
   of the subject, "down to the end of the second century this Gospel was
   universally recognized and attributed to the apostle whose name it
   bears." In the Canon Muratori, the first list of the New Testament
   writings, a fragment which belongs to somewhere near A. D. 180, it is
   named and ascribed to John. About the close of the century or the
   beginning of the next, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian of Carthage,
   and IrenÃ¦us of Gaul, all bear similar testimony. That the reader may
   see his opportunity for full knowledge upon the subject we will quote
   from IrenÃ¦us. This eminent writer, an earnest Christian and a martyr,
   says: "I can even describe the place where the blessed Polycarp used to
   sit and discourse--his going out and his coming in--his general mode of
   life and personal appearance, together with the discourses he delivered
   to the people; also how he spoke of his familiar intercourse with John,
   and with the rest of those who had seen the Lord; and how he could call
   their words to remembrance. . . . What I heard of him I wrote, not on
   paper, but in my heart, and by the grace of God I constantly keep it in
   mind." It will be seen that IrenÃ¦us was a pupil of Polycarp who was a
   pupil of John, and surely had every opportunity of knowing just what
   John did write. He states it as an undoubted fact that John wrote the
   Gospel that bears his name. The testimony stands as follows. 1. All the
   internal evidence points directly to John as the author. 2. Men who
   talked with those who were his companions, affirm that be was the
   author. 4. The universal voice of the Church at the close of the second
   century harmonizes in ascribing the Gospel to John; an array of
   testimony that can leave no doubt that it came from the pen of the
   beloved apostle. If we reverse the order of proof it stands as follows:

   1. In the fourth century all the ancient Greek manuscripts of the New
   Testament, including the Sinaitic and Vatican, which belongs to the age
   of Constantine, and are copies of older manuscripts; all the ancient
   versions made during the second and third centuries, and all the canons
   of the books of the New Testament contain John and ascribe it to the
   apostle.

   2. The Greek and Latin Fathers up to the middle of the second century,
   without a dissenting voice, bear the same testimony. This includes
   Jerome who died A. D. 419, Eusebius (340), Origen (254), Tertullian
   (200), Clement (190), IrenÃ¦us who wrote about A. D. 178, Theophilus
   (180), Muratorian Canon (170), Tatian (155-170) who quotes the Gospel,
   Justin Martyr (103-166) who also quotes it. It may be added that
   Polycarp, the disciple of John, of whose writings only a fragment is
   preserved, in it quotes the First Epistle of John, but it is conceded
   that it had the same author as the Gospel. This martyr died A. D. 155,
   when about 86 years old, and was 25 or 30 years old when John went to
   rest.

   If, then, John did not write the Fourth Gospel, it must have been
   written about the time he died by a great Unknown, the mightiest mind
   of the Gospel historians and palmed off on the men who knew John
   personally and had been educated at his feet as the genuine composition
   of the last of the apostles. This must have been done so skilfully that
   no dissenting voice in the Church protested against the fraud!

     Either we must have here truths which Christ taught reported by one
     who lived after the spiritual and catholic character of Christianity
     had begun to show its actual development, and who, therefore,
     comprehended his profounder instructions as they were not
     comprehended during his lifetime; or else we must believe that the
     centuries immediately following the Christian era produced a
     spiritual genius whose insight into the profounder truths of human
     experience, when inflamed into more than merely human life by the
     inbreathing of God, makes him the equal if not the superior of the
     Jesus portrayed in the three Synoptic Gospels, and yet one who has
     been utterly unknown to fame, and who has left no other monument to
     his memory than a document that is a fraud if not a forgery. The
     skepticism that asserts this lays too heavy a tax on human
     credulity. It asks us to believe not only in a Socrates who had no
     Plato to reveal his teachings and his influences, but in one who did
     not hesitate to employ a petty and a useless fraud as a setting for
     the most transcendent spiritual truth.--Abbott.

The Author's Life.

   John the Apostle, was evidently born and reared in the vicinity of the
   sea where he afterwards assisted his father in the calling of a
   fisherman. It has been thought that Bethsaida on the northern shore was
   his early home. As James is usually mentioned first, John is supposed
   to have been the younger of the two sons of Zebedee. Salome, his
   mother, is thought to have been a sister of Mary the mother of Christ,
   a hypothesis that would make John the cousin of our Savior. He was
   probably a few years younger than Jesus as all antiquity testifies that
   he lived until the year 98 of our era. His parents seem to have been in
   comfortable circumstances, since we have an allusion to the hired
   servants of his father, and his mother was one of that band of noble
   women who followed Jesus, supported him with their means, who brought
   spices to his tomb, and who were last at the cross and first at the
   open sepulcher. John was himself a personal acquaintance of the high
   priest and seems to have had a home in Jerusalem into which he received
   the mother of our Lord after the crucifixion. The fact that he was
   called on to do so favors the idea that he was a kinsman.

   He was pronounced by the Jews (Acts 4:13) an "unlearned and ignorant
   man." This, however, does not mean that he was illiterate, but that he
   had taken no theological course in the rabbinical schools, without
   which they thought that it was great presumption for any one to assume
   to be a teacher of religion. The education of John was such as all
   respectable Jewish children were wont to receive and we know that they
   were better educated than the children of any other nation in the
   world. There never was a people where the requirements of home
   education were so rigid and, in addition, a school was attached to the
   synagogue. Familiarity with the Scriptures in the Hebrew original was
   required from the earliest childhood, five years being the age named by
   the Jewish writers as that at which the child should begin to read, and
   the education was continued by regular gradations to the age of
   eighteen. John had not only passed through this course but had also
   been a disciple of John the Baptist and enjoyed the benefit of his
   preparation for the ministry of Christ. In addition to this, before he
   entered upon the work of the Twelve as the representatives of the will
   of Christ on the earth, he had sat for three years at the feet of Jesus
   and enjoyed the benefit of his constant teachings. Surely with these
   opportunities few men have enjoyed such educational opportunities as
   the author of the Fourth Gospel.

   It was while attending upon John as his disciple that he was pointed to
   Jesus by the Forerunner, and left him to become a disciple of our Lord.
   This incident occurred on the banks of the Jordan where John was
   baptizing, shortly after the Temptation. A little later he was enrolled
   as one of the Twelve, and becomes one of the Three who stood nearest of
   all to Christ, who beheld his transfiguration and the scene of the
   Garden of Gethsemane. He leaned on the bosom of Christ at the last
   Supper, followed him to the court of the high priest, alone of all the
   apostles stood near the cross at the crucifixion, and was entrusted by
   the dying Savior with the care of his mother. He was the first to
   recognize the Savior at the sea of Galilee, and seems to have had a
   rare faculty of spiritual perception, shown in the reception of the
   deepest sayings of the Lord.

   While quiet, contemplative and loving, he was not without traits of a
   different character. It is James and John who are styled by the Savior
   the Sons of Thunder, a name which seems to imply a fiery, energetic
   temper; it is James and John who wish to call down fire upon the
   Samaritan village which had refused to receive Jesus (Luke 9:54-56); it
   is John who forbade others who were doing a good work in the name of
   Christ, because they were not of the apostolic circle (Luke 9:49); it
   is Salome who asks, in behalf of her two sons, that they may be the
   prime ministers of Christ in the earthly kingdom that they expected him
   to establish; and it is John who in his epistles exhibits the most
   intense indignation over the wiles of opposers. Here every one who
   dishonors the Christian profession is a liar; one who hates his brother
   a murderer; one who sins wilfully a child of the devil, and those who
   deny the incarnation are Antichrist. Evidently John's was a strong,
   fiery nature, of intense feeling, but sweetened down by the love of
   Christ and guided by the Holy Spirit.

   From the era of the founding of the Church on Pentecost John stands
   along with Peter as one of the foremost characters. At a little later
   period Paul speaks of Peter and James and John "as seeming to be the
   pillars" (Gal. 2:9), and as apostles of the circumcision, while Paul
   and Barnabas represented the uncircumcision. With Peter he heals the
   cripple at the gate of the temple; he is arrested with Peter and
   threatened by the Sanhedrim, and with him he was sent to confirm the
   Christian converts at Samaria. While it is evident that he made his
   home in Jerusalem and Judea for twenty or thirty years after the
   establishment of the Church, he seems to have stood aloof from the
   Judaizing controversy that assumed such prominence during that period.
   Though not mentioned by name he is included in those said to be present
   at the conference on this question about A. D. 50 or 51, and Paul, in
   Gal. 2:9, referring to a visit to Jerusalem which is believed to have
   been at this time, says expressly that he saw him. At the fifth and
   last visit of Paul, made some eight or ten years later, he saw only
   James (Acts 21:18). All the apostles living had dispersed to other
   fields of labor.

   It seems probable from this that before the year 60 John had left
   Jerusalem. He must have made that city his home until the death of
   Mary, but from this time we have no scriptural testimony of his
   whereabouts until we behold him as an exile on the island of Patmos.

   The gap that remains between his disappearance from Jerusalem and his
   reappearance at Patmos can only be partly filled from the testimony of
   the early church. There can be no doubt but that he passed many years
   in Asia Minor with his headquarters at Ephesus, but it is almost
   certain that he did not remove there until after the death of Paul,
   placed by the best authorities in A. D. 68. According to Conybeare and
   Howson Paul wrote to Titus from Ephesus in A. D. 67, and in the same
   year wrote to Timothy at Ephesus. In neither epistle is the name of
   John mentioned, which is sufficient proof that he was not yet in that
   part of the world. Already the disturbances had begun which culminated
   three years later in the destruction of Jerusalem, and as after a few
   years John was at Ephesus, we are justified in concluding that on, or
   shortly before, the overthrow of the Jewish state, he left Judea, and
   finally was led by the need of apostolic influence in the flourishing
   churches of Asia Minor, after the death of their founder, to locate at
   Ephesus. This change could hardly have taken place until after the fall
   of Jerusalem.

   Concerning the length of the period John spent in this section of the
   world, or the details of his evangelical labors, we can do little more
   than conjecture. It is only in the dim twilight of the apostolic age
   that we again behold him certainly as the exile of Patmos. Of the
   following facts we may be sure: 1. That at some time during this period
   he wrote his Gospel, the Epistles ascribed to him, and Revelation. 2.
   That he was exiled for a season to Patmos and while there wrote the
   last named book. 3. That the Seven Churches of Asia, of which Ephesus
   was the center, were to him special objects of solicitude (Rev. 1:11),
   and if we accept the voice of antiquity he died and was buried at
   Ephesus in the reign of Trajan, and at that place his grave was pointed
   out for centuries.

   It is a pleasing picture that the early writers draw of the closing
   years of the last of the Apostles. He is described as the apostle of
   love, who in his extreme old age was carried on the arms of the
   disciples to the place of meeting, and repeated again and again the
   exhortation, "Little children, love one another." Various legends have
   come down, some of which may be true, but are not confirmed by
   satisfactory testimony.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Place and Date.

   We have found that the later years of John were passed in Asia Minor
   and principally at Ephesus. IrenÃ¦us, who had such excellent sources of
   information and who was himself educated in the same region by a
   disciple of John, declares that the Gospel was written at Ephesus; with
   him agree Jerome and later writers. IrenÃ¦us also states that it was the
   latest written of the Gospels, and this agrees with judgment of all
   commentators. It was therefore written after the departure of the
   Apostle to this portion of the world, and there can be little doubt
   that its place of composition was the great metropolis of this portion
   of the world, and for along period after the fall of Jerusalem, the
   chief center of Christianity. "After the destruction of Jerusalem
   Ephesus became the center of Christian life in the East. Even Antioch,
   the original source of missions to the Gentiles, and the future
   metropolis of the Christian patriarch, appears for a time less
   conspicuous in the obscurity of early church history than Ephesus, to
   which Paul inscribed his Epistle, and in which John found a dwelling
   place and a tomb. This half Greek, half Oriental city, visited by ships
   from all parts of the Mediterranean, and united by great roads with the
   markets of the interior, was the common meeting place of various
   characters and classes of men."--Conybeare and Howson.

   Of the date we can have no certain knowledge. There are internal
   evidences that would refer it to the last quarter of the first century.
   It has been held by some critics that it is the last composition of the
   New Testament, but I think it contains internal evidence that it was
   composed before Revelation, while the latter seems in its final words
   to close the sacred canon. In addition, the voice of the early church
   agrees that the Gospel had the earlier date. It was almost certainly
   composed between A. D. 75 and A. D. 90. A vague tradition that it was
   written during the exile to Patmos has no authority. Alford fixes the
   date between A. D. 70 and 85; Macdonald at A. D. 86 or 86; Godet
   between A. D. 80 and 90; Tholuck at not far from A. D. 100.
     __________________________________________________________________

Character of the Gospel.

   The last record made of the Life and Words of our Lord is contained in
   the Fourth Gospel. The only survivor of the band that had attended his
   footsteps, heard his words, beheld his life, and been a witness of his
   resurrection, was John. The consciousness that he was closing the
   record, giving the last witness, and paying the last tribute to the
   Master which would come from a personal witness, must have produced a
   profound impression upon John when he undertook the task of outlining
   the ministry of Christ. Apart from all promptings of the Spirit, which
   would bring, all things to remembrance, he would be moved by his love
   and reverence for the Savior to give the truest possible revelation of
   his heart, life and majesty.

   That this consciousness was ever present is manifest from the first to
   the last line of the Gospel. The last is the deepest, the highest, the
   most tender and loving, the most spiritual and the best of all the
   Gospels. Origen calls it "the crown of all the Gospels." Dr. Schaff
   pronounces it the most influential work of literature that was ever
   given to the world. There can be no doubt that John, with the exception
   of Paul, is the greatest human force that has appeared in Church
   history, and it may be regarded certain that no single book of the
   Bible has exerted as profound and far-reaching an influence as the
   Gospel of John. Nor is it difficult to account for this. He not only
   wrote after all the other apostles had passed from earth; after
   Jerusalem had fallen, the Jewish nation scattered, the church separated
   from the synagogue, the Jewish and Gentile Christians moulded into one,
   and the Jews regarded by even Jewish converts as an alien people, but
   he was a member of the apostolic band; one, too, of the sacred inner
   circle who were permitted to look into the very heart of Christ. Nay,
   more, of these three he was the "beloved apostle," the one who leaned
   on the bosom of the Lord, who spoke with him as a confidential friend,
   and who had charge of the mother of Christ after the tragedy of the
   cross. Surely there never was anyone else who enjoyed such precious
   advantages or who so nobly used them.

   The appreciative reader is struck with the difference between John and
   the other Evangelists as soon as he reads the first sentence. He is
   conscious that a loftier and sweeter key has been struck. He has
   entered the Holy of Holies of the New Testament. He is in the presence
   of the Divine. It is not the tender, helpless Babe of Bethlehem,
   hanging on the bosom of an earthly mother, that meets him at the
   threshold, but the Incarnate Word, the Word who was in the beginning
   with God and is God. Yet while the Lord first appears clothed with
   Divine majesty, and though no one else has so exalted his matchless
   glory, yet, on the other hand, no one else has so lifted the veil from
   the humanity of the Master, revealed his heart and the tenderness of
   his soul in the intimacy of his private life. It is John who takes us
   within the sacred circle and allows us to sit at the Master's feet and
   listen to his "table talk" with his own beloved disciples. While we
   have combined, such exalted revelations of the "One sent by the
   Father," on the one hand, and such near views of the loving Brother,
   upon the other, all is told in a plain, clear and natural way; simple
   as the story of a child and yet lofty as the flight of a seraph. If we
   search for the peculiarities that make it different from the other
   Gospels the following will be most apparent:

   I. It is the Gospel of the Incarnation. The emphasis is upon the grand
   truth that Christ is the Word made flesh, the One sent from the Father,
   the Bread of Life come down from heaven, the One who hath life in
   himself and is therefore the Life of men, the Vine from whence the
   branches draw their life, the Light that cometh into the world, the I
   AM, the Son of God. John expressly disclaims having recorded all the
   words and deeds of the Lord, and assures us that he had selected from
   almost infinite resources. He has omitted much that is recorded in the
   other Gospels; he has added five miracles that they omitted and a
   series of discourses to which they hardly alluded, but a study of his
   material will show that the leading thought has been its bearing upon
   the oneness of Christ with the Father. We search in vain for many
   things found in the other Evangelists that portray the human side of
   the Redeemer's nature. No genealogies are given, there is no mention of
   the birth at Bethlehem, or of the life at Nazareth; the childhood is
   passed over as well as the baptism of our Lord, and the Lord appears
   before the reader, in the very beginning, not only as the Son of man
   but as the Son of God. The Divine Word is traced, step by step, as he
   speaks and acts in human form, as he controls the elements of nature,
   creates food and drink for man, creates new organs in those without
   them from birth, unlocks the tomb and calls forth a friend from the
   embrace of death, as he speaks to friends and foes of his relations to
   the Father, as he suffers and is humiliated, and in the sublimest of
   all miracles, overthrows Death who claimed him as a victim. He is
   traced when he comes forth a conqueror because "he had life in
   himself," and after a continued manifestation to his disciples, ascends
   in order that the Comforter might come "to abide with them forever."
   Never for a moment does John lose sight of the truth that the Savior in
   the "brightness of the Father's glory and the express image of his
   person." Yet it must not be supposed that in this respect there is any
   contradiction between John and the other Gospels. While the Savior is
   regarded from different standpoints the pictures are in complete
   harmony. John shows us the mother and "his brethren," the Baptist as
   the "Voice in the wilderness" who bears witness of Christ; he reveals
   the Lord "groaning" and "troubled in spirit," as weeping at the grave
   of a friend, or weary at Jacob's well. He attests that with his own
   eyes he saw him wounded to death and die, and indeed he concedes all
   they narrate of the human life of our Lord. On the other hand, they
   affirm, if with less emphasis, the matchless majesty of the Son of God.
   He is conceived without sin, is the Lord of David (Matt. 22:43), claims
   power on earth to forgive sins, declares himself the judge of the world
   (Matt. 7:21 and 25:31-46), will come riding on the clouds of heaven,
   will come in his glory with his holy angels with him, will take his
   seat on the throne of glory to judge all nations, is seen on the Mount
   of Transfiguration shining with heavenly glory, declares after the
   resurrection that all power in heaven and earth is given into his
   hands, associates himself with the Father and the Holy Spirit in the
   baptismal formula, as the connecting link between the two and thus
   assumes a place on the very throne of the Deity. There is nothing in
   the Johannean conception of the Son that is higher. This statement with
   which Matthew closes shows in what sense he uses the term Immanuel,
   "God with us," in the very first chapter of his Gospel (1:23). Indeed,
   it is strange that any candid man should have held that the Christ of
   John is a different conception from the Christ of the three
   Evangelists. With all four he is the Son of man, but with all four he
   is the Son of God, not a son, but the Son of God, and it is because he
   made this claim before the Sanhedrim, according to these Gospels, that
   he was condemned to death. In the earlier Gospels the Son of David, the
   Son of Mary, is demonstrated to be the Son of God; in the last Gospel
   he is seen as the Godhead in bodily form, the Son of God who is the
   manifestation of the Father. In the first three the human is divine; in
   the Fourth the Divine is human.

   II. The Gospel of John is the Gospel of Love. It is true that the same
   doctrine is taught by the others. There the Savior declares that love
   is the very basis of eternal life; there is taught, perhaps the
   sweetest of all parables, that of the Good Samaritan. Yet there is an
   emphasis of love by John not found elsewhere. He it is who declares,
   "God is love," and of this he gives the highest possible proof in the
   fact that "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
   that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal
   life." Here it is that Christ is revealed as the "Good Shepherd who
   layeth down his life for his sheep;" here is also given the New
   Commandment, "Love one another, as I have loved you;" and here it is,
   also, the sin of unbelief in rejecting a Savior whose very being is
   love, is most fully described.

   III. It is the most Spiritual Gospel. Within about a hundred years of
   the time when it was written Clement of Alexandria declared that John
   wrote a Gospel of spiritual things, while the earlier Evangelists wrote
   Gospels of material things. By this he meant that they were more matter
   of fact, and did not enter into the deep questions, or take the deep
   spiritual views which are constantly exhibited in John. As the student
   of Scripture drinks more deeply into the word of God he will observe
   this more and more. Not only does John bring to the front the
   profoundest questions, but he beholds a significance in every act of
   Christ. Every miracle and act becomes a kind of parable. The water of
   the well of Jacob gives occasion to the precious utterances concerning
   the Living Water; the feeding of the Five Thousand brings out the
   discourses on the Bread of Life; the rejection of the healed blind man
   by his spiritual shepherds calls out the beautiful picture of the Good
   Shepherd; the fruit of the Vine on the table of the Last Supper
   occasions the delineation of the True Vine. Not only does John unfold a
   deep spiritual meaning, as just described, but he gives an emphasis to
   the Holy Spirit that is not found in the preceding Gospels. They are by
   no means silent; they speak of the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the sin
   against it, praying for it, baptism in the name of the Father, Son and
   Holy Spirit, and of the promise of the Father that the disciples shall
   be endued with its power in Jerusalem, but it is John who unfolds the
   great doctrine of the Comforter, outlines his work, and declares in
   explicit terms that he shall be a perpetual possession of the church.
   Nor can it be doubted that when he penned, "He shall guide you into all
   truth," "shall bring all things to your remembrance," that he was
   gratefully conscious of the Spirit's help in bringing the Savior's life
   and discourses vividly to memory, a half century after his ascension to
   the heavenly throne.

                             The Analysis of John.

   The plan of John is much more systematic, clear and simple than those
   of the other three Evangelists. It will be a help in a connected study
   of this part of Holy Scripture to have an analysis. I am indebted to
   Dr. Schaff for the outlines of the following plan, though I have
   modified and condensed the view he gives in his History of the
   Apostolic Church. I have marked by a star those sections which are not
   found in the other Gospels.

   follow.

   *The Appendix and Epilogue. 21:1-25.

   While the other Gospels allude to the appearance of the risen Lord in
   Galilee the incidents of this chapter are narrated only by John.

   (1) Christ appears to Seven Disciples on the shores of the Sea of
   Galilee. The third time he had revealed himself to his Apostles.
   21:1-14.

   (2) The Dialogue with Simon Peter. His Restoration. 21:15-22.

   (3) The intimation concerning John tarrying until he came. 21:21-23.

   (4) The attestation to the authorship of the Gospel. 21:24, 25.

   An examination of the stars prefixed to the sections peculiar to John
   will show how far his history is independent of the other Gospels. Up
   to the beginning of the eighteenth chapter only five incidents are
   named, I believe, which are narrated by the other writers. The accounts
   of the trial, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, and appearances, are
   more nearly parallel, but the last chapter is, again, entirely new
   matter. These facts serve to show how much of the Savior's words and
   life would have been lost to the world if the Fourth Gospel had never
   been written. They also demonstrate the infinite resources from whence
   the Gospel historians drew their accounts; resources so vast, that
   after three historians wrote the life of the Redeemer, a fourth was
   still able to write another history, in full harmony with what was
   already written, but composed almost entirely of new matter, not less
   important or interesting than what had already been narrated.

     __________________________________________________________________

Preliminary Note.

   The reader who opens the Gospel of John at once notices a marked
   difference between it and the three preceding gospels. They begin with
   the times of Jesus Christ upon the earth, while the fourth carries the
   reader back to the unknown period that lies before the dawn of
   Creation. The question will at once arise why John introduces his
   history of Christ with the profound exposition of the WORD which
   occupies the first eighteen verses of this chapter. It must always be
   kept in mind that he wrote many years later than the authors of the
   other Gospels, wrote far away from Judea among a people deeply imbued
   with the philosophical spirit of Grecian civilization. At Ephesus he
   was in a center of Grecian culture, and even the church would be more
   or less affected by the prevalent speculations of the philosophers. In
   the earlier part of the century there lived at Alexandria in Egypt, a
   great center of Grecian learning where the greatest library of the
   ancient world was gathered, a Jew named Philo, born about b.c. 20, who,
   writing in the Greek language, had indulged in, or rather had gathered
   from various sources, a system of profound speculation upon the nature
   and essence of the Divine Being. He held that the absolute Deity was
   incapable of coming in contact with, or influencing matter, or
   manifesting himself to other intelligences, but that he gave forth
   certain divine powers or influences, which surround God as the members
   of a court surround an earthly monarch. The highest of these he called
   the Logos, or Word, a term that not only indicates Reason, but is the
   expression of thought in language. He also held that God was pure and
   absolute Light. His philosophy would possess little interest for us
   were it not for the fact that it was developed into a system called
   Gnosticism which reached its climax in the second century, and was
   already, before the close of the first century, a troublesome heresy.
   It took the idea of Philo of an absolute Deity, and taught that there
   were various emanations from God, among which were Reason, the Word,
   Power, Light and Life, which were all a kind of lesser deities. Even
   Jehovah, the revealed God of the Jews, was one of these inferior
   deities, and Jesus Christ was another, but a higher manifestation.
   These theories had begun to disturb the church before the death of Paul
   who refers to them a number of times (Col. 2:18; 2 Tim. 2:16-18), and
   John at Ephesus would at once come in contact with their subtle
   influence.

   He therefore, in the very outset of his Gospel, shows that these
   speculations do not harmonize with the revelation of Jesus Christ. The
   first eighteen verses are the profoundest exposition of the unity of
   the God-head, and the absolute divinity of the Word manifested in the
   flesh, that was ever penned. The first section (verses 1-4) contains a
   description of the essence of the Divine Word. He was before time
   began, was in association with God and was God. He was also the
   uncreated source of all created things, was the Power of God; and was
   also the Light, and the fountain of existence, the Life of men. He is
   not only these things, but is shining in upon the darkness. This Word
   became flesh and dwelt among men in the person of Jesus Christ, who is,
   therefore, God, divine, the Power, the Light, the Life, the light and
   life of men. To him the prophets have borne witness, and most of all,
   John, who was not himself the Light, but came as a witness of the
   Light. These grand declarations, which cover the ground of the Gnostic
   heresy, and which show its errors, are kept in view in the whole
   Gospel. The Son of man is revealed as the Son of God, as Divine, the
   Light of the world, the Resurrection and the Life, the Bread and Water
   of Life, and as the manifestation of the Father, the whole reaching its
   climax in the declaration, "These things are written that you might
   believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."

   This Word (logos), which John introduces without explanation, is not
   used in the sense of Philo and the Gnostics, as representing Reason,
   nor is it ever used in that sense by the writers of the Bible. Nor is
   it an attribute of God, but an acting reality, personal, instead of an
   abstraction or personification, a Person who appeared upon the earth in
   human form. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Word of God, not
   because he speaks the word, nor because he is spoken of, nor because he
   is the author and source of the word as spoken in the Scriptures, but
   because the Word dwells in him, acts through him, and speaks from him.
   He is not only the Word, but the Light and Life, for similar reasons;
   the Light dwells in and shines from him, and the Life lives in and
   works from him. It is because he is the Light that he has filled the
   world with light; because he is the Life that the dead of the earth
   hear his voice, become new creatures, live a new life, and the world
   itself is regenerated. It is because he is the Word that he spake as
   never man spake, spoke in the morning of time, and at his voice order
   came out of the primeval chaos, spoke to the dead when he was upon the
   earth, and they rose from the tomb, and shall speak to those that are
   in their graves and they shall hear his voice and come forth in the
   resurrection. It was this Word which was pre-existent, before time,
   that was manifested in the fulness of time in the flesh to carry out
   the gracious ends of divine love.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Word Made Flesh.

   1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
   Word was God. This sublime preface of John carries us back to the
   account given in Genesis of the beginning of all things, when, "In the
   beginning God made the heavens and the earth." The passage declares
   that at that time, before creation, the Word existed, was with God and
   separate from him, but was God, or divine. What this Word is we learn
   from verse 14th, where it is stated that it became flesh and dwelt
   among men in the person of Christ. This deep disquisition upon the
   divine Word, almost too deep for human understanding, was penned by
   John on account of certain false philosophies which began to creep into
   and to trouble the church. Much has been written, very learnedly, upon
   those heresies and upon the Word and its relation to the Father, but I
   will pass by all speculation and confine myself to what is the manifest
   meaning of the Scripture. This passage then affirms: 1. That the person
   afterwards manifest as the Christ existed before creation began; 2.
   That he was present with God; 3. That he was divine; 4. That he was the
   Word; 5. That by or through him were all things made that were made
   (verse 3). The first chapter of Genesis helps us to understand its
   meaning. God said, "Let there be light," "Let there be a firmament,"
   "Let the earth bring forth," etc., and it was done. God exhibits his
   creative power through the Word, and also manifests his will through
   the Word. Every careful reader of the Old Testament is struck with the
   prominence given to the Word of the Lord, and also with the frequent
   reference in the Pentateuch to the Angel of Jehovah through whom the
   Lord manifests himself. When Jesus came he was "the brightness of the
   Father's glory, and the express image of his person," the manifestation
   of the Father, the "Word made flesh and dwelling among men." There are
   mysteries belonging to the divine nature and to the relation between
   the Son and the Father that we have to wait for eternity to solve. They
   are too deep for human solution, but this is clear: that God creates
   and speaks to man through the Word. As we clothe our thoughts in words,
   God reveals his will by the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ. (Joh 1:2)

   2. The same was in the beginning with God. John reiterates a part of
   his first statement, partly for emphasis, and partly to bring out the
   thought that there is a real distinction between the Word and the
   Father. He labors to make clear two thoughts, that the Word was divine,
   God, and yet had an individuality of its own. From the beginning, that
   unknown epoch, before creation began, he was with God. (Joh 1:3)

   3. And all things were made by him. Having affirmed the divine and
   uncreated nature of the Word, John next proceeds to tell of his
   relation to creation. All things, the world and all it contains, and
   the whole universe, were made by or through him. Paul declares (Heb.
   1:2), "Through him the worlds were made." The account of creation in
   Genesis helps us to understand. It was God who said, "Let there be
   light," and there was light. It was when the Word was employed that the
   sun, moon, and stars took their place in the sky. All things that were
   made were spoken into being, or made through the Word. The Word was not
   yet named Jesus Christ, for he had not yet been manifested as our
   Savior, nor is it certain that he was called the Son of God until he
   appeared upon earth as the Son of Man. (Joh 1:4)

   4. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. Here is a grand
   affirmation. He is a fountain of life from whence life flows like a
   river. From him life flowed in the beginning. Man can construct the
   statue, but he cannot breathe it into existence. The Word could create
   the form and endow it with life. And when the Word became flesh, he
   became a "fountain of living waters," a well springing up to eternal
   life. Because he had life in himself, the dead heard his voice and
   lived, and when he was slain the grave could not hold him, but he came
   forth and brought to light life and immortality. Hence the sublime
   utterance, "I am the resurrection and the life." "The life was the
   light of men." Man was created in the divine image. In him was fuller
   life than in the brute creation. Hence he is intelligent, capable of
   reasoning, of learning, of progress. His life is light, in the sense
   that it enlightens him. Then, in him can dwell the Word, which is the
   true light that enlightens the world. As the sun chases away darkness,
   so Jesus, the light of the mind and soul, chases away error, ignorance
   and superstition. The Life will overcome death and the Light will fill
   the redeemed world with his glory. (Joh 1:5)

   5. And the light shineth in darkness. Now the apostle comes more
   plainly to the thought that Christ is the light of the world. He is the
   light that shineth in the darkness, has shone in it as the Word, and
   who continues to shine. The sun shines in the heavens, but bats and
   owls that hate the light hide from his rays. So, too, Christ shines,
   but men who love darkness rather than light, can reject him and abide
   in darkness. The darkness comprehended it not. The sun shines upon the
   darkness and the darkness disappears, but when John wrote the true
   Light was shining in the earth and the people in darkness understood it
   not. Christ, the Light of the world, came to his own and his own
   received him not. They had eyes and saw not, hence were not
   enlightened. The difficulty was not that there was not light, but they
   loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. There
   is a sad tone running through this and the following verses to verse
   14. (Joh 1:6)

   6. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. Having declared
   the pre-existence of Christ, the apostle now begins the history of the
   Word being made flesh and dwelling among men as the Light of the World.
   He first presents the messenger who preceded him and who came to bear
   witness of the Light. He was a man "sent from God," predicted by Isaiah
   and Malachi, and by the angel that appeared to Zacharias. Notice that
   John the apostle calls the great forerunner simply John, instead of
   John the Baptist, as do the other writers, as if the Baptist was the
   only John entitled to distinction. (Joh 1:7)

   7. The same came for a witness to bear witness of the Light. John came,
   not so much as a reformer, as a witness. His work, as declared by
   Malachi, was to be a messenger to go before the Lord. In all his
   preaching he testified of Christ. When he preached repentance he
   declared the Kingdom was at hand. When he baptized he declared that
   there was one coming who would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire.
   He said, "I am not he that should come, but there cometh one whose
   shoes I am unworthy to loose." He pointed his disciples to Jesus and
   declared him the Lamb of God. That through him all men might believe.
   That John's preparation and testimony should cause men to believe upon
   the Light. The earliest disciples of Christ, including at least a part
   of the apostles, were men who had been prepared by John. John bore
   witness to Christ before he was manifested, The apostles bore witness
   after, for the same purpose, to cause men to believe. This too is the
   work of the church and of every preacher of the word. (Joh 1:8)

   8. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness. An early
   heretical sect held that John the Baptist was the Messiah. The apostle
   is explicit in order to correct this error. It is said by the Savior,
   of the Baptist (John 5:35), that he was a shining light. It is well to
   keep in mind that the term here translated light is different. It is a
   word that means original, self-shining light, like the sun; in 5:35 it
   is one that means a reflected light, like the moon. Christ shines by
   his own light; John shone by Christ's light. (Joh 1:9)

   9. That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into
   world. That was the real light who enlightens all men. Christ is the
   universal light. The Revision reads, "There was the true light, even
   the light which lighteth every man, coming into the world."
   Grammatically, both in the Greek and the English, coming may belong to
   the light, or every man. We believe that it should agree with light.
   That was the true or real light who, when he comes into the world,
   enlightens every man. Jesus says (John 12:46), "I am come a light into
   the world." Here John affirms that he came into the world to lighten
   every man. It should be kept in mind that the apostle is now about to
   treat of the personal coming into the world of the Light in the form of
   the Christ. As the Creator of natural things, as the Word that has been
   spoken to man from the beginning, and as God manifest in the flesh, he
   is the source of all the moral and spiritual light the world has ever
   known. (Joh 1:10)

   10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
   knew him not. John has just spoken of the personal coming of the Light
   of the world. Lest any one should forget that he was already in the
   world as the Word, he says that he was in the world and was its
   Creator, and had been in it from the beginning, though the world did
   not recognize him. There is a connection between this and the following
   verse. This declares that (1) he was in the world, (2) the world was
   made by him, (3) it did not recognize him. The next verse states (1)
   that he came, personally, to his own. He took upon himself a fleshly
   form and came to the race to which he was united by fleshly ties; (2)
   his own received him not. The world is humanity in general, which knew
   him not; his own is the Jewish nation, who received him not. (Joh 1:11)

   11. He came to his own, and his own received him not. It is stated
   above that he was in the world, from the beginning. Here it is stated
   that he came, to his own, when he came to Judea as the son of Mary,
   and, therefore, of the Jewish race. This passage is full of pathos and
   is an epitome of the Savior's earthly history. When the kingly babe
   came there was "no room" found even in the inn; a few days later he was
   carried to Egypt to save him from the murderous Herod; when he entered
   upon his ministry he was met by hatred, reviling and conspiracy; at
   last the Sanhedrim of the nation condemned him to death; and before
   Pontius Pilate, choosing a robber in his stead, they cried, "Away with
   him; crucify him!" His own people received him not. Even his townsmen
   of Nazareth sought to put him to death. (Joh 1:12)

   12. To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
   sons of God. The Revision reads, "Children of God," which is better.
   While the nation rejected him, some received him. To such as receive
   him in every age he gives power to become the children of God. The
   manner in which he is received is given; even to those who believe upon
   his name. It is not declared that they are made children by believing,
   but to the believer he gives the "power to become" a child. When one
   believes in Christ, his faith becomes a power to lead him to yield
   himself to God and to receive the Word into his heart. He can now
   repent of sin, surrender to the will of the Father, and then, "being
   baptized into Christ he puts on Christ," is his brother and a child of
   God by adoption, whereupon, "because he is a son, God sends his Spirit
   into his heart," enabling him to say: "Abba! Father." Wesley says, "The
   moment we believe we are sons." The Scriptures do not so teach, but
   that when we believe, Christ "gives us power to become children."
   Without "belief upon his name" the "power" to become a child is
   impossible. (Joh 1:13)

   13. Who were born, not of blood, nor by the will of the flesh. The Jews
   prided themselves on being Abraham's children, and trusted in their
   blood for salvation. John declares that blood, or race, has nothing to
   do with becoming the children of God; nor has this new birth which
   makes one a child of God aught to do with natural generation (the will
   of the flesh), nor earthly adoption (the will of the man). It is not a
   fleshly birth at all, but the spirit of the subject is born of God. In
   John 3:1-8 the Savior explains this birth more particularly. Faith,
   repentance and obedience prepare us for the gift of the Spirit, and we
   are thus made new creatures in Christ Jesus. (Joh 1:14)

   14. And the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. The Word assumed a
   human form and became incarnate as the child of Mary. It did not merely
   manifest itself, but dwelt among us for about thirty-three years. There
   was already a heretical sect, the Gnostics referred to in 2 John 7, who
   denied that Christ had come in the flesh. The apostle here makes this
   positive statement to meet this heresy. And we beheld his glory. Peter,
   James and John not only beheld the sinless and godlike life of Christ,
   but they saw the glory of the Mount of Transfiguration, "the glory as
   of the only begotten of the Father." Full of grace and truth. The Word
   incarnate, Christ, was full of grace and truth; his mission was one of
   grace or favor to men, and he was the Truth, as well as the Way and the
   Life. (Joh 1:15)

   15. John testified of him. Verse 7 declares that John came to testify
   of Christ and here the substance of his testimony is given. When he saw
   Jesus he cried, "This is he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is
   preferred before me because he was before me." (Joh 1:16)

   16. Out of his fulness have we all received. It is John, the apostle,
   who speaks. The thought refers to the two preceding verses. John had
   seen the glory of Christ, who was "full" of grace and truth, and the
   Baptist declares that Christ existed before he came into the world, and
   then John declares, "We have all received of his fulness, and favor
   upon favor." (Joh 1:17)

   17. The law was given by Moses. It was not a system of grace, nor could
   it make men perfect; in contrast with it the system of grace and truth
   (see verse 14) were given by Jesus Christ. (Joh 1:18)

   18. No man hath seen God, with bodily eyes, but he was manifested as
   the Word and at last the "only begotten Son hath declared him." "He
   that hath seen me," said Christ, "hath seen the Father. The Father is
   in me and I in him." Christ came in human form, in order to reveal the
   Father to a race who knew him not.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. What wonderful condescension that so glorious a being as the Word
   should take upon himself our nature, dwell among men, suffer and die
   for us! "This is the love of God that he hath sent the Son into the
   world, not to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be
   saved."

   2. How can any one treat lightly the Word of the Lord when he learns
   that "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
   Word was God?" It is said that the Jews refused even to throw upon the
   earth slips that had printed or written upon them passages of
   Scripture. We have infinitely more reason for reverencing the Word than
   the Jews. Every passage of the inspired testimony has come to us
   through the medium of him who is the Word.

   3. Christ is the light of the World. Take a map and delineate those
   countries which are most enlightened in bright colors, then shade
   others more and more as you approach barbarism and ignorance. Then make
   another map in which the countries that most truly receive the Bible
   and Christ are represented in bright colors, shade those lands that
   have a corrupted Christianity, shading according to the degree of
   corruption, and put those in darkest colors where nothing is known of
   Christ. Then compare the two maps. It will be found that there are not
   two maps, but two copies of one map.

   4. The Word made flesh. God, the uncreated, the incomprehensible, the
   invisible, attracted few worshipers; a philosopher might admire so
   noble a conception, but the crowd turned away in disgust from words
   that presented no image to their minds. It was before Deity, embodied
   in human form, working among men, partaking of their infirmities,
   leaning on their bosoms, weeping over their graves, bleeding on the
   cross, that the prejudices of the synagogue, and the doubts of the
   academy, and the pride of the portico, and the fasces of the lictors,
   and the swords of thirty legions, were humbled in the dust.--Macaulay.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Witness of John.

   19. And this is the record of John. The history now begins its sweep
   onward. All before is prefatory. The historian passes by the incidents
   connected with the birth of John and of Jesus, the early history, and
   even the account of John's preaching and the baptism of Christ, given
   in the other Gospels. He wrote at a much later period and these facts
   are supposed to be well known. The witness here noted was given after
   the baptism and probably while Christ was in the wilderness at the time
   of the temptation. When the Jews sent priests and Levites. John uses
   the term "Jews" as though he was not of that race. He was now an old
   man and for many years had transferred his allegiance to another nation
   (1 Peter 2:9), and for a long time had been dwelling in Asia Minor,
   among Gentile Christians. That his Jewish feelings had gradually passed
   away is often shown in his language. Usually "the Jews" means the
   ruling classes of Judea. In this case it refers to the SANHEDRIM. As
   this court fills a conspicuous place in the New Testament history it
   will help the student to have a clear understanding of its nature. The
   Jewish writers claim that it originated with the seventy elders whom
   Moses (Num. 11:16, 17) was directed to associate with himself in the
   government of Israel, who, with himself, would make a court of
   seventy-one persons. Hence it was composed of seventy-one members.
   There is, however, no positive proof of its existence during the period
   of the Jewish kings, and it only appears in unmistakable form during
   the later days of the Hebrew commonwealth. Its very name, Sanhedrim, or
   more correctly, Sanhedrin, is Greek, and this fact points to a period
   after the Macedonian conquest of the East, when it assumed shape.
   According to the Jews themselves (Jerusalem Gemara), forty years before
   the destruction of Jerusalem the right to inflict capital punishment
   was taken away from it, which agrees with the answer of the Jews to
   Pilate (John 19:31). It was a supreme court to which belonged the trial
   of a tribe fallen into idolatry, false prophets, and accused priests.
   As an administrative council its jurisdiction was still more extensive.
   Jesus was arraigned before this body as a false prophet (John 11:47)
   and condemned as a blasphemer (Matt. 26:65). Peter, John, Stephen and
   Paul were arraigned by it as false teachers and deceivers of the
   people. It was entirely in harmony with its prerogatives that it should
   send an official deputation to ascertain the character of John. He had
   produced a profound sensation and stirred the whole land, and it was
   the duty of the Sanhedrim, from its standpoint, to examine into his
   claims. There is nothing in the language to show whether this
   deputation was hostile or friendly, and it is probable that it was
   neither, but only one of inquiry. Its members were all of the
   sacerdotal tribe. (Joh 1:20)

   20. I am not the Christ. The idea had already begun to receive currency
   that John might be the expected Christ. In his preaching recorded by
   Matthew he denied this with great emphasis and explained his relation
   to the Coming One. Here he is equally emphatic. The stress which the
   apostle here lays on this denial shows that he had in mind that later
   class of the disciples of John, who in the latter half of the first
   century, asserted that he was the Christ. (Joh 1:21)

   21. They asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? Malachi (4:5) had
   declared that Elias would precede the Messiah. Hence when John denied
   that he was the Christ, the next question was whether he was Elias. He
   said that he was not; he was not the literal Elias whom they expected;
   nor is it certain that God had revealed to John that he was the
   spiritual Elias. He was greater than he himself knew. He was, in many
   respects, in mission, manner of life, fearlessness and ruggedness, an
   Elias, and was the Elias foretold by the prophet (Matt. 17:12), though
   Elias did literally come on the mount of transfiguration. Art thou that
   prophet? They ask still another question. Moses had predicted a prophet
   like himself (Deut. 18:15), but John denies that he is the fulfillment.
   It was later (Acts 3:22; 7:37) when the apostles understood that Jesus
   was he of whom Moses did speak. (Joh 1:22)

   22. Who art thou? The conjectures are exhausted and they demand an
   explicit answer, that they may carry the information to "them that sent
   them," or to the Sanhedrim. (Joh 1:23)

   23. I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. John answers this
   question by quoting Isaiah 40:3, where the prophet describes his
   mission. The passage is applied to John, Matt. 3:3; Mark 1:2, and Luke
   3:4. He sinks his own personality, and is simply the "voice of one
   crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord." His work
   was that of preparation for the Lord. (Joh 1:24)

   24. Of the Pharisees. The messengers were not only of the religious
   tribe, but of the strictest of Jewish sects. The Pharisees were far
   more attentive to external rites than any other class, and as the next
   question is concerning such a rite, the fact that they were Pharisees
   is noted. (Joh 1:25)

   25. Why baptizest thou then? This question shows that John's baptism
   was, to them, a new rite. They could understand that Christ, or Elias,
   or "that prophet" might establish a new ordinance by the divine
   authority, but if John is none of these, why does he do so? Their
   perplexity shows that, in some way, the baptismal rite was new to them.
   It is claimed that Gentile proselytes to the Jewish faith were baptized
   (immersed according to all the Jewish authorities) before this time,
   but the only proof offered is the testimony of the Talmud, written two
   or three centuries later. Even if proselyte baptism had been
   instituted, John's rite presented the new feature of baptizing Jews,
   those who considered themselves God's people. In that it called the
   chosen people to baptism it was a new rite. (Joh 1:26)

   26. I baptize with water. The correct rendering is in water, and the
   preposition en is thus rendered by the American Committee of the
   Revisers, as well as by Canon Westcott of the Church of England and the
   most judicious scholars. Even in the Common Version, out of 2,660 times
   that en occurs in the Greek of the New Testament, it is rendered by
   "in" 2,060 times. There is no good reason why it should not be so
   rendered every time it occurs in connection with baptism. The
   translators of the Catholic Bible in English, the Douay Version, were
   more honest than King James' revisers, and have always so rendered it.
   John does not answer the question of the Pharisees directly, but points
   to one already standing among them. The baptism of water connects
   itself with that pre-eminent being. Standeth among you. This points out
   that the Christ was already on the earth, in Judea, though unknown and
   unrecognized by the people. (Joh 1:27)

   27. Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. The latchet was
   the thong by which the sandal was bound on the foot. To loose or fasten
   it was the work of a menial. The dignity of Christ was so exalted, that
   John counted himself unworthy even to attend to this office. (Joh 1:28)

   28. These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was
   baptizing. The Revision substitutes Bethany for Bethabara. Both terms
   are found in the manuscripts, but Bethany has the better authority. The
   Bethany named was not the one near Jerusalem, but a village, whose site
   is not now known, on the east bank of the Jordan. Bethany is said to
   mean "the house of the boat," and Bethabara "the house of the ford,"
   both alike pointing to a ferry or ford of the Jordan. We have three
   allusions to the localities of John's baptismal rite, all showing that
   abundance of water was an essential; Matt. 3:5, 6 and 13; John 3:23,
   and the present passage.

   The sending of this deputation is a proof of the great stir caused
   throughout Judea by the teaching of John. That he exerted a profound
   influence upon the nation and was accounted a prophet are evident from
   Jewish writers. Josephus, a Jewish priest and general, a contemporary
   of John and Christ, says (Antiquities, book 18, chap. 5): "Now some of
   the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army came from God,
   and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, that
   was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man, and one
   who commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness
   toward one another, and piety toward God, and so to come to him for
   baptism; for that the washing with water would be acceptable to him, if
   they made use of it, not in order to the putting away (or the
   remission) of some sins (only), but for the purification of the body:
   supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by
   righteousness. Now when (many) others came into crowds about him, for
   they were greatly moved by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest
   the great influence which John had over the people might put it into
   his power and inclination to raise a rebellion (for they seemed ready
   to do anything he might advise), thought it best, by putting him to
   death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not to bring himself
   into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him to repent of it
   when it should be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of
   Herod's suspicious temper, to MachÃ¦rus, the castle I have before
   mentioned, and put to death there."
     __________________________________________________________________

Christ's Ministry Begins.

   At this point Jesus breaks suddenly in upon the narrative. The Fourth
   Gospel passes by all the details contained in the other three
   concerning the early life of the Savior; the miraculous conception, the
   birth at Bethlehem, the flight to Egypt, the return to Nazareth, the
   visit to the temple when Jesus was twelve years old, and even his
   baptism a short time before in the Jordan. This is referred to, and a
   familiarity with it implied, but its history is not given. In these
   facts we have additional evidence that John wrote many years after the
   other evangelists and supposed his readers to be acquainted with the
   facts that they narrated.

   Jesus was at this time thirty years old, had lived a singularly
   blameless life with his home at Nazareth, where he had worked at the
   trade of Joseph, and hence is spoken of as "the carpenter" and "the
   carpenter's son." He had never attended the great schools of the Jewish
   law in which all the Rabbins obtained their education, but went from
   the carpenter's bench to John's baptism, was anointed with the Holy
   Spirit, retired to the desert for forty days of lonely preparation, and
   then reappears at this point, to begin his ministry. (Joh 1:29)

   29. The next day John seeth Jesus. The next day after the visit of the
   deputation of the Sanhedrim. It was not the first visit of Jesus to
   John. About forty days before he had presented himself and demanded
   baptism. He doubtless knew Jesus personally before this, for he
   testifies to the blameless purity of his life, but it had not then been
   revealed to him that Jesus was the Christ; only that the One upon whom
   he should see the Spirit descending was the King of whom he bore
   witness. After this baptism Jesus had retired to the wilderness to meet
   the tempter alone. It is at the period of his return that John points
   him out as the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. The
   lamb was a very familiar object of sacrifice to the Jews. It was slain
   by every Jewish family at the passover, was commonly used for a sin
   offering (Lev. 4:32); in the cleansing of the leper (Lev. 14:10); at
   both the morning and the evening sacrifice (Exod. 29:38); at all the
   great feasts, and on special occasions. When John pointed out Jesus,
   not as a, but the Lamb of God, it can only mean that God had provided
   him as a sacrificial offering. Every lamb offered on Jewish altars
   pointed to him; Isaiah, in chapter LIII, points out that he was "lead
   as a lamb to the slaughter." In Revelation he is declared to be the
   Lamb, "as it were slain." There is no escape from the idea that Jesus
   became a sacrificial offering for the world. This is entirely in
   harmony with the class of passages which affirm that "his blood
   cleanseth from all sin." We may not be able to fathom all the mysteries
   of the atonement, but it is the part of faith to accept and trust
   fully, what is so clearly taught. It will be seen, also, that John, by
   inspiration, is enabled to grasp the magnitude of the Savior's work. He
   is to take away the sin, not of Jews only, but of the world.

   The reader should not fail to note, at the beginning of the Savior's
   ministry, that the idea that he is more than a Jewish deliverer comes
   into prominence. He is the Lamb of God who taketh away sin, not the sin
   of Israel only, but the sin of the world. John, by inspiration, is
   enabled to rise above the idea of a Jewish Messiah, the sphere of whose
   blessings would be confined to the narrow limits of the race of
   Abraham, and at once points his followers to Jesus as the Messiah of
   man, the Redeemer of the world who taketh away the sin thereof. Here,
   at the outset, is a divergence from the Messianic ideas of the Jews,
   and the germ of that disappointment of their hopes by seeing in Jesus
   the founder of a universal spiritual kingdom, rather than a worldly
   national empire, which led to their rejection of the Christ. (Joh 1:30)

   30. This is he of whom I said. In verse 27 the words he refers to are
   given. The One who will come after him in point of time, precedes him
   in eminence, for he was before him in existence. John might be first
   known on earth and older by human birth, but Christ had existed from
   eternity. (Joh 1:31)

   31. I knew him not. Knew not whom God had chosen as the Christ. He knew
   Jesus personally, but did not know he was the Christ until God pointed
   him out. Therefore am I come baptizing with (in) water. His whole
   mission of preaching and baptizing was to prepare for and reveal the
   Christ. In his baptizing the Christ became manifest in the way stated
   in the following verses. (Joh 1:32)

   32. John bare record. Gave witness to the fact, either at this or some
   subsequent time. I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove.
   See Matt. 3:16. At this time, as Jesus came up out of the water, the
   Spirit was seen descending in the form of a dove, and the voice of God
   was heard declaring, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased." Thus Jesus was anointed with the Spirit, and was
   thenceforward the Christ, the Anointed. It is significant that this
   took place at the time of baptism. Why should any Christian disparage a
   rite the Lord has so honored? (Joh 1:33)

   33. And I knew him not. Knew not who was the Messiah. The Lord had
   however, given him a sign by which he could recognize him. Upon
   whomsoever the Spirit visibly descended and abode, the same would
   baptize in the Holy Spirit. The only one baptizing in the Holy Spirit
   is the Christ. The Spirit in its fulness abode with him, and hence he
   was able to impart its fulness in the baptism of the spirits of his
   disciples. Christ did not baptize in the Holy Spirit until after he had
   ascended, the first instance being recorded in Acts 2:1-4. (Joh 1:34)

   34. And I saw and bare record that this is the Son of God. While the
   apostle does not give the history of the Savior's baptism, his
   allusions to it are very full and can only be understood by comparing
   them with the accounts given in the other Gospels. John "saw" all that
   is recorded by Matthew (3:13-17) and heard the Divine voice. Hence he
   "bare record that this is the Son of God." This language was spoken the
   "next day" after the deputation of the Sanhedrim had waited upon him,
   and that event is thus located after the baptism and temptation of
   Christ. The order of events, in the gospel history, up to this date, is
   about as follows: 1. The Annunciation to Mary; 2. The Birth of John the
   Baptist; 3. The Birth of Jesus; 4. Jesus in the Temple with the
   Doctors; 5. The Preaching of John; 6. The Baptism of Jesus; 7. The
   Temptation in the Wilderness; 8. The Deputation of the Sanhedrim to
   John; 9. The Return of Jesus to John.
     __________________________________________________________________

The First Disciples.

   35. Again the the next day after, Jesus stood, and two of his
   disciples. In verses 19-28, the account is given of the visit of the
   priests and Levites, sent by the Sanhedrim to John. "The next day"
   after this John sees Jesus and points him out as the Lamb of God,
   giving a discourse of which, in verses 29-34, we have a synopsis. On
   the "next day" after this, the third day after the deputation of the
   Sanhedrim, and the second after the return of Jesus from the
   wilderness, John stood with two of his disciples. One of these two, we
   learn from verse 40, was Andrew; the other, we have reason to believe,
   was John, the apostle. The statement that they were John's disciples,
   shows that they had accepted his message and been baptized by him. All
   the earlier disciples of Christ had been prepared for him by the
   Forerunner. At first glance it might seem as if John was merely
   repeating the testimony that he had given in verse 29, but there the
   testimony is general; it is not stated to whom it was spoken; here it
   is specific, and spoken to two disciples who were afterwards, almost
   certainly, apostles of Jesus. (Joh 1:36)

   36. Behold the Lamb of God! On the preceding day John had recognized
   Jesus in a public discourse as "the Lamb of God that taketh away the
   sins of the world." Now he personally points the disciples to him. The
   lamb, throughout Old Testament times, was commonly used as a
   sin-offering (Lev. 4:32), at the morning and evening sacrifice (Ex.
   12:21-27), at the great feasts (Num. 28:11), and on special occasions
   (1 Chron. 29:21). The paschal lamb was offered by every family in
   Israel at every passover. In pointing out Jesus as the Lamb of God,
   John declares that he is the great sin-offering of which all the lambs
   slain on Jewish altars were the types. "He taketh away the sins of the
   world;" he is the great sin-bearer, not for a single generation, but
   for all time; not for a single family or race, but for the world. These
   words teach a sacrifice and an atonement, but were not understood by
   John himself, as we learn by turning to Matt. 11:2-6. "Under the Old
   Testament were provided by the sinner, lambs, whose sacrifice took sins
   away from the individual or the nation, but for the time only, and
   therefore the sacrifice had to be continually repeated; under the New
   Testament one Lamb is provided, the Lamb of God, whose sacrifice takes
   away the sin of the whole world, and therefore needs never to be
   repeated."--Abbott. (Joh 1:37)

   37. And they followed Jesus. As John intended, the two disciples at
   once left him and followed the footsteps of Jesus. They did not become
   followers in the religious sense, but literally followed him, possibly
   from curiosity, possibly from a yearning desire to know more of the
   Lamb of God. (Joh 1:38)

   38. Jesus turned . . . and saith, What seek ye? Jesus does not ask this
   in order that he may know their object, but to open a conversation and
   to draw them out. Such was his custom; for example, see the
   conversation with the woman at Sychar (Chap. 4:10-16). The Christian
   teacher may find a valuable hint in the example of the Master. His
   teaching was almost all by conversation and his methods are
   incomparable. Rabbi. A term of very ancient origin, signifying teacher,
   or master. Ahasuerus set a Rab, or master, over the tables of his feast
   (Esther 1:8). Among the Jews there are three degrees--Rabban, Rab, and
   Rabbi--the last being the lowest. It is by the highest that Mary
   addresses the Lord at the tomb after his resurrection. Where dwellest
   thou? The disciples dared not probably, from their timidity, to express
   fully their motives in following Jesus, but asked for his temporary
   abiding place and where he might be found. This question, which some
   might have regarded impertinent curiosity to be met by a rebuff, was
   met by a kind invitation that attached the disciples to Jesus for life.
   Here again we should note the effect of gentleness and hospitality.
   Note, too, that Jesus is not sought in vain. "They that seek shall
   find." (Joh 1:39)

   39. They abode with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. The
   Jew commenced the hours with 6 A. M. and hence the tenth hour would be
   4 P. M. As it was near the close of the day the disciples remained over
   night. The conversation of that evening is unrecorded, but the
   impression that it made upon the minds of the two guests is seen in
   their conduct the next day. All doubts had passed away and they were
   ready to seek their friends with the joyful message: We have found the
   Messiah. (Joh 1:40)

   40. One of the two . . . was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. Andrew and
   his brother Simon were sons of Jonas, of the town of Bethsaida in
   Galilee, and were fishermen by trade. The description of Andrew as
   Peter's brother shows the importance assigned by John to the apostle
   who was to open the doors of the kingdom. Andrew was afterwards one of
   the Twelve. The other "one of the two" is supposed to be John, the
   apostle, for the reason that he never mentions his own name, but
   invariably those of other disciples. (Joh 1:41)

   41. He first findeth his own brother Simon. Andrew sought and found
   Simon, before he sought anyone else. This is the true spirit. Unless
   one is ready to tell the joyful story to his own relatives and
   neighbors, we have a poor opinion of his zeal for the conversion of the
   Zulus or Congo negroes. Christ and the apostles began their work at
   home and extended it in an ever widening circle. We have found the
   Messias. The Anointed, the Hebrew term which corresponds to the word
   Christ. It was with the utmost joy that Andrew told this joyful story.
   It was the fruition of the long delayed hope of Israel. Andrew's
   exclamation of delight on finding the Messiah is the same attributed to
   Archimedes when he made his discovery of the amount of adulteration in
   Hiero's crown. The, cry of each was Eureka, "I have found." The
   grandest discovery ever made, greater than that of a continent, was the
   finding of Christ, the hope of the world. (Joh 1:42)

   42. Thou art Simon . . . thou shalt be called Cephas. There was no
   hesitation on the part of Peter to go at once to see him of whom Andrew
   spoke. He, also, as one of John's disciples, was waiting for the King.
   To his name Simon, Christ added another by which afterwards he was
   known. Cephas is Hebrew, and means a stone; Peter means the same in
   Greek; not rock, as some have urged. The word for that in the Greek is
   petra, while the word anglicised as Peter is petros. In Matt. 16:18,
   Christ says, in response to Peter's confession, "Thou art Petros (a
   stone), and upon this petra (a solid rock) I will build my church." The
   Rock was the "Stone cut out without hands." Peter was a fragment of
   rock built upon the Stone by the great confession. Christ is the Rock;
   Peter was a rockman. (Joh 1:43) (Joh 1:44)

   43. The day following. The next day after Andrew brought Peter to
   Jesus. According to Meyer, the order of this interesting week is as
   follows: First day, John's conference with the priests and Levites
   (verses 19-28); second day, John's testimony of Jesus (29-34); third
   day, the two disciples pointed to Jesus (35-39); fourth day, Peter
   brought to Jesus (40-42); fifth day, Nathanael brought to Jesus
   (43-51); seventh day, (one day intervening,) the marriage at Cana,
   (chap. 2). Findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. This is the
   first recorded instance of the Savior calling a disciple to follow him.
   Philip, it must be borne in mind, is not Philip, "one of the seven,"
   but "one of the Twelve," a citizen of Bethsaida, of Galilee, and a
   fellow-townsman of Andrew and Peter. (Joh 1:45)

   45. Philip findeth Nathanael. As we learn from John 21:2, Nathanael,
   like Peter and Andrew, James and John, and Philip, was a Galilean, his
   home being at "Cana of Galilee." His name only occurs in these two
   places. He is supposed to have been one of the Twelve, the same one
   mentioned in the other Gospels as Bartholomew, which is a patronymic,
   meaning son of Tolmai. The use of the name in John 21:2 favors this
   hypothesis. We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the
   prophets, did write. There was only one to whom this could refer, "The
   prophet like unto Moses," the Messiah; and when Philip names Jesus of
   Nazareth, Nathanael is at once skeptical whether the Messiah could come
   out of Nazareth. Note, 1. That although Cana was not far from Nazareth,
   so quiet had been the life of Jesus, thus far, Nathanael does not seem
   to have heard of him; 2. As soon as Philip becomes a disciple he at
   once begins to seek others, an excellent example for all young
   Christians. For references in the books of Moses to the Messiah, see
   Gen. 3:15; 17:7; and Deut. 18:15-19. (Joh 1:46)

   46. Nathanael said . . . can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?
   The Jews of Jerusalem despised Galilee and scornfully rejected the
   Galilean teacher, while the rest of Galilee seems to have despised
   Nazareth. From the manner in which the mob thrust Jesus out of the
   synagogue and tried to kill him, its population could not have been of
   high moral type. The Jews were wont to associate all moral and
   religious good with Jerusalem, and could hardly conceive that the King
   would come from elsewhere than the capital of David. Come and see. That
   is the best answer to the skeptic. Bring him to Christ, let him
   consider him, and what he has done for mankind. The strongest proof
   that Jesus is the Christ is Jesus himself. The unbelieving John Stuart
   Mill said that no one could find a better rule of virtue than "to
   endeavor to live so that Christ would approve his life." Renan
   pronounces him "the greatest and purest of the sons of men." (Joh 1:47)

   47. Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! The Savior salutes
   Nathanael with a tribute to his honest, guileless character. He was a
   true Israelite, without hypocrisy, worshiping God with sincere soul,
   according to the light he had received. (Joh 1:48)

   48. Whence knowest thou me? Nathanael, who had never met Jesus before,
   was surprised to hear himself spoken of as one known. When thou wast
   under the fig tree. There was Something about this answer that filled
   Nathanael with astonishment. Under the shade and shelter of the fig
   tree he had had some rare experience that is not recorded, and that he
   supposed unknown to man. That Jesus knew of it and read his soul
   startled him and dissipated his unbelief. (Joh 1:49)

   49. Thou art the Son of God; the King of Israel. Philip had said,
   "Jesus, the Son of Joseph," as he supposed, but Nathanael, convinced,
   declared him the Son of God. This is the first confession of the
   divinity of Jesus, and is the spirit, rather than the letter of Old
   Testament prophecy of the Messiah. Nathanael, devout, a devoted student
   of prophecy, living in the great hope, rises to the heights of the
   Messianic prophecies. (Joh 1:50)

   50. Thou shalt see greater things than these. Nathanael, as a follower
   of Christ, did see greater things than the revelation of hidden
   knowledge that convinced him. So, too, if all believers faithfully use
   their present opportunities they shall have greater. There is a growth
   in grace and knowledge. (Joh 1:51)

   51. Ye shall see the heavens open, and the angels of God ascending.
   Jacob, old Israel, in his dream at Bethel, saw the ladder that reached
   to heaven with the angels upon it (Gen. 28:12). Christ is that ladder,
   the way from earth to heaven, the way heaven sends messages to the
   world and the way we must go to reach it. Nathanael would be permitted
   to see that Jesus was the Mediator, that through him the Father speaks
   to man; that through him there is intercommunication between earth and
   heaven. Nathanael sees heaven open, not opened. It still stands open,
   and has been since the vail of the temple was rent.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. Jesus is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. He
   who refuses the sacrifice of the Lamb hath none other. There is "none
   other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved."

   2. The best reply to the honest doubter is to bid him, "Come and see."
   If he is a quibbler, it is vain to talk with him. If he is an honest
   skeptic, do not seek to argue, but get him to look at and study Christ.
   "I know men," said Napoleon Bonaparte on St. Helena, "and I tell you
   that Jesus Christ is not a man."

   3. The examples in the lesson are well worthy of imitation. 1. As soon
   as Andrew found the Messiah, he at once sought his brother to bring him
   to Christ. Let every Christian, young or old, seek to bring the members
   of his own family to the Savior. 2. As soon as Philip was called, he
   sought, at once, for Nathanael and induced him to go and meet the
   Savior. Every Christian should labor to bring all his friends to the
   Redeemer.

   4. God's ways are not man's ways. When he called a leader to deliver
   Israel from bondage, he chose a shepherd of Midian; when he chose the
   founder of the line of Jewish kings, he took a shepherd boy of
   Bethlehem; when the "Word became flesh," it dwelt in the person of
   Jesus in the despised town of Nazareth, while the Jews all expected
   that the Messiah would appear in Jerusalem of the princes or great men
   of Israel. Still he chooses the weak and humble to confound the mighty;
   "the things that are not to confound the things that are."
     __________________________________________________________________

Note on "the Son of Man."

   In verse 51 occurs for the first time in the Gospel of John the phrase
   "the Son of man." This remarkable designation is the one the Lord
   usually applies to himself. It occurs thirty times in the Gospel
   according to Matthew, thirteen times in Mark, twenty-five times in
   Luke, and twelve times in John. In the Gospels it is never used by the
   historians or disciples as a designation of Christ, and is used only by
   the Lord in speaking of himself. Hence, it only occurs once beyond the
   range of the Gospels, in Acts 7:56, and the Lord never uses it after
   his resurrection. It will be found that the passages in which the Lord
   uses the phrase may be grouped into two classes: 1. Those which refer
   to the earthly work of the Lord during the period of his humiliation,
   and 2. Those which refer to his future coming in glory. It is used in
   the present instance in the latter sense. Another striking example of
   this use is found in Matt. 25:31, "When the Son of man shall come in
   his glory, and all his holy angels with him" to take his seat on the
   throne of judgment. Such passages show that the Son of man is a divine
   being who shall sit surrounded by angels upon the throne of eternal
   judgment. The phrase is not an equivalent to the word "Messiah," or
   Christ, but one that expresses the universal humanity of our Divine
   Lord. He describes himself, not as the Son of Mary, nor as the Son of
   Abraham, but as the Son of man. He appeared upon earth, not as the
   kindred of the family of Nazareth, or of the Jewish nation, but as the
   kindred of humanity. He is the brother of the Greek, the Roman, the
   Gaul, the American, the African, as well as of the Jew. Nor did he ever
   call himself a Jew, but in all his relations with the Jewish nation he
   held himself as one not of their race. He always spoke to them, not of
   our but of your law. And it is as the brother of our race that the Son
   of man shall judge the world.

                                  Chapter II.
     __________________________________________________________________

The First Miracle.

   "On the third day" after the events narrated in the closing portion of
   the last chapter there occurred the first exercise of miraculous power
   on the part of the Savior. The scene was Cana of Galilee, the northern
   district of Palestine, to which he had returned immediately after the
   witness of John (Chap. 1:43). (Joh 2:1)

   1. And the third day there was a marriage. It is well known that the
   marriage ceremonies of the Jews began at twilight. It was the custom in
   Palestine

     "To bear away The bride from home at blushing shut of day,"

   2. Both Jesus and his disciples were invited. He now had disciples,
   those called in the few days before, John, Andrew, Peter, Philip and
   Nathanael. As the invitation of Jesus is named apart from that of Mary
   it was probably sent after he and his disciples had returned to
   Galilee. (Joh 2:3)

   3. And when they wanted wine. The Revision says, "When the wine
   failed." From some cause, perhaps from a larger number of guests than
   was expected, the wine gave out. "None but those who know how sacred in
   the East is the duty of lavish hospitality, and how passionately the
   obligation to exercise to the utmost it is felt, can realize the gloom
   which this incident would have thrown over the occasion, or the misery
   and mortification it would have caused to the wedded pair. They would
   have felt it to be, as in the East it is still felt to be, an indelible
   disgrace."--Farrar. It has been supposed that this deficiency was due
   to the presence of the disciples of Jesus, who had been invited after
   all the preparations were made. The mother of Jesus saith to him, They
   have no wine. The solicitude of Mary could hardly be expected from one
   not a relative, but why did she appeal to Jesus? In part, because it
   was natural to speak to him in her perplexity, and in part, likewise,
   because she hoped he would meet the difficulty. She knew who he was,
   and could not doubt his ability to do what had been done for the
   widow's cruse of oil (1 Kings 17:14). Perhaps, also, she felt that the
   failure of the supply was due to his bringing his five disciples. If
   his "hour was come," why should he not create the supply needed? (Joh
   2:4)

   4. Woman, what have I to do with thee? These words in our language
   sound harsh and almost rude, but the term rendered woman was so
   respectful that it might be addressed to the queenliest, and so gentle
   that it might be spoken to those most tenderly loved. It is used by
   servants to queens, and Christ uses it when he, from the cross,
   commends his mother to the care of John. The time, too, had come for
   Jesus to act no longer as Mary's son; henceforth earthly ties of blood
   were not to bind him. "Whosoever did his will," the same was to be
   "mother and sister and brother." This is implied in his question. Mary
   must understand that, henceforth, he is the Son of man and the Son of
   God, rather than her son, and under her authority. Chrysostom says,
   "The answer is not that of one rejecting his mother, but of one who
   would show her that, having borne him, would avail nothing, were she
   not faithful," and St. Augustine adds: "As much as to say, thou art not
   the mother of that in me which worketh miracles." This language, partly
   a rebuke to Mary, shows very plainly that the Catholic fiction of Mary
   being immaculate, the "Queen of Heaven," and "the Mother of God," is
   all nonsensical. Mine hour is not yet come. The hour of his full
   manifestation, as the divine King of Israel. If his mother was rebuked
   for attempting to direct him in the days of his flesh, how absurd to
   address her as if she had the right to command him on the throne of
   glory!--Wesley. (Joh 2:5)

   5. Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. The words of Mary to the
   servants show: 1. That the family where the wedding took place were in
   comfortable circumstances; 2. That Mary had some right to direct, being
   probably a relative; 3. That she understood from the manner of the
   reply, more than from the words, that Jesus would relieve the
   difficulty in some way. (Joh 2:6)

   6. There were set there six water-pots of stone. These water-pots were
   to supply water for the washings usual at feasts (see Mark 7:4). The
   Jews were regarded ceremonially unclean if they did not wash both
   before and after eating. This was done in a formal manner, and was,
   with the washing of cups, pots and brazen vessels, a ritual observance
   on which the Pharisees laid great stress. The six water-pots, on this
   occasion, each held two or three firkins, meaning, it is supposed, the
   Hebrew bath, a measure of seven and a half gallons. The pots would hold
   about twenty gallons each, and the whole capacity would be about one
   hundred and twenty gallons. (Joh 2:7)

   7. Jesus said, Fill the water-pots with water. Some have commented on
   the amount of wine made by Jesus. 1. There is no proof that he made
   more than was needed for the number of guests and the length of the
   feast, where wine was the common beverage of the people. 2. It is God's
   way to pour out his bounty in abundance. When the 5,000 were fed there
   was twelve baskets over. (Joh 2:8)

   8. He said, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. They
   had poured in water and they took out wine. "He that had made wine that
   day in those six water-pots does the same every year in the vines. For
   as what the servants put in the water-pots was changed into wine by the
   operation of the Lord, just so what the clouds pour forth is changed
   into wine by the operation of the same law."--Augustine. (Joh 2:9)

   9. When the ruler of the feast had tasted. The ruler of the feast, and
   the governor of verse 8th, are the same. It was customary to choose,
   sometimes by lot, a president who regulated the whole order of
   festivities. The ruler of the feast on this occasion was a guest,
   chosen to this honorary office. As he presided at the banquet he had
   known nothing of the failure of the wine, or the source from whence the
   new supply came. Called the bridegroom. Probably called to him across
   the table. (Joh 2:10)

   10. Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine. The language
   of the ruler is sportive, but still he states a custom. The best wine
   was offered when the appetite of the guests was sharpest and most
   critical. After they were well filled and had entered fully into the
   spirit of the feast, poorer was offered. Are drunken. Not intoxicated,
   but have drunk considerable. The Revision says, "Have well drunk."
   Satan gives his good wine first; so the drunkard finds it; so did the
   prodigal son. Afterwards he gives the bitter; red eyes, pain, hunger,
   wretchedness. Thou hast kept the good wine until now. What meaneth
   Christ making wine. It must be borne in mind that among the Greeks and
   Romans and in Palestine there were three kinds of wine: 1. Fermented
   wines, which, however, were very unlike our fiery liquors, and
   contained only a small per cent. of alcohol. These were mixed with two
   or three parts of water. The laws of Zaleucus, the Locrian, put to
   death anyone who drank unmixed wine, except as medicine. The fermented
   wine, at first mild, and then diluted with water, was a drink as used,
   that had no intoxicating power unless used in enormous quantities. 2.
   New wine, the fresh juice of the grape, like our new cider, not
   intoxicating. 3. Wines in which, by boiling the unfermented juice of
   the grape, or by the addition of certain drugs, the process of
   fermentation was stopped, and which had no intoxicating properties. We
   cannot surely determine which kind the Savior made here, but we agree
   with Whedon, who says: "We see no reason for supposing that the wine of
   the present occasion was that upon which Scripture places its strongest
   interdict, (Proverbs 20:1; 23:31; Isaiah 22:13,) rather than that
   eulogized as a blessing (Psalms 104:15; Isaiah 55:1)." Even adopting
   the view that it was fermented wine, it was totally unlike the fiery
   and undiluted drinks sold as wines in saloons, used in many families,
   offered at hotels and wine parties, and even poured out at communion
   tables. In the use of the usual wine of Palestine there is not the
   slightest apology for drinking as a beverage the alcoholic drinks which
   are the curse of our times. With regard to them the only safe rule is
   "to touch not, taste not, handle not." They are the "cup of Devils." It
   is a shame that anyone should pretend to quote the example of Christ as
   an apology for being a modern tippler. (Joh 2:11)

   11. This beginning of miracles. This was the first miracle of Christ.
   The stories told in Catholic fables and in the Apocryphal New Testament
   are baseless. He had refused to make bread to feed his own hunger in
   the wilderness, but he was ready to supply the needs of others. A
   miracle is a supernatural act, in which a higher power employs,
   modifies, or suspends the laws of nature. Jesus did this by his own
   power; his apostles in his name. Peter says: "In the name of Jesus of
   Nazareth, arise and walk." Christ says: "Young man, I say unto thee,
   arise!" Manifested forth his glory. This was the first supernatural
   manifestation of his divine power; that he by whom all things were made
   controlled the powers of nature. His disciples believed in him. They
   already believed, but their faith was made firmer. The five named in
   the last chapter are meant. (Sec 2)
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. See how marriage is honored! God solemnized the first marriage in
   Eden. Christ wrought his first miracle on a marriage occasion.

   2. It is to be noted that he was not an ascetic, nor did he delight in
   asceticism. He not only attended the joyous festivities of the marriage
   feast, but he even contributed to the means of enjoyment. He would
   still rather see us bright, joyous and thankful, than long-faced,
   doleful and fault finding. His ministry was to be one of joy and peace;
   his sanction is to be given, not to a crushing asceticism, but to
   genial innocence; his approval, not to compulsory celibacy, but to a
   sacred union.--Farrar.

   3. The first miracle of Moses was to turn the river of a guilty nation
   into blood; the first of Jesus to fill the water pots of an innocent
   family with wine.

   4. The world giveth its best and richest first. At the board it spreads
   the viands may not fail; nay, may even grow in number and improve in
   quality, but they soon pall on the sated appetite, and the end of the
   world's feast is always worse and less enjoyable than the beginning.
   Who has found it so of the provisions of the Savior's grace, of those
   quiet, soothing, satisfying pleasures, that true faith imparts? There
   the appetite grows with the food it feeds upon. . . . Of each new cup
   from the heavenly Provider we may say: "Thou hast kept the good wine
   even until now."--Hanna.

   5. "Let no table be spread to which He who graced the marriage feast of
   Cana could not be invited; let no pleasure be indulged in that could
   not live in the light of his countenance." Then thou wilt be an invited
   guest to the marriage supper of the Lamb of God. Rev. 19:9.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Brethren of the Lord.

   12. After this he went down to Capernaum. Capernaum was situated on the
   northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, and the road thence was "down"
   from the hill country where Cana was located. His mother and brethren
   according to the flesh went with him, and this city became his favorite
   abode during his earthly ministry. The "disciples" who accompanied him
   were the same who were present at Cana. His mother and his brethren.
   Who were the brethren of our Lord who are attending his mother? Before
   attempting to answer this question it is well to explain that as no
   mention is made of the presence of Joseph after Jesus was twelve years
   old he is supposed by all commentators to have died before the Lord
   began his ministry. This seems to be confirmed by his charge to John
   from the cross to provide for his mother and furnish her a home. As to
   the brethren there have been various views. The term is used in the
   Bible with some latitude, as it is with us. It sometimes means kindred,
   cousins, those of the same race, and also the disciples of the Lord.
   Still it is not used with greater latitude than among us, as we apply
   it in till these significations, and hence the apparent meaning to an
   English reader of the term "his brothers" is to be taken unless there
   are reasons for its rejection. The expression "his brethren" occurs
   nine times in the Gospels and once in Acts. Of these the first three
   (Matt. 12:46; Mark 3:32; Luke 8:19) tell of his mother and brethren
   coming to speak with him; the two next (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3), mention
   his brothers in connection with his mother and sisters; the sixth is
   this passage; in three more his brethren are represented as urging him
   to show himself to the world, and it is stated that they did not
   believe on him (John 7:3). In Acts 1:14 it is said that the Apostles
   "continued in prayer and supplication with the women, and with his
   brethren." In addition, Paul (1 Cor. 9:5) speaks of "the rest of the
   apostles and the brethren of the Lord," and in Gal. 1:19 he speaks of
   "James, the Lord's brother." These passages would seem to establish
   beyond doubt that Jesus was the first-born son of Mary, and that she
   had four other sons, whose names are given, besides daughters.

   To this it is objected (1) that early tradition, accepted by the
   Catholic and Greek churches, holds that Mary remained a virgin, and she
   is worshiped as the Virgin Mary. To this it may be answered that the
   tradition was not universally accepted in the early Church, and has
   none of the marks of authentic history. (2) It is urged that Jesus
   would not have committed Mary to the care of John if she had other
   sons. To this it may be replied that at that time his brethren were
   unbelievers (John 7:5), though after his resurrection their unbelief
   passed away. (3) It is further urged that they were all the Lord's
   cousins, the sons of a sister of Mary, also named Mary, and of AlphÃ¦us
   or Cleophas. This argument relies on the fact that their names were
   "James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon" (Matt. 13:55); while there was
   also a "Mary the mother of James and Joses," (Matt. 27:56) and a "James
   and Judas were the sons of AlphÃ¦us" (Luke 6:15). To this we answer
   that, (a) While Mary had a sister (John 19:25), there is no evidence
   that she was named Mary; nor is there any parallel case of two Jewish
   sisters having the same name; nor is there any evidence that she was
   the wife of Cleophas; (b) It could not be true that his cousins are
   meant because "his brethren" were not apostles, nor believers, and he
   had cousins who believed and were among the apostles, if this theory be
   correct; (c) Nor does it prove anything that the names James and Joses
   occur as those of the children of another Mary, as the names were very
   common. There are five Jameses in the New Testament, several Judes, and
   Josephus, who lived at this time, names twenty-one Simons, seventeen
   Joseses, and sixteen Judes.

   On the other hand the expression, first-born son, in Luke 2:7, implies
   that Mary had other and younger children, and Matt. 1:25, implies that
   what was true before the birth of Christ was not after. Common sense
   will indicate that if Mary continued a virgin, Matthew would have
   chosen different language. To these passages we may add the general
   tone of the Gospels in all the passages cited above. The "brothers" of
   Jesus are constantly represented as attending his mother, without a
   hint that they were not her children. These cogent facts cannot be set
   aside by a tradition or by conjectures. Alford well sums up the
   argument in a few words which we quote:

   1. There were four persons known as the brethren "of him," or "of the
   Lord," not of the number of the Twelve.

   2. That these persons are found in all places, but one or two, in
   immediate connection with Mary, the mother of Jesus.

   3. That not a word is anywhere dropped to prevent us from inferring
   that the brothers and sisters were his relations in the same literal
   sense that we know his mother to have been.

   4. All explanations which make them aught else than the children of his
   mother are mere conjectures.

   5. The silence of the Scripture narrative leaves Christians free to
   believe that they were real (younger) brethren and sisters of our Lord.

The Cleansing of the Temple.

   The Gospels are silent concerning any visit of Jesus after his twelfth
   year until the first passover after his ministry began. The Lord, after
   his baptism, the temptation, and the witness of John, had begun his
   work rather quietly in Galilee, but when the passover season came he
   joined the vast crowds who were seeking the city of David, and repaired
   to the national capital where popular expectation held that the Messiah
   would reveal himself. The following events have a fuller significance
   when it is borne in mind that it is the Lord's first visit to the
   temple after his work began. The cleansing is an assertion of his
   Lordship, and authority over the temple, a declaration to the religious
   rulers that the Holy One of Israel had come. (Joh 2:13)

   13. And the Jews' passover was at hand. Observe that John writes as one
   far from Judea and among Gentiles. He does not say the, but the Jews'
   passover. For an account of the institution of this annual feast, see
   Exodus, chapter XII. There is no account that John the Baptist ever
   went to Jerusalem, but the Savior attended all the passovers but one
   during his ministry. A short time before he had been baptized and
   anointed for his ministry; since then his time had mostly been spent in
   Galilee. Now, first, since his work began he visited the capital of the
   nation and the Temple. His life had thus far been quiet, but it
   behooved him to assert his authority in the very center of national
   worship, and his collision with the corruptions of the times brought
   upon him immediately the antagonism of the priesthood and Pharisees.
   From this time onward his pathway is stormy. (Joh 2:14)

   14. And he found in the temple. The Jewish worship centered in the
   temple. There the nation gathered at the great religious festivals;
   there all sacrifices were offered and the priesthood were consecrated.
   First there was the Tabernacle, the movable temple of the wilderness;
   then the temple of Solomon, destroyed at the time of the Captivity;
   then the second temple built by Zerubbabel; lastly, the temple of
   Herod, a great enlargement of the second temple, one of the most costly
   and beautiful buildings on the earth. It was of white marble, with
   roofs of cedar, and was rather a collection of buildings, courts and
   porches than a single building, all within the temple enclosure
   covering nineteen acres. The plan on the following page will give a
   better idea of it than any description.

   ntc3051

   Temple Plan.

   In the center was the Holy of Holies, only entered by the High Priest
   once a year, at the feast of the atonement; next without was the Holy
   Place, entered only by the priests; without the entrance of this was
   the Court of Israel; then the Court of Women; then still without, the
   Court of the Gentiles. It was in this last named court that the traffic
   was conducted that aroused the indignation of the Savior. Those that
   sold oxen and sheep and doves. These were for the sacrifices. It is
   stated that at the passover 200,000 paschal lambs were required, and as
   the vast throngs who came from distant parts could not bring them it
   was needful to buy them in Jerusalem. The traffic in these and the
   victims required for sacrifices, oxen, sheep, kids and doves, became an
   enormous one. Instead of being conducted at stock-yards it was
   installed in the temple itself, under the eye and patronage of a venal
   priesthood. The Court of Gentiles, designed as a "house of prayer for
   all nations" (Mark 11:15-19), was converted into cattle stalls, filled
   with their ordure, and noisy with their lowing and the din of traffic.
   And the changers of money sitting. The Jew was required to pay for the
   support of the temple service a half shekel annually (Exodus 30:13;
   Matt. 17:24). No heathen coin could be put into the temple treasury
   because they usually had images upon them which the priests regarded
   idolatrous; the Jewish shekels were not in general circulation, and
   hence it was needful that the current coin be changed before the temple
   tax could be paid. This money brokerage had also installed itself in
   the temple and much gain was made by the commissions charged. (Joh
   2:15)

   15. Made a scourge of small cords. The original implies that it was
   made of rushes, which were carried in as bedding for cattle. It was not
   a formidable weapon of itself; was chosen more as a symbol, and was
   probably not laid in violence upon any one. Drove them all out of the
   temple. His indignation was aroused at the desecration. As the
   representative of the Father he had the right to cleanse the Sanctuary,
   and here, first, he asserts his authority. The traffickers fled before
   his glance; not in terror of his scourge, or of one man whom they might
   have defied, but there was something about him that struck
   consternation; an authority, a divine majesty, a mysterious power that
   could not be resisted. The act was superhuman. If any one doubts it let
   him try to clean a market of thousands of greedy traffickers with a
   harmless scourge, and see how soon he will bite the earth. Along with
   the traders he drove out their cattle, and overturned the tables of the
   money changers. (Joh 2:16)

   16. Said unto them that sold doves. Cattle could be driven out, the
   money overturned, but the doves were in cages and could only be carried
   out, or released and lost. Christ's object was to cleanse the temple,
   not to destroy any one's property. Hence, he commands them to carry
   them out. Make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. His
   authority for his act is that this is his Father's house. He does not
   say our, but my Father, or in other words, he acts as the Son of God.
   His act is really a public proclamation of his divine authority. He
   still looks with indignation upon the desecration of his Father's
   House. How often still it is converted into a house of merchandise!
   This cleansing of the temple must not be confounded with the later one
   that occurred on his last visit to Jerusalem. His ministry in the Holy
   city very appropriately begins and ends with a protest against the
   desecration of the temple. (Joh 2:17)

   17. His disciples remembered. As they beheld his flaming zeal and
   thought of the wrath that it would bring down upon him, they thought of
   the words in Ps. 69:9, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up." (Joh
   2:18)

   18. Then answered the Jews. I suppose that "the Jews" has an official
   signification as in John 1:19. As soon as they have time to recover
   from their surprise, the officials demand his authority for these acts.
   They are evidently full of resentment. The enmity that grew more and
   more bitter until its object was nailed to the cross, had begun. They
   call for a sign, some miraculous demonstration of his rights. One had
   just been given. (Joh 2:19)

   19. Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. To the
   demand for a sign, made more than once during his ministry, this was
   his constant answer. Unbelief would do its work in destroying the
   temple of his body, and its argument would be overthrown by his
   resurrection from the dead. The temple itself was only a type of the
   spiritual body of Christ. His body contained within itself the
   spiritual temple that would be developed. It was appropriate to point
   to it as the temple, though the Jews did not comprehend his words. (Joh
   2:20) (Joh 2:21)

   20. Forty and six years was this temple in building. It had been
   forty-six years since Herod the Great had begun his work. At this time
   the work was not fully completed and workmen were still engaged on some
   of its parts. It was eighty years from the time it was begun before it
   was fully completed by Herod Agrippa II. a.d. 64. The Jews did not
   understand him, nor is it certain that he designed they should. To the
   obstinate and hostile unbelievers he often spoke in parables. To honest
   seekers for truth his language was plain and simple. (Joh 2:22)

   22. When therefore he was risen from the deed his disciples remembered.
   They remembered and understood his words then; they did not now. Then
   "they believed the Scripture" which foretold his death and
   resurrection, though they had never understood it before. (Joh 2:23)

   23. Many believed in his name when they saw the miracles. The miracles
   that he worked at this passover season are not recorded, but this
   passage affirms them, as well as John 3:2. Their belief was rather an
   intellectual assent that he was a divine teacher than an obedient trust
   in him as the Savior. (Joh 2:24)

   24. He did not commit himself to them. He knew too well that theirs was
   not a heartfelt trust to reveal himself unreservedly to them. (Joh
   2:25)

   25. He knows what was in man. He knew their hearts, because he
   possessed the divine omniscience that could fathom the depths of every
   heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. The Master still looks with indignation upon the conversion of the
   Temple into a house of merchandise. It is still done by a corrupt
   priesthood, a greedy ministry, or a membership who try to make gain by
   professed godliness. When a priesthood sells its offices, makes its set
   charges for absolution, extreme unction, the burial of the dead, masses
   and indulgences; or in Protestant churches the ministry become a set of
   hirelings, in the market for the highest bidder; or the membership
   convert the house of God into a place for shows, festivals, raffles,
   etc., the Father's House is made a house of merchandise. There is need
   of the whip of small cords to scourge out the traffickers.

   2. When corruption and avarice enshrined themselves in the Jewish
   temple the time of its overthrow was near. Soon God departed from it
   and "their place was left unto them desolate." When the church becomes
   sordid instead of spiritual God will abandon it to destruction.

   3. The Master still knows what is in every heart. He has no need to be
   told what is in mine or yours, but he sees every thought and motive
   every day. Our lives are naked and open to him with whom we have to do.

     __________________________________________________________________

Christ and Nicodemus.

   This chapter relates another and a remarkable incident of this visit to
   Jerusalem, an interview with a member of the Sanhedrim, a prominent
   Pharisee. The last verses of the second chapter state that there were
   many who believed in Jesus when they saw his miracles, not with that
   unfaltering trust that commits everything to the Lord, but a belief
   that he was a man of God. One of this number was Nicodemus, who came
   confessing that Jesus must be "a teacher come from God," because no man
   could do such miracles unless God was with him, and who sought to learn
   more in a private interview. In order to understand the significance of
   the Savior's words to him, the reader must inform himself as to the
   position of this "ruler of the Jews." He was a prominent member of the
   most influential sect of Israel, of an order who were in great repute
   on account of their reputation for holiness, a body of Hebrew saints
   elevated above the rest of the Jews by their devotion to the law of
   God. The body probably had its beginning about the time of the
   Captivity, but we discover it first as a power in Israel at the time of
   the great revival of the Maccabees, about two centuries before the time
   of this interview. At that time there was a determined effort to detach
   the Jewish nation from the religion of their fathers and to induce them
   to adopt the ways of the Syrian Greeks. Against this attempt the
   Pharisees set themselves with the sternness of Puritans and were a
   buckler to the Maccabees in their effort to re-establish the national
   freedom with the ancient religion. Seeking, at first, the preservation
   of the law of Moses with all its rites in their original purity, they
   gradually degenerated into a set of formalists who kept the letter of
   the law while its spirit was lost. In the time of the Savior the two
   fundamental rules were to pay tithes of everything, even to mint and
   cumin, and to keep rigidly every ceremonial required to secure legal
   purification. Hence, they made a great show of sanctity, were outwardly
   very religious, and esteemed themselves much holier than the rest of
   the people, but at the same time were proud, puffed up, and really
   corrupt at heart. My space will not allow me to go into details, but
   these would show in them one of the most conspicuous examples on record
   of the complete loss of the spiritual life in a slavish bondage to
   forms. At the same time they regarded themselves as the favorites of
   heaven, entitled to the approval of God by their righteousness, and the
   very nucleus of the kingdom of God. Hence, when one of these holy ones,
   with the prejudices of his order, but more open-hearted, inquiring and
   teachable than his brethren, came to the great "Rabbi" from Galilee for
   information, the occasion is a remarkable one, and the Savior, in his
   first utterance, fells to the earth the Pharisaic pride when he
   declares: "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
   God." Nor need we wonder at the perplexity of Nicodemus concerning the
   "New Birth," when we realize that he deemed the natural birth of the
   race of Abraham together with a rigid observance of the law as the
   essentials to membership in that kingdom. (Joh 3:1)

   1. There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
   Jews. Nicodemus is named three times by John, and not elsewhere; here,
   in chapter 7:50, where he protests against condemning Jesus unheard,
   and in chapter 19:39, where he aids Joseph of ArimathÃ¦a, in the burial
   of Jesus. There are untrustworthy traditions about him and an allusion
   in the Jewish Talmud to a Nicodemus who lived about this time, but it
   may have been another man. Two facts are here stated: (1) That he was a
   Pharisee of the powerful, self-righteous sect which laid such stress on
   ceremonial observances and Jewish birth; and (2) That he was a ruler, a
   member of the Sanhedrim, the congress of seventy persons who held the
   chief authority in Israel. The allusion to him in verse 10 as a
   "teacher in Israel," would imply that he was one of the prominent
   doctors of the law. (Joh 3:2)

   2. The same came to Jesus by night. He probably chose the night in
   order to escape observation. The radical act of Jesus in driving the
   cattle and the dealers, as well as the money changers, from the temple
   court, had excited the wrath of the priests who derived gain from the
   desecration. The holy and uncalculating zeal of the young Teacher on
   this occasion, like that of an old Hebrew prophet, his teachings and
   miracles in Jerusalem, had excited much discussion. Nicodemus was
   deeply moved, yet dared not provoke the scorn and opposition of his
   fellow-rulers by going openly to Jesus. Rabbi, we know that thou art a
   teacher come from God. Nicodemus confesses, not only his belief, but
   that of his fellow Pharisees and rulers. The miracles of Jesus
   convinced them, even if they would not admit it, that he was a teacher
   sent from God. No man whom God did not send could do such works. There
   is more in the words of Nicodemus than his words. He really intends a
   question. He was one of those who waited for the salvation of Israel.
   John had preached that the long expected kingdom was at hand. Now,
   while John was still preaching, this Galilean Teacher had startled all
   Jerusalem by his act of authority in the temple, by his teaching and
   miracles. Nicodemus wants to know what he has to do with, and to say
   about, the Kingdom. (Joh 3:3)

   3. Verily, verily, I say unto thee. This form of expression was often
   upon the lips of Jesus to give emphasis to an unusually solemn and
   weighty declaration. See Matt. 5:18. It occurs twenty-four times in
   John. Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. The
   term translated "again" is rendered "anew" in the Revision, which is
   better. It is the great doctrine, so fundamental in the Gospel, of
   Regeneration, a new Birth, being made a new creature, the same doctrine
   spoken of in chapter 1:12, 13. Nicodemus, like all Jews, supposed that
   all who were born as children of Abraham would, as Abraham's seed, be
   citizens of the kingdom. John had rejected this idea and denounced the
   claim of special privileges because they had Abraham for their father,
   but Nicodemus seems to have had his breath fairly taken away by the
   declaration that no man could see (enjoy) the Kingdom unless he was
   born anew; that the Jew, ruler, Pharisee, priest and Levite were not
   exceptions, and stood on the same footing as the despised Gentile.

   Life begins visibly with birth; the new life must begin with a new
   birth; no one can be a new creature in Christ Jesus unless he is born
   anew. We are born naturally into the kingdom of nature, to live the
   natural life; if we enter the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of grace,
   it must be by a new birth. The doctrine that a man can bury his old
   sinful life, and begin a new one with the freshness of youthful hope,
   is foreshadowed in the Old Testament (Isaiah 1:18; Jer. 31:33; Ezek.
   11:19; 36:26), and taught in the New Testament (Rom. 6:8; 8:3; 12:2; 2
   Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15,16). (Joh 3:4)

   4. How can a man be born again when he is old? The question of
   Nicodemus indicates his surprise and skepticism. He ought to have
   apprehended the meaning of Jesus better. The Jews were wont to admit
   Gentile proselytes to the Jewish religion and to speak of them as born
   again. They even insisted that the proselyte was no longer kin to his
   old relations and might marry his nearest kin without offence, because
   old relationships were destroyed by his new birth. This doctrine of
   naturalization ought to have given him a better conception of the
   Savior's meaning. (Joh 3:5)

   5. Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter the
   kingdom of God. Jesus does not reply directly to the question of
   Nicodemus, but proceeded to give a more explicit statement concerning
   the new birth. One must be born of water and of the Spirit. Whatever
   this may mean, it will be admitted by all, 1. That no one is a member
   of the kingdom of God until he is born again; 2. That the Savior
   declares the impossibility of one entering who is not born of water and
   of the Spirit. One cannot enter by being born of water alone, nor of
   the Spirit alone, but must be born of water and of the Spirit.
   Otherwise he cannot enter. What, then, is the meaning of these two
   words? Concerning the birth of the Spirit we need say little, as there
   is little controversy about it. Concerning born of water we agree with
   Alford that it refers to baptism, while "of the Spirit" refers to the
   inward change. He adds: "All attempts to get rid of these two plain
   facts have sprung from doctrinal prejudices by which the views of
   expositors have been warped." Abbott says: "We are to understand Christ
   as he expected his auditor to understand him. The Jewish proselyte, as
   a sign that he had put off his old faiths, was baptized on entering the
   Jewish church. John the Baptist baptized both Jew and Gentile as a sign
   of purification by repentance from past sins. Nicodemus would then have
   certainly understood by the expression, born of water, a reference to
   this rite of baptism." Milligan, of Scotland, says: "John said: I
   baptize with water; the One coming baptizes with Spirit; but Christ
   says: The baptism of both is necessary. One must be born of water and
   of the Spirit." See also Titus 3:5 and Rom. 6:4. (Joh 3:6)

   6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; . . . of the Spirit is
   spirit. Our fleshly bodies are born of our human parents and are like
   them, endowed with carnal passions and are sinful; but it is the inward
   man, the spirit, that is renewed by the Spirit and the subject of the
   new birth of the Spirit. Like, in each case, produces like. (Joh 3:7)

   7. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The
   necessity and reasonableness of the new birth is explained more fully
   below. It is implied in the word kingdom. No one born a citizen of
   England can become a citizen of the United States without complying
   with our naturalization laws. The kingdom of God has its naturalization
   laws and there is no other way of entrance than to be born of water and
   of the Spirit. We may not understand all the mysteries of the new
   birth, any more than we do those of the natural birth, but we can
   understand what has to be done and what is necessary. It is plain that
   a new spirit is essential to a new life. (Joh 3:8)

   8. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
   thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so
   is every one that is born of the Spirit. No passage, probably, in the
   New Testament, has caused more bewilderment or controversy than this
   verse. Most commentators have held that it means: "As the wind moves
   mysteriously, so does the Spirit, and it breathes upon whom it will,
   effecting the inward change called the birth of the Spirit
   arbitrarily." This view we believe to be incorrect and caused by a
   wrong translation, sanctioned, not by the Greek, but by current
   theology. Let it be noted that, 1. Exactly the same term is rendered
   "wind" and "Spirit" in this verse. It is a violation of all law that
   the same word should experience so radical a change of meaning in the
   same sentence. 2. That word (pneuma) is not translated "wind"
   elsewhere, although it occurs scores of times in the New Testament, but
   is always "Spirit." 3. Another word in the Greek, anemos, is usually
   used to represent "wind" in the New Testament. 4. This erroneous idea
   creates a confusion of figures. It makes Christ to say: The wind blows
   where it listeth; so is (not the Spirit, but) every one born of the
   Spirit. It affirms of him just what is affirmed of the wind, a thing
   the Savior never did. These facts are sufficient to show that the
   rendering "wind" is wrong. All we have to do is to translate pneuma
   here, as is done in the latter part of the verse and elsewhere in the
   New Testament. The verse then reads: "The Spirit breathes where it
   pleases and thou hearest the voice thereof, but canst not tell whence
   it comes nor whither it goes. So (by hearing its voice) is every one
   born of the Spirit." The meaning is: The Spirit breathes where it wills
   and you recognize its manifestation by its voice; by the words spoken
   by men of God as the Holy Spirit gives them utterance. You cannot tell
   whence the Spirit comes or whither it goes, but you can hear its voice
   when it does come. So, by listening to the voice of the Spirit, is
   every one born of the Spirit. He who receives by faith the
   communications of the Spirit is born of the Spirit. The birth of the
   Spirit is not the gift of the Spirit. To those who are born the Spirit
   is given. "Because ye are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son
   unto your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." Gal.4:6. Hence, in harmony
   with the above view, Peter says, "Being born again, not by corruptible
   seed, but incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and
   abideth forever." (Joh 3:9)

   9. How can these things be? His skeptical tone is gone and he is an
   humble inquirer. He has been sobered and awed by the earnestness and
   moral power of Christ, like the Samaritan woman, or Festus and Agrippa.
   (Joh 3:10)

   10. Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things? The
   question implies that Nicodemus was one of the doctors of the law.
   These made very arrogant claims of superior knowledge. Christ intends
   to show their ignorance of the fundamental principles of the kingdom.
   Though the prophets had indicated the new heart and spirit as one of
   its conditions they had entirely overlooked it. (Joh 3:11)

   11. Verily, verily, I say unto thee. This is the third time these words
   have occurred. Each time they mark a new stage of the discourse. We
   speak that which we do know . . . ye receive not our witness. Why does
   Christ change to the plural? Various answers have been given, but we
   believe that the change of "thou" to "ye" explains it. "Ye" includes
   Nicodemus and all Jews who failed to confess him; "we" includes himself
   and those who should testify of him as the Holy Spirit gave them
   utterance. They I knew and testified that they had "seen." This is
   closely connected in thought with verse 8th. The birth of the Spirit is
   due to hearing the "voice of the Spirit," to being "born of the word of
   God," to believing the things witnessed by the Spirit. (Joh 3:12)

   12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not. He had
   spoken of the things that belonged to the kingdom of God on earth, of
   the new birth. If Nicodemus could not understand and believe this, so
   plain, easily understood and connected with human life, how would he
   receive testimony concerning the heavenly kingdom, God, and eternal
   glory? He had said: "We know that thou art a teacher, come from God;"
   Christ now declares that he is not "a man sent from God" like John, but
   has come down from heaven, still is of heaven, and therefore, can bear
   witness of heavenly things. (Joh 3:13)

   13. For no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down . . .
   the Son of man which is in heaven. No man has gone to heaven and
   returned to bear witness of heavenly things and the counsels of God.
   The only witness is the Son of man who came down and is still in
   heaven, because divine and in constant communication therewith. This
   implies: 1. That he existed before he appeared on earth. 2. That heaven
   was his true abode. 3. That, on earth, his spirit was in communication
   with heaven. (Joh 3:14) (Joh 3:15)

   14, 15. As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the
   Son of Man be lifted up. The reference is to Numbers 21:4-9. The
   Israelites sinned through unbelief and were bitten by fiery serpents
   and died. Moses, at the command of God, raised on a pole a brazen
   serpent and those bitten who looked in faith were healed. So the world
   is in sin and dying because bitten by the serpent of sin through
   unbelief. Christ, he declares, will be lifted up on the cross, and
   whosoever looks to the crucified Savior and believes upon him will not
   perish, but have everlasting life. This implies that those who reject
   the uplifted Christ win perish. (Joh 3:16)

   16. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, etc.
   There is no sweeter verse in the Bible. It declares, 1. That God is
   love. 2. That he loved the world instead of hating it. 3. That he so
   loved that he gave his Son. The Son did not come to appease the
   Father's wrath, but the Father sent him because he loved so well. 4.
   That he came to keep men from perishing;--to save them. 5. That those
   who believe upon him, so as to receive him, will not perish but have
   everlasting life. God's love is not limited;--"he loved the world." Men
   limit its grace by refusing to receive its medium, "the only begotten
   Son." (Joh 3:17)

   17. God sent not his Son to condemn the world. Christ came to be the
   Savior. His mission was to "save his people from their sins." There is
   condemnation, but it is because of unbelief. "This is the condemnation,
   that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than
   light, because their deeds were evil." (Joh 3:18)

   18. He that believeth on him is not condemned. "He that believeth and
   is baptized shall be saved." Faith in Christ is essential to salvation,
   because it is the power that leads to obedience to him. Belief in him
   must be strong enough to sway all the life and soul. Is condemned
   already. "He that believeth not shall be damned." The unbeliever
   condemns himself. He is lost and refuses to be saved by Christ. He is
   dead and refuses to be made alive. The judgment is already passed upon
   him; the day of judgment will only make it manifest. Hath not believed
   in the name. The name Jesus, which means Savior. To disbelieve that
   name is to reject the salvation of Jesus; the only name whereby we must
   be saved. (Joh 3:19) (Joh 3:20)

   19, 20. This is the condemnation. The ground of condemnation. The light
   had come into the world, Christ, the true Light, but men chose to walk
   in darkness because they loved it rather than light. The evil doer
   shuns light because it exposes. Birds and beasts of prey, thieves and
   evil doers, love the night because it hides their deeds. There is
   nothing that frauds of every kind dread so much as investigation. They
   hate the light lest their deeds should be reproved. The fact that men
   love sin accounts for the unbelief and spiritual darkness of our race.
   Myriads do not want truth or light which condemns their evil deeds.
   (Joh 3:21)

   21. He that doeth truth cometh to the light. Truth is not an abstract
   idea; it is something that must be lived. Many a life is a false one, a
   lie; many a life is a true one, an illustration of the truth. He that
   does the truth, is conscious of a true and genuine life, seeks the
   light, and is willing that his deeds should be manifest.

Practical Observations.

   1. One cannot creep secretly into the kingdom of heaven. He must come
   out openly on the side of the Savior and publicly confess him.

   2. Earthly birth, or station, does not entitle to spiritual privileges.
   The kingdom is not composed of sons of Abraham, or priests, or nobles,
   or princes, but of those who have been born again.

   3. No one can enter the kingdom who is not "born of water and of the
   Spirit." To baptize a babe, or anyone without faith, cannot make it a
   member of the kingdom, because it is not born of the Spirit. Nor can
   one enter who may claim that he is born of the Spirit unless he is
   "born of water" also. The proof that one has received the "Spirit is
   that he receives the things of the Spirit."

   4. The Spirit breathes upon whom he wills and then he "speaks as the
   Holy Spirit gives him utterance." His voice was heard. So, by hearing
   his voice and obeying, every one is born of the Spirit. Vain are the
   claims of men to the new birth who refuse to obey the Spirit's
   commands.

   5. Those who believe upon the Son are born of the Spirit, and have
   everlasting life. He that believeth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God
   is born of God, because his belief, if of the heart, leads him to a
   truthful and obedient acceptance of him who is the life.

John at Ã†non.

   22. After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
   Judea. Shortly after the passover and the interview with Nicodemus, he
   left the Jewish metropolis. It had refused to hear him and he retired
   to the country districts, probably on the banks of the Jordan. There he
   tarried with them and baptized. This is the first intimation of Christ
   administering the baptismal rite. He did not baptize in person, but by
   his disciples (John 4:2). His baptism at this time could not have been
   the Christian rite that he instituted after his resurrection, but was
   preparatory like John's. Christian baptism could not exist until the
   Son had demonstrated his relation to the Father by the resurrection,
   and until the Holy Spirit was given. The baptismal formula recognizes
   the authority of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. (Joh
   3:23)

   23. John also was baptizing at Ã†non near to Salim. The location of Ã†non
   was long in doubt, and it was left for Lieut. Conder, of the British
   Palestine Exploration, to settle the question so satisfactorily that
   the authorities on the sacred localities, Robinson, Stanley, Thompson,
   Schaff and McGarvey, have accepted his discovery. He, the only man who
   has made a scientific survey of Palestine, locates it northeast of
   Samaria, in a beautiful valley, not far from the Jordan. He says (Tent
   Work, p. 92): "The valley is open in most of its course, and we find in
   it the two requisites for the scene of the baptism of a large
   multitude,--an open space and abundance of water. Not only does the
   name Salim occur in the village three miles south of the valley, but
   the name Ã†non, signifying 'springs,' is recognized as the village of
   Ainun, four miles north of the stream. There is only one other place of
   the latter name in Palestine, Beit Ainun, near Hebron, but this is a
   place that has no fine supply of water and no Salim near it. On the
   other hand there are many other Salims all over Palestine, but none of
   them has an Ã†non near it. The site of Wady Far'ah is the only one where
   all the requisites are met,--the two names, the fine water supply, the
   proximity of the desert, and the open character of the ground." Prof.
   McGarvey, who visited the locality, says: "The much water we found all
   the way, and although the season was exceptionally dry, pools well
   suited for baptizing were abundant. . . . Here, then, was the open
   space required, and a more suitable place for the gathering of a
   multitude could not be found on the banks of any stream in Palestine. .
   . . We cut an oleander cane apiece from the bank of the stream, and
   took a bath in one of its pools."--Lands of the Bible, pp. 508-9.
   Because there was much water there. This is assigned as a reason, not
   why John was at Ã†non, or preached at Ã†non, but why he baptized at Ã†non.
   It explains "baptizing." "Much water" was essential to baptism in New
   Testament times, and Ã†non provided it. It shows the stress of
   Pedobaptists when they insist that he chose Ã†non because the great
   multitudes would require much water for domestic purposes. The
   Scripture explains its necessity otherwise. Nor does the criticism that
   polla hudata means "many waters" help their cause. The phrase is
   applied in the Septuagint to the Euphrates (Jer. 51:13), and in
   Revelation to the Tiber (Rev. 17:1). It may mean either "much" or
   "many" waters. There were many fountains at Ã†non and many pools in the
   stream they created. Whatever polla hudata may mean it explains the
   reason why John was baptizing there, a fact that can be reconciled only
   with immersion. The reason why the historian gives this explanation is
   that all the other accounts of John's baptizing locate him at the river
   Jordan. As it is here affirmed that he was baptizing at a place some
   distance from the Jordan, it is explained that there "was much water
   there" also. (Joh 3:24)

   24. For John was not yet cast into prison. This incident occurred just
   before the seizure of John. The testimony following is the last words
   recorded of the great forerunner before he was sent to prison and from
   thence to death. As the other Gospels omit this incident, and, after
   the baptism of Christ, mention John next in prison, the author of the
   Fourth Gospel is particular to say "he was not yet cast into prison."
   (Joh 3:25)

   25. There arose a question between John's disciples and the Jews. The
   Revision reads "a Jew" which is supported by the best manuscripts. We
   can only conjecture the nature of this dispute. "The Jew," evidently
   not a disciple of either John or Jesus, but perhaps a Pharisee (see
   John 4:1), associated baptism with the bathings of the Jewish law for
   purification. The context shows that in a discussion with disciples of
   John he gave preference either to Christ's baptism, or to Christ
   himself, over John and his baptism. He probably also spoke of the great
   numbers who resorted to Christ. (Joh 3:26)

   26. Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, . . . the same
   baptizeth. Full of jealousy for the reputation of their master, they
   rush to him with their complaint, as if the growing influence of Jesus
   and his practice of baptism were an infringement on the rights of John.
   Note that they had been impressed by the witness that John had borne to
   Jesus at Bethabara. (Joh 3:27) (Joh 3:28)

   27, 28. A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven.
   This trial of John would have been a sore one had he been swayed by
   human feeling. To see his great popularity and influence gradually
   waning, and another coming up to take his place, was well calculated to
   arouse jealousy. But John, in the spirit of his mission, rose to a
   sublime superiority over carnal weakness. He declares, first, that what
   he is, and what Jesus is, is due to the will of heaven. Each will fill
   his appointed mission "given him from heaven." Next, he cites his own
   words before spoken, of which they were witnesses, in which he declared
   that he was not the Christ, but only the messenger who went before the
   King to prepare his way. The superiority of Jesus was only what he
   himself had predicted. (Joh 3:29)

   29. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom. This expressive figure is
   often used. The church, espoused to Christ, is the bride; Christ, the
   bridegroom. John, in the growing influence of Christ, already sees in
   anticipation the bridegroom united to the bride. As the friend of the
   bridegroom he rejoices in the happiness of the bridegroom The good news
   that his disciples bring him of Christ, so far from arousing envy,
   causes him to rejoice. He feels that his own work is done: "My joy
   therefore is fulfilled." (Joh 3:30)

   30. He must increase, but I must decrease. As the light of the moon
   fades out before the rising sun, so John must decrease before the
   bright light of the Sun of Righteousness. His own decrease is, however,
   only a proof of the increase and fulness of Christ. These last words of
   John are in the spirit of Christian sacrifice and are a fitting close
   of his work. (Joh 3:31)

   31. He that cometh from above is above all. It is generally supposed
   that the following words are, not those of John the Baptist, but of the
   Apostle. There is a contrast of style, and a part of what follows
   contains references to the words of our Lord. The one that cometh from
   above is Christ, who is above every earthly teacher, prophets,
   apostles, and John the Baptist. (Joh 3:32)

   32. What he hath seen and heard, he testifieth. He hath no need for
   instruction, for the one from heaven knows personally of what he
   testifies. No, man receiveth his testimony. The world, in John the
   apostle's time still rejected Christ. Here and there were churches who
   honored the Master, but mankind refused to receive his testimony. (Joh
   3:33)

   33. Hath set his seal that God is true. A few, comparatively, had
   received his testimony, and these thereby demonstrated their conviction
   that God is true; that his promises have been fulfilled in Christ. To
   attach a seal to a document is to confirm it. (Joh 3:34)

   34. He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God. So Christ affirmed
   of himself. It was the Father who spoke in him. He had the fulness of
   the Spirit. It is the testimony of the whole world, believing and
   unbelieving, that "he spake as man never spake." The reason of this is
   plain. It was the Father speaking through him. (Joh 3:35)

   35. The Father loveth the Son. Therefore he had the Spirit without
   measure, and in him dwelt the "fulness of the Godhead." (Joh 3:36)

   36. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life. Eternal life
   and death turn on the question of faith in Christ. They turn on this
   principle because "without faith we cannot please God," for we cannot
   live the life, while unbelievers, that pleases him. Faith is the
   mightiest power of earth to move men to action, and faith in Christ
   moves to the life that is needful to become the sons of God. He who
   believes with a heartfelt, obedient faith, a faith that trusts all and
   surrenders all to the will of Christ, is born again and "hath eternal
   life," while the unbeliever remains in disobedience and abides in
   death. It is not "faith alone" that gives life, but "faith made
   perfect" by obedience. See James 2:22.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. Those who neglect, or disparage the rites which God has established,
   trample under foot the example of the Master. He obeyed, preached, and
   practiced John's baptism. Much the more ought all his followers to
   regard that which the Lord has enacted.

   2. The true servant of God seeks not his own honor, but the glory of
   Christ. A godly preacher will hide himself behind the Master and be
   forgetful of himself so that Christ is honored. "God forbid that he
   should glory, save in Christ and him crucified." It is no credit to a
   preacher that his hearers should go away from his preaching thinking
   and talking of himself. He only preaches effectually who fixes their
   thoughts on Christ.

Jesus at the Well.

   After the Savior's Passover and the conversation with Nicodemus, he
   tarried in the land of Judea, probably until the late fall of the year
   (chapter 4:35). He had not yet called his apostles nor ordained his
   baptism, but he co-operated with John in administering his baptism,
   through his disciples (chapter 3:22). A question concerning this
   baptismal rite was raised with John's disciples by the Jews, evidently
   to provoke jealousy of Christ, which led these disciples to come to
   John with a complaint. This gave him another opportunity to give a
   noble testimony to Christ. The jealousy of the Pharisees and the arrest
   of John, caused the Lord in the fall to return to Galilee. On the route
   occurred the memorable conversation with the woman of Sychar.

   The Jews, whose discussion had thus deeply moved the followers of John,
   may well have been of the prominent Pharisees, and our Lord soon became
   aware that they were watching his proceedings with an unfriendly eye.
   Their hostility to John was a still deeper hostility against him, for
   the very reason that his teaching was already more successful. Perhaps
   in consequence of this determined rejection of the earliest steps of
   his teaching--perhaps also out of regard for the wounded feelings of
   John's followers--but most of all because at this very time the news
   reached him that John had been seized by Herod Antipas and thrown into
   prison--Jesus left Judea and again departed into Galilee. Being already
   in the north of Judea, he chose the route which led through Samaria.
   The fanaticism of Jewish hatred, the fastidiousness of Jewish
   Pharisaism, which led his countrymen when traveling alone to avoid that
   route, could have no existence for him, and were things rather to be
   discouraged than approved.--Farrar.

   The historic setting of the visit to Sychar is so entirely harmonized
   with the facts, that the account must have been penned by an
   eye-witness. "We are confronted with the historic antagonism of the
   Jews and Samaritans, which still survives in Nablus, the modern
   Shechem, where the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Samaritan synagogue are
   still shown to the stranger; here we see the genuine humanity of Jesus,
   as he sat 'wearied with his journey,' though not weary of his work of
   saving souls, his elevation above rabbinical prejudices which forbade
   conversing with any woman out of doors, his superhuman knowledge and
   dignity, and his surpassing wisdom of parabolic teaching; here the
   life-like sketch of a sinful, yet quick-witted woman, full of curiosity
   and interest in the religious question of the day, and running to tell
   her neighbors her great discovery of the prophet who had touched her
   conscience, excited her thirst for the water of life, and led her from
   Jacob's well to the fountain of salvation, and from the dispute about
   the place of worship to the highest conception of God as an omnipotent
   Spirit to be worshiped in spirit and truth. Truly, no poet could have
   invented such a story. (Joh 4:1)

   1. When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
   made and baptized more disciples than John. These verses explain why
   Christ left Judea and returned to Galilee. Evidently the controversy
   noted in the last chapter (3:22-27) had stirred up no little
   excitement. "The Jew" who disputed with John's disciples was probably a
   Pharisee. This bitter sect was noting the increasing influence of
   Christ. There were, therefore, two reasons for departure; first, to
   avoid arousing the jealousy of John's disciples, and secondly, to
   prevent a premature conflict with the Pharisees. (Joh 4:2)

   2. Though the Lord did not himself baptize, but his disciples. Christ's
   message at this time was John's: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is
   at hand," and his baptism was that of John. Hence it was needful that
   it be administered by servants, rather than the Master. His own baptism
   could not be observed until after the death, burial and resurrection,
   since it is a planting in the likeness of his death. (Joh 4:3) (Joh
   4:4)

   3, 4. He must needs go through Samaria. Samaria was between Judea and
   Galilee, and hence the route led through it. It seems probable from
   John 4:35, that it was in the latter part of the fall that he departed
   from Judea. [1]See comment on verse 35.

   The scene at Jacob's well presents a most graphic, and yet most
   unartificial picture of nature and human life, as it still remains,
   though in decay, at the foot of Gerizim and Ebal, the most beautiful
   section of Palestine. There is still the well of Jacob, recognized as
   such by Samaritans, Jews, Mohammedans and Christians alike; there is
   the sanctuary on the top of Gerizim, where the Passover is annually
   celebrated by the remnant of the Samaritan sect, according to the
   prescription of Moses; there are the waving grain-fields, ripening for
   the harvest in the well-watered, fertile valley.--Schaff. (Joh 4:5)

   5. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar. Samaria
   was the district, embracing the ancient city of Samaria, which lay
   between Judea and Galilee. As it was interposed between, when our Lord
   would go from Judea to Galilee "he must needs go through Samaria,"
   unless he would take a very circuitous route east of the Jordan. The
   district of Samaria comprised the country formerly occupied by the
   tribe of Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh. When the Ten Tribes
   were carried to Babylon the Assyrian king sent in other tribes to
   occupy the country. These, on account of calamities, and probably
   influenced by Israelites who had been left in the country, requested of
   the Assyrian king a Hebrew priest, and one was sent. Henceforth they
   had a religion partly Jewish and partly pagan. When the Jews returned
   from Captivity and began to rebuild the temple the Samaritans offered
   to aid them, but were sternly repulsed. Henceforth a bitter feeling
   existed between the two peoples. When Manasseh, a priest, was expelled
   from Jerusalem by Nehemiah, for an unlawful marriage, he fled to
   Samaria, took charge of their worship, and a temple was erected on Mt.
   Gerizim, in opposition to the one at Jerusalem. Henceforth the
   Samaritans, claiming to be the children of Israel (Jacob), insisted
   that Gerizim, the Mount of Blessing, was the place chosen by God for
   worship. As the later Jewish Scriptures recognized Jerusalem as the
   seat of divine worship, they were rejected by the Samaritans, who
   received the five books of Moses alone. Sychar. This place was the
   ancient Shechem, so famous in the early history. It was forty miles,
   north of Jerusalem, and was situated between Mount Gerizim and Mount
   Ebal, the Mounts of Blessing and Cursing (Joshua 8:30-35). Here Jacob
   built his first altar (Gen. 33:18); here Joseph was buried in the land
   given him by his father (Joshua 24:32); and here also the covenant of
   Israel was renewed with amens to the blessings and curses, after Joshua
   had conquered Canaan. Few spots in all Israel had a more interesting
   history. The word Sychar signifies a drunkard and a liar, and was,
   doubtless, first applied by the Jews in derision. It was afterwards
   called Neapolis, and at present a village called Nablous exists with a
   population of two thousand, about two hundred of whom are Samaritans
   and preserve their ancient worship. Near to the parcel of ground that
   Jacob gave to his son Joseph. In this parcel Joseph was buried when
   Israel came up out of Egypt, his bones having been carried with them in
   accordance with his dying wish. His tomb is still shown and it can
   hardly be doubted that his bones really rest in the place pointed out.
   (Joh 4:6)

   6. Now Jacob's well was there. It is still seen by the traveller, cut
   through the solid rock, between eight and nine feet in diameter, and
   about seventy-five feet deep. When visited by Maundrel, two hundred
   years ago, it was over a hundred feet deep. The accumulation of rubbish
   at the bottom has lessened its depth and there is now no water visible.
   It is about two miles from Nablous. There is no account of Jacob
   digging the well, and it has been asked why he should have dug it when
   there was an abundance of springs within two miles. Probably because
   the springs belonged to others and were occupied. At any rate, some one
   did dig the well, and a tradition that Christ did not reject and which
   John seems to admit, ascribed it to the patriarch. Jesus . . wearied .
   . sat thus on the well. The wells were usually curbed around with stone
   and covered. On this curb the Savior sat sheltered from the sun at
   noon, the sixth hour being twelve o'clock. His body was human and
   subject to all the infirmities of ours. The morning journey had wearied
   him; he could hunger; he sank under the weight of the cross. (Joh 4:7)
   (Joh 4:8)

   7, 8. There cometh a woman of Samaria. A Samaritan woman of the city of
   Sychar. Why she should come so far from the city for water is a matter
   of conjecture. It was the custom for women to work in the fields, and
   she was probably employed near, and came at the noon hour, the hour of
   rest and refreshment, to the well for water. She had lived a checkered
   and, in part, disreputable life, and this might account for her not
   being accompanied by any of her sex. The Savior had been left alone by
   his disciples, who had gone to the village to buy food, and he opened a
   conversation by asking the woman to give him a drink of water, a
   request that the children of the East regard it an obligation to comply
   with most cheerfully, even to strangers and enemies. In that parched
   land water is the chiefest of blessings; Jesus pronounced a blessing
   upon him who should give a cup of cold water; Mahomet enjoined that it
   should never be refused; the servant of Abraham had asked it of the
   daughter of Nahor; the request of Jesus, even to a strange woman, was
   the custom of the East. (Joh 4:9)

   9. How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me? She saw by his
   dress, appearance, and the direction whence he came that he was of the
   Jewish race. The antipathy between the Jews and Samaritans was so
   bitter that, although there might be some trade and they could buy food
   of each other on a journey, they were never wont to ask any hospitable
   rite. The woman's reply is not a refusal of the Lord's request, but an
   expression of astonishment that a Jew should ask a favor of a
   Samaritan. "The maxims of the Jews respecting intercourse with the
   Samaritan people varied much at different times and it is not easy to
   say what rules prevailed at the period with which we are here
   concerned. One precept in the Talmud approves their mode of preparing
   the flesh of animals, others commend their unleavened bread, their
   cheese, their food. Elsewhere, however, we find restrictions; and the
   wine, vinegar, etc., of the Samaritans were forbidden to every
   Israelite, their country with its roads and other products only being
   regarded clean. This narrative shows that it was held lawful to buy
   food in a Samaritan town, so that the words of this verse must be
   understood to mean that the Jews had no hospitable intercourse with the
   Samaritans."--Milligan. Dr. Robinson says: "If of old the Jews had no
   dealings with the Samaritans, the latter at the present day reciprocate
   the feeling, and neither eat, nor drink, nor marry with the Jews, but
   only trade with them." (Joh 4:10)

   10. If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee,
   Give me to drink. The gift of God is not water, nor even peace of soul,
   but Christ himself, God's "unspeakable gift." "God gave his only
   begotten Son." She neither knew of God's unspeakable gift, nor that the
   Son given was at that moment speaking to her. Had she known, the Savior
   declares: Thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee
   living water. Observe: 1. That Christ asks a favor in order to confer a
   greater one; makes a request in order to open up a conversation that
   will give access to a heart. 2. The well and the water suggest the
   thirst of the soul and the waters of life. With him natural objects,
   the sparrows, the lilies, the storm, the harvest, the water, the sower,
   the seed, etc., were constantly made texts for teaching spiritual
   truth. Living water meant, literally, "running" water, the water from a
   fountain or stream. It is known from the term used for well in the
   Greek of verse 6 (pege) that it was a fountain fed by subterranean
   springs, not a deep cistern supplied with rainwater. The "living
   water," water that fails not while it quenches thirst, but flows right
   on perennially, is taken by the Savior as a symbol of himself, the one
   who quenches the thirst of the soul. Elsewhere he says: "The Spirit and
   the Bride say come; and let him that is athirst come and partake of the
   waters of life freely." (Joh 4:11)

   11. Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with . . . whence then hast thou
   that living water? She was deeply impressed by his manner and his
   words. This is shown by her calling him Sir (Kurie, Lord), but she
   fails to rise above the material meaning of his words. The well is a
   hundred feet deep; it, like the wells of the country usually, has no
   bucket; he has brought no vessel with him as, she has done; how then
   can he furnish her this water from the fountain? She cannot understand.
   (Joh 4:12)

   12. Art thou greater than our father Jacob? The question indicates
   still further her dawning conviction of the greatness of the stranger.
   It was from Joseph, the son of Jacob, that the Samaritans claimed
   descent. Jesus spoke of giving living water; Jacob, their great
   ancestor, had given this well; he, his flocks, his children and his
   servants had drunk of it; it was a sacred object of reverence; was
   Jesus greater than the giver of the well? Perhaps it was because the
   well was deemed holy that she had come there to obtain water. Often
   those least truly religious in life have most faith in relics. (Joh
   4:13)

   13. Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again. Her own
   experience would confirm his words. Nothing earthly satisfies long.
   Raiment, food, drink, all have to be supplied again. (Joh 4:14)

   14. Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never
   thirst. The water of which he speaks is a gift which he gives to
   humanity. It is not given to him but is his own gift. No prophet ever
   spoke thus, no man, only Jesus Christ. His language is always that of
   the Son of God. He says, "I am the life;" "Come to me ye that labor and
   are heavy laden and I will give you rest;" "I am the bread of life;"
   "He that believeth on me shall never thirst;" "If any man thirst let
   him come and drink * * * from him shall flow rivers of living water."
   Such words could not fall from human lips. "The water that I shall give
   him shall be in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."
   Springing up into everlasting life. The water that Christ bestows, the
   living water, the water of life, not only satisfied the longings of the
   soul, but is the real "elixir vitae," and quickens it into a new life
   that never ends. (Joh 4:15)

   15. Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not. The mysterious words of
   the Jewish stranger she cannot yet understand, but she is deeply
   stirred, and one thing seemed plain--if she could have this water she
   would thirst no more, and would not be compelled to come to the well.
   She is bewildered, but eager to comprehend the nature of the gift. The
   tenor of the whole narrative shows that she was neither flippant, nor
   sluggish. (Joh 4:16)

   16. Go, call thy husband, and come hither. The woman has asked for the
   water; before she can receive it she must be fully conscious of her
   need, of her soul's thirst, of her sinfulness and wretchedness. Hence
   Jesus makes a demand that will awake her to a sense of her condition.
   His abrupt words are designed to recall her past life. (Joh 4:17)

   17. I have no husband. The words have their designed effect. Probably
   with the deep blush and confusion of shame she admits that she has no
   husband. She has a man, but not a husband. The emphasis is on the word
   husband. (Joh 4:18)

   18. Thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy
   husband. The Lord accepts her statement as true in words, but reveals
   to her his knowledge of the real facts. She had been married five
   times; the easy divorce laws of the age, permitting a "divorce for any
   cause," would allow many changes without the death of either party.
   Some of her husbands may have died; a part were almost certainly
   divorced. Her sixth alliance did not even have the apology of such a
   marriage. It was illegal and condemned even by her unenlightened
   conscience as sinful. The Savior's words are like a probe, keen,
   severe, but gentle. (Joh 4:19)

   19. Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Every word that Jesus had
   uttered had excited her wonder more and more, and when he lifted the
   curtain off her life, she was convinced at once of his superhuman
   knowledge. She had heard of the ancient prophets; he must be one. (Joh
   4:20)

   20. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
   Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Partly to turn
   attention from her sinful life, and partly to have him settle a great
   controversy, she appeals to him to say where men ought to worship God.
   The Jews went up to Jerusalem to the temple. From the time of Jeroboam
   the Ten Tribes had worshiped elsewhere. When the Israelites returned
   from the Captivity and repulsed the Samaritans, Manasseh, the renegade
   priest, conducted this worship on Mt. Gerizim, the "Mount of Blessing."
   In the reign of Alexander the Great, according to Josephus, a temple
   was erected there. At a later period it was destroyed by John Hyrcanus,
   the Jewish prince, but still the altar was kept up, and the Samaritans
   made it their holy place. Note that the woman worshiped there because
   "our fathers" did. The "fathers" were wrong. Many now keep up infant
   sprinkling and other corruptions because their "fathers" practiced it.
   Fathers are no authority in such matters; only Christ and the word of
   God. (Joh 4:21)

   21. The hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor yet at
   Jerusalem. Now comes the announcement of one of the grandest truths
   revealed by Christ. The Jews said that men must worship at Jerusalem to
   worship acceptably; the Samaritans contended for Mt. Gerizim as the
   true holy place; the Mahometan insists on a pilgrimage to Mecca; the
   Catholic on praying at some holy shrine, but Christ says that the time
   even then was at hand when no holy place need be sought for worship. A
   little later God emphasized this lesson by the destruction of the
   temple at Jerusalem. In verse 23d the reason is given. (Joh 4:22)

   22. Salvation is of the Jews. In the controversy between the Jews and
   Samaritans, the former were right on the great issue. The Samaritans,
   worshiped, but knew not what they worshiped, because they rejected the
   prophets who would have directed them. In this the Jews had the
   advantage, and the salvation of the world was to come through the Jews,
   through Christ of the seed of David. "Ye" refers to the Samaritans;
   "we" to the Jews. (Joh 4:23)

   23. The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship
   the Father in spirit and truth. This verse is linked with verse 21st.
   The time is at hand, says the Lord, when a worship of forms, or at holy
   places, will not meet the demands of the Father. He must be worshiped
   with the heart, in spirit and in truth. Spiritual worship can be
   offered in any land, wherever the soul can humble itself before God.
   God is seeking for such true, spiritual worshipers. (Joh 4:24)

   24. God is a Spirit. Rather, "God is Spirit." This declaration is
   fundamental. 1. God is not material, according to the gross conception
   of the pagans. 2. He is not a material force, nor an abstract force as
   some scientists urge. 3. Nor is he a kind of blind, impersonal power,
   "that makes for righteousness," as Matthew Arnold urges. 4. He is
   Spirit, fills the universe, is omnipresent, and hence can be worshiped
   anywhere, because he is everywhere. Since he is Spirit, he must be
   worshiped in spirit. A material worship, a worship of forms, is not in
   harmony with his nature. The heart and spirit must be lifted up. (Joh
   4:25)

   25. I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ. Her heart had
   been made lighter with the great hope of the world. The words of Jesus
   carried her thoughts to that hope. He had told her much; the Messiah
   would tell her all things, and give light on every dark question. (Joh
   4:26)

   26. I that speak unto thee am he. This is the first recorded confession
   of Jesus that he was the Christ. His disciples learned to believe the
   truth, but until Peter's confession the last year of his ministry,
   there was no open admission. Perhaps we never can tell why he chose to
   make his first acknowledgment of his mission to a poor, wretched,
   Samaritan woman.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. Christ's followers should, like their Master, seize every
   opportunity to preach the gospel.

   2. Natural objects and passing events should always impart religious
   lessons.

   3. Earthly food cannot permanently satisfy any want. The soul's wants
   can never be satisfied on husks. Only the "living Bread" and the
   "living Water" will sate its hunger and thirst.

   4. One cannot partake of the "water of life" until he is athirst. He
   must be conscious of his sinfulness before he can be delivered from sin
   in Christ.

   5. The customs of "our fathers" should not make us content to follow in
   their footsteps without comparing their course with the New Testament.

   6. God is Spirit; everywhere we may meet him, and pray and worship;
   everywhere he sees us and takes note of our conduct.

   7. Outward, formal worship, counting beads, genuflections, waving
   incense, pilgrimages, etc., are not worship, but an insult to God. He
   is not matter. He demands that those who worship him shall lift up
   their spirits.

   8. Besides her individual character, there was also the circumstance
   that she was a Samaritan. It is the first time that Jesus comes into
   close, private, personal contact with one who is not of the seed of
   Israel; for though she claimed Jacob as her father, neither this woman,
   nor any of the tribe she belonged to, were of Jewish descent. "I am not
   come," said Jesus, afterwards defining the general boundaries of his
   personal ministry, "but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." When
   he sent out the Seventy, his instructions to them were: "Go not into
   the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans, enter ye
   not." And yet there were a few occasions, and this is the first of
   them, in which Christ broke through the restraints under which it
   pleased him ordinarily to act. I believe that there are just four
   instances of this kind recorded in the Savior's life: that of the woman
   of Samaria, of the Roman Centurion, of the Canaanitish woman, and of
   the Greeks who came up to Jerusalem. All these were instances of our
   Lord's dealings with those who stood without the pale of Judaism, and
   as we come upon them in the narrative, we shall be struck with the
   singular interest which Jesus took in each; the singular tact that he
   bestowed in testing and bringing out to view the simplicity and
   strength of the desire towards him, and faith in him, that were
   displayed; the fulness of the revelations of himself that he made, and
   of that satisfaction and delight with which he contemplated the issue.
   It was the great and good shepherd, stretching out his hand across the
   fence, and gathering in a lamb or two from the outfields, in token of
   the truth that there were other sheep which were out of the Jewish fold
   whom, also, he was in due time to bring in, so that there should be one
   fold and one shepherd.--Hanna.

   The interview with the Samaritan woman marks a great epoch in the
   development of religion. While the Jews had been forbidden to make any
   graven image to represent the Deity, and had been taught his
   omnipresence and spiritual being, like other races, it had been hard
   for them to rise to any just conception of the Almighty. Hence
   Jerusalem was the Holy City of their race where they expected the
   peculiar presence of Jehovah, and forgetting the spiritual meaning of
   the ordinances given to their nation, their worship had degenerated
   into outward and, often, frivolous forms. The Samaritans had still
   lower spiritual conceptions than the Jews, and clung to the idea that
   on Mt. Gerizim alone could true and acceptable sacrifice be offered to
   the Almighty, while the heathen faith was either godless or given to
   the most materialistic, sensual and debasing forms of idolatry. It also
   had its sacred shrines where the gods must be met, its Delphos, Dodona,
   and seat of Jupiter Ammon, and seemed to have even in its most cultured
   philosophers, only the most vague conception of an omnipresent deity.
   Hence, it was new and revolutionary when Christ proclaimed the dawn of
   a spiritual religion, the worship of the only true God, an omnipresent
   Spirit, not content with outward sacrifices, gorgeous forms, counting
   beads, making signs, or going on long pilgrimages to supposed holy
   places, but demanding the heart, the worship of an uplifted spirit, and
   present everywhere to hear the prayers and bless the worship of those
   who gathered in his name. Only such a religion could be adapted to the
   whole race, as well fitted to Europe, America, and the isles of the
   sea, as to western Asia. Hence, in the words to the woman of Samaria
   there lies imbedded the Gospel for all nations.
     __________________________________________________________________

Sowing and Reaping.

   The hearty reception given by the Samaritans to the Jewish teacher
   shows that their hearts were much more open to the reception of divine
   truths than the conceited and bigoted Jews. It seems strange, with such
   readiness to receive him on their part, that we do not hear more of our
   Lord's intercourse with the Samaritans. His heart, full of the love of
   man, not of a single race, seemed bursting to reach out and embrace all
   the lost children of Adam. He is the "Son of Man," not of David or
   Abraham; he "came to save the world," not the Jewish race alone; he is
   "the Lamb slain for the sins of the world." Yet, when he gives his
   apostles their first commission, he forbids them to go to the
   Samaritans and Gentiles. Why is this? Because he was "born of woman,
   made under the law." The law of Moses was yet in force. He kept it in
   all points blamelessly. It was still the law of God, but when the
   "handwriting of ordinances was nailed to the cross," then the "middle
   wall of partition was broken down," the "Old Covenant was taken away to
   give place to the new," and then, under the New Covenant, a covenant
   that embraced mankind instead of the children of Abraham, the Lord
   directed his disciples to preach the gospel "in Jerusalem, and Judea,
   and Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth." (Joh 4:27)

   27. Upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the
   woman. His disciples had left him alone at the well, while they went to
   the village of Sychar to buy food. As they return they see him in the
   clear air of that country and on the elevated site of the well on the
   mountain side, engaged in conversation with a woman. They probably
   approached near before the conversation ended, and paused and wondered
   that he would talk with a woman, and especially with a Samaritan woman.
   It was considered by the Jews indecorous to talk with a woman in
   public, and the Rabbis held that to talk with such an inferior creature
   was beneath the dignity of a doctor of the law. Their surprise well
   illustrates the state in which woman was held before Christ lifted her
   to the side of man as his equal and companion. Among the Greeks,
   Socrates, their best and wisest teacher, thanked the gods daily, that
   he was born neither a slave nor a woman; the Roman law gave the husband
   absolute authority over the wife, even to put her to death; among the
   Jews the wife could be divorced "for any cause," their most renowned
   doctor, Hillel, insisting that for her to burn the bread in baking was
   a sufficient reason. It is in the New Testament, first, that woman
   stands forth as the minister of Christ and the helper in the gospel.
   Christ's disciples had not yet been emancipated from their false
   teachings, and hence they were filled with surprise at the
   condescension of the Master. Yet such was their awe that none
   interrupted, or asked a reason for his departure from all that they had
   ever known. They soon learned better. (Joh 4:28)

   28. And the woman left her water-pot and went her way. Her soul was so
   stirred that she forgot the errand on which she came to the well. She
   had got a taste of the "living water," and forgot her need of the water
   of the well. The Savior had told her to call her husband. Her soul was
   so full of the strange, good news, that she wished to tell every one.
   What a touch of nature in her forgetting her water-pot in her
   excitement! Such little things prove the truth of the narrative. (Joh
   4:29)

   29. Come and see a man who told me all things I ever did. He had told
   her some things about her own life, and conscience had told her more.
   She felt that all was known to him, and naturally exaggerates by
   saying, "He told me all my life." Notice that as soon as she believes
   she seeks to spread the tidings. Notice, too, her unconscious skill.
   Instead of asserting, she asks them to come and see for themselves. She
   believed him to be the Christ, but she asks: Is not this the Christ?
   Chrysostom speaks of her zeal and wisdom: "She said not, Come, see the
   Christ, but, with the same condescension with which Christ had netted
   her, she draws men to him; Come, she saith, See a man who told me all I
   ever did. Is not this the Christ? She neither declared the fact
   plainly, nor was she silent She desired, not to bring them in by her
   own assertion, but to make them share her opinion by hearing him." Had
   she asserted they would hardly have believed her, but her modest manner
   arouses their curiosity and makes them eager to see and hear. There is
   a good example here for all Christian workers. (Joh 4:30)

   30. And then went they out of the city. Her success was immediate.
   Their curiosity was aroused and they were eager to hear. It is evident,
   by the effect of her words, that they were not a skeptical people, but
   were waiting for the Christ. (Joh 4:31)

   31. His disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. While the woman was
   gone, spreading the tidings, this episode occurs with the disciples.
   They had returned with food, which they now pressed upon the Master
   whom they had left wearied and hungry. To their surprise, although it
   was now past the noon hour, he hesitated to touch the food. (Joh 4:32)

   32. I have meat to eat ye know not of. "Man shall not live by bread
   alone." The Lord who could go forty days in the wilderness without
   food, in the exaltation of soul caused by his baptism and the descent
   of the Holy Spirit, would forget the hunger of the body also, when he
   was pouring out the water of life to a poor, thirsty soul. He had been
   lifted above hunger by the eagerness of his spirit in his holy work.
   This forgetfulness of the needs of the body at such an hour was not
   surprising or supernatural. It constantly occurs to those whose spirits
   are deeply stirred. (Joh 4:33)

   33. Hath any man brought him ought to eat? Their ideas were still as
   gross as those of the Samaritan woman, who at first could not
   comprehend the "living water." They cannot think of spiritual food,
   heavenly manna, bread of life. Yet, long before, the prophet had spoke
   of this food and had said, "Ye that have no money, come, buy bread, and
   eat." They fancy, therefore, that he has received food, and wonder who
   has brought it. (Joh 4:34)

   34. My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his
   work. It must be borne in mind that "meat" in the Scripture, means not
   only flesh, but any kind of food. The Savior then declares, in
   explanation of the perplexity, to his disciples, that to do the will of
   God is food to him; that is, discharges the same offices as food. 1. It
   was an enjoyment; 2. He longed for it, as the hungry long for food; 3.
   It refreshed and strengthened him. This is always true of doing the
   will of God. The character of his service is such that the faithful (1)
   Delight in it; (2) Are made better and stronger by it, all the time.
   His work does not weary, but refreshes the soul.

   Some have insisted that Christ says: "My meat is in order to do his
   will, etc." or that his soul is fed that he may do it. Though the
   original may be thus translated it does not harmonize with verse 32. He
   is explaining what the meat is that has taken away his hunger, not what
   it is for. The whole passage is one of many similar sayings. See Matt.
   4:4; John 5:30; 6:38; 15:10, etc. (Joh 4:35)

   35. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
   Harvest began about the middle of April in Palestine. The time when the
   Savior spoke would then be about the middle of December. This would
   indicate that he had passed eight months in Judea, as he had come from
   Galilee to attend the passover. Of this period of his ministry but
   little is recorded, save the incidents of the passover, the
   conversation with Nicodemus, and the fact that Christ preached and
   baptized (through his disciples) more converts than John. Now the idea
   of the harvest suggests, as the water and the food had done, another
   spiritual lesson. From their elevated position on the mountain side the
   road to Sychar is visible, filled with the throngs who are flocking to
   "see and hear" the Stranger of whom the woman has told. He points to
   them and says: "Lift up your eyes and look on the (spiritual) fields.
   They are already white for the harvest." The words, "Lift up your
   eyes," show clearly that he pointed to what was visible, the fields
   with a harvest of men ready to be gathered. (Joh 4:36)

   36. He that reapeth receiveth wages. The figure is kept up. The reaper
   in the harvest fields receives wages, and so shall those who reap the
   harvest of souls; not earthly pay in money, or fame, or position, but
   the happiness of doing the noblest work, and beyond, the crown of life
   shining with stars. "They that turn many to righteousness shall shine
   as stars forever and ever. In the reaping there is joy on earth and, on
   high, the joy of bringing sheaves to the Lord. Gathereth fruit. Souls,
   that are gathered as sheaves, into the eternal gainer. There, the saved
   souls and the reaper who gathered them "rejoice together." (Joh 4:37)

   37. One soweth, and another reapeth. This was a common proverb, growing
   out of constant human experience, true of worldly and spiritual things.
   How often has the patient pastor sowed, and then the evangelist has
   reaped in a meeting the results! (Joh 4:38)

   38. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor. The verb
   "sent" is past, and refers to some event before the present incident.
   It can only be explained by referring it to the events of the last
   eight months. The disciples had baptized multitudes, "more than John"
   (chapter 4:1); so many that John's disciples reported "all men come
   unto him" (chapter 3:26). The disciples of Christ who baptized all of
   these (chapter 4:2), were reaping the fruit of John's sowing, to a
   great extent, supplemented by the labors of Christ. John had sown; they
   were reaping. Other men labored. John and other holy men, but the
   disciples had entered in upon their labors. So, too, Christ sowed, and
   at Pentecost, in Judea, and in Samaria, they afterwards entered into
   his labors. See the reaping of what he had sowed in Samaria, at this
   time, in Acts 8:5-8. (Joh 4:39)

   39. And many of the Samaritans believed on him for the saying of the
   woman. She had borne witness, wisely, gladly, as best she could, and
   though a very humble creature, she had not preached Christ in vain.
   (Joh 4:40)

   40. So when the Samaritan were come. Because already faith was sprung
   up in their hearts, they insisted that he should tarry with them. A
   strange invitation for a Samaritan village to give to a Jew. It was
   also a strange thing for a Jewish teacher to accept the invitation.
   (Joh 4:41)

   41. Many more believed because of his own word. They saw and heard for
   themselves. He worked no miracles, but he poured the waters of life
   with the result that they recognized in him a divine teacher. He
   wrought miracles at Jerusalem, but how different the course of the
   self-righteous Pharisees! (Joh 4:42)

   42. Know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world. The
   Samaritan hearts were good soil, ready for the word, open and honest,
   and hence there was a wonderful result. To the woman Jesus had said,
   that he was the Christ. Now by his teachings, many months before
   Peter's confession, the Samaritans pronounce him the Christ, the
   Savior, not of Jews only, or Jews and Samaritans, but of the world. It
   indicates a wonderful freedom from the narrow prejudices of their times
   that they should proclaim him as the world's Savior.

Practical Observations.

   1. God's work does not fatigue and weaken. It refreshes and
   strengthens. It is meat for the soul. It is the idlers in the vineyard
   who are sickly. It is the workers who are fresh, vigorous, and full of
   rejoicing.

   2. Harvest is a season of rejoicing. Pentecost, when the first fruits
   were waved, was a festival of joy. The "Harvest Home" has been an era
   of gladness in every land. What a time of heavenly rejoicing when the
   reapers in life's harvest and their sheaves stand together in the
   presence of the Lord, and rejoice together!

   3. The fields are now white for the harvest; the harvest is plenteous,
   but the laborers are few. Pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest,
   that he may send laborers into his harvest.

   4. Though wearied, he does not neglect the occasion and opportunity
   offered to him. He commences the conversation by a natural request. He
   opens the woman's heart by requesting from her a favor. He passes, by a
   natural transition from the physical to the spiritual world, from
   nature to the truth of which nature testifies.--Abbott.

   5. Had you but stood by Jacob's well and seen the look of Jesus, and
   listened to the tones of his voice, or, had you been in Sychar during
   those two bright and happy days, hearing the instruction, so freely
   given, and so gratefully received, you would have had the evidence of
   sense to tell you with what abounding joy to all who are waiting and
   who are willing, Jesus breaks the bread and pours out the water of
   everlasting life. Multiplied a thousand fold is the evidence to the
   same effect now offered to the eye and ear of faith. Still, from the
   lips of the Savior of the world, over all the world the words are
   sounding forth: "If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink."
   Still, the manner of his dispensation of the great gift, stands
   embodied in the words: "Thou wouldst have asked, and I would have given
   thee living water." And still the other voices are heard catching up
   and re-echoing our Lord's own gracious invitation: "And the Spirit and
   the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him
   that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of
   life freely."--Hanna.

   6. In the temple, between the court of the Gentiles and the next inner
   court, was a marble screen or curiously carved fence, some two feet
   high, beyond which no Gentile could venture. Had a Samaritan put his
   foot inside of that "wall of partition," he would have been whirled
   away in a fury of rage and stoned to death in the twinkling of an eye.
   But Jesus was treading down that partition wall. This visit in Samaria
   is of singular importance, at the opening of Christ's ministry, in two
   respects: First, as a deliberate repudiation and rebuke of the
   exclusiveness of the Jewish church; and secondly, and even more
   significantly, as to the humane manner of his treatment of a sinning
   woman. It was the text from which flowed two distinguishing elements of
   his ministry--sympathy with mankind, and the tenderest compassion for
   those who have sinned and stumbled.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Nobleman's Son.

   This lesson, though it follows the last without a break in John's
   Gospel, is thought to be separated in time by a short interval from the
   last. It will be noted that Jesus, on leaving Samaria, does not return
   to his old home at Nazareth, the home of his mother and brethren, but
   goes to Cana, where he made the water wine, the home of Nathanael or
   Bartholomew, one of his disciples. It is well known that John did not
   aim to give a full history of the words and deeds of Jesus (John
   21:25), but rather to supply what had been omitted by Matthew, Mark and
   Luke. It is thought by many that the teaching in the synagogue of
   Nazareth, related in Luke 4:16-30, occurred at this time, immediately
   after his departure from Samaria. It certainly occurred early in his
   ministry, and it is probable that it was at this time. If this view is
   correct, Jesus passed a Sabbath, soon after his sojourn at Sychar, at
   his old home, and attended the synagogue where he had often worshiped;
   was handed the Scripture to read the lesson of the day, as a teacher of
   established fame; read from Isaiah and spoke words that were at first
   listened to with profound attention, but soon with disapproval; and
   when he rebuked sternly the implied demand that he should work a
   miracle for their gratification, they rose in an angry mob and
   endeavored to take his life. Passing from their midst, by the exercise
   of a power, either moral or supernatural, which he often exerted, he
   turned his back on Nazareth never to return. "For," says John, "Jesus
   himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country."
   Therefore he went into other parts of Galilee. This view is made more
   probable by the fact that in going from Sychar to Cana, Jesus would
   pass either through, or very near to Nazareth, it lying almost directly
   between the two former places. See also Matt. 13:57; Mark 6:4, and Luke
   4:24, in each of which passages the same statement is made as in verse
   44 by John, and in each case refers to the rejection of Christ by the
   people of Nazareth.

   The return of Jesus brings him once more in that part of Palestine in
   which his youth was passed and where, until the last year of his
   ministry, he did most of his teachings and wrought most of his
   miracles. Though Nazareth might be filled with narrow prejudice against
   the exalted claims of the boy who had grown up in the humble
   carpenter's family, whom it had seen so often playing on its hills, or
   had beheld in his manhood working at the bench, and who, it knew, had
   never attended any of the great schools of Jewish theology, yet the
   Galileans, as a body, were far more disposed to listen with favor to
   his teachings than the proud Jews of the national capital. Though
   Galilee was not free from its conflicts, yet it furnished Christ all
   the apostles but one, and that one proved a traitor, and we find
   evidence that his teachings exerted a profound effect on the Galilean
   mind in the fact that, after his resurrection, "five hundred brethren
   at once" were permitted to behold the risen Lord in Galilee. The
   Galileans, remote from the influence of the temple, and brought into
   closer contact with Gentile influences, were less prejudiced and
   narrow, more simple in their faith, and of more open hearts than the
   Jerusalem Jews. It was among this teachable people that the Savior
   seemed to love to linger; there was Capernaum "his own city," there he
   fed the five thousand who attended his ministry on two different
   occasions, there the transfiguration occurred, there the enthusiastic
   multitudes sought to make him a king by force, and when on the last
   Sunday of his earthly ministry he made his entry as a king into
   Jerusalem, the multitude who surrounded him were mostly Galileans. (Joh
   4:43)

   43. After two days he departed thence and went into Galilee. Two days
   were spent delightfully in sowing the seed of the kingdom in the "good
   ground" of the Samaritan hearts. Then he went on to Galilee, for which
   he had started, and which he had left about eight months before. Luke
   4:14, 15, which probably refers to this time, makes it probable that he
   spent a short time teaching elsewhere before reaching Nazareth. (Joh
   4:44)

   44. For Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own
   country. The "for" explains why Jesus did not tarry at Nazareth, but
   went to other parts of Galilee and stopped at Capernaum. This statement
   of Jesus is recorded four times and in three of these certainly refers
   to the rejection of Jesus by his neighbors and kindred at Nazareth (see
   Matt. 13:57; Mark 6:4; Luke 4:24). This must be its meaning here, and
   is evidently based on the incident recorded in Luke 4:14-30. It
   declares a general truth. Judea persecuted Isaiah and Jeremiah; Israel,
   Elijah; Columbus had to go to a foreign land to got help to discover
   America. The interpretation of this passage, suggested by comparison
   with the parallel passages, that it explains his turning aside from
   Nazareth to sojourn elsewhere, is so easy and natural that it is a
   surprise to the writer that so many commentators reject it for
   far-fetched and complicated explanations. (Joh 4:45)

   45. When he was come into Galilee the Galileans received him. He had
   honor abroad in Galilee, though rejected at his own home. The ready
   reception of the Galileans is explained in the statement that they had
   seen all that he had done at the feast, his cleansing of the temple,
   and his miracles. John explains, for the benefit of Gentile readers,
   that "the Galileans also attended the feast," as was customary with all
   devout Israelites. The hearty reception of the Galileans is in striking
   contrast with the opposition of the priests, Levites and rulers of
   Jerusalem. This helps us to understand why Jesus spent so large a
   portion of his ministry in Galilee and selected Galileans for his
   apostles. (Joh 4:46)

   46. So Jesus came again to Cana, where he had made the water wine. It
   was the home of Nathanael, who, there is reason to believe, had
   followed him in his journey to Judea, and some think that it was now
   the home of Mary, but this is mere conjecture. And there was a certain
   nobleman, whose son was sick. The Greek word translated "nobleman" is
   Basileukos, from Basileus, a king, and implies one connected in some
   way with royalty. "Origen thinks he may have been one of CÃ¦sar's
   household, having business in Judea at this time. But the usage of
   Josephus is the safest guide. He uses the word Basileukos to
   distinguish the soldiers, or courtiers, or officers of the kings (Herod
   and others), but never to designate the royal family. He may have been
   Chuza, Herod's steward (Luke 8:3), but this is pure conjecture. This
   man seems to have been a Jew.--"Alford. He was probably a king's
   officer of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, and was stationed at
   Capernaum. Capernaum. The site of this city, so interesting as the
   "Lord's own city," his earthly home for two years of his ministry, is
   certainly known. That of Cana is in dispute, but it was probably
   distant twenty or twenty-five miles from the former. Cana was in the
   hill country; Capernaum, "down" on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.
   Hence Jesus is besought to "come down." (Joh 4:47)

   47. When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea. Either he had been
   to Jerusalem to the feast, or he had heard of the deeds of Jesus from
   others. The fact that he comes, as soon as he heard of the return of
   the Lord, shows that he was already regarded as a prophet in Galilee.
   Note that: 1. The nobleman has already "faith as a grain of mustard
   seed" in Jesus; 2. That faith moves him to seek the aid of Jesus; 3. To
   make sure of his help he comes in person, instead of sending servants;
   4. While he thought he could heal his son, he did not comprehend that
   it could be done unless Jesus came to where he was; 5. He thought it
   would be too late if the son died before his coming. His faith was very
   imperfect. (Joh 4:48)

   48. Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. Jesus had
   just come from Sychar where, without a miracle, but because his words
   and character met the needs of their souls, the people believed on him
   and declared him "the Christ, the Savior of the world." The nobleman,
   in his sore distress, has some faith, caused only by the fame of the
   "signs and wonders" wrought. His faith is still imperfect, far below
   the holy trust of the Samaritans. He is the type of a class whose
   belief depended on outward signs, while a higher, nobler faith, is that
   which recognizes in Jesus the Bread of life, that satisfies the hunger
   of the soul. A "sign" was a miracle wrought as a proof; the term
   "wonder" does not demand such a motive for the miracle. (Joh 4:49)

   49. Sir, come down ere my child die. Fearing, by the Savior's reply,
   that he did not intend to grant his request, he makes an impassioned
   appeal. "Not a moment was to be lost. Soon it would be too late. Come
   down, at once, before the child is dead." Christ is educating his
   faith. It is made more complete by the next utterance. (Joh 4:50)

   50. Go thy way; thy son liveth. These words were spoken like the Son of
   God. There was no hesitation; no doubt; the fact is as firm as the
   hills of Cana. The manner of the Lord at once carried conviction to the
   heart of the sorrowing father. The man believed. At the time of his
   coming he had a partial belief that Jesus was a prophet; now he
   believes upon him; believes his word; believes that at the moment he
   said, "Thy son liveth," his disease was arrested. He did not comprehend
   the Savior's mission and character, but he now had such faith in him
   that he was ready to accept all his words. (Joh 4:51)

   51. And as he was going down. He did not hurry back. He might have
   reached Capernaum the same evening, as the Savior had dismissed him at
   one o'clock, but his anxiety was gone. It was on the next morning that
   his servants met him with the good news that his son was well. (Joh
   4:52)

   52. Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him. At the exact
   hour that Jesus had spoken the fever disappeared. The seventh hour is
   one o'clock. (Joh 4:53)

   53. Himself believed, and his whole house. Henceforth this household
   was among the believers. It is a natural and pardonable curiosity that
   leads us to seek their further history. He was an officer of Herod, and
   the fact that "Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward," was one who
   ministered to him in his Galilean ministry, has suggested that he may
   have been the nobleman. Acts 13:1, names Manaen, "who had been brought
   up with Herod the tetrarch," as a prominent Christian of Antioch. He
   may have been the man whose son was healed. (Joh 4:54)

   54. This is again the second miracle. The word is "sign" in the Greek.
   He had wrought other miracles in Judea, but this was the second wrought
   in Galilee. The seat of the first was Cana; the Lord was at Cana when
   he wrought the second, but the subject of it was at Capernaum.

Practical Observations.

   1. Christ is the Great Physician; the healer of the sickness of our
   souls.

   2. He hears our prayers on his heavenly throne and from thence can say
   when we pray that our children may drink of the "living water," "Thy
   son liveth."

   3. "Blessed are they who, not having seen, have believed," because they
   have found in Christ Him who meets every want of the soul.

   4. How often those who have the best spiritual opportunities are
   slowest to appreciate them. R. G. Ingersoll was the son of a preacher.
   We have known many other preacher's sons who were wicked blasphemers.
   The people of Nazareth rejected Christ. 'He came to his own and his own
   received him not.' "Many shall come from the east and the west (from
   afar off), and sit down with Abraham, and Isaac and Jacob in the
   kingdom of heaven; but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out."

Jesus at Bethesda.

   Thus far in his history of Christ John has followed the chronological
   order closely, and there is little difficulty in assigning the
   approximate date of each event. While he aims to select those events
   that illustrate his great aim, and often to supply what the other
   writers have omitted, rather than to give a full history, yet we can
   locate each occurrence in its proper connection until we come to the
   miracle at the pool of Bethesda. It occurred at "a feast of the Jews,"
   on the occasion of the second visit of the Lord to Jerusalem after he
   began his ministry. It was after the occurrence at the well of Jacob,
   or the latter part of the fall, and before the feeding of the five
   thousand, which was about the first of April. This fact has made most
   commentators think that the feast attended was that of Purim, in early
   March. I do not harmonize with this view because, 1. The rigor of the
   season would have prevented the sick lying on couches exposed in the
   open air (5:3); 2. The short interval of three weeks to the passover
   makes it improbable that he would leave Jerusalem for a journey to
   Galilee; and, 3. The feast of Purim was not one ordained by the Jewish
   law, but an observance based on human tradition. The whole spirit of
   the Savior's teaching was opposed to such observances, and in the
   absence of testimony, I cannot believe that he ever came to Jerusalem
   to attend a feast of this kind.

   There is far greater probability that the passover named in John 6:4,
   was a year later and that a whole year of the Lord's ministry had
   intervened in the interval. This is the view of IrenÃ¦us, Eusebius,
   Lightfoot, Neander, Greswell, and of Andrews. According to their view,
   Christ went to Galilee in December and returned in the spring to
   Jerusalem to attend his second passover. The passover was, of all
   Jewish festivals, that in which Christ showed the greatest interest. He
   attended one at twelve years of age, another when he drove out the
   money changers, and probably the third, at this time, just one year
   later, on his second visit to Judea. John names two more passovers
   after this that the Savior attended, making, with this, four after his
   ministry began, and five including the one when he was twelve years of
   age. This much is certain, that it was our Lord's second visit to
   Jerusalem after his baptism, and that it occurred about a year after
   his first visit, as he had spent eight months in Judea, and a
   considerable time in Galilee, before his return.

   The location of the pool of Bethesda cannot be certainly determined.
   There were various pools around Jerusalem which were used for bathing,
   and more than one now fed by intermittent springs which agitate the
   water at intervals. The portion beginning with "waiting for the moving
   of the water" in the third verse and including the fourth verse, is
   omitted by the Revised Version, is not found in the best manuscripts,
   and is evidently an interpolation by some monkish scribbler who wanted
   to explain his ideas of how the water was moved.

   This passage in the life of Christ, apart from other interest, is
   deeply significant as the first conflict between Jesus and the
   authorities at Jerusalem. At his visit one year before they had
   questioned his proceedings. The miracle at the pool of Bethesda causes
   them to seek to kill him (John 5:18). (Joh 5:1)

   1. There was a feast of the Jews. John did not think it important to
   indicate what feast this was and we cannot certainly tell. It is
   remarkable that John in this case alone of all his allusions to Jewish
   feasts should have failed to give its name. Dr. William Milligan, in
   the International Lesson Commentary, suggests the following explanation
   of this omission: "Why did John, whose custom it is to mark clearly
   each festival of which he speaks (see 2:13, 23; 6:4; 7:2; 10:22; 11:55;
   12:1; 13:1; 18:39; 19:14), write so indefinitely here? The only reply
   that it is possible is that the indefiniteness is the result of design.
   The Evangelist omits the name of the feast, that the reader may not
   attach to it a significance that was not intended. To John,--through
   clearness of insight, not from power of fancy,--every action of his
   Master was fraught with deep significance; and no one who receives the
   Lord Jesus as he received him can hesitate to admit in all his words
   and deeds a fulness of meaning, a perfection of fitness, immeasurably
   beyond what can be attributed to the highest of human prophets. Our
   Lord's relation to the whole Jewish economy is never absent from John's
   thought. Jesus enters the Jewish temple (chapter 2:4). His words can be
   understood only by those who recognize that he is himself the true
   temple of God. The ordained feasts of the nation find their fulfillment
   in him. Never, we may say, is any festival named in this Gospel in
   connection with our Lord, without an intention on the author's part
   that we should see the truth which he saw, and behold in it a type of
   his Master or his work. If this be true, the indefiniteness of the
   language here is designed to prevent our resting upon the thought of
   this particular festival as fulfilled in Jesus, and lead to the
   concentration of our thought on the Sabbath shortly to be mentioned,
   which in this chapter has an importance altogether exceptional." Two
   things ought to be added: 1. That the whole conflict that follows is
   about the Sabbath; 2. The feast of Purim, could not be celebrated on
   the Sabbath. (Joh 5:2)

   2. There is at Jerusalem . . . a pool. It has been held that this
   language proves that John wrote before Jerusalem was destroyed. It only
   proves that he knew of the existence of such a pool and as far as he
   knew it still existed. Even if the city was destroyed the pools would
   mostly survive, and many exist to this day. (Joh 5:3) (Joh 5:4)

   3, 4. In these lay a great multitude. All that follows "waiting" to the
   beginning of the 5th verse is wanting in the ancient manuscripts and is
   an interpolation. The efficacy of the pool might have been due to
   mineral elements, or even to effect on the imagination. (Joh 5:5)

   5. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight
   years. In the porches around this pool a great number of afflicted
   persons were gathered on account of a belief that the waters had a
   miraculous virtue. The Scripture does not say (leaving out the
   interpolation) whether they had or not, but the multitude thought so.
   One was, probably, a paralytic who had been diseased thirty-eight years
   and had now been long waiting at the pool. (Joh 5:6)

   6. Wilt thou be made whole? On the Sabbath day, while Jesus was
   attending the feast, he walked out to the pool of Bethesda, and seeing
   this poor sufferer and knowing that he had long been there without
   relief, he asked him the above question. He certainly knew that the man
   would like to be healed, but he asked the question to secure the man's
   attention. In almost every miracle he requires attention and an act of
   the will on the part of the subject. So in healing of sin, the will of
   the sinner must be reached and act, in order that he may be saved.
   "Almost every miracle is a parable of redemption." (Joh 5:7)

   7. I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool.
   His attention was excited, but his only thought was of being healed by
   the pool. He explains that he has no man to put him into the pool, and
   his movements are so slow on account of his infirmity that some one
   else always anticipates him. His answer reveals the ideas that
   prevailed. The water was agitated at intervals, probably by an
   intermittent spring, and they supposed that the first one to enter
   after would receive the benefit. Only one could be healed at a time. No
   doubt many were, even without a miracle. In nervous diseases faith is
   the great healing power. (Joh 5:8)

   8. Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. Then came the command to rise and
   walk. When the Lord commanded there was always prompt obedience. He
   spoke not as man, but as the Son of God. He healed not by some other
   power, as did prophets and apostles, but by his own. His commands are
   always imperative, whether to the winds, the waves, the dead, the sick
   and infirm, and are always followed by immediate obedience. The powers
   of nature recognize it as the same voice that said, "Let there be
   light, and there was light." Note, however, that while Christ speaks
   with divine authority, the act of obedience is required. The man must
   rise, take up his bed, and walk. The bed was either a mattress which
   served as a couch by night and a seat by day, or a low bedstead. He was
   commanded to take it in order to emphatically show that he was a
   perfectly cured man. (Joh 5:9)

   9. Immediately the man was made whole. Nature always recognized Jesus
   at once as her King. There was no slow process of healing, but the cure
   was immediate. Lazarus came forth at once; the lame walked at his
   voice. This man at once heard the command, was whole, took up his bed
   and walked. The result seems like an echo of the command. Observe the
   process: 1. Christ addresses the man; 2. He commands; 3. The man obeys.
   It is the obedience of faith. 4. In the act of obedience he is healed.
   Christ is the healer, but he is healed by the obedience of faith. (Joh
   5:10)

   10. The Jews, therefore, said unto him. "Therefore," points to the fact
   that he was carrying his bed on the Sabbath day. The term, "the Jews,"
   does not refer to the people, but to the authorities. John always uses
   it to signify, not the multitude, but the rulers. The man was
   officially stopped and questioned. The bearing of burdens on the
   Sabbath was forbidden, not only by Jewish tradition, but by the law.
   See Exodus 31:13; Jeremiah 17:21 and Nehemiah 13:15-19. The Pharisees,
   however, had carried the matter to extremes never designed. Their
   doctors had gravely decided that "on the Sabbath a nailed shoe could
   not be worn; it was a burden; but an unnailed shoe could be worn; that
   a person could go with two shoes on, but not with only one; and that
   one man could carry a loaf of bread, but that two men could not carry
   it between them." The spirit of love, rest, worship and peace in the
   original Sabbath had given way to the iron bondage of formality. It was
   needful for one who was "Lord of the Sabbath" to teach them that "the
   Sabbath was made for man." These rigid martinets who delighted in
   frivolous minutiÃ¦ and forgot the spirit of the law, at once interrupted
   the man who was healed and accused him of breaking the law. (Joh 5:11)

   11. He that made me whole said unto me. The defence of the man is that
   he was ordered to do it. He knew not who had healed him. Christ had
   suddenly appeared, spoken the words of healing and then disappeared in
   the crowd. He had never seen the Lord before, and he was little known
   at Jerusalem, only having visited the city once before, since he began
   his ministry. (Joh 5:12)

   12. What man is it that said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? This
   question betrays the narrow bigotry of these officials. They do not
   ask, "Who healed thee?" but confine themselves to the charge of Sabbath
   breaking. They care nothing that the man is healed, and would far
   rather that he was lying on his couch, sick, and unable to move, than
   that he should carry it on the Sabbath. (Joh 5:13)

   13. For Jesus had conveyed himself away. It is explained why the man
   did not know who healed him. As soon as Jesus spoke the words he
   disappeared in the multitude, none of whom probably knew him. In the
   later portion of his ministry crowds attended his footsteps and the
   whole land rang with his words and deeds, but at this stage he was
   comparatively unknown in Jerusalem. Christ never worked his miracles
   for popular applause or seemed to seek observation. The man had faith
   in him who commanded him to rise and walk, but had no idea who he was.
   (Joh 5:14)

   14. Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple. The man probably went
   there, moved with gratitude, to give thanks for the great mercy he had
   received. Still the temple was the great place of public resort in
   Jerusalem of all classes; great crowds gathered there, and he may only
   have wished to see and mingle again among his fellows, and to visit
   scenes from which he had long been excluded. Sin no more, lest a worse
   thing come unto thee. His own sins, thirty-eight years before, had
   brought on his infirmity. What was their nature we are not informed,
   but we know that often our fleshly ills can thus be accounted for. The
   words of Jesus show to the man that he knew his whole life, and brought
   up a flood of memories. His sins when he was young had ruined his
   health; now he is well, but is warned to beware lest a worse thing come
   upon him. (Joh 5:15)

   15. The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus. The second
   time he saw him he learned that it was Jesus. The authorities had
   demanded to know who it was that told him to "carry his bed;" in
   obedience to the demand when he had learned he told "who had made him
   whole." He had probably been charged to carry word and did so to
   exculpate himself. The Jews thought of the violation of the Sabbath; he
   thought of being made whole. (Joh 5:16)

   16. The Jews persecute Jesus. The word is literally rendered "pursued
   Jesus." At once they hunted him and attacked him. They did not at first
   "seek to slay him." This is omitted by the Revision and does not appear
   in the old manuscripts. But the officials now come to Jesus to learn
   why he has done this act. It is the second time they have met him face
   to face; the first time after he had cleansed the temple (John 2:14);
   then he had claimed authority over the temple as his Father's house.
   Now he has laid his hand on the Sabbath day and claims to be its Lord.
   He had wrought the miracle on the Sabbath; commanded the man to take
   away his couch on the Sabbath; and in the wonderful address that he
   makes "to the Jews" justifies his course by the example of God, and
   makes "himself equal with God." (Joh 5:17)

   17. My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. The answer of Jesus to his
   accusers goes to the very root of the matter. The basis on which the
   Sabbath rested was that God had ceased his creative labors on the
   seventh day. Jesus shows that God's rest was not idleness. His
   government, providence, and direction of nature were not suspended on
   the seventh day, or ever since creation. The Father had continued his
   works of love and mercy. He worked in these works right on till Jesus
   came; "now," says the Son, "I work as my Father works. There is no
   suspension on the Sabbath of works of benevolence and mercy." The
   Father's example is the pattern given to direct man. By this example
   the work of love is never a violation of the true Sabbath law.
   Comparing with Matt. 12:8 and Mark 2:27, we deduce as the Savior's
   teaching: 1. The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath; above it; can
   modify or change it at his will. 2. It was made for man; for all men;
   for the poor, the bond as well as the free. What helps man is lawful on
   the Sabbath. 3. The Father's example is the true rule. He worked right
   on, but with a change of work. Work, like his, to help and bless
   humanity, is proper. It is rest that should be activity; a change from
   secular toil for our own interests, to work for the benefit of man.
   There is rest by a change of work to a higher kind of activity. (Joh
   5:18)

   18. Because he not only had broken the Sabbath. The Pharisees were
   horrified, not only at what they deemed the breaking of the Sabbath,
   but at the high ground on which the Lord placed his defence. They could
   not understand how the Sabbath could be kept without placing the soul
   under bondage to outward forms. Jesus broke these bonds and gave the
   soul liberty, pointing out the essential spirit of the law, which
   consisted in following the divine pattern. The Pharisee would have kept
   this poor man on his bed all day watching it to keep it from being
   stolen; Christ bids him to take it to its proper place that he may
   appear in the temple and worship. The Pharisee would have placed him
   under a bondage that would have made the day one of secular anxiety;
   Christ frees him and allows him to keep the day in the worship of God.
   But said also that God was his Father. This high claim seemed to them
   blasphemous. They understood his language to mean that he was
   personally God's own Son, therefore of Divine nature, and equal with
   God. They understood him aright, but such a claim seemed to them
   astounding and blasphemous. They regarded him only as a man, however
   wonderful, and for a man to claim that he was Divine! Hence "they
   sought the more to kill him." They did not undertake to carry out his
   death at once, for that was not possible save by outright murder, but
   to prepare the way for his condemnation. Over two years later it was on
   this very charge that he was condemned. When all other charges failed
   the high priest asked him if he was the Son of God, and when he
   affirmed, he cried, "He blasphemes," and the Sanhedrim voted," He is
   worthy of death."

Practical Observations.

   1. Like our Savior we should seek out objects who need our help. There
   are the needy all around us. We cannot excuse ourselves because we do
   not see them. We should hunt them up.

   2. Christ is the great Healer. He can heal us of the diseases that
   paralyze our souls. In order that he may heal us we must (1) Listen to
   him; (2) Believe in his words; (3) Obey him. Whatever he bids us do
   must be done.

   3. Sin is pregnant with evil. Our calamities are almost all born of our
   own sins. Those who live debauched lives destroy their bodies. Most of
   those who live in constant bodily affliction can trace the origin of
   the trouble to their own acts. Sin will curse in this life and curse in
   the life to come. Jesus will save from the eternal curse of their sins
   all who come to him.

   4. A law may be kept in the letter and yet violated in the spirit.
   Outward forms alone cannot serve God. A bondage to frivolous forms
   cannot enable us to keep the Lord's day right. There must be the free
   spirit that seeks in all things to glorify God and bless man.

   5. As Christ followed in the footsteps of the Father, so we must follow
   Christ. "It is lawful to do good" on the Lord's day. Works of mercy and
   love are pleasing in the sight of God. We may relieve suffering,
   journey to worship, or bear burdens that will free us from cares that
   keep us from divine worship. It is better to ride on the street cars in
   order to attend church, than to break the Savior's law by staying away.

   6. Why did Jesus choose the Sabbath day to walk in the porches of
   Bethesda? He chose that day, and he selected that man, and he laid on
   him the command he did, for the very purpose of bringing himself front
   to front with the Jewish rulers. To this miracle we are indebted for
   one of the most wonderful discourses of the Savior.

   7. According to rabbinical authorities it was forbidden to travel more
   than two thousand cubits on the Sabbath, to kill the most offensive
   kinds of vermin, to write two letters of the alphabet, to use a wooden
   leg or a crutch, to carry a purse, or for a woman to carry a seal-ring
   or a smelling-bottle, to wear a high head-dress or a false tooth. Among
   other restraints laid upon animals, the fat-tailed sheep was not
   allowed to use the little truck on which the tail was borne to save the
   animal from suffering. These are a portion of thirty-nine prohibitions
   of the same kind.--Canon Cook.

The Glory of the Son.

   19. Then answered Jesus. To their charge that he was guilty of
   blasphemy in making himself equal with God. In his answer he abates
   nothing from the high claims he has just made, but he meets their
   thoughts and purposes by a justification. The Son can do nothing of
   himself. He asserts his Sonship, but shows that the power of the Son
   comes from the Father. Perfect Sonship involves perfect identity of
   will and action, and hence, "Whatsoever the Father doeth, these also
   doeth the Son." (Joh 5:20)

   20. He will show him greater works than these. The miracle of healing
   that has just occurred shall be followed by greater works which, on
   account of the love of the Father, the Son will be permitted to do.
   (Joh 5:21)

   21. So the Son quickeneth whom he will. The Father is the fountain of
   life, and can restore life to the dead. The Son possesses the same
   power and will show it forth. (Joh 5:22)

   22. Hath committed all judgment to the Son. In the 20th, 21st and 22d
   verses are given three proofs of the exaltation of the Son, all
   introduced by "for." The Son is loved of the Father, shall quicken the
   dead, and shall judge the world. (Joh 5:23)

   23. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father. Because the
   Son speaks the words, does the works, and is the manifestation of the
   Father. (Joh 5:24)

   24. Hath everlasting life. The conditions of eternal life are (1)
   knowledge of the revelation of the Son; (2) a belief of it such as to
   cause its acceptance. (Joh 5:25)

   25. The dead shall hear the voice . . . and live. Primarily the
   reference is to those spiritually dead. They shall hear and the Son
   will give them eternal life. It was already true that these heard his
   words and were made alive. It shall also be true of those in the graves
   at the resurrection (verse 28). The power of Christ to give life was
   shown in Jerusalem a little later in the case of Lazarus. (Joh 5:26)
   (Joh 5:27)

   26, 27. Son of man. These verses affirm that God has not only given to
   the Son to have life in himself, or to be a fountain of life, but has
   also made him, the judge of mankind, because he is the Son of man, a
   judge who can share the nature of those called to judgment. (Joh 5:28)

   28. Marvel not at this. What marvel that the Son should give spiritual
   life to those dead in sins and sit as Judge, when even those in their
   graves shall come forth at his command? He who had power to rescue
   Lazarus from the grave, surely has the power to give life to the soul
   and to confer immortality. (Joh 5:29)

   29. And shall come forth. At the general resurrection all shall come
   forth from the tomb; those who have wrought good to life eternal; the
   evil doers to damnation. It is clear from this passage that there is a
   judgment beyond the grave. (Joh 5:30)

   30. As I hear, I judge. The judgment of the Son is based on a perfect
   knowledge of the will of the Father. It is the Father's will that moves
   him, his own will being merged in the will of the Father. (Joh 5:31)

   31. If I bear witness of myself. I is the emphatic word and is
   equivalent to "I only." He' cites other witnesses that these Jews ought
   to heed. (Joh 5:32)

   32. There is another that beareth witness of me. I believe the
   reference is to the Father, referred to again in verse 37. I think that
   verse 34 shows that he does not mean John. (Joh 5:33) (Joh 5:34) (Joh
   5:35)

   33, 34, 35. Ye sent unto John and he bare witness. See Chap. 1:19. John
   had borne positive testimony and the Jews, in great part, believed him
   to be a prophet of God. Jesus did not receive human testimony, but
   referred them to John's witness that "they might be saved." (Joh 5:36)

   36. I have greater witness. His works. Christ's life and deeds were a
   proof that the Jews could not answer. See Chap. 3:2. (Joh 5:37)

   37. And the Father himself . . . hath borne witness. God hath borne
   witness in the prophecies that were so wonderfully fulfilled in Christ,
   he also bore witness in the power he gave to Christ, and he bore
   witness by his voice at his baptism, and after this date, at the
   transfiguration, though these Jews had neither seen nor heard. (Joh
   5:38)

   38. Ye have not his word abiding in you. The proof of it was that they
   did not believe the one whom God had sent, though the word bore
   continual witness to him. (Joh 5:39)

   39. Search the Scriptures. Or rather, "ye search the Scriptures" for
   eternal life. Yet those Scriptures were full of the testimony of
   Christ. Of him had all the prophets borne witness. He of whom the
   Scriptures spoke was the Life, yet they refused to come to him that
   they (Joh 5:40)

   40. Might have life. They turned away from the life that was in their
   own Scriptures. The word search implies painstaking, exhaustive
   examination. (Joh 5:41)

   41. I receive not honor from men. This seems to connect itself with a
   thought which he detected in their hearts that he had rebuked them from
   disappointment. (Joh 5:42) (Joh 5:43)

   42, 43. I know you. He read their hearts. The love of God. Love of God
   is always manifest in obedience to his will. The rejection of Christ,
   who came in the Father's name, was proof that they were without the
   love of God. They rejected the Christ of God, but would readily follow
   a human deceiver. This was verified in their history. (Joh 5:44)

   44. How can ye believe? They sought human glory and elevation, and
   hence could not be of the contrite and lowly spirit needful for belief.
   (Joh 5:45)

   45. Do you think that I will accuse you? Moses will be their accuser.
   They had failed to keep the spirit of the law, or to accept his
   testimony. (Joh 5:46) (Joh 5:47)

   46, 47. Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me. Moses
   recorded various prophecies that were fulfilled in Christ, and all the
   types, shadows and symbols pointed to him. Had they believed Moses they
   ought to have accepted Christ. The reader should note the reverence
   with which Christ always alludes to the writings of Moses. The fault
   that he charges upon the Jews is not that they reverence Moses too
   highly, but that they disregard his sayings. There is not the slightest
   intimation that he regarded the Pentateuch aught else but the genuine
   composition of Moses. Those critics of our times, who profess a
   profound reverence for the authority of Christ, but insist that the
   books assigned to Moses are frauds of a later age than his time, should
   learn a lesson from the example of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. Unbelief is due to the heart rather than to the mind. The unbeliever
   chooses unbelief. Christ said of the Jews: Ye will not believe.

   2. Sonship implies the reproduction of the Father's will in the Son. If
   we are the children of God our will must be lost, in his. Every child
   of God will pray, "Thy will be done."

   3. The prophets, John, the Father himself, his own sinless life, his
   divine wisdom, his superhuman power, and his ability to transform the
   souls of men and to give them a new life, all bear witness that Jesus
   is the Son of God.

   4. Christ is our life. He has power to quicken the soul into new life,
   to make it a new creature and to give it a deathless existence. This
   stupendous and beneficent result is due to "hearing his voice." "They
   that hear shall live." They that "have ears and hear not" will remain
   in death. Every "one that hath ears let him hear."

     __________________________________________________________________

The History of a Year.

   If the view that I have adopted concerning the time of the healing of
   the impotent man at the pool of Bethesda is correct, John leaves a
   whole year of the ministry of Christ, that between the Lord's second
   passover and the third, which is named in the present chapter, to be
   supplied from the other Evangelists. That year was one of activity.
   Following the [2]chronological table of Andrews, given in the Appendix,
   and referring to the three preceding Gospels, we trace the Savior from
   the passover in April to Galilee in the latter part of the month, where
   he enters vigorously upon his ministry, as though the fierce opposition
   from the religious authorities at the capital of the nation had only
   incited him to a more determined effort to win Galilee to the gospel.
   Making Capernaum his home, from thence he made the circuit of the
   province, teaching and healing. At an early period of the year occurred
   the miracle of the first draught of fishes in the Sea of Galilee.
   Immediately after it four fishermen, James and John, Andrew and Peter
   were called upon to leave their nets and follow him; the next Sabbath
   he healed a man with an unclean spirit in the synagogue of Capernaum;
   shortly after Peter's wife's mother was cured of a fever; and then
   followed many miracles of which the details are not given. Shortly
   after a leper was healed in a "certain city;" then one palsied who was
   let down through the roof, whose healing offended the Scribes because
   Jesus said to the paralytic: "Thy sins be forgiven thee." Next comes
   the call of Matthew, also called Levi, the publican, who left the
   receipt of custom to follow the Master, and then on a Sabbath the
   Pharisees were greatly offended because on that day he healed a man
   with a withered hand, and "they took counsel with the Herodians against
   him how they might destroy him." On this account he drew himself off
   into retirement for a season but was still sought by the multitudes.
   After a night of lonely prayer on a Galilean mountain he called the
   twelve Apostles, probably in the summer of a.d. 28, and soon after
   preached the wonderful sermon, known as the Sermon on the Mount, which
   has for fifteen hundred years been the basis of the moral systems of
   the world. Soon after he returned to Capernaum where he healed the
   servant of the centurion, and the day after went to Nain where be
   raised the dead son of a widow as he was on the bier being carried to
   the tomb. About this time John, who was now in Herod's prison, sent
   disciples to Jesus to inquire of him concerning his mission, probably
   not so much to satisfy John himself as to direct his disciples to
   Christ. Afterwards, in the house of a Pharisee, a sinful woman anointed
   his head with ointment and washed his feet with tears, giving occasion
   to an impressive lesson. Then follows a circuit of Galilee, preaching
   and healing, in which he was attended by the twelve and certain women
   whom he had healed and who ministered to him of their substance. During
   this circuit he preached much, uttered many parables, and left many
   precious words of which we have a record. In the autumn he stilled a
   tempest as he crossed the Sea of Galilee to Gadara, and there healed
   the demoniacs. On his return to Capernaum he attended Matthew's feast,
   healed the woman with the issue of blood, raised the daughter of
   Jairus, healed two blind men, and sent out the twelve to preach the
   coming kingdom. This probably occurred in the winter and later in the
   season occurred the murder of John the Baptist, the return of the
   twelve from their preaching tour, the news of Herod's desire to see
   Christ, and then, probably in the latter part of March or early April,
   the Savior retired from Herod's jurisdiction to a desert district
   belonging to Bethsaida, where the five thousand were fed.

   This summary of the history of the year demonstrates its intense
   activity, the growing influence of Christ, and the growing intensity of
   the hatred of his enemies.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Five Thousand Fed.

   This miracle is the only one recorded by all the Evangelists, and as
   the details vary somewhat, a study of all the accounts (Matt. 14:13-21;
   Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17) is needful to get the entire history. At
   Jerusalem, in the last chapter, Christ revealed himself as the Giver of
   life; here in Galilee he shows himself as the Support and Guide of
   life. (Joh 6:1)

   1. After these things. If I am correct in regarding the feast at which
   the miracle of Bethesda was wrought, the passover, this incident is
   about a year after. We are aided in locating it by the account of
   Matthew. He declares that Christ had just heard that John the Baptist
   was put to death. It is agreed by the most judicious scholars that John
   was beheaded about the third year of Christ's ministry. This began some
   months before his first passover, when he cleansed the temple; the
   miracle of Bethesda was at his second passover and in the second year
   of his ministry; this passover season (see verse 4) was in the third
   year. The date of this miracle tends to confirm the view that the feast
   of John 5:1 was the passover. Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee.
   Matthew (14:13) says that he went because he heard that Herod had slain
   John. He wished to have a season of retirement, probably for
   reflection, and he went out of Herod's jurisdiction. Mark indicates
   (6:30) that he retired for rest. Luke adds a fact that helps us to
   understand the reason. He says, "Herod sought to see Jesus." The news
   of the death of the Baptist, of the design of Herod to see him, the
   return of the Twelve from their mission (Luke 9:10), and the need of
   rest all co-operated to cause him to seek the wilderness over the sea.
   Sea of Tiberias. Another name of the Sea of Galilee at that time better
   known to Gentile readers. (Joh 6:2)

   2. And a great multitude followed. When the death of the Baptist
   occurred the popularity of Jesus was at its height in Galilee. Great
   multitudes follow him wherever he goes, and so throng him that he has
   no leisure even to eat. From every part of the land they come to listen
   to his teachings and to be healed. Nor may we ascribe this concourse
   merely to curiosity and selfishness. (Joh 6:3)

   3. And Jesus went up into a mountain. The mountains on the eastern
   shore of the sea rise to the height of nearly two thousand feet above
   the level of the water. The region was uninhabited, and therefore a
   quiet place for communing with his disciples, and rest. (Joh 6:4)

   4. And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. This statement
   gives us a note of time and shows that the country was green with the
   freshness of spring. It was not far from April 1st, and the trees were
   in full leaf. The proximity of the greatest of the festivals that were
   celebrated at Jerusalem (the passover, which began that year a.d. 29,
   on April 17th), would give occasion for a large increase of visitors
   around Galilee, as the crowds gathered for the journey. The gathering
   at such a time of a crowd of 5,000 men, attracted by so famous a
   teacher, is not incredible. The mention of the passover is an aid to
   the chronology of the Lord's ministry. The feast named in John 5:1
   could hardly be that of Purim, for then he would not have left
   Jerusalem before the passover, it following only about a month later.
   If that feast was a passover, we have now reached a period of two years
   from the passover at which he cleansed the temple (2:13). It is clear
   that the feast, now so near at hand, was not attended by the Savior,
   the only one that he seems to have omitted during his ministry. Perhaps
   the plots to kill him when last in Jerusalem explain his absence. "His
   hour was not yet come." (Joh 6:5)

   5. When Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw a great company. The other
   historians tell us that he was filled with compassion. They were
   destitute of teachers. They had no guides but the blind Scribes and
   Pharisees. They had no spiritual food but man-made traditions. Let us
   never forget that our Lord is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.
   He never changes. High in heaven at God's right hand he still pities
   the ignorant and them that are out of the way. Whence shall we buy
   bread? He had spent the greater part of the day in teaching and
   healing. As the evening came his disciples came to him asking him to
   dismiss the multitude that they might return to the villages and
   procure food, and probably as a result of their importunity he asked
   this question of Philip. (Joh 6:6)

   6. He himself knew what he would do. He was in no perplexity as to what
   would be done, though he asked the question. He often asked questions
   for the sake of their moral effect upon others. (Joh 6:7)

   7. Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them. This sum
   is mentioned mainly because it was an estimate of how much it would
   cost to give each one a little (John 6:7). Some have supposed that this
   is the amount of money they had in their common treasury, but it seems
   rather to be mentioned as a sum beyond their ability to pay. It was
   equal to $30, or Â£6, 5s.; a large amount of money then, since a
   denarius, or "penny," was the hire of a day's labor. The penny, or
   denarius, was about seventeen cents, and was equivalent to about one
   dollar now, so that the whole sum would reach $200. (Joh 6:8)

   8. One of his disciples, Andrew, . . . saith. The answer of Andrew is
   to the question of the Savior reported in Mark 6:38. He bade them to
   examine and report what food they have, and Andrew replies that a lad
   has five loaves and two fishes. (Joh 6:9)

   9. Five barley loaves and two small fishes. The loaves here were of
   barley-meal made into small, thin cakes, baked hard on the side of the
   oven, so as to be broken. Probably this was the whole stock of
   provisions then at the command of the disciples--no more than enough
   for one meal to them. The fishes were salt and dried, and used for a
   relish, according to a common custom of the country. Plain common food.
   Barley was the food only of the lower classes. It was a very small
   amount, as is shown by the fact that a "lad," a "little boy" in the
   Greek, carried them. What were they among so many? (Joh 6:10)

   10. Make the men sit down. We learn from Mark that they sat down in
   companies. Our word parties, in its convivial acceptation, is, as
   nearly as possible, a reproduction of the original term. The multitude
   was to be arranged in a suite of parties, no doubt semicircularly
   adjusted, after the form of Roman triclinia, or Grecian symposia. Such
   a semicircular or three-sided style of parties had become common among
   the Jews, being adopted from the Greeks and Romans; and hence the
   frequent reference, in the New Testament, to reclining at meals. There
   was much grass there. It was in Nisan, "the month of flowers," and the
   slopes were rich with the soft green of the spring grass. About five
   thousand. Thus there was one loaf to every thousand men. Matthew adds,
   "besides women and children," of whom there were doubtless many. It was
   customary then, as now, in the East, for men to eat alone, reclining,
   and the women and children by themselves, sitting. It was easy to
   number the men, who were arranged in companies of hundreds and fifties;
   but not the women and children, who perhaps sat around promiscuously.
   (Joh 6:11)

   11. When he had given thanks. It was held by the Jews, that "he who
   partakes of anything without giving thank acts as if he were stealing
   it from God." The prayer of thanks was always pronounced by the father
   of the family; and Jesus never neglects it, nor ought any Christian.
   (Joh 6:12)

   12. Gather up the fragments that remain. God does not allow
   wastefulness. Nature wastes nothing, not an ounce of matter. It is the
   waste of man that causes want. There is food enough for all. The waste
   of our nation is appalling;--$800,000,000 per year on liquor;
   $50,000,000 on tobacco, besides all the extravagance of life. Christ
   bids us save; save the fragments. It is by wasting the fragments that
   the great wastes occur. (Joh 6:13)

   13. Filled twelve baskets with the fragments. Only one basket in the
   beginning, but twelve after all were fed. Baskets were taken by Jews on
   journeying, to carry their provisions, etc., that they might not have
   to depend on Gentiles, and so incur the risk of ceremonial pollution.
   (Joh 6:14)

   14. Of a truth this is that prophet. The long expected prophet,
   foretold Deut. 18:15, 16, and referred to by the delegation sent to
   visit John the Baptist (John 1:21). This expected prophet was to be the
   king of Israel, the head of the kingdom of God on the earth. In other
   words they said: "This is the Christ." (Joh 6:15)

   15. Perceived that they would come and take him by force, and make him
   a king. Convinced that he was Christ, they sought to proclaim him king,
   to raise his standard, and establish his government. This miracle
   worked up to the highest pitch their enthusiasm in behalf of the
   recognition of Jesus as the Messiah. Might not this, indeed, be taken
   as the commencement of his reign? Hitherto his acts had been those of
   individual beneficence. But here was a public act, performed in the
   sight of thousands, and of which thousands had shared the benefit. Who
   so fit to be their king as he who could banish want and labor from
   their borders, and revive the good old times when their fathers were
   fed by bread from heaven? To escape their well meant efforts Jesus
   retired to a mountain alone. We learn from Mark that he went to pray.
   (Joh 6:16)

   16. When even was come his disciples went down to the sea. They were
   sent down. See Matthew and Mark. The disciples were probably ready to
   join the people in an enterprise which would fulfil their remaining
   carnal expectations regarding the Messiahship of their Master. Hence
   our Lord dismissed them, sending them where they would feel the need of
   his presence. (Joh 6:17)

   17. Entered a ship. A fishing boat large enough to carry a dozen
   persons, but not too large to be propelled by oars. To Capernaum. Mark
   says to Bethsaida, but this was on the way to Capernaum. Mark names the
   first landing place, but John the end of the journey. (Joh 6:18)

   18. The sea rose by reason of a great wind. Sudden gusts are common on
   the Sea of Galilee. Prof. McGarvey reports one that caught his party on
   the same sea. The winds rush down from the mountains of Lebanon or up
   the Jordan Valley. Thompson says he encountered one of such fury that
   no rowers could row a boat across the lake. (Joh 6:19)

   19. Rowed five and twenty or thirty furlongs. About three or three and
   a half miles. The lake is here about six miles wide. They were about
   the middle of the lake. It was about three o'clock in the morning. They
   had toiled nearly through the night, but could make no headway against
   the wind and waves. Walking upon the sea. The words, "walking on the
   sea," are common to the Evangelists, and can have no other meaning here
   than that the Lord walked bodily on the surface of the water.--Alford.
   We may see in it something like an anticipation (not unconnected, it
   may be, with the intensity of that crisis in his life) of that
   spiritual body of which we see another manifestation in the
   transfiguration, and which became normal after the resurrection,
   reaching its completeness in the wonder of the ascension.--Ellicott.
   They were afraid. Mark says, They cried out in fright. They regarded
   the appearance seen through the darkness an apparition and thought it a
   harbinger of evil. (Joh 6:20)

   20. It is I; be not afraid. This is the gospel message of peace, on the
   ground--the simple ground--"It is I." Christ's presence is peace to the
   soul.--Jacobus. How often has he to speak this word of encouragement,
   even to his own! almost always when they are brought suddenly, or in an
   unusual way, face to face with him! It is I. Literally, I am. The same
   language used by Jesus in Jerusalem (John 8:58), for which the
   Pharisees would have stoned him, and in the Old Testament to designate
   Jehovah (Exodus 3:14). Here I should prefer to give it this meaning:
   Christ says not merely, "It is I, your Friend and Master;" he says, at
   least implies, it is the "I AM," who is coming to you, the Almighty One
   who rules wind and waves, who made them, and whom they obey.--Abbott.
   (Joh 6:21)

   21. He went up . . . into the ship. John says, "they willingly received
   him;" and, on account of the wind abating, they came at once to port.
   Christ's getting in the ship was their salvation. He can both calm the
   tempest round us, and carry us safe to heaven. Immediately the ship was
   at the land. Unless the word "immediately" has more latitude than is
   common with us, this implies another miracle.

Practical Observations.

   1. He who could make the grain grow could also multiply the loaves.

   2. Our duties and our privileges are not measured by what we can do of
   ourselves, but by what God is willing to do through us. We cannot turn
   the machinery of the factory, but we can let the water on to the wheel.
   We cannot push the steamship across the ocean, but we can let on the
   steam for the engine to do it.

   3. By feeding the hungry bodies of men we often get access to their
   souls. This has been well illustrated in the famines of India and
   China.

   4. Jesus had bidden the disciples to cross the sea. It ought to have
   comforted them, to remember that he himself had constrained them to
   enter into the ship. They were evidently in the path of duty. How,
   then, could any evil befall them? It is a great comfort to us when we
   can feel sure that we are doing the will of God; for, whatever trouble
   may threaten us, we can trust Jesus to bring relief in the storm.

   5. We often learn more of faith in one month of darkness and storm,
   than in years of sunshine. When God would prepare us for higher work,
   for sweeter peace, for clearer light, he brings them by an increase of
   faith, and increases our faith by trying our faith.

   6. Jesus sometimes leaves us alone, that we may know ourselves and our
   own weakness, but he never leaves us out of sight.--Quesnell.

   7. There are often "contrary winds," even in the way of duty. We must
   expect them, and not be discouraged, nor turn out of the way.

Jesus the Bread of Life.

   The reader should note the progressive revelation of the divine majesty
   of Christ as unfolded by John. In the temple at his first passover, he
   asserted his authority over his "Father's house;" at his second
   passover he demonstrated his power over diseases and gave intimation of
   his coming dominion over the grave; in his miracle of the loaves and
   fishes he revealed the secret that his hand gave the increase of the
   earth and seas, while the quelling of the storm on Galilee showed that
   the winds and the seas obeyed his voice. In the discourse that follows
   he proclaims himself the Bread of life.

   After the feeding of the 5,000 the apostles embark in their boat;
   Christ goes up into the hills to pray; the people linger awhile for his
   return, then conclude that he has returned to Capernaum, and go back to
   Capernaum themselves; on the following Sabbath morning he enters the
   synagogue; their astonishment at his approach is great; they break out
   in questioning, How did you get here? His answer diverts them from mere
   astonishment to a serious consideration of spiritual truth: "Ye are
   seeking me, not because of the evidence I have given of my divine
   commission, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled. Labor
   not for the meat (food) that perisheth, but for that meat which
   endureth unto everlasting life."--Abbott. This gives occasion for one
   of the remarkable discourses that occur so frequently in John's gospel.
   There is no reason to believe that we have more than a condensed
   report. The whole discourse can be read in five minutes, and it is
   likely that the Savior occupied much more time in its delivery. (Joh
   6:22)

   22. The day following. The day after the miracle, when five thousand
   were fed, and after the night storm on the sea of Galilee. "The people
   who had stood on the other side and been fed," remained awhile because
   there were no other vessels, and the more willingly, because they raw
   that Jesus had not gone with his disciples. (Joh 6:23)

   23. There came other boats from Tiberias. Tiberias was the largest city
   on the sea, built by Herod, and named after Tiberius CÃ¦sar. Herod
   Antipas usually occupied it as his capital. It was a place the Lord
   never entered, though often near it. It is explained that vessels came
   from there to the place where Christ had fed the five thousand, by
   which many of them returned to Capernaum. Others had probably dispersed
   to the neighboring towns and villages, but Capernaum was "on the other
   side of the sea." (Joh 6:24)

   24. Came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. As they did not see the Lord
   longer on the eastern shore, they sought him at the place where he made
   his home. These seekers were deeply impressed by the miracle of the day
   before, and were among those who would have made him king. They were
   eager to again And him, follow him, be fed by him, and partake of his
   glory. (Joh 6:25)

   25. Rabbi, when camest thou hither? While they had come to Capernaum
   seeking him, they were astonished to find him there. He had not crossed
   the sea with his disciples; he had not come with them; how and when did
   he come? Of course they had not seen him walking the waves in the
   darkness. (Joh 6:26)

   26. Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles. The Savior reveals to
   them the true motives which induced them to seek him. They may not have
   been aware themselves of the fact that they were led by selfish
   purposes, a desire of temporal benefits. They followed him, not because
   they saw in him "that prophet who should come into the world," but
   because he supplied their lowest needs. Henry says: "Not because he
   taught them, but because he fed them; not for love, but for loaves.
   Thus do all who seek in religion secular advantages and follow Christ
   for the sake of secular preferments." People are more clamorous for
   earthly bread, than anxious concerning food for their souls. (Joh 6:27)

   27. Labor not for the meat that perisheth. The Savior does not prohibit
   laboring for food, but making the acquisition of food and worldly
   things the leading object of life. He means: Do not manifest a chief
   anxiety for bodily food, for the food that perishes with the using, but
   rather seek the meat that endureth to eternal life. The food of the
   soul; the Bread of Life. He had discoursed with the woman at Sychar of
   that which imparted eternal life to the soul under the similitude of
   water: he here speaks of the same things under the similitude of food.
   Our Lord bids us work for the food of eternal life. How few are doing
   it! This food he declares that the Son of Man will give. Him hath the
   Father sealed. Sealing is the mark of approval, of authority. A legal
   document must bear the seal of the State to give it force. The Father
   had commissioned, authorized, and stamped his seal upon the work of the
   Son. His miracles were a divine seal. In the East a document was always
   authenticated by the seal of the maker, instead of by the signature of
   a name, as with us. (Joh 6:28)

   28. What shall we do, that we might work the works of God. These
   seekers of Christ are eager for more information. He had bidden them
   work for the food of eternal life. What works then shall they do that
   they may please God and receive the divine gift? The word work had
   impressed their minds. They had been painfully keeping the law and the
   rabbinical precepts in the hope that thus they should do the works of
   God. If, however, there was something more, if Jesus had requirements
   that would impart to them a share in the kingdom, they wished to know
   of them. Their question shows a teachable disposition. (Joh 6:29)

   29. This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
   They are startled by hearing that to please God the first requirement
   is faith in Christ. This is "the work of God" that pleases him.
   "Without faith it in impossible to please God." It is not works, but
   one work, that is required, a faith that will enable them to lay hold
   upon, follow in all things, and appropriate to the souls, him who is
   the Bread of Life. From such faith would spring a Christlike life.
   Pharisees, Romanists and Pagans have ever sought to "do the works of
   God" by pilgrimages, penances, vows, and mortifications. So Luther
   thought to do as he climbed on his knees up Pilate's staircase at Rome,
   and heard the words coming to him like the voice of God: "The just
   shall live by faith." (Joh 6:30)

   30. What sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? He
   had pointed to himself as the object of faith, making his claim such as
   had never been made by mortal man. He had spoken of his seal, or sign.
   They ask now for a sign. The miracle of the day before had excited
   their surprise, but had not yet satisfied them that eternal life was to
   be found by believing in him as the Son of man sent by God. What mighty
   work can he do that will carry conviction? (Joh 6:31)

   31. Our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness. He may have fed a few
   thousands on the day before, but what was that to the feeding of the
   whole host of Israel for forty years in the wilderness? Is he as great
   a leader as Moses in whose time the manna fell? The sign they suggest
   shows that Christ had read their hearts when he said that they sought
   him because of the loaves and fishes. (Joh 6:32)

   32. Moses gave you not that bread from heaven. It was not Moses, with
   whom they were disposed to compare him, that furnished the manna in the
   wilderness, but the Angel of the Lord. This Angel of the covenant is
   supposed, from Malachi 3:1, to have been Christ. If so, not Moses, but
   "the prophet like unto Moses," was the dispenser of the bread from
   heaven, that sustained old Israel while journeying to the Promised
   Land. He still feeds the Israel of God on its way to the heavenly
   Canaan. My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. The true bread
   is not the manna. That perished like all earthly food. The true bread
   is for the soul instead of the body. It satisfies the soul's hunger and
   keeps it alive. The Father gives it by sending the Son, the true Bread
   of Life. Of the true bread the manna was a type. (Joh 6:33)

   33. The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven. He here
   defines the marks of the true bread: 1. It comes from heaven; 2. It
   bestows life upon the soul and sustains it; 3. It is for the world, not
   for a single race. The manna did not last longer than a single day; all
   who ate it died; it was for a single nation. These things are not true
   of the bread of God. God feeds his people, not with bread made on
   earth, but prepared by his own hands from heavenly materials. (Joh
   6:34)

   34. Lord, evermore give us this bread. One cannot fail to see the
   resemblance to the case of the woman of Sychar. There the emblem is
   water, here bread; there Christ offers water that will permanently
   satisfy the soul's thirst, here food that satisfies its hunger; there
   the woman asks for this water, here they ask for this bread, not yet
   fully comprehending what it is. Like Ponce de Leon, who sought the
   fountain of immortal youth in Florida, they thought that this food
   would literally make them immortal and eagerly clamored for such a
   boon. (Joh 6:35)

   35. Jesus says, I am the bread of life. They ask for this bread. He
   answers, It is here; I am that bread. The work of God is that you
   receive it by believing upon him whom he hath sent. He that cometh to
   me shall never hunger. He that cometh shall not hunger; he that
   believeth shall not thirst. It is thus shown that faith is the power
   that brings us to Christ. We come to him by believing. They who thus
   come will have their souls satisfied, and they who abide with him shall
   not hunger or thirst more. "Coming" and "believing in" are clearly
   equivalent to "eating" and "drinking." (Joh 6:36)

   36. I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. They
   had asked a work in order that they might believe, which was a
   confession of their unbelief. They ask for the bread of life, but they
   can only partake of it by believing in him. He therefore points out the
   one obstacle to obtaining what they had just asked for. (Joh 6:37)

   37. All that the Father giveth me will come to me. Christ here, as
   elsewhere, shows that the power is of the Father. The Jews may reject
   him, but all whom the Father gives, of every race, will come to him.
   The whole body of believers, Gentiles as well as the Jews, are given to
   the Son by the Father. Christ is God's gift to men, but the believers
   are his gift to Christ. "The gift of the Father must not be understood
   of a predestinating decree. Here, and in other passages, when we read
   of God giving his Son to his people it is the moral and spiritual state
   of the heart that is thought of under the word. This state of heart by
   which they are induced to listen to the voice of Jesus is due to God
   alone." Schaff. I will in no wise cast out. Every one that cometh is
   sure of a hearty welcome. No suppliant, however humble or despised, is
   rejected. (Joh 6:38)

   38. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will. Christ will
   refuse none who come to him; all such are given by the Father and he
   came to do the Father's will. He did not come to choose such followers
   only as were congenial to him, nor to follow his own inclinations, but
   to do the Father's will, which was that he should save the world. All
   was to be subordinated to this purpose. (Joh 6:39)

   39. That of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing. He would
   not cast out any one coming to him, for such were given of the Father,
   and his will was that the Son should lose none of those given, but
   should raise every soul at the last day. Whoever receives the Son hath
   life eternal, and at the last day the Son raises such because they have
   eternal life. Those "given," "come" to Christ, but they must "abide" in
   him, if they would continue to live. (Joh 6:40)

   40. This is the will of the Father. The will of the Father is
   paramount. That will is that "every one who sees the Son and believes
   upon him," thus coming to, following and abiding in him, feeding upon
   him as the soul's food, should have eternal life, and that in the
   resurrection day Christ should raise him from the grave. These verses
   show, 1. That there is not any secret decree of election. The will of
   the Father applies to every one who believes upon the Son. 2. The
   condition of eternal life is a faith that leads to and appropriates
   Christ; that makes him the Lord of the soul. 3. Christ hath brought to
   light immortality. He is "the resurrection and the life." He says, "I
   will raise him at the last day." He is the life of the world, and in
   eternity all will praise him as the true Bread of Life that came down
   from heaven.

Practical Observations.

   1. Too many seek Christ for the loaves and fishes. Persons often choose
   a church to improve their social condition, or to secure a professional
   practice, or to build up a trade. It is said that A. T. Stewart, when
   starting in business, carefully selected out a church that he thought
   would furnish him patronage in business. Such motives are sordid and
   carnal.

   2. The Lord has made it needful that we should labor for food, but this
   should not be the great object of life. The body and its food will
   perish; the soul can abide forever. We should work to procure the food
   that will enable it to enjoy eternal life.

   3. God hath sent down the Bread of Life from heaven. Nothing else will
   satisfy the soul. It may feed on the husks of pleasure, or applause, or
   show and pride, and yet perish with hunger. Why should ye seek that
   which is not bread and satisfies not?

   4. "If any man be idle and gluttonous, and careth for luxury, that man
   worketh for the meat that perisheth. So, too, if a man by his labor
   should feed Christ, and give him drink, and clothe him, who is so
   senseless and mad as to say that such an one labors for the meat that
   perisheth, when there is for this the promise of the kingdom that is to
   come and its good things? This meat endureth forever."--Chrysostom.

   5. That is food which sustains life. Bread, as the great life
   sustainer, is called the staff of life. To the hungry nothing is so
   precious. Once a hungry Arab on the desert sought a spring of which he
   knew to quench his thirst. As he rose he saw a bag, dropped by some
   traveler, and he joyfully exclaimed, "Here is food." Eagerly he tore it
   open, and then in bitter disappointment he cried, "Alas, it is only
   pearls!" Nothing will feed the soul but Christ. To the hungry soul he
   is more precious than the gems of Golconda.

   6. To feed on the Bread of Life we must come to Christ. We come by
   hearing and believing upon him. The evidence of our real belief upon
   him is the surrender of our lives to his will. Those who thus believe,
   he will never cast out; he invites all such to his arms; they feed upon
   him by faith and make his life their life. They have eternal life for
   he will raise them at the last day.

   7. Bread is a dead thing in itself; the life it supports it did nothing
   to originate. But the bread from heaven brings with it the life it
   afterwards sustains.--Hanna.

Feeding Upon Christ.

   At this point our Lord's discourse is interrupted. Hitherto he had been
   addressing the multitude; now for the first time we read "the Jews,"
   which, as already explained, means adherents of the ruling party which
   was violently hostile to Christ. Whether these Jews were among the
   multitude hitherto addressed in this discourse we cannot tell. If so,
   they had not made themselves prominent and were lost in the crowd. It
   may be that the regular discourse in the synagogue ended with verse 40,
   that these official "Jews" were not present, but were soon informed of
   what he said, and came with their objections. Or, they may have been in
   the synagogue and kept silence to this point. They may have been sent
   from Jerusalem to watch Jesus. Mark 3:22 and 7:1 distinctly intimate
   that Scribes came from Jerusalem to Galilee, and the phrase "the Jews"
   seems to convey a kind of official meaning. Since the term "Jews"
   describes, not Galileans, but natives of Judea, it is applied by John,
   almost without exception, to those connected in some way with the
   authorities at Jerusalem, and since also, we learn from the passages
   just cited that officials came from Jerusalem to take note of the words
   and acts of the Galilean prophet, it is probable that these "Jews" were
   representatives of the authorities at the Capital. If this view is
   correct, of which there can hardly be a doubt, it shows the jealousy
   with which the Sanhedrim watched over Jesus during his entire ministry
   in Galilee, as well as Judea. (Joh 6:41)

   41. The Jews murmured. They found fault and tried to raise discontent
   among those who had listened willingly to Christ. (Joh 6:42)

   42. Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph? If he was Joseph's son, how
   could he have come from heaven, or be bread from heaven? Their argument
   is that he was human born and, hence, only a man. They were, no doubt,
   ignorant of the miraculous conception, and Christ never refers to it in
   his teachings. He did not bear witness of himself. (Joh 6:43)

   43. Murmur not among yourselves. The reply of Jesus is a rebuke. These
   men were not honest inquirers but cavilers. (Joh 6:44)

   44. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
   him. Two elements are concerned in coming to Christ, the human will and
   the divine drawing. No man comes unless he wills to come. It was the
   charge of Christ against the Jews: "Ye will not come to me that ye
   might have life" (John 5:40). In Matthew 23:37 he exclaims to
   Jerusalem: "How often I would have gathered your children . . . but ye
   would not." A man can refuse to come and God does not compel, but he
   says "whosoever will, let him come and partake of the water of life
   freely." This is the human side. On the divine side God "draws," not so
   as to coerce the human will, but to induce the desire to come. "The
   gospel is the power of God unto salvation." It is the drawing power. It
   draws by its manifestation of the love of God, by its revelation of the
   crucified Savior, and his adaptation to the needs of the soul. God
   often mellows the human heart by his providences so that it becomes a
   fit soil for the Word, and by the gospel, the sword of the Spirit, his
   providence, the invitations of the Spirit, he "draws" men. If our will
   consents, and we yield to the drawing, we come. If we "will not," and
   refuse to be drawn, we do not come. The ball that I hold in my hand is
   "drawn" to the earth by attraction but is kept away by another force.
   So, too, the sinner may be "drawn" by the influence that the Father
   exerts, but, under the influence of other forces, refuse to be drawn to
   Christ.

   No man comes to the Son unless he yields his own will and is drawn by
   the love of the Father. I will raise him. The Father draws the soul to
   Christ; then the Son takes up the work and will raise him from the
   dead. (Joh 6:45)

   45. It is written in the prophets, They shall be all taught of God.
   Christ makes more explicit how the Father draws. It is by teaching men.
   All taught of God, who "have heard and learned of the Father," come to
   the Son. It is what they learn from the Father that makes them willing
   to come. (Joh 6:46)

   46. Not that any man hath seen the Father. Men do not learn of the
   Father by seeing and hearing him personally, but they learn the
   Father's will and words from the Son. (Joh 6:47)

   47. He that believeth. Here he returns to his former subject and
   affirms that belief in himself is the source of life. (Joh 6:48) (Joh
   6:49) (Joh 6:50) (Joh 6:51)

   48, 49, 50, 51. I am that bread of life. The multitude had spoken of
   the manna given to their fathers. They had all perished, for it was not
   the bread of life, and could not communicate life, but the true Bread
   was that which came from heaven, the appropriation of which would
   impart immortality because it had life in itself. He is that Bread. If
   a man eat of this bread, he shall live forever. He now goes one step
   further, and declares that that bread is his flesh. (Joh 6:52)

   52. The Jews strove among themselves. They could not comprehend what
   had just been said, and they discussed how Jesus "could give his flesh
   to eat." (Joh 6:53) (Joh 6:54)

   53. Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye
   have no life in you. The Jews had already stumbled over the statement
   that his flesh must be eaten, but the Savior, as was his custom (see
   the case of Nicodemus and the woman of Sychar), reiterates his
   statement in still stronger language. Not only must his flesh be eaten,
   but they must drink his blood if they would have life, a startling
   statement to those who had not learned the lesson of the cross, and one
   that has caused no little discussion in the Christian world. Let us
   seek his meaning. He had revealed himself already as the Life. In some
   way he would give immortality to those who partook of his life. He had
   declared himself to the Samaritan woman as the giver of the Water of
   life, and in this discourse, as the Bread of life. He had plainly
   taught that the partakers of himself, the Water of life, the Bread of
   life, should have eternal life. But how shall that Bread be eaten, or
   in other words, how shall mortals so partake of Christ as to receive
   the life he had himself, and thus have eternal life? The answer is that
   they must eat his flesh and drink his blood, but how? Those who accept
   the doctrine of transubstantiation assert that this is done in the
   Lord's Supper; that the bread and wine are literally transformed into
   the flesh and blood of Christ, and thus his flesh and blood are eaten
   and drunk. Others affirm that his language is parabolic, and that he
   means that the emblems that represent his body and blood must be
   appropriated. I believe that he means that every man must become a
   partaker of the benefits of his death, his slain body and shed blood,
   by an appropriation of them to himself, in order to live. It is only
   after his death that his flesh can be said to be eaten. The flesh of
   animals we eat is dead flesh, but this is living Bread; not dead flesh,
   but living Flesh. It is, then, not literally eaten, but is otherwise
   appropriated so that the living flesh of the Son of God becomes the
   sustenance and the life of those who partake of it. At death he shed
   his blood to wash our sins away; in his resurrection and ascension his
   glorified flesh was raised and ascended to heaven. As Alford says: "I
   cannot see how anything short of his death can be meant. By that death
   he has given his flesh for the life of the world." How shall one, then,
   eat his flesh and blood? Verses 47 and 48 show that the Bread of life
   is appropriated by believing. There must, then, be such a belief, not
   merely in Christ as a divine teacher, but in his death and
   resurrection, as will induce us to be planted in the likeness of his
   death and raised in the likeness of his resurrection. We eat the bread
   on our tables because we believe it to be bread and that it will
   sustain life; he that believeth upon the crucified Lord enters into the
   fellowship of his sufferings, is crucified with him by repentance,
   buried into his death, raised in the likeness of his resurrection with
   the new life to walk in newness of life. See Rom. 6:1-8.

   It is shown in verse 63 that it is not the literal flesh eaten that
   makes alive, but the spirit and the words of Christ are endowed with
   spirit and life. It is said, Heb. 4:12, that the word of God is quick
   (alive, living) and powerful. By the appropriation of the words of
   Christ, faith in the crucified and risen Savior, and the incorporation
   of the will and life, as expressed in his word, into our lives, we are
   made alive. (Joh 6:55)

   55. My flesh is most indeed. Is food indeed. The body does not feed
   upon it, but the soul. Its hunger and thirst are satisfied, and by the
   appropriation of this, it becomes endowed with the vital principle of
   the Bread of life. (Joh 6:56)

   56. Dwelleth in me, and I in him. By this eating one enters into.
   Christ and partakes of his life. See Rom. 6:1-8. (Joh 6:57)

   57. The living Father. The Father who is the fountain of life. He sent
   Christ endowed with his life. So Christ endows with life those who
   "eat" him. It was the meat of Jesus to do the will of the Father. We
   eat Christ, our meat, by making his will the will of our lives. (Joh
   6:58)

   58. Your fathers did eat manna. That food might sustain life for a
   season, but could not impart it, for it was dead food. The Bread from
   heaven is endued with life, and hence, gives eternal life. (Joh 6:59)

   59. These things said he. This ends the discourses in the synagogue.
   There is a third discourse to his disciples. Synagogue. See note on the
   Jewish synagogue at the close of this chapter. (Joh 6:60) (Joh 6:61)

   60, 61. Doth this offend you? His disciples could not take in what had
   just been said. They expected an earthly king, not a crucified Savior.
   Hence they murmured and were offended. (Joh 6:62)

   62. What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend? He points out a
   still greater marvel than eating his flesh and blood. He came from
   heaven and he will return there. This passage is remarkable as
   furnishing the only instance in which the Lord spoke in specific terms
   of his ascension during his earthly ministry. It is true that he often
   speaks of his return to the Father, but he does not explain whether it
   is a spiritual return or in what sense it was meant. Here he speaks
   positively of his ascension, and his words must be regarded a prophecy
   of his ascent from the heights of Olivet, in the presence of his
   disciples. (Joh 6:63)

   63. It is the spirit that quickeneth. These words we may paraphrase as
   follows: "I shall ascend to heaven so that my flesh cannot be literally
   eaten; the flesh literally profits nothing. It is the spirit that makes
   alive. The spirits of men must eat, or partake of me, and be thus
   quickened by my spirit. My words are spirit and life, and he who feeds
   upon them makes them his soul food, governs his life by them and will
   be made alive." He had spoken "in parables" to the Jews, but explains
   to his disciples his meaning as was his custom. See Matt. 13:10, 11.
   (Joh 6:64)

   64. There are some of you who believe not. Had no living,
   appropriating, trusting faith. (Joh 6:65)

   65. Except it were given him. See, for explanation, [3]verses 44,
   [4]45. (Joh 6:66)

   66. Many of his disciples went back. They were of the unbelieving.
   Their faith was not strong enough to accept the great doctrine of
   eating his flesh. (Joh 6:67) (Joh 6:68)

   67, 68. To whom shall we go? Christ, apparently sad that these had
   turned away, asked the twelve whether they would go also. Peter, always
   prompt, even impetuous, answers: To whom shall we go? The world may
   well ask this question. If it turns from Christ, to whom shall it go?
   He only has the words of eternal life. (Joh 6:69)

   69. We believe . . that thou art the Christ. It is worthy of remark
   that the same confession made at Cesarea Philippi is here made by
   Peter. (Joh 6:70)

   70. One of you is a devil. Is "diabolical" comes nearer the idea. I
   chose you and one has fallen away. The shadow of sorrow is still upon
   his spirit. The word in Greek is diabolos, not daimonion. (Joh 6:71)

   71. He spake of Judas Iscariot. At that time none knew of whom he
   spoke. The words were well calculated to cause each one to examine
   himself. Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. The Revision reads, "the son
   of Simon Iscariot," which is the proper rendering of the Greek. Simon,
   the father of Judas, is called Iscariot as well as his son, which shows
   the word is not a surname but evidently designates place. They were men
   of Kerioth, a place in Judah named in Joshua 15:25. Some have
   endeavored to identify the father of Judas with "Simon the Canaanite,"
   one of the apostles, others with "Simon the leper," who lived at
   Bethany, but there is just as much warrant for identifying him with
   Simon Barjona, or Simon the Galilean Pharisee, or Simon, one of the
   brethren of our Lord. The name was a very common one and we have
   nothing particular about this Simon except that he was the father of
   Judas and a man of Kerioth.

   In this remarkable chapter there are given three discourses of the
   Savior, or three separate sections of one discourse. The bread with
   which the five thousand had been fed furnishes the text, as the water
   of the well of Jacob did when he discoursed of the Water of life. An
   examination of his words will show the gradual development of his
   thought. He announces:

   1. Verse 33, the Bread of God, which cometh from heaven, and giveth
   life to the world.

   2. In verses 48 and 50 he declares: "I am the Bread of life." . . .
   This is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat of
   it and not die.

   3. Verses 51-56 show that the Bread of life must be eaten by becoming
   partakers of his flesh and blood, or by becoming the kindred of Christ
   and dwelling in him and having him abide in us.

   4. Verse 63 shows that eating his flesh and drinking his blood are not
   literal acts, but are symbolical expressions. The literal flesh
   profiteth nothing. The words of Christ are spirit and life. The spirit
   of man is quickened (made alive) by feeding upon those divine words
   which are endued with life.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. "Man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
   out of the mouth of God." The "Word became flesh and dwelt among men."
   That Word is the Bread of life of which, if a man eat, he shall have
   life, and "he hath given his flesh for the life of the world." Yet the
   flesh in itself "profiteth nothing." "It is the spirit that
   quickeneth." Christ's words "are spirit and life." He who feeds upon
   his words shall live. Thus the lesson is brought out that we are made
   alive by hearing, receiving into our souls, incorporating into our
   being as life principles, the words of Christ. It is thus he is eaten.
   The spirit of man thus feeds upon the spirit of Christ.

   2. A common life only exists in the most Intimate union. Christ hath
   the life of, because he is in the Father and the Father in him. So,
   too, Christ must be in us and we must be and abide in Christ in order
   to be partakers of his life.

   3. The ordinances appointed by Christ symbolize the intimate union of
   his disciples with the Lord. They believe upon him, are baptized into
   him (Rom. 6:3) and thus put on Christ (Gal. 3:27) and henceforth dwell
   in him (Rom. 8:1) and are new creatures in Christ Jesus. In the Lord's
   Supper the disciples partake of the symbols of his flesh and blood, and
   by faith enjoy "the communion of his body and blood."

   4. We may not always understand the words of Christ; they may be too
   deep for us; but we can receive them in loving trust as the words of
   our Lord. If we were to turn from Christ where could we go? Not to
   Buddha, or Mahomet, or to the philosophers and theorists. When the
   children ask for bread they give them a stone. None other than Christ
   can feed to the soul the Bread of life and give it rest. He only has
   the words of eternal life.

Note on the Jewish Synagogue.

   It will be of service, in understanding the incidents at Capernaum, as
   well as the many passages of the New Testament which refer to the
   synagogue, to have a comprehensive idea of this peculiar Jewish
   institution. It is not known when the synagogue originated, but it is
   certain that, when the temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar and the
   remnant of the nation carried into captivity, the knowledge of the word
   was preserved by establishing in every community of Jews a place where
   the law was read and taught to the people. When the nation was again
   established in their own land, as their institutions emerge into the
   clearer light of the period near the beginning of our era, the
   synagogue is found existing in, not only the towns and cities of
   Palestine, but in every foreign city where there was a Jewish
   population. In them the Savior, in the earlier portion of his ministry,
   was a frequent teacher, and Paul in his missionary tours to foreign
   cities always first sought the synagogue of his own race.

   It was a kind of Jewish local church, and permitted the worship of God
   on every Sabbath at places far away from the temple. Wherever ten Jews
   could be found it was permitted to, organize one. In it on the Sabbath
   the Scriptures were read, prayers were offered and instruction was
   given. No priest was required, there was no professional clergy; there
   was, however, a "Ruler" with his "elders," there were subordinate
   officers, and there was a regular prescribed course of reading. At one
   end of the synagogue was an "ark" or receptacle where the roll of the
   law was sacredly preserved and from which it was taken with the most
   profound reverence. On an elevated platform sat the "Ruler of the
   synagogue" and the elders; prayers were offered, and after these two
   lessons were always read, one from the Law, and one from the Prophets;
   these lessons might be read by any competent person who was designated
   by the ruler for the duty, and the reader might add his comment. When
   the Lord appeared in the synagogue at Nazareth he read from Isa. LXI,
   and then sat down to deliver his sermon, or comment. Any scholar in the
   law who might happen to be present could be called on for the comment,
   as there was no appointed preacher, and hence it frequently occurred
   that when Paul entered a Jewish synagogue in some Gentile city he was
   invited to deliver the address. The character of the address was more
   conversational than the modern sermon. Questions were not out of place,
   objections could be made, and often in the reports of discourses in the
   New Testament we see the marks of these interruptions.

   The synagogue, in Its organization, in many respect's like the
   Christian congregation, had also the power of discipline, but its
   penalties were not entirely spiritual. Scourging could be inflicted
   upon delinquents, and hence the Savior, in Matt. 10:17, speaks of his
   disciples being delivered to the synagogues to be scourged.

   The following account of an attempt of the students of Newton
   Theological Seminary to reproduce the worship of the synagogue in the
   time of Christ, given by J. H. Garrison, will aid the reader to a
   correct understanding: "About a score of the young men performed this
   service. They were appropriately rigged with the conventional uniform,
   and went through their various parts with becoming reverence. The Law
   and the Prophets were read in Hebrew and translated by an interpreter
   into the vernacular of their hearers, which was the custom of the Jews
   in their synagogue service, after the Hebrew ceased to be the language
   of the people. The chanting was very good, perhaps much better than
   that heard in the average synagogue in the time of our Savior. The Law
   from which they read was a veritable Hebrew scroll, secured from a
   Rabbi in Germany. Various readers were called out from their number,
   and while one was reading several others carefully scrutinized each
   word to see that the reading was correctly done. Every action indicated
   the greatest reverence for their sacred Scriptures. When the portions
   of both the Law and the Prophets were read, a speaker was sought for,
   and the messenger of the ruler of the synagogue had no little trouble
   in finding some one to address the people. When he found one at last
   who agreed to 'say on,' according to the invitation extended to Paul
   and Barnabas, the preacher took his seat in front of the congregation
   and proceeded to exhort his brethren to faithfulness in the observance
   of the law of their God. He evinced no little feeling when he alluded
   to their Gentile oppressors. The address, which was in English, being
   ended, he asked for questions. A number were asked, indicating by their
   character, and by the answers, the tendency of the Jews to split hairs
   on fine points of their law, at that period of their history, a
   characteristic which is brought out prominently in the gospel
   narratives. Some further responsive chanting, and a prayer, closed this
   interesting and instructive service, which was witnessed by a large
   audience. It explained how Paul would have an opportunity to speak in
   the Jewish synagogues wherever he went, and brought out very vividly
   that scene in the synagogue at Nazareth when Jesus read the wonderful
   prophecy concerning himself, and, when all eyes were fastened upon him,
   proceeded to announce its fulfillment that day. For the reader was
   sometimes, though not always, the speaker. The reading of the
   Scriptures was the main thing in the synagogue service; the speaking
   was only incidental. It may be safely questioned whether the reading of
   the word of God has the prominence in our Lord's day service that it
   ought to have."

                                  Chapter VII.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Feast of Tabernacles.

   The discourse in the synagogue at Capernaum occurred, according to
   Andrews, in the spring of a.d. 29; the visit to Jerusalem at the feast
   of Tabernacles, took place in the early autumn of the same year. An
   interval of about six months lies between, concerning the history of
   which John is silent. In order that the reader may rightly locate the
   incidents of chapter VII., I will note the outlines of the Lord's
   ministry, as given by the other Evangelists, for this period. After the
   discourse at Capernaum, the Savior visited the coasts of Tyre and
   Sidon, the only time in his ministry when he passed beyond the
   boundaries of Israel to a Gentile country. Here he heals the daughter
   of the Syro-Phoenician woman, and returning to the region of Decapolis,
   heals one with an impediment in his speech, and afterwards feeds 4,000
   persons. At Capernaum he comes in contact with the Pharisees; soon
   after crosses the sea, and at Bethsaida heals a blind man. From thence
   he goes, accompanied by his apostles, to the neighborhood of Cesarea
   Philippi, and there occurs the remarkable conversation in which Peter
   declares that "Jesus is the Christ the Son of the living God," and the
   Lord, after commending Peter and declaring that he shall be a stone or
   splinter of the Rock, affirms, "On this Rock," the great foundation
   truth Peter had uttered, "I will build my church, and the gates of the
   unseen world shall not prevail against it." They were then in the
   vicinity of "a high mountain apart," Mt. Hermon, the highest peak of
   Syria, and, ascending it, his heavenly glory broke through the bonds of
   humanity, and he was transfigured in the presence of his disciples.
   Following this remarkable event, henceforth teaching his approaching
   death at Jerusalem, after healing a lunatic child, paying the tribute
   money at Capernaum, and traversing Galilee, teaching his disciples, he
   sets out to Jerusalem to attend the feast of Tabernacles.

   Three times a year the whole adult population of Judea was required to
   assemble at Jerusalem to attend the great feasts. The finest seasons of
   the year, spring and autumn, were chosen for these gatherings of the
   people. Separated into the various tribes, these annual gatherings must
   have served to cement the bond of national unity and establish
   acquaintance and friendship. Another advantage was the opportunity of
   an interchange of sentiment on every subject of interest. Whatever was
   an engrossing topic was sure to be discussed in the great assemblages.
   Since the Savior had healed the paralytic at the pool of Bethesda,
   about eighteen months before, there is no account that he had visited
   Jerusalem, but the story of his wonderful teaching and works in Galilee
   was spread broadcast over the land, and at this gathering at the feast
   of Tabernacles the great question was whether he would come to the
   feast. Among the vast crowds a search was made to know whether he was
   not present, but when in the midst of the feast he suddenly appeared in
   the temple, not only the multitude, but the temple authorities, seem to
   have been startled.

   The feast of Tabernacles was instituted to commemorate the time when
   the Israelites had dwelt in tents during their sojourn in the desert.
   To bring vividly to remembrance the forty years of tent life, the
   people were enjoined, during the seven days of the feast, to dwell in
   huts made of the branches of trees. The flat house-tops of the city
   were covered with these leafy bowers, which became the temporary home
   of the family; while the open places and surrounding hills were also
   occupied by the vast crowd of sojourners. The feast began on the
   fifteenth of the month of Tisri, which this year answered to October
   11th, and continued eight days, seven of which were spent in the leafy
   huts. While it lasted the Jews gave themselves up to festivity and
   rejoicing. There is a proverb: "He who has not seen the rejoicing at
   the pouring out of the water of Siloam at the feast of Tabernacles has
   never seen rejoicing in his life." For the time, manner, and reason of
   this feast, see Lev. chapter 23.

   It is a remarkable fact that after so long and systematic an absence
   from Jerusalem, as eighteen months prior to this feast, our Lord should
   attend every feast for the next six months, the last of his ministry,
   in their order.--Greswell.

   This feast was the last of the Jewish year, and in some respects it was
   its crown of glory. Its characteristic was joyousness--(1) For
   deliverance from Egypt; (2) For care in the wilderness--fit emblems
   these, in every Christian experience, for deliverance from the bitter
   bondage of sin, and for care in the heavenly ways.--Vincent. (Joh 7:1)

   1. After these things. After the discourse in the synagogue at
   Capernaum. The report of "the Jews" to the authorities at Jerusalem had
   intensified the enmity that had been created when the man at the pool
   of Bethesda was healed, and the Savior refrained from rushing into
   danger until "his time" had nearly come. Six months passed, "after
   these things," before he went to the feast of Tabernacles, and during
   this time he traveled and taught in Galilee. The Jews sought to kill
   him. This illustrates the sense in which John uses the term "Jews."
   Christ's disciples and friends were all Jews by race, but when John
   wrote all disciples had merged their race distinctions into Christ and
   were Christians. "The Jews" were still a hostile people, and when the
   word is used without qualification it has this hostile sense. (Joh 7:2)

   2. Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand. It is spoken of as a
   feast that belonged to a stranger people. This feast stood pre-eminent
   among the Jewish festivals. Josephus says that it "was the holiest and
   greatest of their feasts." Occurring at the vintage season, after the
   crops were garnered, it was a season of thanksgiving. It fell from the
   15th to the 22d days of the month Tisri, covering the last part of
   September and first of October, and was about six months after and
   before the passover. Its date, therefore, shows us that six months of
   Christ's ministry had intervened between the discourse at Capernaum and
   this time. Matthew gives some the details of this interval in chapters
   XII.-XVII., XXI. (Joh 7:3)

   3. His brethren, therefore, said unto him. His brethren according to
   the flesh, whose names were James and Joses and Simon and Jude (Matt.
   13:55). For discussion of their relationship to him, [5]see notes on
   John 2:12. The theory that they were his cousins, the sons of Alpheus
   and Mary, the sister of the mother of Christ, is disproved by this
   passage: "James, the son of Alpheus, and Jude the brother of James,"
   were apostles and believers, but "these brethren" at this time were not
   believers and even seemed to be disposed to scoff. Depart hence and go
   into JudÃ¦a. A year had passed since the Savior had been at Jerusalem,
   and his brothers thought it inconsistent with his high claims that he
   should avoid the national center of religious culture and influence.
   That thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. This
   language is partly ridicule and partly entreaty. His brothers were
   astonished and puzzled, but he was so different from their conception
   of the Christ that they refused to believe. They insist that he shall
   go to Judea and show what he can do. (Joh 7:4)

   4. For no man doeth anything in secret. No prophet and inspired
   teacher. Such a teacher, they urge, seeks the multitudes and there, in
   the most public manner, exhibits his supernatural power. If thou do
   these things. If implies that they were doubters. The next verse
   affirms that they were unbelievers. While the counsel of these
   brothers, from a worldly point of view, might seem wise, it is in
   another form the same counsel offered by the devil in the second
   temptation, and spurned by our Lord. (Joh 7:5)

   5. For neither did his brethren believe in him. It shows the stress to
   which those who hold the tradition that the mother of our Lord always
   remained a virgin are put that they should insist on a theory that
   requires three out of four of these unbelievers to be apostles! A clear
   distinction is made here between "the brothers of him" (Greek) and his
   disciples. The distinction is still clearer in Matt. 12:47. They
   afterwards became believers (Acts 1:14). (Joh 7:6)

   6. My time is not yet come. The time for the full manifestation of
   himself had not yet come. He had revealed himself gradually, step by
   step, until his apostles had recognized and declared him as the Christ,
   the Son of the living God (John 6:69; Matt. 16:16). He had satisfied
   the woman of Sychar that he was the Christ, and had revealed himself in
   the synagogue at Capernaum, as the Bread of life. Three of his apostles
   had been eye witnesses of his majesty on the Mount of Transfiguration,
   but the time for the grand final lesson of the cross, the tomb, the
   resurrection and the Ascension had not come. His presence in the
   church, in the hearts of believers, as a power has gone on increasingly
   ever since, but his full manifestation to the world does not take place
   until his second coming, when "every eye shall see him." His disciples
   had to be prepared for the manifestation of his divine Christhood to
   them; and the church and world has to be prepared for his coming. Your
   time is always ready. Those who have no set work are always ready, and
   the world is always ready for those who have no message to it. He who
   has a work must make ready for it. He who has a message for the world
   must educate it to receive his message. (Joh 7:7)

   7. The world cannot hate you. In that case it would hate those who had
   its spirit and were of it. It will not hate itself. It only hates those
   who rebuke its sins and oppose its ways. Me it hateth because I testify
   . . . the works thereof are evil. It always hates those who expose and
   denounce its sins. Socrates had to drink hemlock because he rebuked the
   folly of the Athenians; Savonarola and Huss had to be burned because
   they exposed the corruptions of Rome; Isaiah, Jeremiah and John the
   Baptist all suffered because they denounced sin in high places; and
   when Jesus came exposing the corruptions of the priests, the hypocrisy
   of the Pharisees, the worldliness and debauchery of the Sadducees and
   Herodians, it was inevitable that he should be hated, persecuted and
   hunted to death. Still the world hates him. The hate of such men as
   Voltaire, Tom Paine and Ingersoll, and of their disciples, is due to
   the fact that Christ and his kingdom are a rebuke to, and condemnation
   of their lives. (Joh 7:8) (Joh 7:9)

   8, 9. Go ye . . . I go not up yet to this feast. A more literal
   translation is: "I am not now going to this feast." He does not use the
   future but the present tense. We cannot be certain whether he had yet
   determined to go at all. It would have defeated his purpose to have
   gone with those who were determined that he should make an exhibition
   of himself. Hence, after the departure of his brethren and the great
   caravan of Galilean pilgrims, he yet remained in Galilee. (Joh 7:10)

   10. Then went he up also to the feast, not openly. After the departure
   of the multitude of Galileans he followed after, no doubt accompanied
   by his apostles, though we have no account of the journey, unless it be
   referred to in Luke 9:51, 52. The journey was made quietly, not
   clandestinely, but unostentatiously and in such a way as not to attract
   observation. As Meyer says: "Not in company of a caravan of pilgrims,
   or in any other way of outward observation, but so that the journey to
   the feast is represented as made in secrecy, and consequently quite
   differently from his last entry at the feast at the passover." He seems
   not to have reached Jerusalem until after the feast was in progress.
   (Joh 7:11)

   11. Then the Jews sought him at the feast. His fame had become so great
   that his appearance at this feast was looked forward to with
   expectation, and the Jews were on the watch for him in order to observe
   his conduct and hear his words. These Jews probably sought him among
   the crowds who came from Galilee. They ask, as they seek: "Where is
   he?" or rather, "that man." Only one man could be meant, for all the
   land was busy with talk of the great Galilean teacher. The question was
   probably about half curiosity and half ill will. (Joh 7:12)

   12. There was much murmuring among the people. Muttering and secret
   discussion. By the people are meant the multitudes. They must be kept
   in the mind as distinct from "the Jews." This chapter brings out a
   vivid picture of Jewish life and of the various elements that composed
   the nation. We have "the disciples" or personal followers and believers
   in Christ; "his brethren," who were brothers according to the flesh but
   were yet unbelievers; "the Jews," officials, or those under official
   influence, and arrayed in opposition to Christ; "the people," the vast
   body of the nation who were fined with marvel, were not yet convinced,
   but were discussing the claims of Jesus; "the Pharisees" (verse 32)
   here named by John for the first time as opposed to the Lord; "the
   chief priests," the Sadducean hierarchy who hated him, not for
   religious reasons like the Pharisees, but because they were sensual,
   time-serving materiaIists; "the Pharisees and chief priests" (verses 32
   and 45), evidently the Sanhedrim; "Nicodemus" (verse 50), a member of
   the Sanhedrim, but inclined favorably to Christ. The contact with all
   of these is personal and direct. He deceiveth the people. While some
   insisted that he was a good man, others urged that he was leading the
   people astray. (Joh 7:13)

   13. No man spake openly. These discussions were private rather than
   public. The people all felt that "the Jews," the ruling powers, were
   intensely opposed to Christ, and they feared that open discussion would
   bring down evil upon themselves. Those who held both opinions
   "mistrusted the hierarchy; even those of hostile opinions were afraid,
   so long as the Sanhedrim had not given its official decision, that
   their verdict might be reversed. A true indication of an utterly
   Jesuitical domination of the people."--Meyer.

Jesus in the Temple.

   14. About the midst of the feast. About the middle. It lasted,
   altogether, eight days. This indicates the time, probably, when Jesus
   reached Jerusalem. Bengel calculates that on this year the middle of
   the feast would come on the Sabbath day; the temple would, therefore,
   be unusually crowded, and the day itself would suggest the remarks
   about the Sabbath which are found in verses 22, 23. Went up into the
   temple and taught. He had come secretly and had refused to make a show
   of himself, but he did not hesitate to proclaim his doctrine in the
   most public manner. He seems to flash upon the Jewish multitude on this
   occasion with the suddenness of the lightning flash. How he came to
   Jerusalem, whether he dwelt in a leafy booth as others, whether his
   voice was heard in the Hallel, we are not told. All we know is that
   suddenly he presents himself in the temple, the very stronghold of his
   enemies.

   Eighteen months had passed since he was last in Jerusalem. Then,
   although the miracle at Bethesda had aroused a controversy and had
   called for teaching, he had not presented himself as the public teacher
   of Israel. Now, however, throwing off all concealment, and apparently
   passing from extreme caution to the very verge of daring, he plants
   himself in the temple and addresses the multitude in a capacity that
   was assumed only by the oldest and most renowned Rabbis of Israel.
   Olshausen, following Tholuck, thinks that the Savior on the Sabbath
   day, did not merely teach in the open court, but delivered a formal
   discourse in the synagogue which was situated in the court of the
   women. As the Lord appears suddenly in the temple, on this great festal
   occasion, as a public teacher, we are reminded of Malachi 3:1. (Joh
   7:15)

   15. How knoweth this man letters? Jesus had never studied in the great
   Jewish schools of theology. In the preceding generation Hillel had
   presided over the school or university in which all who became doctors
   of the law were expected to take their course. At this time Gamaliel, a
   disciple of Hillel, had succeeded him in the supervision of this
   renowned school. Here "letters," the written law, and the unwritten
   interpretations and traditions, were made the subjects of study. No
   person was expected to become a rabbin, a public teacher of the
   synagogue or temple, until he had passed regularly through such a
   course. Yet Jesus, who had never learned of any of the doctors, never
   attended any of the rabbinical schools, now stood forth publicly in the
   temple as a teacher of religion. The Jews "marvelled" at this, but
   their question implies more. They question the right of one who had not
   a Doctor's diploma to appear thus as a public teacher. (Joh 7:16)

   16. My doctrine is not mine. These words are an answer to the question
   of the Jews. The Rabbis were wont to proclaim of whom they "received"
   their teaching. Jesus declares that his is not human learning, was not
   learned in any of the schools of men, but came from God. (Joh 7:17)

   17. If any man will do his will he shall know the doctrine. Literally,
   "If any man wills to do his will," etc. A willing obedience to the will
   of God is essential to knowledge where Christ is a divine teacher. This
   does not promise that he who seeks to obey the will of God shall be
   able to solve every difficulty of theology, but it does promise that he
   will be able to know whether Christ taught divine truth and is
   therefore the Savior of mankind. In other words, the purpose to do
   God's will so clears the spiritual insight that the soul will be able
   to recognize the nature and mission of Christ. If this be true,
   unbelief originates in an indisposition to do the will of God. The
   honest soul, eager to do God's will, will recognize Christ as a divine
   teacher. I believe that the experience of humanity confirms this
   declaration. I have never heard of one who devoutly sought to know and
   do the will of God who remained in unbelief. As far as my observation
   has gone skeptics have been more anxious to follow their own will than
   the will of God. The antidote to unbelief is for the heart to say, not
   my will but thine be done. Indeed, the conscience is not right before
   God until there is a determination to do his will. Until that point is
   reached there is not "the good and honest heart" in which the seed of
   the word can germinate. In these words the Savior points out to the
   Jews the spiritual difficulty in the way of their understanding his
   claims. They were not willing, in spite of all their religious
   pretensions, to do the will of God. (Joh 7:18)

   18. He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory. The true teacher
   of men does not preach himself. Christ came to speak of and exalt the
   Father. The true preacher hides his own personality behind Christ. The
   general truth is stated. Whenever a preacher is met who keeps himself
   prominently before his hearers he is not a true man; but when one
   forgets himself in the message of his Lord "the same is true." Egotism
   and the spirit of Christ are not in concord. (Joh 7:19)

   19. Did not Moses give you the law? I take it that this remark is
   designed to convict the Jews of not "willing to do the will of God."
   The law of Moses was recognized by them as the will of God, yet they
   violated it. It commanded, "Thou shalt not kill," yet at that very time
   "the Jews" were plotting his death. (Joh 7:20)

   20. The people answered. This answer is not given by "the Jews," of
   whom the Savior's words were just spoken (see verse 15), but by "the
   people," the great multitude of the nation who were yet undecided.
   There were people standing there, "people of Jerusalem" (verse 25), who
   knew of the plot to assassinate him, but the great body of the people
   were probably ignorant of it and, therefore, spoke honestly. It seemed
   to them so abhorrent that there should be a purpose to murder him that
   they think that the error must have been impressed on his mind by
   demoniacal influence. They mean nearly what we would say if we were to
   say of one that he is under a delusion, or is "mad." Hast a devil. See
   note on Demons at the end of this chapter. (Joh 7:21)

   21. I have done one work, and ye all marvel. Dropping the matter of
   their purpose to kill him, which time would reveal, the Lord cites them
   to the marvellous work, which had aroused the first purpose of "the
   Jews" to slay him. That work had taken place eighteen months before, on
   the occasion of his last visit to Jerusalem ([6]see John Chap. V.). It
   had been performed on the Sabbath day, which had, probably, caused them
   to marvel more, than that a man bound for thirty-eight years should be
   made whole. (Joh 7:22)

   22. Moses gave you circumcision. The rite of circumcision, given at
   first to Abraham, and therefore, "of the fathers," was a part of the
   Mosaic law. The child was to be circumcised on the eighth day and if
   this came on the Sabbath, the day was disregarded and the rite
   performed in order "that the law of Moses might not be broken." (Joh
   7:23)

   23. Are ye angry at me? The Rabbis said, "Circumcision drives away the
   Sabbath." It was, they held, "of the fathers," a patriarchal
   institution, and therefore, of older date than the Sabbath, which was
   of Moses; therefore, the Sabbath gave way before the duty of attending
   to circumcision on the eighth day. The law of mercy was older than
   either circumcision or the Sabbath; the Jews were, therefore,
   inconsistent in their indignation against him because he had performed
   an act of mercy, "made a man every whit whole, on the Sabbath day."
   Mercy was God's eternal law. (Joh 7:24)

   24. Judge with righteous judgment. They judged by "appearances" when
   they condemned Christ for healing on the Sabbath, and forgot the
   eternal principles of righteousness. Sometimes one law is broken in
   order to obey a higher law. They should always ask whether this was the
   case before they condemned, and then "judge with righteous judgment."
   (Joh 7:25) (Joh 7:26)

   25, 26. Then said some of them of Jerusalem. There were hundreds of
   thousands of strangers in the city who would know little of the
   purposes of "the Jews," but these residents of the city would be more
   likely to know. They therefore express surprise that he "whom they
   sought to kill" is speaking boldly. Do the rulers know indeed that this
   is the very Christ? They are bewildered. They do not either condemn or
   approve the purpose of the rulers, but they cannot understand why it is
   not carried out. Is it possible that the rulers have found out that
   this is the Christ? Does that explain their neglect to carry out their
   purpose? (Joh 7:27)

   27. When Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. There was an
   expectation, probably due to Dan. 7:13, that the Messiah would suddenly
   appear in Jerusalem without any one knowing whence he came. These men,
   therefore, reason that this cannot be the Christ because they knew from
   whence he was. They knew that he came from Galilee and probably that
   his early home was at Nazareth, but were ignorant of the fact that
   Bethlehem was his birthplace. Nor did they know of his heavenly origin,
   so that it was literally true that the Christ was before them and no
   man knew whence he came. It might be well to add that the Jewish
   tradition held that Bethlehem would be the Messiah's birthplace, but he
   would be caught away by spirits and tempests and lie hidden until he
   should miraculously appear to enter upon his mission. (Joh 7:28)

   28. Ye both know me and know whence I am. These words are directly
   suggested by their argument against his being the Christ. There is a
   certain irony in the answer, as though he should say: "You profess to
   know all about me, whence I came; yet if this were true you would
   believe, for I came not of myself, but was sent by one who is true; you
   do not even know who sent me." Whom ye know not. They knew not God. Had
   they known him, recognized his true character, they would have known
   Immanuel. (Joh 7:29)

   29. I know him. His knowledge was not that of hearsay, but of
   experience, for he came from God. (Joh 7:30)

   30. Then they sought to take him. The charge that they were without the
   knowledge of God so angered them that they sought to lay hands on him.
   "They of Jerusalem" are referred to. It was the attempt of a mob.
   Because his hour was not yet come. They were in some way restrained,
   perhaps by awe, and no man could yet do him violence, for the set time
   had not come. (Joh 7:31)

   31. And many of the people believed on him. Not "the Jews," or "they of
   Jerusalem," but the multitude. They were convinced that he was a
   teacher from God and were ready to follow him, though as yet not
   certain that he was the Christ. Hence they asked, "When Christ comes
   will he do more miracles than this man does?" It must be remembered
   that Jesus did not proclaim himself to be the Christ. He demonstrated
   it by his works. His apostles already knew who he was; the multitude
   had not yet learned. (Joh 7:32)

   32. The Pharisees heard that the people. These active and watchful
   adversaries discovered that the people were being convinced and thought
   it time to act. The most powerful and most religious of the Jewish
   sects, they were the bitterest enemies of Christ. Great sticklers for
   ceremonials, worshiping the letter of the law while careless of its
   spirit, intensely Jewish and Mosaic, they were early alarmed by the
   teaching of Christ (John 4:1), though this is the first place where we
   have the positive declaration of the enmity of the sect in the
   headquarters of ritualism. The Pharisees and chief priests. This phrase
   describes the Sanhedrim, composed of the chief priests who were
   Sadducees, and the leaders of the Pharisees. It is apparent that the
   Sanhedrim was quickly called together, it was announced that Jesus was
   in Jerusalem and teaching in the temple, also that the people were
   moved by his doctrine and ready to acknowledge him; it was therefore
   determined to send at once "the officers," temple guards always on
   service within the sacred precincts and composed of Levites, to arrest
   him. (Joh 7:33) (Joh 7:34)

   33, 34. Then Jesus said unto them. Now he gives another part of his
   discourse. His first words show that he is aware of the beginning of
   the end. He will not be arrested now for "yet a little while I am with
   you," but the triumph of his enemies will come shortly, for "I go to
   him who sent me," "and ye shall seek me and not find me." This is very
   plain to us in the light of subsequent history, but it is not strange
   that his hearers on the other side of the cross, did not understand.
   (Joh 7:35) (Joh 7:36)

   35, 36. Then said the Jews. They could not comprehend. Did he mean that
   he was going also to the Jews dispersed among the Gentiles? Would he
   teach them and the Gentiles, as well as the Jews of Judea and the
   Galileans? Their perplexity was genuine, but as the Jews of Jerusalem
   looked with scorn on those dispersed abroad, the insinuation is
   designed for a taunt. The question indicates the scorn in which "the
   Jews" held all whose religious privileges were less than their own.
   There was only a less degree of contempt for foreign Jews and Galileans
   than for Gentiles. In verse 52 the contempt of Galilee is indicated in
   the rebuke of Nicodemus. This contempt did not arise so much from pride
   of blood, as from pride of superior sanctity and religious learning.
   Jerusalem was then the great center of Rabbinical learning, while the
   outlying districts were regarded unlettered and scorned as the homes of
   ignorance. "If any one wishes to be rich, let him go north; if he
   wishes to be wise, let him come south," was a saying of the Rabbins.
   When Nathanael asked, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" he only
   spoke in the spirit of the times. Puffed up with the pride of
   Rabbinical learning, "the Jews" exhibited an offensive contempt for all
   who could not be measured by their standard.

Jesus the Christ.

   37. On the last day, that great day of the feast. Whether the great
   day, so emphatically mentioned, was the seventh, or the eighth day, is
   a point that has been much discussed and which cannot be certainly
   settled. There were seven active days of the feast and the eighth was a
   day of holy rest. It is probable that he to whom all the feasts of
   Israel pointed, chose this eighth day, the last day, for the
   proclamation of himself as the hope and joy of Israel. Seven days in
   tents commemorated the sojourn in the desert, but the eighth day, it is
   supposed, was devoted more especially to rejoicing and thanksgiving for
   the blessings of the year. It was a kind of "harvest home." If any man
   thirst, let him come unto me and drink. Every morning whilst the
   Israelites were gathered in the temple courts, one of the priests
   brought water drawn in a golden urn from the pool of Siloam, and amid
   the sounding of trumpets and other demonstrations of joy, poured the
   water upon the altar. This rite is not mentioned in the Old Testament;
   but, as a commemoration of the miraculous supply of water from the rock
   of Horeb in the wilderness, it was in harmony with the spirit of the
   festival. The chanting of the great Hallel (Ps. 113-118) celebrated the
   past, but the Talmud declares that the Jews connected with this
   ceremony the words of Isaiah 12:3: "Therefore with joy shall ye draw
   water out of the wells of salvation," and saw in it a type of the
   effusion of the Holy Spirit. It is held that it is with reference to
   this pouring out of water, the Savior cried, "If any man thirst, let
   him come to me and drink." Alford holds that for seven days the water
   was poured every morning, but that on the eighth there was a blank, and
   that then he invited them to the living water which would really quench
   the thirst of the soul and not leave them unsatisfied. (Joh 7:38)

   38. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said. Notice that
   "believing" corresponds to "coming" in the preceding verse, showing
   that faith is the means that brings us to Christ. The reference is not
   to any single passage, but to the spirit of the Scripture, notably such
   passages as Isaiah 55:1; 58:11; Ps. 36:8, 9. Out of his belly shall
   flow rivers of living water. Below the spot on which Jesus stood while
   speaking in the temple courts, was a vast reservoir of water. It is
   probably to this subterranean supply Joel referred when he spoke of a
   fountain that "shall come forth from the house of the Lord," and to
   which Zechariah alluded when he said that "in that day living waters
   shall go out of Jerusalem." Christ now shows that the living waters
   shall go forth because every one who drinks shall himself become a
   fountain. It will be observed that the promise takes a wider sweep. He
   who drinks shall not only never thirst but becomes himself a running
   fountain, an unfailing supply of the waters of life. Meyer says: "The
   mutual and inspired intercourse of Christians from Pentecost downward,
   the speaking in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, the mutual
   edification of Christian assemblies by means of inspired gifts, even to
   the speaking of tongues, the entire work of the apostles, and the early
   evangelists, furnish an abundant commentary on this text." Christ is
   the living water; he who believes upon Christ has Christ formed within
   him, and hence must become a fountain to dispense the living water
   wherever he goes. (Joh 7:39)

   39. This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
   receive. This declaration of John makes the second chapter of Acts the
   best commentary on the preceding verse. Luther says: "So St. Peter, by
   one sermon on the day of Pentecost, as by a rushing of water, delivered
   three thousand men from the devil's kingdom, washing them in an hour
   from sin, death and Satan." Because Jesus was not yet glorified. Let it
   be noted, 1. That the Holy Spirit was not given until after the death
   and ascension of Jesus. 2. The disciples of Christ did not become
   "fountains of living water" until the Holy Spirit was sent. This marks
   Pentecost as the beginning of the preaching of the gospel
   authoritatively by his disciples. The sermon of Peter was the first
   sermon under the great Commission, the first declaration of the
   conditions of the gospel, the first preaching by men as "the Holy
   Spirit gave them utterance." It was only after Jesus was glorified that
   he could send the Holy Spirit, and on Pentecost it was declared, "He
   hath shed forth the things which you do see and hear." (Joh 7:40)

   40. Of a truth this is the Prophet. There were conflicting views among
   those who listened to him. Some of these impressions are now given.
   Some said he was "the Prophet," spoken of in Deut. 18:15, and referred
   to in John 1:15. All agreed that a prophet was to come at the Messianic
   period, but some held that he was to be the Messiah himself, and others
   that he was to be the forerunner. Hence the deputation of the Sanhedrim
   put three questions to John: "Art thou Elias? Art thou that prophet?
   Art thou the Christ?" (Joh 7:41)

   41. Others said, This is the Christ. Others asserted that he was the
   Christ. The opponents denied this and based their opposition, not upon
   his character, or his teaching, but upon the fact that he came from
   Galilee. Jesus, reared at Nazareth, coming to Jerusalem from Galilee,
   was supposed by the Jews to have been born there, and they were well
   aware of the fact that Christ was to be born at Bethlehem. (Joh 7:42)

   42. Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem. Even the
   Talmud explains Micah 5:2, as declaring that Bethlehem should be
   Christ's birthplace. The wise men who came to Jerusalem seeking the
   young Babe heard the same thing from the priests. Nor was anything more
   clearly predicted than that he should be of the seed of David. See on
   this Isaiah 11:1; Jer. 23:5; Ps. 89:36. (Joh 7:43)

   43. So there was a division among the people. The Greek word for
   division is schism, or implies a violent split. They were rent into two
   parties and there was fierce contention. (Joh 7:44)

   44. Some of them would have taken him. In the heat and bitter animosity
   of the dispute some were eager to lay violent hands on him. For a year
   and a half the Jewish leaders had been looking for a pretext to seize
   him, and when he appeared at this feast they sought to carry out their
   purposes. Though officers were sent to apprehend him, and a mob was
   ready to seize him, yet "no man laid hands on him," "for his hour was
   not yet come." (Joh 7:45)

   45. Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees. These
   were the temple police, Levites under the direction of the chief
   priests. In verse 32 we are told that the chief priests, instigated by
   the Pharisees, had sent the officers to arrest him. This was the act of
   the Sanhedrim, and was the first official attempt to arrest him, the
   beginning of the course that resulted, six months later, in the final
   arrest, trial and crucifixion. These officers returned without the
   expected prisoner, and the reason was demanded by the Sanhedrim which
   was in session, apparently waiting for their return. (Joh 7:46)

   46. Never man spake like this man. The only answer the officers could
   make to the demand why they had not carried out orders was, "Man never
   spake like this man." The multitude had not overawed them, but the
   words of Christ. There is no stronger testimony to the moral power of
   the presence of Christ than this confession of the rough temple police.
   "To listen to him was not only to be disarmed in every attempt against
   him, but it was even to be half converted from bitter enemies to
   awe-struck disciples." (Joh 7:47) (Joh 7:48)

   47, 48. Then answered the Pharisees. . . . . Have any of the rulers,
   etc.? The Pharisees, always the bitterest foes of Christ, charge the
   officers in language of scorn. Have any of the rulers believed? By
   rulers are meant the Sanhedrim. In the matter of deciding on the claims
   of the Messiah they hold that the judgment of the "rulers" must be
   decisive. They were not probably aware that Nicodemus was really in
   secret a believer, and that another "senator," Joseph, would reveal
   himself at the proper time. At this time the Pharisees controlled the
   Sanhedrim. (Joh 7:49)

   49. This people . . . are accursed. Their argument was, "Not the
   Sanhedrim, not the powerful and religious Pharisees, but the rabble are
   the believers upon him. They are utterly ignorant of the law and are
   accursed. On account of their ignorance they are easily led astray."
   (Joh 7:50)

   50. Nicodemus said. It was a "ruler" who now spoke. The impression made
   on Nicodemus in that night interview, long before, had been permanent.
   (Joh 7:51)

   51. Doth our law judge any man before it hear him? There is a keen
   sarcasm in this question. Of course it did not, yet they who boasted of
   their knowledge of the law, were breaking it in their blind rage. The
   answer of the Pharisees shows that the question of Nicodemus cut to the
   quick. Instead of a direct answer they reply with a sneer. (Joh 7:52)

   52. Art thou also of Galilee? Are you a follower of the Galilean? Then
   they assert, "Out of Galilee hath arisen no prophet;" a false
   statement. Jonah was of Galilee (2 Kings 14:25); Elijah probably so (1
   Kings 17:1), and Nahum, also (Nahum 1:1). In their scorn of Galilee
   they held it impossible that a man of God could come out of that
   province. With such recrimination the session of the Sanhedrim broke
   up.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. If any man thirst. In those hot and arid regions there is no fiercer
   want than thirst and no greater blessing than the cool draught of
   water. The Savior knew that there was a thirst no earthly fountain
   could satisfy, a deep inward thirst that dries up the spirit. Such he
   bids to come and drink.

   2. A condition of coming to the living fountain is thirst. "Ho,
   everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters." "If any thirst, let
   him come." "Come ye that are weary and heavy laden." There must be a
   felt need of Christ, before anyone can come to him. If the world
   satisfies the soul it has no room for Christ.

   3. Those who drink must become flowing fountains. Moses struck the rock
   of Horeb and it flowed in a living stream. Christ strikes our barren
   hearts and lives and they flow forth in his love, a stream of life to
   others. Those who have eternal life must lead others to eternal life.

   4. There is no ignorance so deep as the ignorance that will not know;
   no blindness so incurable as the blindness that will not see. And the
   dogmatism of a narrow and stolid prejudice which believes itself to be
   theological learning is, of all others, the most ignorant and blind.
   Such was the spirit in which, ignoring the mild justice of Nicodemus,
   and the marvellous impression made by Jesus on their own officers, the
   majority of the Sanhedrim broke up, and went each to his own
   home.--Farrar.

   5. When the Interpreter had done, he takes them out into his garden
   again, and led them to a tree whose inside was all rotten and gone; and
   yet it grew and had leaves. Then said Mercy, "What means this?"--"This
   tree," said he, "whose outside is fair, and whose inside is rotten, is
   it to which many may be compared that are in the garden of God; who
   with their mouths speak high in behalf of God, but in deed will do
   nothing for him; whose leaves are fair, but their heart good for
   nothing but to be tinder for the devil's tinder-box."--Bunyan's
   Pilgrim's Progress.
     __________________________________________________________________

Note on Demons.

   While John does not give a single account of the casting out of devils,
   or demons more correctly, he refers in no less than four places to
   demoniac possession. In chapter 7:20, the multitude exclaim, "Thou hast
   a devil (demon): who goeth about to kill thee?" In 8:48, his enemies
   insult him by declaring: "Thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil." In
   8:52, they exclaim: "Now we know thou hast a devil," and in 10:20, they
   say, "He hath a devil and is mad." In all these places the Greek term
   is demon (daimonion), not devil (diabolos). It is the same term that is
   constantly used by the other Evangelists when they speak of demoniac
   possession. The subject is one that requires, to a correct
   understanding, more than a brief note, and I will add the substance,
   condensed, of what has been said by Trench (Miracles), Alford and Smith
   (Dictionary of the Bible) upon the subject. There has been presented no
   less than three theories of demoniacal possession: 1. Strauss and his
   school hold that there was nothing of the kind and that all language
   that seems to imply it is to be spiritualized. The possession of devils
   is only a lively symbol of the prevalence and power of evil in the
   world, and the casting out of devils is a corresponding symbol of our
   Lord's conquest of evil by his spiritual power. This theory is a part
   of that mythical explanation of everything miraculous in the life of
   Christ of which Strauss is the expounder. It is a sufficient answer to
   say that it is utterly inconsistent with the plain, matter of fact
   narratives of the New Testament. 2. The second theory holds that our
   Lord found a general belief in demoniacal agency, which attributed to
   demons various diseases, including some forms of lunacy, and epilepsy,
   that he did not combat this belief, but healed the diseases by
   miraculous power, and that there is really no such thing as demoniacal
   possession. The principal argument advanced is that we are not able to
   discover demoniac possession now, and hence, we ought to conclude there
   never was anything of the kind. To this view I will let Alford answer:
   (1) The Gospel narratives are distinctly pledged to the historic truth
   of these occurrences. Either they are true, or the Gospels are false.
   The accounts are too explicit, the details are given too fully, and the
   recognition of the demons by the Savior is too clear to admit of doubt.
   (2) Not only are the "demons," "evil spirits," "unclean spirits"
   recognized by the writers of the Gospels, but by the Savior himself. He
   speaks of them, to them, and commands them. His recognition is such
   that he has given testimony to their reality. If they are unreal he did
   that which is wholly at variance with the Christian idea of
   truthfulness. (3) The possession by demons was more than bodily
   disease. It is distinguished from sickness, lunacy and palsy by all
   being mentioned together (Matt. 4:24). It is shown not to be epilepsy
   by the spirits recognizing Jesus as the Son of God, pleading with him
   not to torment them before their time, speaking of their number, and
   passing from men into a herd of swine. It is shown to be a demoniac
   power by emphasis of the need of great spiritual power to control it
   (Matt. 9:29). (4) As to the statement that there is no such thing now
   that cannot be proved. One of the miraculous gifts was "discerning of
   spirits," and it is possible if this gift was restored we would be able
   to explain many a mysterious case by reference to this cause. It is
   known that insanity often cannot be traced to any physical cause and
   there are cases that can be explained most easily by reference to such
   a possession. We often, too, meet with cases where there seems, as in
   the possessed of the New Testament, to be a kind of a double will
   power, a feeble struggling against some force that sustains the man and
   leads him to a life that his other nature abhors. Perhaps, too, there
   may sometimes be something in the claims of writing and trance mediums,
   who insist that they are controlled by spirits. There are millions who
   believe in spiritualism, and it may not be entirely delusion. If there
   is any basis for their belief the whole system is ancient demonology in
   our age. Still it is not strange if demons should have less power now
   than 1800 years ago. Then was the "hour and power of darkness." The
   leaven of Christianity has been infusing itself through the world and
   has, no doubt, immensely limited the power of Satan.

   3. What is this possession? The demons are described as "evil spirits,"
   "unclean spirits," "the powers of the air," etc. Satan, the same as
   Beelzebub, is spoken of as the "prince of demons." He, a fallen angel,
   drew after him "angels that kept not their first estate" and is the
   spiritual chief of a realm of wicked spirits. These, doing his bidding,
   when they find a human heart prepared for their reception, enter in,
   take possession, sway the will and control the actions of the
   unfortunate being. The possession sometimes manifests itself in
   physical, and sometimes also in mental infirmities, nor can we reject
   the existence of demons unless we deny the existence of the world of
   spirits altogether.

The Adulterous Woman.

   By referring to the Revised Version the reader will see that the last
   verse of Chap. VII. and eleven verses of Chap. VIII. are omitted. It is
   not in harmony with the purpose of this commentary to enter into a
   critical discussion of the reasons why they are rejected, further than
   to say that they are wanting in most of the very ancient manuscripts,
   and terms are also used that John nowhere else adopts. On the other
   hand the account is so much in harmony with the spirit of Christ, so
   characteristic, and bears such marks of real history, that I am
   compelled to believe that it gives a real incident of the life of the
   Master. With the stern ideas that grew up in the succeeding centuries
   it would have been impossible to have invented such a story, and the
   suggestion of some of the early Fathers, Augustine for one, that it had
   been stricken from some of the manuscripts because it might be tortured
   into a license for sin, is more likely. Whether or not penned by John
   it is so full of, Christ that I believe it is true, though it might
   have been added to the Gospel after it was written.

   "The whole scene, the arrest of the woman, the demand on Jesus, the
   Pharisaic contempt of public morality in obtruding the crime and the
   criminal on public attention in the temple courts; the attempt to
   entrap Jesus; the skill of his reply; the subtle recognition of the
   woman's shame and despair,--and the gentle avoidance of adding to it by
   turning the public gaze from her to himself as he wrote upon the
   ground; the final confusion of the Pharisees and the release of the
   woman, bear the marks of real history. It is impossible to believe that
   any monkish mind conceived of this and added it to the narrative. The
   deed is the deed of Christ, whether or no the record is the record of
   John."--Abbott. (Joh 8:1)

   1. Jesus went to the mount of Olives. The last verse of Chap. VII. says
   that "every man went to his own house." Those who disputed with him had
   homes in Jerusalem to which they retired, but "Jesus went to the Mount
   of Olives," perhaps to the shades of Gethsemane where he rested under a
   leafy olive tree, possibly to the bower of some of his Galilean
   friends, constructed of branches as was the custom at this feast,
   possibly to the loved home of Lazarus and his sisters which was
   situated on the farther slope of the mount, about two miles from the
   city. This is somewhat remarkable as the only place where John mentions
   by name this hallowed mount, although it soon acquires a striking
   prominence in his history from its relation to the scenes of Bethany,
   Gethsemane and the triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It was separated
   from the city by the valley of Jehoshaphat, through which flowed the
   brook Kedron, and overlooked Jerusalem from the east. The road to
   Jericho, the Jordan, and Perea lay across, or rather around its brow.
   On its eastern slope were the sacred localities of Bethphage and
   Bethany. (Joh 8:2)

   2. Early in the morning. Of the first day after the feast had ended
   (see (Chap. VII. 37), if this narrative is in its proper place in his
   life. And he sat down and taught them. We learn from verse 20, that he
   was now in "the treasury of the temple." John does not give the words
   of teaching for the reason, as I believe, that as soon as the Savior
   had taken his place as a teacher and the throngs were gathered, an
   interruption took place. The Scribes and Pharisees were awaiting his
   coming and at once obtruded upon him. (Joh 8:3) (Joh 8:4)

   3. The scribes and Pharisees. This is the only place where John
   mentions the Scribes, though they are often named by the other
   Evangelists. From the time of Ezra they had been a distinct class.
   Gradually they became the most influential teachers of Israel, having
   far more to do in shaping the religious life of the people than the
   priests. To this order belonged the Rabbins, the great Doctors of the
   law, such men as Hillel, Shammai and Gamaliel. When Christ began to
   teach, at once the people began to compare his methods with those of
   the Scribes. They did not speak "with authority," but fortified their
   decisions with the opinions of great Doctors, "teaching for doctrines
   the commandments of men." He, on the other hand, spoke as one drawing
   upon a fountain of absolute truth within himself, "with authority and
   not as the Scribes." The phrase, "Scribes and Pharisees," has almost
   the same meaning as "the Jews," so frequently used by John. Brought
   unto him a woman. She had possibly been arrested during the night. As
   Jerusalem was crowded with strangers and this feast was a gay, joyous
   one, there was probably more license than usual. There was no reason
   why they should bring her to him. The law of Moses was clear and they
   could understand that Judea was a Roman province and the Roman civil
   law was now in force in Judea, which did not punish adultery with
   death. The man was equally guilty according to the Mosaic law, but
   pursuing the usual course of corrupt men they let him go and fastened
   upon the helpless woman. (Joh 8:5)

   5. Moses commanded such should be stoned. The Mosaic enactment is found
   in Deut. 22:22, and Lev. 20:10. It required stoning in the case of a
   betrothed virgin, and also made the infidelity of a wife punishable
   with death. It was no feeling of outraged purity that brought these
   learned Scribes, thoroughly posted in the Mosaic teachings, to Christ.
   Long since the rigid observance of the Levitical law had been laid
   aside in questions of morals, and the nation under the influence of
   association with heathen, had become corrupt. The Scribes and Pharisees
   were themselves "whited sepulchers." They only thought that, by means
   of this guilty woman whom they had entrapped, they could annoy,
   possibly entangle and gain ground for accusing the Prophet of Galilee.
   (Joh 8:6)

   6. This they said, tempting him. The dilemma corresponds to that of the
   tribute money. To affirm the binding validity and force of the Mosaic
   enactment, would be to counsel a course of action contrary to the Roman
   law, and would also be incongruous with the merciful spirit of him who
   had called publicans and permitted "sinners" to weep unrebuked upon his
   feet. On the other hand, to set aside the Mosaic judgment would make
   him liable to the charge of breaking the law of Moses and would be a
   powerful aid in breaking down his influence with the people. In one
   case they could accuse him to the Romans and place him under the ban of
   the civil power; in the other they could denounce him a setter aside of
   their cherished law. With his finger wrote on the ground. His act was a
   significant object lesson which said that he would pay no attention to
   them. When anyone speaks to me and I busy myself with something else it
   signifies that I do not consider him worthy of attention. It may be
   noted that this is the only record given that Christ ever wrote a line.
   It is vain to conjecture what he may have written with his finger in
   the dust, but if it had come down to us it would probably be found to
   have a marvellous adaptation to the circumstances. (Joh 8:7)

   7. He lifted himself up and said. As they were determined not to be
   foiled they kept pressing the question, "What sayest thou?" until he
   arose, looked at them with a look that seemed to pierce their very
   hearts, and to unveil their thoughts and lives, and then he said, "Let
   him that is without sin among you cast the first stone." They knew
   their lives were known; that he saw them polluted with impure thoughts
   and deeds; yet his answer bids the sinless one among them to step forth
   and, in accordance with the law of Moses, hurl the first stone at the
   poor, shame-stricken, agonized sinner who cowered before them. The
   answer was like a bolt of lightning. It affirmed nothing, but hurled
   them back on their own hearts and bade them thus decide. It said to
   them, "Thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest;
   for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself: for thou
   that judgest doest the same things." (Joh 8:8)

   8. Again he stooped down, and wrote. Resuming his former attitude he
   left them to ponder what he had said and to act upon it. There, for a
   little while, stood the silent scene; the stooping Lord slowly tracing
   characters with his fingers upon the earth; the crouching and weeping
   woman held by her accusers, and the haughty Scribes and Pharisees with
   shame upon their countenances, perplexed faces and eyes cast upon the
   earth; a scene worthy of a painter. They had forgotten that the Mosaic
   law provided that the witnesses on whose testimony the accused was
   condemned should cast the first stone (Deut. 17:5-7), and also that a
   guilty husband could not demand punishment upon a guilty wife,
   according to their Rabbinical law. Before the judgment of the law of
   Moses could be carried out, therefore, they must settle the question of
   their own innocence, yet his language reveals a knowledge of their
   guilt. (Joh 8:9)

   9. Being convicted by their own conscience, went out. As he wrote and
   left them to their own thoughts, conscience began to do its work. "The
   word of the Lord was quick and powerful." In the presence of one who
   read their hearts they were helpless, and, one by one, they began to go
   quietly out, the eldest and guiltiest leading the way, and in a little
   while the only figures left of the group were Jesus, still writing, and
   the woman whom they had left behind. She might have followed, but I
   trust that she remained because her heart yearned for forgiveness and a
   new life in the presence of the Sinless One before her. (Joh 8:10)

   10. Woman, where are thine accusers? Then he lifted himself up, looked
   around and saw that his enemies were gone, and then addressed the
   woman. As Augustine says: "Misery was in the presence of Mercy." "Doth
   no man condemn thee?" Is there no accuser to prove thy guilt? (Joh
   8:11)

   11. No man, Lord. . . . Neither do I condemn thee. He will not
   pronounce sentence upon her. He does not palliate her sin, but gives
   her the opportunity for repentance. In the words, "Go and sin no more,"
   there is an implied rebuke of her past life, a charge to repent and
   live a better life, and an opening of the door of hope in case she
   heeded his words.

Practical Observations.

   1. Men often do not know themselves. These Scribes and Pharisees
   regarded themselves very religious men, and very loyal to Moses. They
   kept the letter of the ceremonial law. They trampled under foot its
   spirit.

   2. Men in their eagerness to entrap others often fall into their own
   snares. Many a man has fallen into the pit that he has digged for
   others. These Scribes and Pharisees in seeking to confuse Jesus brought
   confusion on themselves.

   3. Before we condemn others we should examine ourselves and see whether
   we are free from the sin we condemn. "With what measure we mete unto
   others, it shall be measured unto us again."

   4. "The merciful shall obtain mercy." On the one hand in the Scriptures
   stand the proud, religious, punctilious Pharisees, scorning to touch a
   publican or a "sinner." On the other hand stands the merciful Jesus,
   "the Friend of publicans and sinners," who had come to call, "not the
   righteous, but sinners to repentance."

   5. Still our mercy must be like that of Jesus, sorrow for the sinner,
   but indignation for sin. It must not degenerate into indifference. Like
   Christ, our mercy should lead us to "seek to save men from their sins,"
   to call sinners to repentance, to open the door of hope to the fallen
   if they will only "go and sin no more." Sin is not the less sinful that
   there is mercy offered to the penitent sinner.

The Light of the World.

   After this, "seated in the Treasury--either some special building of
   the temple so-called, or that part of the court of the women which
   contained thirteen chests with trumpet-shaped openings, into which the
   people, and especially the Pharisees, cast their gifts--he taught as
   recorded in the present section. In this court were two gigantic
   candelabra, fifty cubits high, sumptuously gilded, on the summit of
   which at night during the feast, lamps were lighted which threw their
   light over the city." In the presence of these lamps, so admired by the
   throng, probably because attention was just then drawn to them, he
   exclaimed: "I am the light of the world," in accordance with his custom
   of fixing his words indelibly by referring to surrounding objects. His
   statement, fitting from the grandest character the earth has ever
   known, seemed to the Pharisees presumptuous, but he declares that he
   had the support of his Father's testimony. This statement led to
   various questions which resulted in their claim that Abraham was their
   father and the discourse that we now are called to study. (Joh 8:12)

   12. I am the light of the world. If the account of the woman is in the
   right place, it would seem that, after that case had reached its
   settlement, he began his discourse to the people. He had said to his
   disciples in the Sermon on the Mount that he was the light of the
   world; now he declares it to the Jewish nation in the temple. It is to
   be remarked that light was regarded as an accompaniment of the presence
   of the Lord. Moses beheld the burning bush in Horeb; when he returned
   from the presence of the Lord on Sinai his face was shining with
   heavenly radiance; the pillar of fire that lighted Israel on the
   pilgrimage was the emblem of the presence of God; the Shekinah
   descended into the Holy of Holies in a blaze of light. While the fiery
   cloud had lighted Israel Christ makes a more stupendous claim and
   asserts he is the light of the world. It is easy for us to understand
   that he is the Sun that chases ignorance, the clouds of doubt and the
   darkness of despair away, and who fills the soul with the light of
   heavenly knowledge and hope. When he uttered these words three of those
   who heard him must have thought of his radiance as they had beheld him
   shining on the Mount of Transfiguration. It is to be noted that Christ
   always rises above the thought of being only a national Savior. He bore
   on his heart the woes of humanity. Other religious teachers have come
   as "the Light of Asia," or of a particular race, but he came as the
   "Light of the world," and hence he bade, "Go into all the world and
   preach the gospel to every creature." He that followeth me shall not
   walk in darkness. The pillar of fire is referred to which lighted
   Israel on the march. So shall his followers be lighted by him, and
   shall have not only light, but "the light of life." "In him was life
   and the life was the light of men" (John 1:4). His disciples are not in
   darkness because be imparts to them the new life which fills the soul
   with light in the reception of the word of God. (Joh 8:13)

   13. Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. Perhaps
   these Pharisees have in mind what is recorded in Chap. V. 31. Had they
   said, "The testimony is not sufficient to convince us," they might have
   merited more respectful treatment, but they bluntly affirm that his
   statement is false. (Joh 8:14)

   14. Though I bear record of myself, my record is true. A man is not
   usually competent to bear witness of himself on account of the frailty
   of human understanding and must have corroborative testimony. I suppose
   that Mahomet, Ellen Smith, and other enthusiasts really thought that
   they were inspired. But Christ was not subject to human limitations. He
   knew himself, what he was, whence he came, whither he would return, the
   secrets of his Father, was dowered with omniscience, and hence, was
   qualified to speak absolute truth. No man understands even his own
   being, but Christ knew all things, and hence never spoke doubtingly, or
   hesitatingly, never stumbled, or had to change his answers. "He spake
   as never man spake." (Joh 8:15)

   15. Ye judge after the flesh. They looked upon outward appearances,
   material forms, and judged, like the world, from a superficial
   examination. They had not the spiritual discernment that was requisite
   to the recognition of Christ as one that came from God. Some "have eyes
   and see not," because some things have to be "spiritually discerned."
   There must be a certain preparation of heart before one can receive or
   comprehend Christ. To coarse, sensual, worldly hearts he is an enigma;
   to "Greeks" of every age, "foolishness; and to Jews a stumbling block."
   I judge no man. Re knows men, but he lets their own deeds judge them.
   When he sits on the throne of eternal judgment and the "books" are
   opened and men see their lives, they will not need that he judge them.
   Their consciences will approve or condemn. (Joh 8:16)

   16. If I judge, my judgment is true. He came not into the world to
   judge the world, but to save it, but he does not refrain from judging
   because he could not pass a judgment that was infallibly true. His
   Father would judge in him, and all lives were "naked and opened" to the
   sight of the Father. (Joh 8:17)

   17. It is also written in your law. The Jewish law which they accepted
   as divine. It declared (Deut. 19:15) that the testimony of two
   witnesses was to be accepted. In this case, besides his own witness,
   there was other testimony to confirm it. It will be noticed that Jesus
   does not say our law. He never classes himself with the Jews. (Joh
   8:18)

   18. The Father that sent me beareth witness of me. There was his own
   testimony that he came from the Father. Then, there was in addition,
   the testimony of the Father. The witness of the Father was given in all
   the Prophets who spoke of Christ, was given at the Baptism by testimony
   from heaven, was given in the divine wisdom, sinless nature, and mighty
   works of Christ, for "no one could do these things unless God was with
   him." The divine presence was manifested in his life to such a degree
   that when Philip inquires for the Father (John 14:8) the Savior's reply
   is in a tone of sorrow: "Have I been so long time with thee and hast
   thou not known me?" (Joh 8:19)

   19. Where is thy Father? This question is asked, not for information,
   but in a scornful spirit. They could not see his Father, therefore they
   disputed his words. The Savior strikes at the root of their difficulty
   in his reply: Ye neither know me, nor my Father. Had they known Christ
   this would have led them to a knowledge of the Father, for it is thus
   we learn to know God, by beholding him manifest in the flesh. The
   mighty Jehovah, clothed in majesty and sitting on his throne in the
   heavens, may be above our comprehension, but the Savior, weeping with
   tenderness and beaming with love, we can comprehend. On the other hand,
   it is a demonstration that men know not God who do not recognize
   Christ, for "in him is the fulness of the Godhead." By their rejection
   of Christ these Pharisees demonstrated that they "knew not God." (Joh
   8:20)

   20. These words spake Jesus in the treasury. The treasury of the temple
   was in the court of the women, the most public part of the temple. See
   Mark 12:41; Luke 21:1. The mention of the locality shows the boldness
   of the Lord's teaching. The Sanhedrim held its sessions, usually, in
   the hall Gazith, which was situated in the wall between the court of
   women and the inner court. Jesus was teaching within hearing of the
   very headquarters of his enemies, from whence had issued the orders,
   shortly before (Chap. VII. 32, 45), for his arrest. "Yet no man laid
   hands on him; for his hour was not yet come." Until the passover, six
   months in the future, that the plans of his enemies should all fail,
   and "his hour should not come," was clearly known to the Lord. (Joh
   8:21)

   21. I go my way, . . . ye shall die in your sins. We now pass to
   another stage in the discourse, either continued at that time, or
   resumed by a connection of thought, afterwards. His words are no longer
   confined to the Pharisees, but addressed to "the Jews," the whole class
   of official opposers, and he carries them forward to judgment. He will
   depart and they shall seek him when it is too late and shall not find
   him but die in their sin (see Revised Version), the sin of rejecting
   the only Savior who could save them from their sins, and the result
   will be that where he is they cannot come. The meaning of his words is
   plain in the light of subsequent events. 1. He went back to heaven from
   the cross, the tomb, and the Mount of Ascension. 2. These Jewish
   hearers will die in their sin. 3. Therefore, they cannot go where
   Christ will have gone. 4. In other words, those who die in sin cannot
   find entrance into heaven. Coupled with the next three verses it is
   strongly opposed to the doctrine of universal restoration, as it is
   also, to an effectual repentance upon the death bed. It teaches us to
   "seek the Lord while he may be found," for the time comes when men
   shall seek him and not find him. (Joh 8:22)

   22. Will he kill himself? I do not suppose that these "Jews" were so
   dull as their question implies. They probably asked this question in
   scorn. They did not understand the Lord because they did not want to
   understand. They mean that, as he proposes to go where they cannot
   come, he must be going to Gehenna, where all suicides go, rather than
   to heaven, where all Pharisees expected to go. The Jews placed suicides
   along with murder and held that the darkest regions of the under world
   were reserved for those who were guilty of the crime. (Joh 8:23)

   23. Ye are from beneath. Their words were full of mockery and the Lord
   increases his severity. Understanding their allusion to the world
   beneath in their question, he replies, "You are from beneath," earthly,
   fleshly, worldly, of a spirit that will cause you to go to your own
   place, but I am from above. Hence, when he "goes away," he will return
   whence he came. (Joh 8:24)

   24. I said therefore, ye shall die in your sins. Because "they are from
   beneath," "of the world." The only way that there is of escape from the
   fearful fate that he predicts is stated: "If ye believe not that I am,
   ye shall die in your sins." Their unbelief was due to their obstinacy
   and wilful blindness; there is still one door of hope; that is belief
   on him. He who dies in unbelief dies in sin. (Joh 8:25)

   25. Who art thou? He had said, "believe that I am;" they said, "believe
   that thou art what? Who art thou?" Their words were no doubt spoken
   with a sneer, as though they said, "Whom, then, dost thou fancy thyself
   to be?" His answer is not such as he was wont to give to honest,
   earnest seekers, but such as mockers merited: "Even the same that I
   said from the beginning." I refer you to my words and what they testify
   of me. His teaching was a demonstration of his character. This answer
   of Christ has provoked much discussion, not so much concerning its
   meaning, as its proper translation. The early Greek Fathers, such men
   as Chrysostom and Cyril, men who spoke Greek as their native tongue,
   held that the Savior said, "Why am I even speaking to you at all?" Or,
   in other words, Why will he condescend to speak at all to men upon whom
   his words are wasted? This gives a clear and harmonious idea. (Joh
   8:26)

   26. I have many things to say and judge of you. Still he continues to
   speak. His words will only make them more bitter, but he represents
   divine truth and the message must be given to the world. He will only
   speak what he "has heard" of God, though he has much to say in the way
   of admonition and censure. (Joh 8:27)

   27. They understood not that he spake of the Father. They were so
   pre-occupied with thoughts of earthly things that they did not perceive
   what is so plain to us, that he declared that he would not speak his
   own words and judgments, but only what he "had heard of the Father." He
   had not designated by any title the One who had sent him. His meaning,
   to them, was partly veiled, as in his parables, in order that unawares,
   some seeds of truth should find a lodgment in their hearts. As Alford
   says: "There is no accounting for the ignorance of unbelief, as any
   minister of Christ knows by painful experience." (Joh 8:28)

   28. When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I
   am. Though his Jewish hearers did not understand the import of his
   words, they are clear to us. The "lifting up" always points to the
   cross, and this victory of his enemies and humiliation of the Son of
   God, is always pointed to as the crisis in which his cause is won and
   his salvation made sure. Two years and a half before, in the interview
   with Nicodemus, he had said, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the
   wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever
   believeth on him should not perish but have eternal life." He taught in
   these and other passages that his "lifting up" would be the means of
   breaking down unbelief and leading men to "know him." The prediction
   was realized. His disciples were few in number until after he died, but
   the very act that his enemies fondly hoped would blot his name from
   history was the means of filling the world with believers. Fifty days
   after his crucifixion thousands of those who had "crucified and slain"
   him, cried, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" A few weeks after
   thousands more of those concerning whom Peter said, "I know that
   through ignorance you crucified the Lord of life and glory," became
   believers. Thus the work went on until the cross became a badge of
   honor, instead of a symbol of shame. The Lord, and indeed the whole
   Scripture, points to the death of Jesus as the central act of the
   Christian religion. It is his death that gives life to the world. (Joh
   8:29)

   29. He that sent me is with me. He always has a sense of the presence
   of the Father. He was not so much an ambassador from God, as "the
   Brightness of the Father's glory and the express image of his person,"
   the manifestation of God. I do the things which please him always.
   "Always" is emphatic. He was completely resigned to the will of the
   Father. Even in Gethsemane his prayer was, "Not my will, but thine be
   done." Because his will was lost in the will of God, the "Father did
   not leave him alone." So, too, every child of God can have a
   consciousness of the presence of the Father if he will always do those
   things that please him. (Joh 8:30)

   30. Many believed on him. From the instructions that follow it is
   evident that they did more than give assent to the proposition that he
   was an inspired man of God. They were evidently moved in heart to trust
   and follow him.

Jesus and Abraham.

   31. If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed. The
   words spoken by the Savior in the preceding discourse convinced many of
   his hearers. They "believed on him," but their faith was not yet made
   perfect by obedience. Hence he adds the conditions of discipleship.
   They must do more than believe; their belief must move them to accept
   his word and obey it. There is a condition, continue in my word; a
   promise, shall be my disciples. To abide in the word, is the condition
   of being Christ's disciples. This harmonizes with the entire gospel.
   The New Testament nowhere teaches justification by a faith that does
   not lead to obedience. (Joh 8:32)

   32. And ye shall know the truth. Disciples are learners. Their object
   is to know the truth. The way to know the truth is, not to engage in
   study, but to obey the truth. He declares (John 7:17): "If any man will
   do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God." This
   shows that the best way to silence doubts is to practice the duties of
   Christian life. It is certain that the faithful doers of the will of
   God are not the doubters, and it is also certain that those who become
   skeptics begin by neglecting their duties. Those who walk devoutly in
   the footsteps of Christ are not troubled by doubts. And the truth shall
   make you free. The truth known through obedience to Christ's words. Too
   often churches seek to bring those who would obey Christ into bondage
   to creeds, traditions of men and human forms. The gospel obeyed
   frees--frees from the yoke of Satan, from spiritual task-masters, from
   fear, fills the soul with hope and the free spirit of a man who serves
   the Father from love. (Joh 8:33)

   33. They answered. Probably not the Jews who believed, but the opposers
   in the throng. We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage. It was
   the proud boast of the Jews that they were descendants of Abraham. They
   trusted in their blood rather than in obedience to the God of Abraham.
   Their proud language was false. Their nation had been in bondage for
   over six hundred years, to Babylon, to Persia, to Macedon, to Syria, to
   Rome. It had been in bondage to idolatry in past time and was scourged
   by God with the captivity. It was at that very moment in bondage to
   Rome politically, and spiritually to the Rabbis, to tradition, to human
   commandments, to spiritual pride, and to sin. Those are most deeply
   enslaved who call their bondage freedom. (Joh 8:34)

   34. Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. According to his
   custom, Christ makes no direct argument in reply, but states a truth
   and leaves them to apply it. The sinner is the slave of sin. Action
   forms habit, and habit is a second nature. We say of the drunkard, the
   tobacco chewer, the opium eater, the swearer, or the gambler, that he
   is the slave of habit. The same principle is involved in all evil
   doing, which tends to fasten evil habits upon the soul. Whoever sins is
   binding upon himself the chains of slavery. This is a law of our being.
   How many there are who become conscious of their weak, sinful condition
   and sigh for deliverance. See Rom. 7:9-24. (Joh 8:35)

   35. The servant abideth not in the house forever. The servant has no
   claim to remain continually in the same family, but may be changed at
   will. The son can remain because he is a son. Hagar, the bondwoman, was
   sent forth from the home of Abraham. The Jews, bondmen instead of
   children, who claimed that they dwelt in the house of God and enjoyed
   his favor, would soon be expelled; only those who were made free by the
   Son and thus become children would continue to abide in the Lord's
   house. (Joh 8:36)

   36. If the son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free
   indeed. Ye are not truly free, but servants of sin, children of the
   bondwoman who was cast out. If you would be free indeed you must have
   the freedom that the Son bestows and become children. In order to fully
   comprehend the figure read Gal. 4:19-21, which is the best commentary
   on this verse. (Joh 8:37)

   37. I know that ye are Abraham's seed. He admits their boast that they
   are the fleshly children of Abraham, "but ye seek to kill me, because
   my word hath no place in you;" a proof that they were not spiritually
   Abraham's children. Abraham had no such spirit. John the Baptist found
   it needful to rebuke the Jewish boast, and declared "God could of these
   stones raise up children to Abraham," a hint that the children of the
   promise should be Abraham's children, not by fleshly descent, but by
   the will of God. (Joh 8:38)

   38. I speak that which I have seen with my Father. Jesus was the Son;
   he had dwelt in the Father's house; he declared what he had seen and
   heard there; this they rejected, and did what they "had seen with their
   father;" not Abraham, whom they claimed, but the father named in verse
   44. (Joh 8:39) (Joh 8:40) (Joh 8:41) (Joh 8:42) (Joh 8:43)

   39-43. Abraham is our father. To Christ's allusion to their father they
   again assert that they are Abraham's offspring. This might be true
   according to the flesh, but spiritually they had another father. See
   verse 44. Ye seek to kill me. A thing totally unlike Abraham, and
   showing that they are not his spiritual children. Ye do the deeds of
   your father. The father named in verse 44. If God were your father.
   This is in reply to their claim that they are God's children. Their
   assertion is disproved by their hate of him who was sent from God.
   God's spiritual children would welcome "God manifest in the flesh."
   Cannot hear my word. They could not understand him, because they were
   morally incapable of hearing him. Satan, their father, had them
   captive, and their minds were so preoccupied, that they could not
   receive Christ's truth. (Joh 8:44)

   44. Ye are of your father, the devil. He shows that there are two
   households on the earth; that of God, composed of his children; and
   that of the devil, composed of his children. All who hear the voice of
   Christ become God's children by adoption (Rom. 8:15-17), and all who
   refuse to hear him, do so because they belong to the devil's household
   and hear his voice. He was a murderer from the beginning. Not merely
   because he inspired Cain's murder of Abel, but because he seduced the
   human race into disobedience and sought to destroy it. The temptation
   in Eden was a case of attempted murder, and has resulted in all the
   murders of earth, and the spiritual death of myriads. They (the Jews)
   were the children of a murderer; hence they sought to kill Christ (see
   verse 40). (Joh 8:45)

   45. Because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. He has just
   declared that the devil is the father of liars and that they are his
   children; hence they would refuse to receive the truth. They had in
   them the spirit of their father which would lead them to reject the
   truth and to prefer falsehood. There are many such in the earth still,
   who fight against the truth and resort to every dishonest quibble in
   order to overthrow it. They do not love the truth and this has so
   warped their nature that they will believe a lie more readily than the
   truth. (Joh 8:46)

   46. Which of you convinceth me of sin? He points to his sinless
   character as a proof that there can be no falsehood in his words. The
   argument is: "If I am not the Son of God, find out some human defect or
   weakness that proves that I am only a man, and therefore, imperfect
   like all others." This is Christ's method with deists. Point out a
   single flaw in his matchless character. You cannot. Then listen to the
   words of the sinless man as to a voice from heaven. "If I am not
   convicted of any sin, I speak the truth. Why then do you not believe
   me?" (Joh 8:47)

   47. He that is of God heareth God's words. These Pharisees claimed to
   be of God, but proved they were not by rejecting the words of the Son.
   (Joh 8:48)

   48. Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? They resort to the language
   of passion and vituperation. Of all men they hated the Samaritans most
   and hence this charge; they next accuse him, not of having a devil, but
   being possessed with a demon, or evil spirit. The charge had been
   before made that he cast out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils.
   See Matt. 12:24. The evil spirits, or demons, are represented as fallen
   angels (2 Peter 2:4); subject to Satan (Matt. 9:34); working miracles
   (Rev. 16:14). (Joh 8:49)

   49. I honor my Father. He passes by in silence their first charge; the
   second he denies, and shows that it cannot be true, for he honors his
   Father, which a demon could not do; and yet the Jews dishonored him,
   while he honored the Father. (Joh 8:50)

   50. I seek not mine own glory. He cared little therefore for their
   abuse, and sought not to defend himself. The "one that seeketh and
   judgeth" would take care of his reputation. God's children may
   disregard the unrighteous judgments of men, but God will Judge
   righteously. (Joh 8:51)

   51. If a man keep my word, he shall never see death. Here again is a
   condition and a promise. Notice 1. Its universal character. If any one,
   Jew or Gentile, male or female, bond or free. 2. The condition: Keep my
   words. Again, obedience essential; no life without it; by obedience we
   are not only freed, but enter into life. 3. Shall not see death. Death
   of the body is not reckoned death, but merely the gate through which
   the believer enters upon a more perfect life. "They who live and
   believe upon him shall never die." (Joh 8:52)

   52. Abraham is dead, and the prophets. Everybody had died, even the
   best and greatest; how then could any one escape seeing death? (Joh
   8:53)

   53. Art thou greater than our father Abraham? Their argument is: They
   that heard the word of God are dead, and shall they who have heard thee
   not die? Their question is asked in scorn. Compare with John 4:12. (Joh
   8:54)

   54. If I honor myself, my honor is nothing. They had just asked: Whom
   makest thou thyself? The Father, who honoreth him, will settle that
   question by his resurrection from the dead and exaltation. (Joh 8:55)

   55. Ye have not known him, but I know him. They claimed to be
   worshipers of Abraham's God. He now shows, that despite their claims,
   they did not know him, but that he knew and revealed him. Nor could he
   deny it, for he must tell the truth. (Joh 8:56)

   56. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day . . . and was glad. Saw
   it in promise by prophetic vision; whether or not "Abraham was greater"
   he rejoiced in the hope of the revelation of Christ. (Joh 8:57)

   57. Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou soon Abraham? They
   do not attempt to give his age, but a round period that will cover it.
   It had been about 2,000 years since the time of Abraham. Jesus did not
   say he had seen Abraham, but they pervert his words. (Joh 8:58)

   58. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. A solemn
   and official declaration preceded by" Verily, verily." The utterance is
   a remarkable one. It does not merely assert that he was before Abraham,
   but, before Abraham was, I AM. It identifies him with the I AM of the
   Old Testament. Divinity has no past tense, nor future tense, but always
   the present. God is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite.
   His hands are laid upon the past as well as the future. (Joh 8:59)

   59. They took up stones to stone him. They regarded his language
   blasphemy. If he had been only a man it would have been. Hence, in a
   sudden rage, without waiting for a trial, they sought to inflict the
   penalty of blasphemy by mob violence. Stoning was the legal penalty of
   blasphemy, but could not be inflicted without a trial and judgment. But
   Jesus hid himself. Quietly disappeared in the crowd and departed from
   the temple, while they were raging around to gather stones. It is not
   probable there was a miracle, as he never worked one for his own
   benefit.

Practical Observations.

   1. This discourse embodies Christ's teaching concerning himself in the
   following points: (1) He is the light, the moral and spiritual
   illuminator of the world; (2) He is superhuman in his origin (verse
   23); (3) The manifestation of the Father (verse 29); (4) The freer of
   those who obey his words (verses 31-36); (5) Sinless (verse 46); (6)
   The life-giver to those who obey him (verse 51); (7) The great I AM
   (verse 58).--Barnes.

   2. To become his disciples we must abide in his words. We must not only
   receive them, but obey them and continue to live in them. No one is his
   disciple who continues in disobedience.

   3. To secure life we must keep his words. There is no promise to any
   but those who seek to do his will. To those who make it their meat to
   do his will, the death of the body is only the opening of the portals
   of the eternal home.

   4. There are two households, two armies, two churches; one of Satan,
   and the other of God. He who does the will of Satan is of the first; he
   who does God's will as revealed by Christ, is of the second. It is easy
   for each one to determine where he belongs.

   5. All true Christians are brothers and sisters of Christ, and heirs
   with him of God his father. His riches are their riches; his joys,
   their joys; his character, their character; his home, their home.

   6. I AM.--The word "I am" in Hebrew is equivalent in meaning to
   Jehovah, and differs from it very slightly in form. This is much
   obscured by our substitution of Lord for Jehovah. The name, which Moses
   was thus commissioned to use, was at once new and old: old in its
   connection with previous revelations; new in its full interpretation
   and in its bearing upon the covenant of which Moses was the destined
   mediator.--Cook. And here we cannot but be reminded of the remarkable
   words of our Savior (John 8:58), "Before Abraham was, I am." The
   expression is so strikingly parallel that we know not how to resist the
   conclusion that there was a real, though mysterious identity in the
   essential nature of the two speakers; so that whatever was meant by
   Jehovah in saying to Moses, "I am hath sent me to you," the same was
   meant by the saying of Jesus, "Before Abraham was, I am."--Bush.

Jesus and the Blind Man.

   This miracle is reported only by John, a fact that is not strange when
   we remember that he alone gives a report of the ministry in Judea in
   which it occurred. The time cannot be certainly determined. Some have
   supposed that it occurred on the same day, only a few moments after
   Christ had escaped from the attempt to stone him; others regard it
   improbable that he should have stopped at such a moment to perform a
   miracle. All that is certain is that it was on the Sabbath day; a fact
   that intensified the animosity of his strict, sanctimonious, but
   unscrupulous enemies. We are, however, inclined to think that it
   occurred on the same day as the events of the last chapter. (Joh 9:1)

   1. And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
   The last verse of the preceding chapter states that Jesus, "going
   through the midst of them, so passed by." This chapter begins, "As
   Jesus passed by." When we remember that there was no break into
   chapters when John wrote the passage, it seems certain that he designed
   to say that this occurred immediately after. In this case it was Jesus
   who came to the blind man, not the blind man to him. Blindness from
   birth is usually incurable by modern science. Like most such
   unfortunates then, the man was a beggar. See verse 8. (Joh 9:2)

   2. Master, who did sin? The disciples observed the Savior's look,
   resting sympathetically on the sufferer. They ask the solution of a
   troublesome question. It was the current opinion of the Jews that such
   an infliction was a punishment for some sin. Traces of this belief are
   often found in the Scriptures. When Job was a sufferer from an
   unprecedented sorrow, his friends insisted that he must have been a
   great sinner. The prophet, describing the sufferings of Christ,
   declared that the people would say, "He is smitten of God and
   afflicted." When Paul placed the bundle of sticks on the fire after the
   shipwreck, and the viper came out and fastened on his hand, the
   barbarians decided at once that he was a murderer or, at least, a great
   criminal. The world still believes that great calamities are judgments.
   When a great misfortune comes on a nation or an individual, the
   question is asked, "How did they sin?" Even Christ had said to the
   paralytic at the pool of Bethesda, "Go, and sin no more, lest a worse
   thing come upon thee." This man. Usually our sorrows are the direct
   result of our own sins. Men are broken in health, reputation, or
   fortune, because they have transgressed. When the drunkard has delirium
   tremens, or the rake is on the rack of a ruined constitution, or an
   outcast woman is dying in shame, they are all reaping what they have
   sown. The disciples knew this to be true, and did not stop to consider
   that the man's own sins could not have caused him to be born blind. Or
   his parents. The disciples knew well that the sins of parents are often
   visited upon the children. Many a child has received the legacy of a
   feeble constitution, or a hereditary disease, or of vicious habits, or
   of a shameful name, from its parents. Nor is such a question strange
   concerning a member of a race which has inherited the consequences of
   sin from Adam. (Joh 9:3)

   3. Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents. Jesus, does not
   affirm that they were sinless, but that their sins were not the cause
   of the calamity. We are not justified in asserting that the sufferer is
   a sinner. Job's friends tried to prove his guilt by his calamities; the
   enemies of Christ, when he suffered on the cross, said, "He is smitten
   of God, and afflicted." Christ here shows that there may be other
   reasons for sorrow than personal or family sins. But that the works of
   God should be made manifest in him. By his miraculous cure the work of
   God shall be made manifest. It is the work of God to believe on Christ
   (John 6:29), and the blindness of this man was the occasion of faith
   being produced not only in him, but others. Thus Christ shows a nobler
   use of suffering. It is often a means of grace, and the saints are
   often called upon to suffer, that they may themselves be purified, or
   to show God's grace to others. "The Father chasteneth every son whom he
   loveth." "If ye be without chastening ye are not sons." "The blood of
   martyrs is the seed of the church." (Joh 9:4)

   4. The night cometh, when no man can work. The works of God are to be
   made manifest in the blind man; Christ must work those works while the
   short day of life lasteth; the night of death soon cometh to everyone
   when no man can work. It is probable, when these words were spoken, the
   afternoon was moving toward night when the work of the day would be
   over. His night of death was near at hand, and he was diligent to
   finish his work. So, too, it soon comes to every man. What is to be
   done must be done first. If we have not "worked out our own salvation
   with fear and trembling," it will be too late. (Joh 9:5)

   5. I am the light of the world. He was the sun that caused the day of
   life and hope to the soul. He sheds moral and spiritual light upon the
   world. It was prophesied that he should give sight to the blind. He not
   only opened blind souls, but blind eyes. At that moment he was about to
   be light to one who had been wrapped in darkness all his life. (Joh
   9:6)

   6. He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle. Why he did this
   we cannot be sure. The ancients believed there was a virtue in saliva,
   but one way of healing was as easy to the Savior as another. It is
   probable that this means was adopted in order to send the man to the
   pool of Siloam to wash. It was Christ's rule to give all who were
   healed something to do as a test of faith. He had volunteered the cure
   in this case; he therefore anointed the blind man's eyes and bade him
   go and wash off the ointment. (Joh 9:7)

   7. Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. A pool in the environs of Jerusalem,
   called Siloah or Shiloah in Neh. 3:15 and Isa. 8:6. South of the temple
   mount is a basin hewn out of the rock in part and partly built of
   masonry, fifty-three feet long, eighteen feet wide and nineteen feet
   deep, which is identified as Siloam. A stream, rising in the fount of
   Siloam, passes through the reservoir, which is used for domestic
   purposes and irrigation by the people of the adjacent village of
   Siloam. Sent. The name of the pool was one of the titles of Christ. He
   was the Shiloah (Sent), it was Siloam. Came seeing. The man went in
   obedience, as Naaman went and washed in Jordan. The result in each case
   was the same. The divine power healed, but the act of obedience was
   demanded of the man. (Joh 9:8) (Joh 9:9)

   8, 9. Is not this he that sat and begged? The only doubt arose from the
   fact that that was a blind beggar, but this man could see. Apparently,
   he was a well-known beggar, but their surprise was so great that it
   required his affirmation before they were sure of his identity. "Both
   beggary and blindness are much more common in the East than with
   us,--the former owing to unjust taxation, uneven distribution of
   wealth, and the total absence of public and systematized charities; the
   latter owing to lack of cleanliness, and to exposure to an almost
   tropical sun, and to burning sands."--Abbott. (Joh 9:10) (Joh 9:11)

   10, 11. How were thine eyes opened? They were astounded. In surprise
   they demand an explanation. His reply is so laconic as to stamp him as
   a more than ordinary man. The literal rendering of the account of what
   he, himself, did is, "And going, and washing, I see." (Joh 9:12)

   12. Where is he? This question may have been asked out of curiosity.
   These questioners were the neighbors of the blind man. (Joh 9:13)

   13. They brought him to the Pharisees. It was a notable event that
   demanded investigation. Hence they brought him to religious men of
   great influence. These Pharisees were then the ruling sect, and the
   blind man is brought to leaders among them for an informal
   investigation of his case. The Pharisees, as a sect, were hypocritical,
   but there were upright men among them. Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea,
   Gamaliel and Saul of Tarsus, were of this sect. (Joh 9:14)

   14. It was the Sabbath day. Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. We have found
   in the case of the miracle at the pool of Bethesda how they were
   angered by any apparent violation of the day. They tried to observe the
   day in the letter and constantly broke it in the spirit. (Joh 9:15)
   (Joh 9:16)

   15, 16. This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath day.
   The Pharisees questioned the man, learned that his eyes had been
   smeared with spittle, and then declared that Jesus had broken the
   Sabbath. The Jewish doctors of the law, while binding burdens that God
   had never imposed, declared that on the Sabbath no man could even
   anoint one of his own eyes with spittle. Hence, according to their
   logic, Jesus had broken the Sabbath, and was not a man of God. But on
   the other hand was the wonderful miracle. How could one whom God did
   not help open the eyes of one blind from birth! Hence, "there was a
   division among them." (Joh 9:17)

   17. He said, He is a prophet. They ask for each man's opinion and,
   finally, in their perplexity and division, turned to the man healed. A
   little while before he had said that "a man called Jesus" healed him;
   now he declares that "he is a prophet;" a little later he is prepared
   to receive him as the Son of God. His convictions constantly deepened.
   (Joh 9:18)

   18. But the Jews did not believe . . . that he had been blind. In
   verses 13-17, the examination of the blind man is conducted by the
   Pharisees; now not that sect alone, but "the Jews," the official
   influence of Jerusalem, including also the Pharisees, undertake the
   investigation. Their only way of escape from the admission that Jesus
   had wrought an unprecedented miracle is to insist that the young man
   had not been born blind. They begin this examination by calling his
   parents. It is to be noted that this is an official examination. (Joh
   9:19) (Joh 9:20) (Joh 9:21)

   19, 20, 21. How then doth he now see? They ask two questions: 1. Was he
   blind from birth? 2. How was he cured? for the fact that he now sees is
   indisputable. The manner of asking the first question is designed to
   express doubts: "Is this your son, that you say was born blind?" The
   parents reply: 1. He is our son; 2. He was born blind; 3. He now sees,
   but by what means he was cured we know not. They refer them to their
   son for further information as a competent witness. Being of age "he
   could speak for himself." (Joh 9:22) (Joh 9:23)

   22. Because they feared the Jews. The parents were non-committal
   concerning how their son was cured from fear of those same official
   classes who were now questioning them. We learn that an agreement had
   already been reached that any one confessing that Jesus was the Christ
   should be excommunicated. Though Jesus had not openly proclaimed
   himself as the Christ this decision of the rulers shows that the people
   were considering that very question and that the opinion that he was
   the Christ was gaining credence. The terror of the parents shows that
   to be "put out of the synagogue" was a punishment of great severity to
   a Jew. There were, according to Rabbinical writers, various degrees of
   excommunication, the mildest of thirty days duration. The effect of
   even the mildest grade was to render the offender a heathen, to cut him
   off from religious privileges, from association with his Jewish friends
   and neighbors, and even from his own family. If, at the end of thirty
   days, the offence was not repented of, a severer punishment was
   administered. This resolution to expel all confessors of Christ from
   the synagogue became a fixed rule after the crucifixion, when the
   gospel began to be preached with such success. Christ predicts it in
   Matt. 10:17. (Joh 9:24)

   24. Give God the praise. Failing to obtain any satisfaction from the
   parents, they send for the son. They aim in this second interview to
   overawe him, and force him to the admission that there was some
   deception or mistake about Jesus having healed him. "Give glory to God"
   (see Joshua 7:19) seems to have been a formula used when a criminal,
   thought to be concealing a part of the truth, was urged to make a full
   confession. It means, "Remembering that the eyes of God are upon you,"
   and therefore, honor God by telling the truth. The evidence that they
   urge as proof of a deception is we know that this man is a sinner.
   Their proof of this was that he healed on the Sabbath. (Joh 9:25)

   25. He answered. His answer shows that he was the wrong kind of
   material to be overawed. He enters into no dispute whether the Healer
   was a sinner or not, but of one thing there could be no doubt: he had
   been blind, but now he saw. (Joh 9:26)

   26. What did he to thee? They begin a cross examination in the hope
   that some flaw in the chain of proof might be developed. (Joh 9:27)
   (Joh 9:28)

   27. I have told you already. See verse 15. He had answered these
   questions to the Pharisees who were an important part of "the Jews."
   His answers show a growing impatience. Will ye also be his disciples?
   This question is sarcastic. They seem so interested, have insisted on
   him telling the story of his cure the second time, ask so many
   questions; is it that they wish to be his disciples? The "also" implies
   that he is a disciple. This was bold irony to the stately Sanhedrists.
   (Joh 9:29)

   29. We know that God spake to Moses. Hence they argue that they are on
   sure ground in clinging to Moses, but as to being the disciple of "this
   fellow, they do not even know whence he is." (Joh 9:30)

   30. Herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not whence he is. Now
   follows a marvellous scene, a ragged mendicant who was only that
   morning begging his bread, in this conclave of great ecclesiastics,
   expounds theology to the very men who "sat in Moses' seat" and shows a
   better knowledge of the Scriptures than the self-righteous Pharisees
   who prided themselves so much on doctrinal knowledge! He frankly
   declares it a "marvellous thing" that they do not know after the great
   miracle of opening his eyes. One who wrought such a miracle must be
   from God. (Joh 9:31)

   31. Now we know that God heareth not sinners. His argument was that of
   the distinguished "master in Israel," Nicodemus, who declared to
   Christ, "No man can do the miracles thou doest, except God be with him"
   (John 3:2). In the same spirit the man cured of blindness declares that
   God only hears true worshipers and those who do his will. (Joh 9:32)
   (Joh 9:33)

   32, 33. Since the world began . . . one that was born blind. He was
   right. No similar miracle is recorded even in the Scriptures. Nor in
   ordinary cases of congenital blindness is there any cure even by the
   developments of modern optical science. However, in certain kinds of
   blindness, cures are not unknown, but usually a cure is hopeless. This
   unheard of cure, he insists, can only be due to the favor and power of
   God; hence Jesus must be a man of God. (Joh 9:34)

   34. Thou wast altogether born in sins. In verse 2 it is asked: "Did
   this man sin that he should be born blind?" They, probably in reference
   to that belief, declare that he was born "in sins," yet he would
   presume to teach great doctors like themselves! In their rage there is
   an implied acknowledgement of the miracle. And they cast him out. Cast
   him out, not only from their presence, but also from their sympathy,
   and intercourse with them and the people. It is implied that he was
   made an outcast, and no doubt their act would be followed by exclusion
   from the synagogue of which he was a member.

   Tholuck remarks: "The narrative of this miracle has a special value in
   apologetics. How often do we hear the wish expressed that Christ's
   miracles had been put on documentary record; and had been subjected to
   a thorough judicial examination! Here we have the very thing desired;
   judicial personages, and these too, the avowed enemies of Christ,
   investigate a miracle of Christ in repeated hearings and they can find
   no flaw." If the reader will observe he will find that the people refer
   the case to a great religious order composed of enemies of Christ; that
   members of this order first examine the facts; then the case is
   referred to a higher tribunal, the official representatives of the
   nation, who cross-examine the parents, as well as the subject of the
   miracle. This judicial investigation shows by the testimony of both
   that the young man was born blind, that he now saw, and his own
   testimony was given that he was healed by Jesus. The attempt to
   disprove the miracle was an utter failure and the court sought to
   discredit it by excommunicating the chief witness. (Joh 9:35)

   35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out. Whereupon he at once sought
   him. The man had lost the world, but Christ was ready to give him
   heaven. Dost thou believe on the Son of God? Many manuscripts read, the
   Son of Man, but at any rate the man knew so little of Jesus that he did
   not know who was meant. (Joh 9:36)

   36. Who is he, Lord? He does not ask this question in doubt, but that
   he may receive the information which will lead to a complete faith. He
   has full confidence in Jesus, but has not learned that he is the Son of
   God, and probably waits to hear him affirm it. (Joh 9:37)

   37. Thou hast seen him. Those eyes that have been opened are permitted
   to see him in the person of the great Healer and he that speaks at that
   moment is the Son of God. It is a striking fact that this declaration
   of himself, spontaneously, to the outcast from the synagogue, only has
   one parallel case, the revelation of Christ to the outcast woman of
   Samaria (John 4:26). (Joh 9:38)

   38. I believe, Lord, and he worshiped him. At once there is an
   outspoken confession of faith, followed by an act of homage. The
   believer believes with the heart, confesses with the lips, and shows
   forth this faith by obedience. (Joh 9:39)

   39. For judgment I am come into this world. He came into the world to
   save it, but the effect of his coming is to reveal every man's true
   condition. The light reveals the stains that would otherwise be unseen,
   and Christ's presence reveals the presence and power of sin in the
   hearts of men. He is the touch stone. His coming not only gave sight to
   the blind but opened the eyes of those who were in the darkness of
   ignorance. Publicans and sinners were enabled to see, while "Jews" and
   Pharisees, who claimed to be enlightened, were left in darkness,
   because they closed their eyes. (Joh 9:40)

   40. Are we blind also? The form of the question implies that these
   Pharisees supposed that Christ would answer in the negative. He had
   spoken of two classes, those who did not see who should see; and those
   who saw, or had the highest spiritual opportunities, who should become
   blind by wilfully closing their eyes. The Pharisees think that they
   belong to neither class. (Joh 9:41)

   41. If ye were blind, ye should have no sin. If they were blind,
   utterly without knowledge, they would have no moral responsibility, but
   they claimed to see and had the highest opportunities for knowing;
   hence, when they closed their eyes and thus wilfully refused to see,
   they were guilty. To other sins was added the sin of the rejection of
   the light. Our responsibility is measured by our opportunities.

Practical Observations.

   1. Sinners are blind to their own interests, to God, heaven, spiritual
   life.

   2. They are not only blind, but beggars, unable to cure themselves,
   needing help from God and man.

   3. The miracles are "parables of redemption." Observe: (1) The man is
   in darkness; the state of the sinner; (2) Christ is the light; (3) The
   condition of receiving the light is faith and obedience; (4) The man
   believes and obeys and "came seeing."

   4. The sinner is blind to his best good, to God's goodness and love, to
   Jesus, to the Bible, to heaven. He is blind and a beggar, needing help
   from others. Blind, and grinding in the mill, like Samson among the
   Philistines.

   5. None are so guilty as those who boast that they are enlightened and
   yet refuse to receive the light. Moral responsibility is measured by
   opportunity.

   6. Sometimes men are called to suffer that "the glory of God may be
   manifest." Bunyan could never have written the Pilgrim's Progress had
   he not been cast into prison, nor Milton, Paradise Lost had he not been
   blind and forsaken by the world. So, too, God's children are sometimes
   called to endure chastisement in order that they might yield the
   peaceable fruit of righteousness. They that bear Christ's cross shall
   wear his crown. They that wear the white robes on high are those who
   have come up through much tribulation and washed their robes in the
   blood of the Lamb. See Rev. 7:14.

The Good Shepherd.

   This discourse undoubtedly immediately followed, and sprang out of the
   conflict with the Jews related in the preceding chapter. As Alford
   says: "The more we carefully study this wonderful Gospel, the more we
   shall see that the idea of this close connection is never to be
   dismissed as imaginary, and that our Evangelist never passes, without
   notice, to an entirely different and disjointed discourse." In the last
   chapter Christ had been in conflict with those who claimed to be the
   shepherds of the people, the Pharisees and Sanhedrists, the men "who
   sat in Moses' seat," and boasted of their knowledge of the law of God.
   These professed shepherds had just cast out from their fold a poor lamb
   for the crime of refusing to believe that the person who had opened his
   eyes was a sinner. The last words spoken before this chapter begins
   were a rebuke to these haughty spiritual shepherds, who, while having
   the law and the prophets which pointed out the Christ, the best of
   opportunities, and who prided themselves on their great knowledge of
   divine things, still blinded themselves by their intense prejudice and
   obstinate rejection of the Holy One of Israel. Hence he continues and
   points out the characteristics of those who are real shepherds, in
   contrast with spiritual robbers.

   "I understand this lesson to be a parable with a double application.
   First, Christ compares the Pharisees to shepherds, himself to the door,
   and declares that those only are true shepherds who enter through the
   door; that is, through Christ and his authority. All others are thieves
   and robbers. Then he changes the application and declares himself the
   good shepherd whose praises David and Isaiah sung, and indicates the
   nature of the service that he will render unto his sheep by giving for
   them his life."--Abbott.

   The figure of the shepherd and his sheep is always a favorite one in
   the Scriptures. Abraham, the founder of the Jewish race, and the father
   of whom all Christians are children by faith, was a shepherd, as were
   Isaac, Jacob, the twelve patriarchs, and all the Jewish race up to the
   time of their settlement in Canaan. Upon the hills of Canaan the
   shepherd's vocation was always a favorite employment, and David, the
   great king, was called from his flocks to the throne. It was David who
   sang, "The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want," and all through the
   Scriptures the Lord is presented in the position of the shepherd of his
   people. It is Christ who is the Good Shepherd. (Joh 10:1)

   1. He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold. The sheepfold
   is a figure of the church, the door into which is Christ. The
   sheepfolds of the East are large enclosures, open to the sky, but
   walled around with reeds, or stone, or brick in order to afford a
   protection against robbers, wolves, and other beasts of prey. There is
   a large door at which the shepherd enters with the sheep. Sometimes
   leopards, panthers and robbers clamber over the walls elsewhere in
   order to prey upon the sheep. At the doors of the large sheepfolds,
   where many thousands of sheep are protected, a porter, or doorkeeper,
   remains on guard, and this doorkeeper will only admit those who have
   the right to enter. (See Sheepfold, in Smith's Bible Dictionary.) All
   those who climb into the sheepfold some other way than by the door are
   thieves and robbers.

   "Those low, flat buildings on the sheltered side of the valley are
   sheepfolds. They are called marah; and when the nights are cold the
   flocks are shut up in them, but in ordinary weather they are merely
   kept within the yard. This, you observe, is defended by a wide stone
   wall, crowned all around with thorns, which the prowling wolf will
   rarely attempt to scale. The nimer, however, and the faked, the wolf
   and the panther of this country, when pressed with hunger, will
   overleap this thorny hedge, and with one tremendous bound land in the
   frightened fold. Then is the time to try the nerve and heart of the
   faithful shepherd. These humble types of him, who leadeth Joseph like a
   flock, never leave their helpless charge alone, but accompany them by
   day and abide with them by night."--Thompson's The Land and the Book.
   (Joh 10:2)

   2. He that entereth by the door. The one who comes in by the door is
   the shepherd. The figure is very plain to those familiar with Eastern
   sheepfolds. The door is for the shepherd and the sheep, while those who
   get in otherwise are robbers who seek to prey upon the sheep. (Joh
   10:3)

   3. To him the porter openeth. The gatekeeper, whose business it is to
   guard the entrance. This servant was furnished with arms to fight off
   intruders, but the shepherd he would let in. There has been much
   speculation what Christ signified by the porter. The sheepfold is the
   church, he is the door by which all enter; he is also the Good
   Shepherd; there are also the shepherds or teachers under him who enter
   by the door; the saints are the sheep; those who seek to become leaders
   of God's people, but have not come in through Christ, are false
   leaders, thieves and robbers. It is not certain that Christ intended to
   make the porter a figure of any spiritual thing, but if so, he would
   represent God, who has decided who shall enter through the door. And
   the sheep hear his voice. "This is true to the letter. The sheep are so
   tame and so trained that they follow their keeper with the utmost
   docility. He leads them forth from the fold just where he
   pleases."--Thompson. The Eastern shepherds lead their flocks, while in
   our country we drive them. A traveler in the Holy Land says: "Two
   flocks were moving slowly up the slope of the hill, one of sheep, and
   the other of goats. The shepherd was going before the sheep, and they
   followed as he led the way to the Jaffa gate; we could not but remember
   the Savior's words: 'When he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth
   before them, and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice.'" He
   calleth his own sheep by name. This corresponds exactly with the facts
   of Eastern shepherd life. They give names to sheep as we do to horses,
   cows and dogs. "Passing by a flock of sheep," says Mr. Hartley, "I
   asked the shepherd to call one of his sheep. He instantly did so, and
   it left its pasturage and its companions, and ran to the shepherd with
   a promptitude and signs of pleasure that I never witnessed before."
   (Joh 10:4)

   4. The sheep follow him, for they know his voice. "As we ate and
   looked, almost spellbound, the silent hillsides around us were in a
   moment filled with sounds and life. The shepherds led their flocks
   forth from the gates of the city. They were in full view and we watched
   and listened to them with no little interest. Thousands of sheep and
   goats were there in dense, confused masses. The shepherds stood
   together until all came out. Then they separated, each shepherd taking
   a different path, and uttering, as he advanced, a shrill, peculiar
   call. The sheep heard them. At first the masses swayed and moved as if
   shaken with some internal convulsion; then points struck out in the
   direction taken by the shepherds; these became longer and longer, until
   the confused masses were resolved into long, living streams, flowing
   after their leaders. Such a sight was not new to me, still it had lost
   none of its interest. It was, perhaps, one of the most vivid
   illustrations which human eyes could witness of that beautiful
   discourse of our Savior recorded by John."--Porter. (Joh 10:5)

   5. And a stranger they will not follow. The sheep refuse to follow a
   strange voice. A traveler once said to a Palestine shepherd that it was
   the dress of the master that the sheep knew and not his voice. The
   shepherd asserted that it was the voice, and to settle the point, he
   and the traveler changed dresses and went among the sheep. The traveler
   called them in the shepherd's dress, but they refused to follow him,
   for they knew not his voice. On the other hand they ran at once at the
   shepherd's call, though he was in strange attire. The application of
   this is easy. The sheep of the Good Shepherd hear his voice, know it,
   and follow him. They will not listen to the voice of a stranger who
   would call them away. The proof that we are Christ's sheep is that we
   hear his voice and follow him. (Joh 10:6)

   6. This parable spake Jesus unto them. The Greek word rendered here
   "parable," is not so rendered elsewhere. The above figure is not a
   parable in the same sense as the term is used elsewhere. There is not a
   true parable in the whole gospel of John. This is rather a simile.
   Christ's hearers could not understand the application. Hence he
   explains in the following verses: (Joh 10:7)

   7. I am the door of the sheep. Verses 1-5, speak of shepherds in
   general. These shepherds enter into the fold and go out by the same
   door as the sheep. Christ is that door; the Door of the sheep, the one
   door for all, both sheep and shepherds, into the fold, into the company
   of God's people, into the church of the living God, to the Father.
   There is no other way in, for "there is no other name, under heaven,
   given among men, whereby we must be saved." (Joh 10:8)

   8. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers. This passage
   has caused much difference of opinion. Alford holds that Satan came
   before Christ in Eden to sway our race, and that the language refers to
   Satan and his followers. Abbott holds that the idea is, "All who came,
   not entering through the door, but claiming to be before me, having the
   precedence, independent of me, are thieves and robbers." Westcott says
   that he refers to false messiahs and teachers who had preceded him. I
   believe that the truth is to be sought by a combination of all these
   views. That he does not mean in point of time alone by "come before me"
   is evident because this view would assign Moses, the prophets and John
   the Baptist to the class of spiritual robbers. There was, however, the
   body of Jewish religious teachers, the Scribes, the doctors and the
   Pharisees, who had claimed for centuries before to be the spiritual
   shepherds but were "blind leaders of the blind," "devourers of widows'
   houses," and these also in their pride turned away from Christ as too
   lowly to receive their deference. In point of spiritual precedence they
   placed themselves "before" him. The underlying principle is that all
   who claim to be religious and moral leaders and who turn away from
   Christ as their teacher are not real shepherds whose aim is to save the
   flock, but "robbers" who wish to prey upon it. This view includes the
   Jewish rabbis, the Greek philosophers, the pretended prophets, and the
   "Infallible Pope." These all refuse to bow to his authority. But the
   sheep did not hear them. The true sheep. It was the goats that wandered
   off after such leaders. (Joh 10:9)

   9. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved. Christ is at once the
   door, the shepherd and the pasture. His pasture is the bread of life
   and the water of life. They who enter by him, in the way he has
   appointed, are saved, and shall never be lost if they continue to hear
   his voice. (Joh 10:10)

   10. The thief cometh not, but to steal. All those who enter otherwise
   than by the door, wish to prey upon the flock. Their object is not to
   save the lives of the flock, but to destroy them. Christ came to give
   life, and to give it an abundant development. False religion robs men;
   true religion blesses and enriches. And to destroy. The false and
   selfish teacher is not only a thief who steals the substance and the
   opportunities of the flock, but a destroyer. This is a universal truth
   that any person of wide observation has seen illustrated too often. He
   destroys the spiritual life of the flock, leads it away from the Good
   Shepherd, fills it with false notions, destroys the faith that is in
   men's hearts, and scatters the flock abroad until the sheep can no
   longer be found. (Joh 10:11)

   11. I am the good shepherd. This title, applied to Jehovah in Psalm 23
   and in Ezekiel 34:12, Christ here applies to himself. The mark of the
   good shepherd is that he giveth his life for his sheep. In that
   unsettled country the shepherd had often to defend his flock. Dr.
   Thompson says: "The faithful shepherd has often to put his life into
   his hand to defend the flock. I have known more than one case in which
   he had literally to lay it down in the contest. A poor, faithful
   fellow, last spring, between Tiberias and Tabor, instead of fleeing,
   actually fought three Bedouin robbers until he was hacked to pieces and
   died among the sheep he was defending." Thus the Good Shepherd loves
   his sheep. So, too, does every faithful shepherd among his followers.
   (Joh 10:12)

   12. But the hireling . . . . leaveth his sheep and fleeth. It is not
   the bare fact of a man receiving pay that makes him a hireling. "The
   laborer is worthy of his hire." He is a hireling who would not work
   were it not for this hire. Such hirelings, who are moved by
   self-interest alone, will abandon the flock in the moment of danger. He
   only cares for his gains. Thus true and false shepherds are
   distinguished. (Joh 10:13)

   13. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling. Because he cares
   for his hire, but not for the sheep. He is bound to them, not by love,
   but by self-interest. When the yellow fever struck Memphis the hireling
   shepherds fled to the North. (Joh 10:14)

   14. I am the good shepherd. The Lord does not say that he is the only
   shepherd. God had in times past sent other shepherds to lead the flock
   of Israel who had led it to the best of their ability, though
   imperfectly, but he is distinguished from them as the Good Shepherd. He
   is the "True Vine" (15:1); the "True Bread" (6:32), as well as the Good
   Shepherd. The great characteristic of the Good Shepherd is indicated in
   verse 11, as his devotion of his own life to the sheep. I know my
   sheep. He knows every one of them, personally, tenderly, lovingly, by
   name. The very hairs of our heads are numbered. (Joh 10:15)

   15. As the Father knoweth me. As the Father knew the Son and the Son
   the Father, so is there a tender bond between the sheep of Christ and
   the Good Shepherd. For them he was then giving and would give his life.
   (Joh 10:16)

   16. I have also other sheep, not of this fold. Not Jews, of whom all
   his followers then were, but Gentiles who would soon be called to him.
   These would hear his voice, enter through the door, into the same fold
   as the Jewish Christians, so that there would be "one fold and one
   shepherd." There is only one Church and one door into it, and one
   Shepherd over it.

   All through the Savior's ministry there shines forth the grand truth
   that he is the Redeemer of the world, instead of a Jewish Messiah. To
   Nicodemus he declared, at the first passover of his ministry, that God
   had sent him, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be
   saved by him. At Samaria, shortly after, his teachings so overleaped
   the narrow bounds of Judaism that the believing Samaritans pronounced
   him "the Savior of the world." Here in no ambiguous language he
   announces the breaking down of the "wall of partition" between Jew and
   Gentile, and the gathering of his sheep "not of this fold" into the
   same fold where his sheep of the Jewish race were gathered, so that
   there would be "one fold and one shepherd." Some narrow critics have
   held that Paul gave to Christianity its impulse to become a universal
   religion, but not only the prophets, but the life and teaching of
   Christ, from the time when John pointed to him on the banks of Jordan
   as the "Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world," down do
   the world-wide commission given as he ascended on high, all declare
   that he came to be the world's Savior. (Joh 10:17)

   17. Therefore doth my Father love me. The ground of the Father's love
   was that Christ had given himself for man. The Father loves those of us
   best who are most like Christ in this respect. (Joh 10:18)

   18. I lay it down of myself. His life. He gave himself for man of his
   free will. He laid down his life on the cross; he took it again when he
   rose from the dead. The plots of men would have been of no avail had he
   not consented. Indeed his whole life from the time his ministry began
   was a laying of it down. While constantly bearing the cross he was
   marching straight to the cross. From the very beginning of his teaching
   there are references to the death he should die (see John 3:14). (Joh
   10:19)

   19. There was a division, therefore, again among the Jews. In John
   7:43, the division was among the multitude; in 9:16, among the
   Pharisees; now among "the Jews," or ruling body. Some were wonderfully
   impressed by his miracles and teachings, while others were obstinately
   blind. We can hardly wonder at the perplexity of the more honest sort
   when we are reminded that Jesus did not in any respect, except power
   and wisdom, answer to their conceptions of the Christ. To accept him
   was to abandon their national hope, and to accept, instead, the hope of
   the world. (Joh 10:20)

   20. Many said, He hath a devil and is mad. It was a common belief among
   the Jews that the agency of demons could produce supernatural effects.
   See Matt. 12:24. It was a very convenient way, therefore, of explaining
   the miraculous power of Christ. (Joh 10:21)

   21. These are not the words of him that hath a devil (demon). No person
   under demoniac influence had ever taught like Christ, and hence the
   better sort assert that his teachings disprove the charge. Besides it
   had never been known that a demon could open the eyes of the blind.
   There had been a display of a mightier power.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. There is no way to the fold of God but through Christ. Those who
   reject him reject eternal life.

   2. Those who are Christ's disciples will hear his voice; that is, obey
   him. All who live in disobedience are following other leaders.

   3. Any teacher who teaches contrary to Christ, who sets aside his
   authority, or teaches falsely, is not a shepherd but a robber. His
   object is to prey upon the sheep.

   4. There are robbers who will destroy the sheep and there are hireling
   shepherds. Robbers lead astray; hireling shepherds are those who work
   for pay alone. They are mercenary men. They will abandon the flock as
   soon as they can get better pay somewhere else.

   5. Followers of Jesus should be like their leader in looking beyond
   trial to triumph.

   6. It is almost universally agreed that by thieves and robbers we are
   to understand rapacious persons, intent on gain. That most of the high
   priests were such persons the history of Josephus abundantly
   testifies.--Bloomfield. He was teaching in Jerusalem and the thieves
   and robbers were in the temple.

   7. God has only "one fold," one church. The division of the Christian
   world into warring sects is sinful.

End of Three Months' Ministry in Jerusalem.

   An interval of more than two months passed between the time of the
   healing of the man born blind and the feast of Dedication, the date of
   the controversy recorded in the remainder of this chapter. Some have
   held that in the interval the Lord went to Galilee and made his last
   circuit of its cities. This is the view of Andrews, but I agree rather
   with those who hold that his ministry in Jerusalem was continuous from
   the time of the feast of Tabernacles until he retired just after the
   feast of Dedication. It was a last and supreme effort to lead the
   nation to salvation.

   The feast of Dedication was not one of the divinely appointed
   festivals, and there is nothing in the Savior's ministry to create the
   idea that he would observe it, but he was in Jerusalem and it afforded
   an opportunity to reach the people of which he availed himself. The
   feast was established by Judas MaccabÃ¦us, in the year b.c. 164, to
   commemorate the purification of the temple after its defilement by the
   Syrian Greeks under Antiochus Epiphanes, which occurred b.c. 167. It
   was observed for eight days, was a patriotic observance much like our
   Fourth of July in spirit, and was celebrated in all the towns and
   cities of Judea as well as Jerusalem. It was instituted by the
   Maccabees who were priests and of the most rigid caste, and was
   observed only by the more rigid Jews; hence it is not strange that the
   adversaries of Christ on this occasion display unusual bigotry. (Joh
   10:22)

   22. It was winter. This feast came in December. This fact is probably
   mentioned to explain why the Savior walked in Solomon's porch. (Joh
   10:23)

   23. Waked in Solomon's porch. A long, covered colonnade, or veranda,
   with the roof resting on pillars. It is generally supposed to have been
   in the southeast part of the temple inclosure, overlooking the valley
   of the Kedron. Josephus describes it as a stadium, or furlong, in
   length, and as having three parts, two of them thirty feet wide each,
   and the middle one forty-five feet. Its height varied from fifty to one
   hundred in different parts. He contends that it was built by Solomon,
   which is, at least, doubtful. (Joh 10:24)

   24. Then came the Jews about him. Jesus was in a place of public resort
   and an opportunity was afforded for a decisive interview. They were
   determined to bring matters to a focus and hence came and surrounded
   him. It must be remembered that these were men of official station. How
   long dost thou keep us in suspense? Their question represents the
   uncertainty and discussion that prevailed in Jerusalem, rather than
   their own feelings. Their act related in verse 31, shows that they had
   made up their minds, but their demand that (Joh 10:25) he should tell
   whether he was the Christ shows the extent of the discussion in
   Jerusalem.

   25. I told you, and ye believed not. He had told them repeatedly (5:19;
   8:36, 56, 58), not as plainly, it is true, as he told the Samaritan
   woman (4:26) and the man blind from birth (9:37), but more plainly than
   he ever told his disciples before the confession of Peter (Matt.
   16:16). He knew what was in their hearts and he simply pointed them to
   his works, as he had done John the Baptist when his messengers came
   asking, "Art thou he that should come?" (Matt. 11:2-6.) Indeed the
   profoundest evidence of his divinity is not his word, but his
   superhuman life, teachings and works, especially the work that he has
   continued to do in the world. Even if he had said he was the Christ
   they would not have understood him, as their idea of the Christ
   differed as far as the poles from the real Christ. (Joh 10:26)

   26. Ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep. The reason of their
   unbelief was not the lack of proof, but the lack within themselves. He
   means, in substance, until my teachings and examples attract you so
   that you will follow me like my sheep, ye will not believe, for you
   cannot be convinced by purely intellectual arguments. You cannot
   believe in Christ as your personal Savior until you recognize and
   follow his examples as a man and prophet. It is the one who "will do
   his will that shall know the doctrine, whether it be of God" (7:17).
   Had they been attracted by his voice to follow him like sheep they
   would have believed. (Joh 10:27) (Joh 10:28)

   27, 28. I give unto them eternal life. I have omitted any special study
   of the phrase "eternal life" hitherto, although it has several times
   occurred in John. It occurs forty-four times in the New Testament, and
   of these occurrences seventeen are in the Fourth Gospel and six in the
   First Epistle of John, making twenty-three instances of its use by this
   single author. It never means simply endless existence, but always
   implies a blessed immortality. In Matt. 25:46, it is opposed to
   everlasting punishment, which is endless existence in a state of
   punishment, while eternal life is endless existence in a state of
   bliss. The word rendered life (zoee) means, in its primary sense,
   "existence" as opposed to non-existence or annihilation. In this sense
   it occurs thirteen times in the New Testament, of which (1 Cor. 15:19),
   "If in this life only we have hope, we are of all men the most
   miserable," is a good example. It is also used in the sense of
   spiritual life quite frequently and especially by John; for instance,
   "Ye will not come to me that ye might have life." It is also used
   without the adjective for eternal life as in John 5:29: "They that have
   done good shall come forth to the resurrection of life," or into a
   blessed existence beyond the grave.

   The word life, as used by John when predicated of God, means absolute
   being. Man created in the image of God hath this being from God and "in
   him lives and moves and has his being." A man may have this life and
   yet in another sense be dead. "Let the dead bury their dead" (Matt.
   8:22), "He that believeth . . . hath passed from death unto life" (John
   5:24), "This my son who was dead is alive again" (Luke 15:24). The
   usage of the New Testament sanctions the following conclusions:

   1. All humanity are endowed with existence (zoee), nor is there any
   indication that this existence ever comes to an end. At death man
   yields up the soul (psuchee, in classic Greek "the breath"), the spirit
   (pneuma) returns to God who gave it, but there is no indication that
   the existence (zoee) closes. When Christ said, "I lay down my life," he
   used psuchee instead of zoee. The same is true when he says, "He that
   loseth his life shall find it." Much confusion has arisen from not
   distinguishing these two Greek words of different meaning in the
   translation. The zoee, (life, existence) is never said to end, or
   perish. It is the psuchee (breath, or animal life), that is laid down,
   or perishes. Death and destruction are not used in the sense of
   non-existence.

   2. Life, in the sense of spiritual being, spiritual life, is the gift
   of Christ, and in its origin differs from the natural life. Those only
   have the spiritual life who are in union with Christ. He is the Bread
   of Life, the Water of Life, and came in order to bestow life (spiritual
   life, not mere existence) upon the world.

   3. Eternal life is the inheritance of all who have been born of water
   and the Spirit, who have the spiritual life, and who, "by a patient
   continuance in well doing, seek for glory, honor and immortality." It
   is the gift of Jesus Christ. It is a blessed immortality, and the
   phrase is never applied to an existence in a state of condemnation. The
   deathless angels that sinned do not have eternal life, but only those
   who have been freed from sin and delivered from the dominion of the
   grave by our Lord. It cannot be made too clear that eternal life is
   different from and higher than eternal existence and that therefore the
   fact that it is a gift does not imply that all who do not receive this
   gift are annihilated beyond the grave. The rich man in hades had
   existence beyond the grave but not eternal life; Lazarus, in Abraham's
   bosom, enjoying "good things," had eternal life. (Joh 10:29)

   29. No man, etc. It has been held that these verses teach the doctrine
   of the "final perseverance of the saints," or "once in grace always in
   grace." They rather teach that Christ watches over his sheep as a good
   shepherd; the sheep hear his voice; none that continue to hear his
   voice will ever perish, nor be plucked out of his hand. The condition
   is "hearing his voice," and upon this condition is based the promise.
   All who hear him shall be protected against their own weaknesses and
   against the strength of assailants from without. None shall ever fall
   away from want of divine grace, or the power of adversaries, but
   because they cease to hear his voice. My Father . . . is greater than
   all. These words are intended to give further an absolute assurance of
   the perfect safety of those who hear the voice of Christ. Even the
   Father's hand shall hold them, and out of his mighty hand none can
   pluck them. This safety rests upon the Fatherhood of God. (Joh 10:30)

   30. I and the Father are one. Not my, but the Father. Nor does he
   affirm that the Son and the Father are one, but here, in the presence
   of these Jews, he makes the statement that he and the Father are one,
   one in essence, one in purpose, and one in person, for he uses the
   plural verb. Since there is a unity of purpose and power the Father is
   pledged to protect the sheep that hear the voice of the Son. He says:
   "My sheep shall never perish, since my Father is greater than all, and
   he gave them into my hand, and I am one with him. (Joh 10:31)

   31. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. The word "again"
   carries us back to chapter 8:52. These high ecclesiasts held that he
   had just been guilty of blasphemy in asserting that he and the Father
   are one, the penalty of which was stoning, and they proposed to inflict
   it without a trial. The stones used in the temple repairs, which were
   still in progress, would furnish material. The manner in which the mob
   was arrested shows the wonderful moral power of Jesus. (Joh 10:32)

   32. Many good works . . . for which of those works do you stone me? In
   chapter 8:46 he had asked: Which of you convinceth me of sin? Now he
   calls for the specifications of the crime for which they have sentenced
   him. (Joh 10:33)

   33. For blasphemy . . . thou makest thyself God. They reply that they
   would stone him for blasphemy in that he made himself divine. This
   charge was often made against him. When he said, "Thy sins be forgiven
   thee," or spoke of God as his Father, or said that he and the Father
   were one, or when on trial before the Sanhedrim he declared that he was
   the Christ, the Son of God, it was uniformly pronounced blasphemy and
   it was on this charge that the Sanhedrim condemned him to death (Matt.
   26:65.) Had Jesus been only a man his words would have been
   blasphemous; they were appropriate to the Son of God. (Joh 10:34) (Joh
   10:35) (Joh 10:36)

   34, 35, 36. Is it not written . . I said ye are gods. The quotation is
   from Ps. 82, which contains a reproof of unjust judges: "I have said
   that ye are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High, but ye
   shall die like men and fall like one of the princes." The argument of
   Christ is: If in your law judges are called gods, and allowed to have,
   in some sense, the divine characteristics, and are called children of
   God, why should you pronounce me guilty of blasphemy for saying that I
   am the Son of God? And the Scripture cannot be broken. This parenthetic
   declaration is a very significant testimony to the inspiration of the
   Old Testament. Modern theologues who deal so freely with it find no
   warrant for their course in the example of Christ. Whom the Father hath
   sanctified. The word sanctify means "to make holy, or to set apart." It
   is here used in the latter sense. Son of God. There is no article
   before Son in the Greek. Some have regarded this whole passage as an
   explanation of the Sonship of Christ in a way that would make it
   possible for any good man to be a Son in the same sense. If it were the
   only passage in the New Testament bearing on the subject it might be so
   explained, but if the circumstances are regarded, it will be seen that
   there is nothing that conflicts with the statements of his divine
   character elsewhere. The Jews were about to rush upon him in a mob to
   stone him to death, because of his affirmation that he was the Son of
   God, and one with the Father. He arrested them by an appeal to those
   Scriptures that they held in such sanctity. He neither affirms nor
   discusses the difference of his relation to God from those whom the
   Scriptures had spoken of as gods because they were appointed judges of
   men, as God is Judge of all the earth, but demands why they should
   pronounce him a blasphemer for declaring that he was the Son of God,
   when their Scriptures had called men gods. See Exod. 22:28 as well as
   Ps. 82:6. We would not look for a revelation of the highest truths
   concerning Christ's nature to an angry mob, not that he would conceal
   or modify the truth to avert danger, but because they were in no
   condition to receive it, and he would only present such truths as their
   souls were in a condition to apprehend. For full information of
   Christ's character we must look to his quiet conferences with his own
   disciples. [7]See Chapter XIV. (Joh 10:37) (Joh 10:38)

   37, 38. If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. The passage
   just quoted from their law showed that those who did the work assigned
   to them by God were recognized, as in some sense, partakers of the
   divine nature. Christ, therefore, points to his own works as a test. If
   he does the works of the Father, then they should recognize in him the
   Sonship. He refers not to his miracles alone, but to his whole life,
   the effects of his ministry, and the divine mercy as well as power in
   his miracles. These works, of which they had ample knowledge, proved
   that "the Father was in him, and he in the Father." If they had
   prejudices against his person, they ought to consider the works without
   prejudice. The Father in me, and I in him. The Father is in the Son
   because he lives and moves in him; is the divine life that animates and
   controls the man Jesus; he is in the Father because a full partaker of
   the divine nature, filled with the divine will, purposes and desires,
   and animated by the one thought of doing the Father's work. (Joh 10:39)

   39. They sought again to take him. Not to stone him, for their passion
   had cooled, but to arrest him. His escape was not probably due to
   miracle, but with many friends among the throng, he could readily
   withdraw through their aid. "They dared not stone him, but as he was
   alone and defenseless in their midst, they tried to seize him. But they
   could not. His presence overawed them. They could only make a passage
   for him, and glare their hatred upon him as he passed from among them.
   But once more, here was a clear sign that all teaching among them was
   impossible. He could as little descend to their notions of a Messiah,
   as they could rise to his. To stay among them was but to daily imperil
   his life to no purpose. Judea was, therefore, closed to him, as Galilee
   was now closed to him. There seemed but one district to be remaining in
   his native land which was safe for him, and that was Perea, the
   district beyond the Jordan. He retired, therefore, to the other Bethany
   (Bethabara), the Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John had been
   baptizing and there he stayed."--Farrar.

   This ends three months of stormy ministry in Jerusalem. Twice there
   were attempts to mob him (8:59; 10:31); twice efforts to arrest him
   (7:32, 45; 10:39), and in addition secret plans for his assassination
   had been laid (7:19; 8:37). John is the only historian of this eventful
   period of the Savior's life, though several incidents reported by other
   writers may belong to the interval. (Joh 10:40)

   40. Went beyond Jordan . . where John at first baptized. For the time
   the Lord retired before the threatening storm. His "hour had not yet
   come," and would not until the passover, three months in the future. In
   this region, where John had done his work of preparation so thoroughly,
   a more friendly reception might be expected. (Joh 10:41) (Joh 10:42)

   41, 42. Many resorted to him. This Perean ministry was fruitful for
   "many believed on him," this being due to the fact that "all things
   John spake of this man were true."

   What were the incidents of this last stay, or the exact length of its
   continuance, we cannot certainly know. We see, however, that it was not
   exactly private, for John tells us that many resorted to him there, and
   believed on him, and bore witness that John--whom they held to be a
   prophet, though he had done no miracle--had borne emphatic witness to
   Jesus in that very place (John 1:28), and that all which he witnessed
   was true.--Farrar.

   In the other Gospels a number of incidents are recorded which are
   supposed to belong to this ministry beyond the Jordan. An example of
   these is found in the Savior's teaching upon the subject of divorce,
   found in Matthew 19:1-12.

Practical Observations.

   Christ and the Father are one; not one in person, but indissolubly
   blended in spirit, purpose, will and work, so much so that he that hath
   seen Christ hath seen the Father. This fact, that "he and the Father
   are one," is the basis of his prayer that all his followers shall be
   one, "even as he and the Father are one." Upon this, Maurice forcibly
   says: Do you think sects would last for even an hour, if there was not
   in the heart of each of them a witness for a fellowship that
   combinations and shibboleths did not create and which, thank God, this
   cannot destroy? The Shepherd makes his voice heard through all the
   noise and clatter of earthly shepherds; the sheep hear his voice and
   know that it is calling them into a common fold where all may rest and
   dwell together; and when once they understand the still deeper message
   which is uttering here, "I and my Father are one;" when they understand
   that the unity of the church and the unity of mankind depends on this
   eternal distinction and unity in God himself, and not on the authority
   or decrees of any mortal pastor, the sects will crumble to pieces, and
   there will be in very deed one flock and one Shepherd.

The Resurrection of Lazarus.

   The ministry of Christ was a manifestation of God in him; of the Father
   in the Son; of the Son by his own works and words. The miracles
   selected by John out of the great number wrought by the Redeemer, are
   chosen according to their bearing on this manifestation and reach their
   climax in the resurrection of Lazarus, the fitting prelude to the
   resurrection of the Lord himself from the dead. In this wonderful
   miracle he reveals himself as the Resurrection and the Life, the
   Conqueror of Death in his very dominions, while his own resurrection
   manifests him as having life in himself, the very fountain of life, and
   hence, divine. The other Gospels give no account of this part of the
   Savior's ministry.

   It was from a fruitful ministry beyond the Jordan that the Lord was
   recalled to Bethany near Jerusalem by the death of Lazarus. It is not
   in our power to determine certainly the exact time of the raising of
   Lazarus, but the order of the narrative shows that it was after the
   incidents of the last two lessons. In chapter 10:39, 40, we are
   informed that the Jews of Jerusalem attempted to seize him, that he
   escaped from them and retired beyond the Jordan into the locality where
   John had at first baptized. Then for a few weeks he engaged in
   teaching, and from thence he was summoned by the call to aid his friend
   Lazarus of Bethany. The Lord waits two days after receiving the message
   of the sisters before he starts to Bethany. Tholuck thinks that he
   could not have made the journey (probably about 30 miles) in a single
   day, and hence parts of two days were required. He supposes, therefore,
   that Lazarus died the night of the messenger's arrival, was buried the
   next day, and that Jesus reached Bethany on the fifth day. There was
   the day of death, two days of waiting, one of journeying, and the fifth
   day of arrival and his visit to the tomb. Abbott says: "I believe the
   resurrection of Lazarus took place in the latter part of February or
   the early part of March a.d. 30, and that it was followed, after a
   brief retirement to Ephraim, by the triumphal march of Christ and his
   disciples into Jerusalem, and by his Passion and death there." Why
   should John alone give the account of the resurrection of Lazarus? He
   alone gives the history of the ministry in Judea in which it occurred,
   though the other writers refer to that ministry. They alone give an
   account of the Galilean ministry, though John refers to it. Still there
   seemed to be special reasons why Matthew, Mark and Luke, who wrote many
   years before John, should be very reticent about the family of Bethany.
   All speak of it, but only Luke names the sisters. Farrar says: "There
   may have been special reasons for not recording a miracle which would
   have brought into dangerous prominence a man who was still living, but
   whom the Jews had sought to get rid of because he was a witness of
   Christ's wonder working power. (John 12:10.)" Long before John wrote,
   Jerusalem itself had been destroyed, and the reasons that may have
   caused the silence of the earlier writers no longer existed. (Joh 11:1)

   1. Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus. The name of Lazarus is
   not mentioned by any of the sacred writers but John, but his family is
   named or referred to by Matthew, Mark and Luke. With his sisters we
   know, from Luke 10:38, that Jesus had a previous acquaintance, and that
   is presupposed in John's narrative. It would seem from Luke's account
   that Martha was the head of the family, and therefore it is thought
   that Lazarus was a younger brother. Putting together John 12:1-11, and
   Matt. 26:6-13, and Mark 14:1-9, it seems certain that Simon the leper
   was in some way connected with the family, but just how is a matter of
   conjecture. The family was one of some property. They owned their
   house, had their tomb in a garden, and were able to give a costly token
   of honor to Christ in an alabaster box of ointment worth, when we
   compare with modern values, three hundred dollars. Bethany, the town of
   Mary and her sister Martha. It lies on the eastern slope of Olivet,
   about two miles from Jerusalem. It seems to have been the constant
   retreat of the Savior while sojourning at Jerusalem. It is
   distinguished from another Bethany beyond Jordan, and especially named
   as the home of the sisters who were such attached friends of Christ.
   Although John has not before named them, he speaks of them as well
   known. They had been named by Luke and were well known to the church at
   the late day when John wrote. (Joh 11:2)

   2. It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment. There were a
   number of Marys distinguished in gospel history, Mary the mother of the
   Lord, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Mark, Mary the wife of
   Cleophas. Hence, John, to distinguish this one, names an incident
   related by all the historians and known to every Christian reader. She
   was the one who anointed the Lord. For his own account of this, see
   chapter 12:1-11. (Joh 11:3)

   3. Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. In their distress the
   sisters turn to one whom they know to be a sympathizing friend. They
   have complete confidence in him and are assured he will do what is
   best. They do not urge any petition, but simply report their trouble.
   (Joh 11:4)

   4. This sickness is not unto death. Death was not its object. It had
   been permitted for another reason; viz., for the glory of God. He was
   glorified by the manifestation of the divine power of Christ in
   rescuing Lazarus from the jaws of death, as well as in the sublime
   teaching for which the case of Lazarus gave occasion. (Joh 11:5)

   5. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. This statement
   is made (1) to explain why the sisters sent to Christ such a message,
   and (2) to show that his delay was not caused by indifference. (Joh
   11:6)

   6. He abode still two days in the same place. He did not hurry off at
   once, probably because his work beyond Jordan was not yet completed.
   His great personal sympathy could not induce him to abandon a work that
   was only half done. His ministry was above the claims of friendship.
   Besides, his delay, and the long interval it caused between the burial
   of Lazarus and his resurrection, would make the miracle more striking,
   and would silence every caviller who might contend that Lazarus was not
   really dead. (Joh 11:7) (Joh 11:8)

   7, 8. Let us go into Judea again. His proposal to recross the Jordan,
   and to return to the locality where his enemies were gathered, was
   opposed by his disciples. They knew well that the authorities at
   Jerusalem had determined on his death; they therefore reminded him that
   he had just escaped from an attempt to stone him. Why should he return
   into the danger? (Joh 11:9) (Joh 11:10)

   9, 10. Are there not twelve hours in the day? The Jews always divided
   the space from sunrise to sunset into twelve hours, whether the days
   were long or short, the hours varying in length according to the season
   of year. There were twelve hours of the daylight, and during this
   daylight a man could see clearly where he was walking. Christ loved to
   speak by simile, and he declares in this way that he knows just what he
   purposes to do. He is not stumbling in the dark. He is not groping in
   the night or walking uncertainly. He has a clear pathway on which the
   sun is shining. Whether it leads him to Judea, to Jerusalem, to his
   enemies, to death, he will walk in the light. What was dark to them was
   clear as sunlight to him. God's true servants will have their twelve
   hours for walking and toil. (Joh 11:11)

   11. Our friend Lazarus sleepeth. It seems probable that an interval had
   passed after Christ's last words. Christ was wont to speak of death as
   a sleep. See Mark 5:39. In the order of things over which he presides,
   death is death no longer, but assumes the character of a temporary
   slumber.--Godet. To speak of death as a sleep, is an image common, I
   suppose, to all languages and nations. Thereby the reality of death is
   not denied, but only the fact implicitly assumed, that death, will be
   followed by a resurrection, as sleep is by an awakening.--Trench. The
   term sleep is used as a symbol of death in 2 Chron. 14:1; Psalms 13:8;
   Jer. 51:57; Job 14:12; Dan. 12:2; Matt. 27:52; Acts 7:60; 1 Cor. 7:39;
   1 Thes. 4:13. (Joh 11:12) (Joh 11:13) (Joh 11:14)

   12, 13, 14. If he sleep, he will do well. The disciples took the Lord's
   words literally. They were all interested in the case of Lazarus and
   regarded him as a friend, but did not wish Jesus to return to the
   vicinity of Jerusalem; hence, they intimate that if he was sleeping the
   case was hopeful and there was little need for the Lord's presence.
   Often a quiet sleep is the turning point of the disease and a presage
   of recovery. An ancient sage said: "Sleep is a remedy for every
   disease." Hence, it was needful for the Master to tell them that he
   referred to the sleep of death. Some skeptical writers have thought
   that the disciples were very stupid, not to understand him at first.
   Their mistake was a very natural one. (Joh 11:15)

   15. I am glad for your sakes that I was not there. Had he been at the
   home of Lazarus before his death he would have felt constrained to heal
   him. Such a miracle would have been less striking and less proof of his
   divine power than the one which would now take place. For the sake of
   his disciples, for the sake of their increase in faith, for a
   demonstration of his mastery of the realms of death, he was glad of the
   opportunity to do what he proposed to do, to the end that they might
   believe. To bring back from the shades of death a man four days buried,
   after decomposition began, was as mighty a manifestation of divine
   power as to create a world. (Joh 11:16)

   16. Then said Thomas, called Didymus. "Thomas the Twin," one of the
   apostles, the doubter after the Lord's resurrection. See John 20:24-29.
   Let us go also, that we may die with him. He looked upon his return to
   Jerusalem, where the hate of him was so intense, where his death was
   already determined, where his enemies resided, as a return to certain
   death. The remark of Thomas shows a true-hearted fidelity and
   illustrates the power of Jesus to bind men to him. For him and with him
   Thomas was willing to die.

   Christ might have reached Bethany on the evening of the first day's
   journey, but more probably about midday of the second. On his arrival
   he paused without the village for some reason. He was close to
   Jerusalem, the seat of his deadly enemies; while he never shrank from
   danger, neither did he rush heedlessly into it, and it was therefore
   desirable that the Lord should act with caution. (Joh 11:17)

   17. He found that he had lain in the grave four days already. Christ
   had in Galilee raised two persons from the dead, one soon after death;
   the other from the bier on which he was carried to burial. Now, in
   Judea, right at Jerusalem, in the face of his enemies, and just before
   his own death and burial, a crowning miracle is to be wrought. He will
   demonstrate that he is "the Resurrection and the Life" by demanding
   back from the grave one buried, buried four days, a period so long that
   in that hot climate decomposition had begun. The miracle is to be
   wrought under circumstances such that the most captious cannot question
   the reality of the death, or the resurrection. (Joh 11:18)

   18. Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem. It was on the eastern slope of
   Mt. Olivet, distant fifteen stadia, or furlongs. The stadium was 600
   feet, so that the distance was 9,000 feet, or a little less than two
   miles. (Joh 11:19)

   19. And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary. By "Jews" John
   distinguishes the inhabitants of Judea and usually means those of
   influence or official character. They came to "comfort." Pharisaism
   arranged that friends and professional mourners should, after the
   funeral, sit with the afflicted on the floor, silent, unless the latter
   spoke, but always ready to take up the word and add some instruction.
   Thirty days of mourning were prescribed, divided into three periods,
   with rigid rules for each period. (Joh 11:20)

   20. Martha . . . went and met him. Where Christ, either from caution,
   or because the mourning customs were offensive to him, or that the
   family might be prepared, had paused. The bustling, active sister, the
   type of all the Marthas, goes; the quiet Mary, so absorbed that she did
   not hear the message, remains. (Joh 11:21) (Joh 11:22)

   21, 22. If thou hadst been here, etc. These words express a conviction,
   a lamentation and a slight degree of reproach, all combined. She cannot
   realize that "All things work for good to them that love God" and
   groans in her sorrow, but at the same time intimates a faint hope, that
   she hardly dares to express, in the words, "I know, that even now,
   whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee." She had a
   hope, probably hardly defined in her own mind. (Joh 11:23) (Joh 11:24)

   23, 24. Thy brother shall rise again. Martha does not understand this
   as an assurance that Lazarus shall be raised now, nor do I know that
   the Savior wished her so to understand it. His object was to lead her
   to a higher faith in himself as the "Resurrection and the Life." She
   declares her belief that he will rise at the last day, a belief that
   she held in common with all Jews except the Sadducees. (Joh 11:25)

   25. I am the resurrection, and the life. She had declared her belief in
   the resurrection. Christ makes the grand, striking declaration that he
   is the RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE, words that never could have fallen
   from the lips of a sane mortal. They mean that he is the power which
   opens every grave, gives life to the sleepers, and calls them forth to
   a new existence; that the life that endows men with eternal being is in
   him and proceeds from him. In the light of his own resurrection they
   mean that when he burst open the tomb he did it for humanity and in him
   humanity has won the victory over death. His utterance was far above
   what mere man could utter; it proclaimed a divine being and power, but
   the resurrection of Lazarus, a few moments later, was the demonstration
   of the truth of his words. His utterance was grander than man, Godlike,
   but immediately followed by a Godlike act in demonstration. It is
   another mode of declaring the same truth uttered when he told the
   Samaritans that he was the Water of Life, or the Galileans that he was
   the Bread of Life. (Joh 11:26)

   26. Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Those dead,
   who believed in him, shall be raised and live, and those living who
   believe, shall never perish. Death will only be a change to a better
   existence and is to be disregarded. Whoever has faith in Christ, has
   Christ in him the hope of glory, never knows death, but passes at once
   "to be with Christ," to join the "general assembly and church of the
   first born whose names are written in heaven." There is no purgatory,
   no dismal Hades, no long period of unconsciousness, no death, because
   there is no cessation of their life in Christ. (Joh 11:27)

   27. I believe that thou art the Christ, etc. He asks about her faith.
   She responds by the good confession that embraces all, Martha's creed,
   Peter's creed, the true "Apostles' creed," the only creed of the
   Apostolic church. (Joh 11:28) (Joh 11:29) (Joh 11:30)

   28, 29, 30. Called Mary her sister secretly. The Lord had evidently
   directed her to do this, for she said, "The Master calleth for thee."
   At once, with a promptitude that shows her joy, Mary arose and hastened
   out of the town to the place where the Lord still tarried. (Joh 11:31)

   31. She goeth to the grave to weep there. The message to Mary was
   secret. When she suddenly arose and left hurriedly the only explanation
   that suggested itself to the Jews was that she had gone to weep at the
   tomb, a custom of Jewish women. They at once followed obtrusively, thus
   preventing a private interview of the Master with Mary such as he had
   had with Martha. (Joh 11:32)

   32. She fell down at his feet. Her act depicts her grief, her
   dependence, and her faith in Christ. Her words are the same that Martha
   had uttered. Had the Lord been there her brother would not have died.
   (Joh 11:33) (Joh 11:34)

   33, 34. He groaned in spirit and was troubled. The word rendered
   "groaned," undoubtedly means "was indignant" and is so rendered in the
   margin of the Revision. Jesus was deeply moved by the grief of Mary,
   but the hypocritical weeping of the Jews who followed her and who were
   acting according to the rules, filled him with indignation. Instead of
   pausing to console Mary, he asked at once for the place of sepulture.
   Empty forms were odious to him. (Joh 11:35)

   35. Jesus wept. The shortest verse in the Bible and one of the most
   touching. I see in the Lord weeping over the sins of Jerusalem, the
   Prophet; but in the Lord weeping at the tomb of Lazarus, the Brother.
   (Joh 11:36) (Joh 11:37)

   36, 37. Behold how he loved him! Some of the Jews were touched by his
   evidence of tender affection. Others, remembering the healing of the
   blind man right there at Jerusalem, asked if he could not have saved
   Lazarus from death. The latter, however, spoke sneeringly in all
   probability. The occurrence of the words "groaning in himself" (was
   indignant) in verse 38, shows that there was something in their words
   to provoke his displeasure. The Greek particle rendered "And," means
   rather "but" and is so rendered by the Revision. Their argument is
   rather: "If he opened the eyes of a blind man, why could he not save a
   friend from death?" (Joh 11:38)

   38. Jesus . . . cometh to the grave. Graves were sometimes cut
   perpendicularly in the rock, as we dig them in the earth, and sometimes
   were horizontally cut into the side of the hill. Sometimes natural
   eaves were selected and sometimes artificial. This family vault was a
   cave, closed by a stone that covered the entrance. For references to
   graves see Genesis 23:9 and 35:8; 1 Kings 2:24; Isaiah 14:15 and 22:16;
   Matthew 27:60; John 19:41. (Joh 11:39) (Joh 11:40)

   39, 40. Take ye away the stone. The large stone that closed the
   entrance and which several persons would be required to remove. The
   practical Martha at once interposes. The body had been four days in the
   tomb, a period so long that decomposition must have begun. It will be
   offensive. She seems to have thought that the Lord's object was to look
   upon the dead body of his friend. He reminds her of his promise,
   conditioned upon their faith, contained in the message sent them (see
   verse 4). Their faith was to be shown, not in expectation, but in
   faithful obedience to his commands. Martha, at once, ceased to object,
   and the stone was removed. Faith, manifested in obedience, is a
   fundamental condition of divine blessing. (Joh 11:41) (Joh 11:42)

   41, 42. And Jesus lifted up his eyes. The Son always sought to honor
   the Father and to show that the Father was in him as he was in the
   Father. I thank thee that thou hast heard me. Constantly in communion
   with the Father he had the Father's answer already and assent to what
   he was about to do. Thou hearest me always. Even in Gethsemane, when
   the cup was not taken away; but he was now thankful that God had
   assented to his prayer, because such a miracle would induce the people
   to "believe that God had sent him." (Joh 11:43)

   43. He cried in aloud voice. A suggestion of the "voice like the sound
   of many waters" (Rev. 1:15) at which all who are in their graves shall
   come forth (1 Thess. 4:16). It was the voice of authority. Lazarus,
   come forth. "Lazarus, here, out," is the literal rendering of the
   Greek; two words, simple, efficacious. (Joh 11:44)

   44. And he that was dead came forth. The earth had never beheld a more
   wonderful or startling sight. At once the sleeper arose, came forth
   from the dark and cold bed where he had lain for four days, bound with
   his grave clothes, with the napkin still upon his face that had been
   bound under his jaw to keep it from falling. The lookers on,
   astonished, dazed, were only recalled to themselves, when the Lord bade
   them "Loose him and let him go." The winding sheet would interfere with
   his motion. A being with whom to will is to do, is divine. God said,
   Let there be light, and there was light. Christ said to the buried
   Lazarus, Come forth! and he came. There was not a moment's delay. So in
   all his miracles. Nature heard his voice at once. He spoke and it was
   done.

   This miracle, the climax of the wonderful works of Christ, and the
   immediate cause of final plans for the arrest and crucifixion, is
   related only by John. The other Gospels describe the raising of the son
   of the widow of Nain, and of the daughter of Jairus, but are silent
   concerning the resurrection at Bethany. Much wonder has been expressed
   at this silence and I can find no better explanation than that, during
   the intense hostility that existed in Judea during the earlier years of
   Christianity, to have pointed out Lazarus by name would have endangered
   his life, but when John wrote the power of Judaism had been forever
   broken. The significance of this miracle, as an evidence that Christ is
   a divine being, has always been acknowledged, and those who dispute
   this have attempted various rationalistic explanations. There are three
   of these: 1. The mythical, of which Strauss is the author, which holds
   that the story is a myth which grew up out of some slight foundation,
   assumed its present shape in the second or third century, and was
   interpolated in this Gospel by some forger, who used John's name to
   give sanction to the story. This theory, in substance, is that John did
   not write the account. The positive evidence that John wrote the Fourth
   Gospel (see [8]Introduction) refutes this hypothesis. 2. The second
   theory is that the story was created to illustrate the truth that
   Christ is the resurrection and the life. The simplicity of the
   narrative, giving life-like details without the slightest air of
   fiction, or any attempt whatever to give a coloring or draw
   conclusions, is a refutation of this speculation. 3. Renan suggests
   that the miracle was a pious fraud, contrived by the Bethany family and
   the friends of Jesus to give eclat to his anticipated entry into
   Jerusalem, and that he lent himself to this fraud in a moment of
   intense fanatical enthusiasm. The folly of such an explanation is shown
   by its utter inconsistency with the character of Christ as portrayed by
   Renan himself, and as acknowledged by other skeptical writers, such as
   Rousseau and John Stuart Mill. The account recorded by John is plain,
   matter of fact, crowded with minute and natural details, exhibits no
   marks of painting and draws no conclusions. It is told as an eye
   witness would tell the story who had no opinions of his own upon the
   subject. He does not even say that a miracle was wrought, or the dead
   raised, but tells what he saw and leaves the reader to draw his own
   conclusions. Even a scientific commission could not report the facts
   with more absolute impartiality. Had the writer invented the story for
   the sake of glorifying his Master there would have been indications of
   his purpose in pointing out the power and glory of him at whose word,
   Lazarus come forth! the dead came forth wrapped in the robes of the
   tomb. Had he invented it in order to prove some doctrine, there would
   have been an indication of this in the application. Instead, it is just
   such a story as might be expected from an intelligent, honest,
   impartial eye-witness, and almost all readers, both friends and foes,
   have come to the only reasonable conclusion,--that it is a genuine and
   faithful account of a real resurrection from the dead.

Practical Observations.

   1. In our troubles we should send a message for Christ, as did the
   sisters of Bethany.

   2. Even if Christ delays his response we should not doubt that our
   troubles are for the glory of God and our own good. "All things work
   for good," etc.

   3. We should look upon Christ always as an all-sufficient helper. If
   present he can always deliver. "If thou hadst been here my brother had
   not died."

   4. We should always be assured of the tender sympathy of the Lord. "He
   can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities." He weeps with those
   who weep and rejoices with those who rejoice.

   5. We should never forget that He is the Fountain of Life; the
   Resurrection and the Life. If we have eaten the Bread of Life, drunk
   the Water of Life, have Christ the hope of glory formed in us, we have
   eternal life. It is begun. We are immortal. We shall never die. What is
   called death

     "Is only a narrow sea That divides the heavenly land from ours."

   6. We have been told that there is inscribed on the monument over the
   clay of the infidel Hume, at Edinburg, Scotland, I AM THE RESURRECTION
   AND THE LIFE. In that grand truth is the hope of mankind.

   7. As he cried to Lazarus, Come forth, so shall he speak with the voice
   of an archangel to all that are in their graves and they shall come
   forth and live.

   8. "I go, that I may awake him out of sleep." There seems to me to be
   contained in these few words one of the most powerful charms in the
   world to lull the bitterness of death, and to make us anxious to become
   such that we may humbly apply them to ourselves.--Thomas Arnold.

The Sanhedrim in Session.

   45. Many of the Jews who came to Mary. Verse 19 speaks of many Jews of
   Jerusalem who came to the house of Martha and Mary. Verse 31 speaks of
   them remaining in the house with Mary and following her when she went
   forth; now, therefore, they are named in connection with her. Believed
   on him. They had seen what had been done and were compelled to believe
   that Jesus was a man of God. (Joh 11:46)

   46. But some . . went to the Pharisees. They, as was usual, divided
   into two classes. Others, though unable to explain the miracle, were
   hostile and went at once to the Pharisees with a report. As this sect
   was now in declared enmity to Christ, this report was no doubt an
   unfriendly act. (Joh 11:47)

   47. The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council.
   The chief priests, including Caiaphas, the acting high priest, and
   Annas, who had been high priest, as well as other great hierarchs, were
   Sadducees and the leaders of that party. The old feuds between them and
   the Pharisees were now forgotten and the two great sects unite in a
   call for a meeting of the Sanhedrim. This session is a notable event.
   It is the first case recorded in the Gospels where we meet with a
   formal account of the meeting of this great body. This meeting settles
   on the plans that are henceforth pushed with vigor and which lead a few
   weeks later to the arrest, trial and condemnation of Christ. For an
   account of the Sanhedrim [9]see notes on chapter 1:19. What do we? They
   do not ask what they shall do, but reproach themselves that they are
   doing nothing. "This man," a designation intended to show contempt, is
   doing many miracles and yet we are idle, doing nothing to counteract
   their influence. This body admitted the miracles and was without
   excuse. As at least two of the members were afterwards Christians,
   Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, it would be easy to learn what
   passed on this note-worthy occasion. (Joh 11:48)

   48. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe. They take it for
   granted that his miracles were calculated to produce belief. They also
   held that the people would regard him the Messiah and would rise in
   insurrection, or raise tumults that would induce the Romans to
   interfere. The Romans . . . will take away our place and nation. The
   Romans were already there, for Judea was a Roman province, there was a
   Roman governor, and also a Roman garrison was stationed in the tower of
   Antonia overlooking the temple itself. But they had their place still,
   were priests with great revenues, or members of the Sanhedrim with
   great power. If there were seditions they might lose "their place," as
   they did a generation later. To take away "their place" would be to
   destroy the ecclesiastical organization, while to destroy the civil
   organization would be to take away "the nation" in the sense they used
   the term. (Joh 11:49)

   49. Caiaphas, being high priest that year. John does not mean that the
   high priesthood was an annual office, but places the emphasis on "that
   year." With him the "year of our Lord" was the year of his death. In
   that ever memorable year Caiaphas was high priest. Caiaphas was a
   Sadducee, a crafty, powerful, unscrupulous man, who was high priest in
   all for eighteen years, from a.d. 18 to a.d. 36, an unusual tenure of
   office in those times when the Romans made and unmade high priests at
   will, there being twenty-five in the century preceding the fall of
   Jerusalem. Ye know nothing at all. "Ye" is the emphatic word. "Ye who
   dwell on these scruples and fears do not even know the simplest rule of
   statesmanship, that one must be sacrificed to the many." The proud
   Sadducee contrasts the timid, hesitating policy of others with his
   fixed, clear policy of putting Jesus to death. His language is bitterly
   sarcastic and he charges the Sanhedrim with blindness to its own
   interest. (Joh 11:50)

   50. Nor consider that it is expedient for us. What was "expedient for
   us" was the main thing to consider. This required "one man to die for
   the people (laos, Jewish race in its relation to God), that the whole
   nation (ethnos, the nation as a civil organization) perish not." The
   word "nation" is applied many times to the Jews, in the singular, but
   never in the plural. It is then translated "Gentiles." (Joh 11:51)

   51. This he spake not of himself. He thought he spoke it of himself,
   but unwittingly he uttered a prophecy. The high priest represented the
   divine headship of the Jewish nation and through him, of old, an
   inspired decision was given on questions of doubt. So Caiaphas by
   virtue of his office utters a prophecy, and like Balaam, while wickedly
   counseling the death of Christ, interprets the results of his death
   truly. (Joh 11:52)

   52. Should gather in one the children of God. Christ died for his
   enemies, for the Jewish nation, and not for it alone, but his death
   broke down the barrier between Jew and Gentile and made friends of the
   hostile clans and nations of the earth. Jew, Gentile, Indian, African
   and Anglo-Saxon;--all who are gathered into him, are brethren and are
   drawn to each other by the ties of universal brotherhood. What Rome
   could not do with the sword was accomplished by the cross when Christ
   was nailed there, and there was cemented in his blood the foundations
   of a universal empire in which there would be neither Jew nor Greek,
   bond nor free, male nor female, but all one in the Lord. (Joh 11:53)

   53. From that day they took counsel. From the time of this meeting they
   were brought over to the policy of Caiaphas and steadfast in carrying
   out their plans for the death of Christ. Here is the official
   culmination of Jewish hatred, and what had been a decree before (5:18)
   now becomes a settled plan. John points out the development and
   successive steps of this enmity and the reader can trace them by
   consulting 5:16-18; 7:32, 45; 8:59; 9:22; 10:39; 11:47. (Joh 11:54)

   54. Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews. The Savior
   once more retired from Jerusalem to avoid the blow that was ready to be
   struck and retired for a short time into a city called Ephraim. Its
   location is not surely known, but it is supposed to be an Ophrah named
   in Joshua 18:23, called Ephraim in 2 Chron. 13:19, and now a village
   called et Taiyibeh. It is about sixteen miles northeast of Jerusalem on
   the borders of a wild wilderness region. To this place the Lord must
   have retired immediately after the resurrection of Lazarus, and here he
   remained until six days before the passover. His "disciples," meaning
   more especially the apostles, were with him in this retirement, and he
   was, no doubt, actively engaged in training them for their great work.
   This was his last retirement from Jerusalem and he went from Ephraim to
   attend his last passover and to die. (Joh 11:55)

   55. The Jews' passover was near at hand. It could not have been more
   than a few weeks away when he went to Ephraim. Many went out of the
   country. They gathered to the great national festivals, not only from
   all parts of Judea and Galilee, but from the foreign countries where
   Jews were scattered abroad. To purify themselves. They came in advance
   of the time of the passover that they might have time to purify
   themselves from ceremonial uncleanness before the feast. Though no
   special rites of purification were enjoined before the passover, yet
   the people were expected to purify themselves before any important
   event (Exodus 19:10, 11), and were accustomed to go through certain
   special rites of purification before the passover (2 Chron. 30:13-20).
   (Joh 11:56)

   56. Then sought they for Jesus. There was a restless curiosity among
   these country people to know more of the wonderful Teacher of whom they
   had heard so much. As they gathered in groups in the temple they
   discussed the probability of his coming, and that the more eagerly as
   they knew that, (Joh 11:57)

   57. The chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment. The
   Sanhedrim had published an edict commanding any man who knew of his
   whereabouts to reveal it in order that they might take him. Godet is of
   the opinion that this order was given to intimidate Christ and his
   disciples so as to prevent their coming to the passover. They certainly
   could have traced him to Ephraim and when he did appear they had to lay
   their plans very carefully and nearly a week passed before they dared
   to arrest him. Lightfoot reports a Jewish tradition that, during forty
   days preceding the passover, an officer of the Sanhedrim "publicly
   proclaimed that this man, who by his imposture had seduced the people,
   ought to be stoned, and that any one who could say aught in his defence
   was to come forward and speak. But no one doing so he was hanged on the
   evening before the passover." It maybe that John refers to some such
   proclamation.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  Chapter XII.

   John shows a logical order in developing the causes of the hostility of
   the Jewish authorities to Christ, which is not found in the other
   Gospels. From the time when, at his first passover, the Lord drove the
   money changers out of the temple, their hatred had grown deeper at
   every fresh visit to Jerusalem, until, just before his retirement to
   Ephraim, the Sanhedrim had officially resolved upon his death as soon
   as it could be brought about on some charge that would be plausible in
   the eyes of the Roman rulers. The Lord knew full well that his "hour
   was at hand" and went into retirement before the storm, not to escape
   his fate, but to defer it until the appointed time at the passover. As
   that time approached he left Ephraim and, it seems, crossed over to the
   east of the Jordan, joined the crowds that were hastening to the feast,
   and crossing the Jordan near Jericho, passed through that city, where
   he healed the blind men, converted Zaccheus and abode at his house.
   From thence he went with his disciples and the crowds of pilgrims, who
   then thronged the thoroughfares, along the winding route that led
   through the mountain passes from the plain of Jericho up to Jerusalem.
   Reaching Bethany he parted from the throngs and stopped to rest in the
   home of friends who were among the truest he had on earth. There is a
   difference of opinion among scholars whether he arrived at Bethany on
   the evening of the Sabbath day or the day before. It is well to admit
   that there is much disagreement concerning the exact date of several of
   the momentous events of the week, extending from the arrival of the
   Lord in Bethany until his resurrection. Even the "six days before the
   passover" has been variously interpreted by the commentators. Andrews,
   whose chronology I have usually followed, and who is one of the best of
   authorities on chronological questions, adopts Friday as the date of
   the arrival at Bethany, and supposes that the Lord left Jericho,
   eighteen miles from Jerusalem, in the morning, reaching Bethany about
   sunset, and stopped with his apostles over the Sabbath. In the evening
   of the next day, the Sabbath, the feast was made at the house of Simon
   the leper. The events of this most wonderful week in the history of the
   world are tabulated as follows:

   other scheme and I shall follow it, not as certain, but as supported by
   the best authorities and most probable. Reasons will be given, under
   different heads, for the date assigned to the events considered.

Anointed for Burial.

   One cannot enter upon the study of the portion of the Gospel that now
   opens before us without feeling that he is entering upon the most
   tender, solemn and sacred portion of the sacred story. This journey to
   Jerusalem is the last journey, is the Lord's last appeal to that
   untoward generation, is the history of the Lamb consciously going to
   the altar of sacrifice, the innocent and holy condemned one seeking his
   doom. A little later Paul went to Jerusalem "knowing that bonds and
   imprisonment awaited him;" but now the Lord goes knowing that he is
   certainly going the cross.

   The account of the feast at Bethany is given by Matthew, chapter XXVI
   and Mark, chapter XIV. These accounts, although differing somewhat in
   details, no doubt describe the same occurrence that John narrates in
   the present passage. The anointing described by Luke in chapter VII, is
   regarded by all the commentators as a different affair which occurred
   in Galilee at the house of a Pharisee named Simon. The only serious
   apparent discrepancy between the accounts of John and the earlier
   writers is that they seem to locate the feast at Bethany two days
   before the passover. It should be kept in mind, however, that neither
   Matthew nor Luke adhere to the chronological order of Christ's
   ministry, nor do they assert that the feast took place two days before
   the passover. That date is assigned to a meeting of the Sanhedrim held
   to devise means to seize the Savior by craft, and at this meeting an
   opportunity presents itself in the offer of one of the apostles to
   betray his Master by leading a band of armed men to his resting place
   at night. Then these evangelists naturally go back to give an account
   of the feast at Bethany where the disappointment of Judas developed his
   purpose to sell his Lord. This account they throw in as an episode, and
   then return to the plot of the Sanhedrim and the treachery of Judas. It
   is but just to admit that some judicious scholars hold that Matthew and
   Mark give the real date of the feast, and insist that John declares the
   time when Christ came to Bethany, but not the time of the feast. The
   attention John usually gives to the order of events, his language, and
   the probabilities are opposed to this view. (Joh 12:1)

   1. Then Jesus six days before the passover. The passover meal was the
   beginning of the feast of unleavened bread, which lasted for seven
   days. The whole paschal week was termed the feast of unleavened bread;
   the passover was, strictly speaking, the 15th of Nisan, "the great day
   of the feast." Jesus reached Bethany on Friday, rested the Sabbath day
   or Saturday, and the feast took place on Saturday evening, after the
   Sabbath ended. Bethany. A village about two miles east of Jerusalem
   (John 11:18), being on the other side of the Mount of Olives. It was
   the home of Mary and Martha, where Christ was wont to visit when in
   Jerusalem (Luke 10:38-41; Matt. 21:17; Mark 11:11, 12). It was the
   scene of the resurrection of Lazarus (John, chap. 11), and of Christ's
   own ascension (Luke 24:50). It is not mentioned in the Old
   Testament.--Abbott.

   Then is rendered by the Revision more correctly "therefore." It marks a
   close connection with what precedes, and especially with 11:55, which
   speaks of the approaching passover and the gathering multitudes. We
   have seen the Lord retiring for a season from the vicinity of
   Jerusalem, out of the immediate presence of the rulers who had now
   officially decided upon his death, and secluding himself in the quiet
   retreat of Ephraim in order to wait for this very passover. As he had
   been present at two preceding feasts, and as Jerusalem has been the
   principal seat of his ministry for about six months, it is not strange
   that the great topic of conversation among the pilgrims was whether he
   would come to the passover. Would the well-known purpose of the
   Sanhedrim keep him away? "Therefore, he came six days before the
   passover," though fully apprised of their designs, and conscious that
   they would be carried out at that very time. Nor was there any
   concealment about his coming. As we learn from the other Gospels, he
   crossed the Jordan from Ephraim and joined in Perea, the immense crowds
   who were hastening to Jerusalem, moved through Jericho in a kind of
   triumphal procession, with vast multitudes thronging his steps, and
   moving with them to Bethany, parted from them, not to seek seclusion,
   but to attend a public feast. The time for all concealment was now
   past, and in the scenes at Jericho, the feast at Bethany, the kingly
   march into Jerusalem, the second cleansing of the temple and the final
   appeal to Jerusalem recorded in Matthew XXI., he not only seemed to
   seek publicity, but to invite the malice of his enemies to do its
   worst. (Joh 12:2)

   2. There they made him a supper; and Martha served. It is not said at
   whose house the feast took place, only that it was at Bethany, that
   Martha served, that Lazarus was one of those at the table, and that
   Mary was there. Matthew and Mark say that it took place at the house of
   "Simon the leper." Of him we know nothing and all is conjecture. He may
   have been the father of the three, or the husband of Martha, or some
   other relative. He may have been dead and Martha his widow. Christ may
   have healed him of his leprosy. The only thing certain is that the
   feast was at his house; the Bethany family were there, and Martha was
   active in providing the feast. The feast may have been made by the
   citizens of Bethany in his honor, in gratitude for the wonderful
   miracle that he had restored one of their townsmen to life. "They" has
   no antecedent expressed and is as likely to refer to the people as any
   one else. In that case there is no need for supposing any relationship
   to the Bethany family. Martha, in accordance with all that we have
   learned of her active, practical nature, would be busy "serving;" Mary
   would naturally be forgetful of all else but her beloved Lord. We are
   told that a favorite time with the Jews for a feast was the evening
   after the Sabbath day had passed. (Joh 12:3)

   3. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly.
   Spikenard, from which the ointment was, made, was an aromatic herb of
   the valerian family. It was imported from an early age from Arabia,
   India, and the Far East. It was the costliest anointing oil of
   antiquity, and was sold throughout the Roman Empire, where it fetched a
   price that put it beyond any but the wealthy. Mary had bought a vase or
   flask of it containing twelve ounces. And anointed the feet of Jesus.
   We learn from the other accounts some additional facts. The ointment
   was contained in an alabaster vase which she broke. It was all for
   Christ. Nothing was kept back. She anointed first his head, and then
   his feet. She came up behind as he reclined at table and poured it on
   his head, and then stooped down to his feet. It must be borne in mind
   that the Jews did not sit but reclined at table with their feet
   extended behind. The anointing of the head was also a distinction which
   was conferred upon the guest of honor (Luke 7:46),--not only among the
   Jews, but generally in the East, and among the ancients. In connection
   with the anointing of the head, was the washing of the feet with water.
   Thus it was an elevation of the custom to the highest point of honor
   when the head and the feet were alike anointed with oil. Wiped his feet
   with her hair. The same is said of "a woman that was a sinner" (Luke
   7:37). That occurrence took place in Galilee and is a different
   incident. That woman washed his feet with her tears of sorrow; those of
   Mary were tears of gratitude. The house was filled with the odor. The
   ointments were very fragrant. Perhaps the rich perfume was the first
   intimation to many of what had been done. Service to Christ is full of
   fragrance to all within reach of its influence. (Joh 12:4)

   4. Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot. Matthew (26:8)
   states that "the disciples" had indignation; Mark reports that "some
   had indignation;" John (12:4), as knowing who had whispered the first
   word of blame, fixes the uncharitable judgment on "Judas Iscariot,
   Simon's son." The narrow, covetous soul of the traitor could see
   nothing in the lavish gift but a "waste." His indignation, partly real,
   partly affected, was perhaps honestly shared by some of his
   fellow-disciples. His own soul was too narrow and sordid to rejoice
   over the honor done the Savior. (Joh 12:5)

   5. Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence? About $45. A
   penny here is the denarius, a Roman silver coin worth 15 to 17 cents.
   The wretch, who is just going to sell the only Son of God for 30 pence
   (pieces of silver), values at 300 a little ointment, perfume, and
   vapor.--Quesnel. As the penny, or denarius, was the price of a day's
   labor then, and would buy as much as a dollar now, the whole sum would
   be equivalent to $300 now, a sum large enough to arouse the greed of
   Judas. So costly a treasure shows that the Bethany family possessed
   considerable wealth. Given to the poor. He cared nothing for the poor.
   This was only a pretext. Those who are the best friends of Christ will
   do most for the poor. (Joh 12:6)

   6. Because he had the bag. Judas was treasurer of the little company.
   They must have had a meagre purse; and it was too much for him to see
   all this money thrown away on the mere sentiment of love, when it might
   have gone into their treasury, from which he could steal it, for he was
   a thief. But he concealed his true motive, and gained the really good
   disciples over to his side by pleading the love of the poor. He was the
   type of all those treasurers, cashiers, etc., who steal trust funds.
   (Joh 12:7)

   7. Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
   Their indignation was roused against the poor, shrinking Mary as if she
   had robbed them. No doubt Judas felt as if he had been robbed. Then
   Christ interposed with authority and silenced them, adding a
   commendation, saying, "She has anticipated the hour of my decease;
   anointing my body before death, and thus preparing it for burial." It
   is worthy of note that this was all the anointing which our Lord's body
   received from the hand of Mary or her female friends, inasmuch as he
   had risen before they reached the sepulchre with their spices. It was,
   therefore, in verity, an anointing beforehand, although she was not
   aware of the full import of her act of love. (Joh 12:8)

   8. For the poor always ye have with you. You will have plenty of
   opportunities to aid them; and the more they did for their Master, the
   more they would do for the poor, for the poor are left in his stead,
   and through them will be expressed the increased love of the Master. It
   is the want of love, not of money, that allows any poor to suffer; so
   that all gifts to Christ which increase our love will increase the
   gifts to the poor. (Joh 12:9)

   9. Much people of the Jews therefore know that he was there. The
   language indicates that he tarried there for several days, from Friday
   till Sunday, and throngs came to see him. He was not seeking privacy
   now. (Joh 12:10) (Joh 12:11)

   10, 11. The chief priests consulted . . . . . put Lazarus to death.
   Lazarus was a living testimonial to the divine power of Christ and they
   desired to get him out of the way. (Joh 12:12)

   12. On the next day. This was Sunday, often called Palm Sunday, because
   on this day the multitude took the branches of palm trees. Much people
   that were come to the feast. Josephus says that from two to three
   millions attended a passover. All the Gospels give an account of this
   entry into Jerusalem and all ought to be read. See Matt. 21:1-11; Mark
   11:1-11, and Luke 19:29-44. (Joh 12:13)

   13. Took branches of palm trees, and went out to meet him. They
   carpeted the Savior's pathway with their garments and the gigantic
   leaves of the palm tree. The "branches of palm trees" are not strictly,
   branches at all, but the enormous leaves, twelve to sixteen feet long,
   which spring from the top of the tall, straight trunk. A few palm trees
   are still to be seen in Jerusalem. Combining the four accounts, we get
   the following features: Some took off their outer garments, the
   burnoose, and bound it on the colt as a kind of saddle; others cast
   their garments in the way, a mark of honor to a king (2 Kings 9:13);
   others climbed the trees, cut down the branches, and strewed them in
   the way (Matt. 21:8); others gathered leaves and twigs and rushes. This
   procession was made up largely of Galileans; but the reputation of
   Christ, increased by the resurrection of Lazarus, had preceded him, and
   many came out from the city to swell the acclamations and increase the
   enthusiasm. Hosanna. A Greek modification of the Hebrew words, "Save
   now, I beseech thee," in Ps. 118:25, the next verse of which formed
   part of their song, "Blessed," etc. It is used as an expression of
   praise, like hallelujah. That cometh in the name of the Lord. The words
   are taken in part from Ps. 118:25, 26, a hymn which belonged to the
   great hallelujah chanted at the end of the Paschal Supper and the Feast
   of Tabernacles. The people were accustomed to apply it to the
   Messiah.--Godet. Christ came in the name of the Lord, because sent and
   appointed by the Lord,--his ambassador, proclaiming the message of the
   Lord. (Joh 12:14)

   14. And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon. This was
   Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem and the people expected him to
   become king at once. The outside of this triumph was very mean. He rode
   upon an ass's colt, which made no figure. This colt was borrowed.
   Christ went upon the water in a borrowed boat, ate the Passover in a
   borrowed chamber, was buried in a borrowed sepulchre, and here rode on
   a borrowed ass. He had no rich trappings, but only the garments of
   others.--Matthew Henry. (Joh 12:15)

   15. Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh. Each of the
   four evangelists goes back to the prophecy (Zech. 9:9) as fulfilled in
   this remarkable event,--the only known instance in which Jesus ever
   rode upon any animal.--Cowles. Hitherto he had entered the holy city on
   foot: this day he would enter as David and judges of Israel were
   wont,--riding on the specially Jewish ass.--Geikie. (Joh 12:16)

   16. These things understood not his disciples at first. There was much
   connected with his ministry that never became clear until he had
   suffered and risen. Then in the clear light of the Holy Spirit all was
   like a sunbeam.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. Affection desires to express itself in costly sacrifices for the
   loved.

   2. The motive, the love, gives value to the deed; as Hermon and Pisgah
   were but common mountains till Christ was transfigured on the one, and
   Moses saw the promised land from the other.

   3. The worldly heart can never understand the blessedness and power of
   enthusiasm, and gifts of love.

   4. Bad men always put forward good motives for their bad deeds.

   5. Expressions of affection are of great value. We all need sympathy,
   and that it be expressed, especially the poor, the sick, the sorrowing.

   6. God does not need our gifts; he is rich enough without: but he wants
   the giving, the spirit of sacrifice.

   7. The gifts for the gospel, for the church, for Christ's sake, always
   increase the gifts to the poor.

   8. Reasons for Triumphal Procession. Till then he had withdrawn from
   popular expressions of homage; but once, at least, he wished to show
   himself as King Messiah of his people. It was a last call addressed by
   him to the population of Jerusalem. This course, besides, could no
   longer compromise his work. He knew that in any case death awaited him
   in the capital.--Godet. He would have a public testimony to the fact
   that it was their King the Jews crucified. It is not merely the Messiah
   that saves, nor the crucified One that saves, but the Messiah crucified
   (1 Cor. 1:23). An analogous commission to prepare the Passover was
   given to Peter and John (Luke 22:8). They may have been the two sent
   forth.--Abbott.

   9. Celebration of Triumph. In September, a.d. 61, about 30 years after
   Christ's triumphal entry, the most magnificent triumph ever seen in
   Rome was given to Pompey. For two days the grand procession of trophies
   from every land, and a long retinue of captives, moved into the city
   along the Via Sacra. Brazen tablets were carried, on which were
   engraved the names of the conquered nations, including 1,000 castles
   and 900 cities. The remarkable circumstance of the celebration was,
   that it declared him conqueror of the whole world. So the triumphant
   procession of Christ into Jerusalem was but a faint shadow of the
   coming of the Prince of peace, when all nations and the wealth and
   glory of them shall take part in his glorious triumph. And the day is
   fast approaching.--After Foster's CyclopÃ¦dia.
     __________________________________________________________________

Gentiles Seeking Christ.

   17. The people . . . bare record. John has just narrated a wonderful
   passage in the life of the Redeemer, his entry into the city of his
   enemies, who had resolved to slay him, in triumphal procession with
   vast crowds raising acclamations and shouting his kingly glory. He now
   pauses to observe that the miracle at Bethany had its effect on this
   demonstration. The people who had seen the miracle bore record. (Joh
   12:18)

   18. For this came also the people met him. Thousands who had not seen
   the miracle were moved by the story of the eye-witnesses, and eagerly
   went out to meet him and joined in the acclamations. They could not be
   regarded as believers but belonged to the fickle throng who went with
   the tide; who would one day shout, "Hosannah to the son of David," and
   a few days later, would swell the cry, "Crucify him; crucify him!" (Joh
   12:19)

   19. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves. These subtle
   opposers, were astounded and frightened by the proofs of the popularity
   of Jesus. They had joined with the Sanhedrim in a determination to put
   Christ to death; he had retired from the city and disappeared for a
   time from sight; an order had been issued that any one who knew his
   hiding place should point it out that he might be seized; yet now he
   had returned, entered Jerusalem as the old kings were wont to enter,
   with shouting crowds around him doing him homage. Hence these baffled
   sectarians exclaim: "Behold how ye prevail nothing; the world is gone
   after him." Matthew describes the commotion in the city that so stirred
   up the Pharisees: "And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city
   was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus
   the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee" (Matt. 21:10, 11). When the Lord
   came into the city he entered into the temple. Mark 11:11, declares:
   "Jesus entered Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked
   round about on all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out
   to Bethany with the Twelve." The interview sought by the Greeks, of
   which we next have an account, either occurred this afternoon, while
   the Savior was in the temple, or on Monday. John does not say when it
   occurred, and most scholars have referred it to the next day, when the
   Savior cleansed the temple a second time, made his final appeal to the
   Jewish nation, and retired from the temple forever, speaking his
   farewell in the wonderfully pathetic words recorded in Matt. 23:34-39.
   This discourse recorded by John seems to have contained his last words
   to the people, and after his words were uttered "he was hidden from
   them," to appear no more in person with the offer of salvation until
   they should say, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
   (Joh 12:20)

   20. And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at
   the feast. A remarkable circumstance is related. The passover feast was
   for the Jews, and those who came there to worship were of the seed of
   Abraham, but on this occasion, "among those who came to worship" were
   Greeks, members of the great Gentile division of the race which
   embraced all that were not Jews. These were not Jews who spoke the
   Grecian language and lived in Greek countries; those are called in the
   original Greek, Hellenistoi. We find them in the Jerusalem church in
   large numbers. See Acts 6:1. These who seek to visit Jesus were
   Hellenes, a term only used of the Greek race. Where they came from we
   do not know. The Greek race was scattered all over the East from the
   time of Alexander's conquests. Eusebius mentions a tradition that they
   were an embassy from the king of Edessa who thus sought to invite Jesus
   to visit his kingdom. It is probable rather that they belonged to the
   large class of "devout Greeks," met everywhere by Paul, who were sick
   of heathenism and were attracted by the grand Hebrew revelation of the
   unity of God. On this great national occasion they had accompanied Jews
   settled abroad as they returned to worship in the city of David.

   The visit of these Greeks to Jerusalem indicates an unusual hunger for
   the truth which they had failed to find in heathenism. The aversion
   shown by a high caste Brahmin for an outcast is not greater than the
   Jews, in the age of the Savior, exhibited for Gentiles. Beyond the
   court of the Gentiles in the temple grounds was an inscription over the
   gateway: "Let no Gentile go farther under pain of death." No pious Jew
   could sit down to eat at the table of a Gentile (Acts 11:3; Gal. 2:12).
   If a heathen were invited to a Jewish house, we learn from the Mishna,
   that he could not be left alone in the room, else every article of food
   or drink on the table was to be regarded, henceforth, as unclean. Milk
   drawn from a cow by heathen hands could not be used. It was not lawful
   to let either house or field, or to sell cattle, to a heathen, and any
   article, however distantly connected with heathenism, was to be
   destroyed. In distant lands, or districts of Palestine where the
   Gentiles were numerous, the Jews became less intolerant, but in
   Jerusalem the aversion was most intense. An illustration of this is
   afforded in the address that Paul delivered from the steps, after he
   was rescued from the temple mob, which listened to him patiently until
   he spoke of the Lord sending him to the Gentiles, on which his
   listeners were at once transported into fury. (Joh 12:21)

   21. The same came to Philip. In the court of the Gentiles where the
   Lord then was waiting and "looking around." He observed much that
   required correction and on the next day, Monday, he again drove out the
   stock traders and the money changers. The name Philip is Grecian, as
   well as Andrew, and those of the seven deacons of Acts, chapter 6. It
   is not unlikely from this fact that Philip had been thrown under Greek
   influences and spoke the Greek language, as did Peter, John, Paul, and
   other apostles. This, probably, explains why they came to Philip. He
   had a Greek name and was acquainted with their race. We would see
   Jesus. They ask an interview. They had probably seen him as he came
   into Jerusalem in triumphal procession; they could see him every day as
   he taught publicly, but Jerusalem was ringing with the fame of the
   resurrection of Lazarus, his other miracles and the wonders of his
   teaching. They were seeking a better faith than that of their fathers
   and they wished to talk personally with the great Teacher. Possibly
   curiosity had something to do with their desire. (Joh 12:22)

   22. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew. Andrew was also of Bethsaida and
   he and Philip seem to have been inseparable friends. The fact that
   Philip wanted some one to go with him to Christ shows how his character
   had inspired with awe even those who were nearest to him. Perhaps the
   Greeks followed the two apostles to the presence of Christ. It is not
   said whether he granted the interview or not. He probably did. John
   reports the address of the Savior to which the application gave rise.
   That Philip should hesitate to make this request is not strange in view
   of the fact that Christ had told his disciples when they were sent
   forth to preach, to go only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
   It has been noticed that Gentiles, the Wise men, came to honor his
   birth, and now Gentiles, the Greeks, do him homage as he is about to
   ascend the cross. (Joh 12:23)

   23. The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. The
   answer of Christ may have been to Philip and Andrew, and the Greeks may
   have heard and understood it. The substance is that the time for his
   glorification had come and that glorification would draw all men,
   Greek, Gentiles as well as Jews, to him. After his glorification,
   accomplished by his death, there would be no wall of partition, but to
   him the Gentiles should seek, and there should be neither bond nor
   free, male nor female, Jew nor Greek, but all one in Christ Jesus. (Joh
   12:24)

   24. Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
   alone. This statement, prefaced by the verily, verily, that gives
   solemn emphasis, enforces a great truth. The grain of wheat may remain
   in the granary for a thousand years and be preserved, but it is useless
   there. It neither reproduces, nor is food. Grains were found in the
   wrappings of Egyptian mummies that were 4,000 years old, but they had
   never produced another grain. It is when it falls into the ground and
   undergoes dissolution, that it brings forth fruit. It is fruitful by
   giving itself up. So, too, Christ must give himself up. Must die, be
   placed in the ground, before he can be glorified and draw all men to
   him. His death was needful in order that he might impart life to the
   nations. (Joh 12:25)

   25. He that loveth his life shall lose it. Then he announces a
   principle that underlies all exaltation. He gave his life and found
   eternal exaltation; the grain gives its life and lives a hundred fold;
   those who consecrate their lives, give them up for others, dedicate
   them to their holy work, will live eternally. Those who seek to save
   their lives, live for this present life, live for pleasures and gains
   and honors, shall lose their lives. The man who says he will get as
   much out of life as possible, the worldling, is the one who "loveth his
   life." The one who disregards present pleasures, or worldly interests,
   but dedicates his life to Christ, is the one who hateth his life. (Joh
   12:26)

   26. If any man serve me, let him follow me. This is Christ's direct
   answer to the Greeks. His service is to be rendered, not by secret
   interviews, but by obeying him, for so the word "follow." is to be
   understood. If any man serve me, him will my Father honor. God demands
   that "every knee should bow and every tongue confess that he is
   Christ." The Christian's ambition should be to follow Christ, to be
   Christlike, to serve him well, and leave all else to the will of the
   Father. (Joh 12:27)

   27. Now is my soul troubled. "Now a sudden change comes over the spirit
   of the Redeemer. His eye closes on the crowd without; he ceases to
   think of, or to speak with man; he is alone with the Father. A dark
   cloud descends and wraps him in its folds."--Hanna. It is the shadow of
   the cross and the tomb. The horror just before him falls upon his soul
   with terrific power. It is a foreshadowing of the struggle of
   Gethsemane. The best comment on this verse is to compare it with the
   account of the agony in the garden. Here he exclaims: Father, save me
   from this hour. There, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me."
   Here he adds: But for this cause came I unto this hour. There
   "Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done." Here the perfect
   resignation that follows the struggle in his soul is in the prayer,
   Father, glorify thy name. It required a fearful struggle, but he "had
   hated his life" and given it for his work's sake. (Joh 12:28)

   28. Then came a voice from heaven, saying, I have glorified it, etc. At
   Gethsemane the angel came to strengthen him; here the Father's voice
   speaks in approval. Three times the Father's voice was heard from the
   sky; first, when Christ was buried in Jordan, a type of his own burial;
   second, when Moses and Elias talked with him on the holy mount about
   his death; third, when he had his struggle of soul in view of death
   portrayed here and triumphed. These facts show the tender, agonizing
   interest the Father felt in the suffering of the Son. Will glorify it
   again. God had glorified his name by the wonders wrought by Jesus; he
   would glorify it by his resurrection, his exaltation, the scenes of
   Pentecost, and the triumphs of the church. (Joh 12:29)

   29. An angel spake to him. All heard the sound of the divine voice, but
   it was not clear to all what it was. Like those who were with Saul of
   Tarsus when on the way to Damascus, they heard, but did not comprehend.
   (Joh 12:30)

   30. This voice came not because of me. He had already won the victory
   before the voice came. It was rather to confirm the faith of his
   disciples who still stumbled over the prospect of his death. (Joh
   12:31)

   31. Now is the judgment of this world. Now, "this hour," the "hour"
   referred to in verses 23d and 27th, the hour for which he had come into
   the world, the hour of the cross; that was to be the hour of judgment,
   the crisis, which should determine who should rule the world. The cross
   became a throne. It gave him the crown. Because he suffered he was
   exalted to majesty and "all power in heaven and earth was given to
   him." The prince of this world is cast out. The great opposer, the
   worldly power, Satan as manifested in the pomp, power, and majesty of
   the earth. The cross cast him out, dethroned him; he is now a usurper
   and shall finally be cast into the lake of fire. (Joh 12:32)

   32. If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.
   Lifted up, first, to the cross; second, from the grave; third, to
   heaven and the eternal throne. The crucified, risen and exalted Savior
   becomes a power to draw all men, Jews and Gentiles, all nations. Christ
   does not declare that he will draw every individual, but all races. The
   great thought is the power of his death and resurrection. (Joh 12:33)

   33. Signifying what death he should die. And the great events that
   followed it as a regular sequence. (Joh 12:34)

   34. We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth forever. The
   multitude were perplexed. They had cried, "Hosanna to the King of
   Israel who cometh in the name of the Lord." They believed Christ to be
   the king. Their idea of the Messiah was an eternal king. Now he spoke
   of death. They ask two questions: first, about the lifting up, and
   second, Who is the Son of man? (Joh 12:35)

   35. Yet a little while the light is with you. He refuses to answer
   their questions directly, but imparts to them needed truths. The light
   was then present with them. He was shining, teaching. Let them seek the
   light and walk in it while they had opportunity. The opportunity might
   soon pass away and the darkness come. (Joh 12:36)

   36. Believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. That
   they might receive the light of the light of the world they must
   believe on him. Unbelief closed their spiritual eyes to his words.
   Unless there was belief and a reception of the light they could not
   become children of the light. With these words he retired from their

Practical Observations.

   1. Christ is the "Desire of all nations."

   2. Though Christ came in person only to the "lost sheep" of the house
   of Israel, his mission was to all the world.

   3. The "wall of partition" between Jew and Gentile, was broken down
   when "the handwriting of ordinances was nailed to the cross." The risen
   Savior said to his disciples, "Go and preach the gospel to every
   creature."

   4. Self-dedication is a life-giving power. The old Romans told the
   story of Rome saved by Quintus Curtius and the Decii giving up their
   lives. The soldier often consecrates himself to save others. So Christ
   gave him elf to save a world.

   5. The life that is given up is the life that is saved and becomes
   glorious. Judson gave up his and lives as the prince of missionaries;
   Howard, Florence Nightingale, Miss Dix, Oberlin, Clarkson, and a host
   of others gave up theirs and have an immortal fame. All who give up
   their lives by dedicating them to holy work will gain life eternal.

   6. Christ himself had struggle of soul. He was tempted in all points as
   we are. The cross was as hard for him to endure as it would be for us.
   He fought the conflict in soul, he gave up his life, and the Father
   spoke his approbation. He gave up but he gained. First the cross and
   then the crown.

     7. "With all his sufferings full in view, And woes to us unknown,
     Forth to the task his spirit flew; 'Twas love that urged him on.
     Lord we return to thee what we can; Our hearts shall sound abroad--
     Salvation to the dying man, And to the rising God."--Cowper.

The Cause of Unbelief.

   If that view is correct which assigns the last discourse to the temple
   on Monday it belongs to Christ's farewell words to Israel. From
   thenceforth he entered the temple no more. In the conflicts recorded in
   Matthew, chapters XXII and XXIII, he had been finally rejected by
   Israel, and henceforth only awaited for the "Son of Man to be lifted
   up" that he might draw all races, the races whom Israel despised, unto
   him. In the closing words to the people, not to "the Jews," recorded by
   John, his last admonition was to seek the light and to walk in it. All
   the woes of Israel arose from the fact that they were averse to the
   light and preferred the darkness, rather than the true light. John,
   with this admonition in mind, next shows how they had turned away from
   the light. (Joh 12:37)

   37. Though he had done so many miracles before them. John only records
   seven of these miracles as types but often refers to the great number
   of them. See 2:23; 4:45; 7:31; 20:30. Believed not. Many of them had a
   kind of intellectual faith in him as a man of God, or as the "prophet
   of Galilee," but they did not have that faith which believes, trusts
   and devotes one's life. (Joh 12:38)

   38. That the saying of Esaias the prophet. The saying here recorded is
   found in Isaiah 53:1. John means to say that God had by Isaiah
   predicted the very state of things in Israel and the Jews so acted that
   it might be fulfilled. (Joh 12:39)

   39. Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said. Isaiah
   6:10. The Revision is clearer, which reads: "For this cause they could
   not believe, for that Isaiah has said again." The cause of their
   unbelief is not that Isaiah said thus and thus, but he points out the
   cause of their unbelief in what he said. The reason why they could not
   believe was not that God had decreed their unbelief and destroyed their
   free agency, but that, in the exercise of their free agency, they had
   made themselves, by the operation of God's moral laws, incapable of
   belief. (Joh 12:40) (Joh 12:41)

   40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart. This explains
   why they could not believe. Whether they were morally responsible for
   their unbelief depends on how God blinded their eyes and hardened their
   heart. If he did it by a direct act, regardless of their moral
   condition, then they were not responsible. If, however, he did it by a
   law of the universe that whoever turns from the light shall become
   blind, and whoever steels his heart against the truth shall find his
   heart hardened, then they were morally responsible if they had turned
   from the light and hardened their hearts. It is a physical as well as a
   moral law that he who turns from the light and seeks to abide in
   darkness will become blinded until he will "believe a lie and be
   damned." The men who are the champions of unbelief, such men as
   Voltaire, Paine and Ingersoll, are unbelievers because they did not
   wish to believe. Their moral condition was such that they could justify
   their course of life only by refusing to believe on Christ. They sought
   the darkness, and as a result, finally they became so blinded that they
   could not believe. They blinded their own eyes because they brought
   upon themselves the penalty. God blinded their eyes, because their
   blindness resulted from the action of his universal law. Thus it is
   said of Pharaoh that "God hardened his heart," but it is also said that
   "Pharaoh hardened his heart." He chose, in the exercise of his
   voluntary agency, to harden his heart, but it is God's law that those
   who harden their hearts shall be hardened, and hence God, by this law,
   hardened his heart. By reference to Matt. 13:14 the reader will find
   this passage from Isaiah quoted and applied by the Savior to the Jews.
   In the application he shows how they were blinded: "Their eyes have
   they closed." The Savior's words settle how God blinded their eyes. It
   was by the application of his invariable law to their own acts. Trench
   says: "The Lord, having constituted as the righteous law of moral
   government, that sin should produce darkness of heart and moral
   insensibility, declared that he would allow the law to take its
   course." (Joh 12:42) (Joh 12:43)

   42. Nevertheless among the chief rulers many believed on him. These
   were members of the Sanhedrim. They had an intellectual faith, but it
   was not a power over their hearts. "With the heart man believes unto
   righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation"
   (Romans 10:10). These rulers, not believing with the heart, did not
   make open confession, because they feared the Pharisees. The fact that
   they did not confess him from fear, only added to their sin. They
   declined openly to take his side when they believed him to be the
   Christ. They were dishonest. Nor does the New Testament anywhere give a
   shadow of a hope to anyone who refuses to confess Christ openly. Put
   out of the synagogue. See 9:22 for the determination of the Pharisees,
   and the consequences of being put out of the synagogue. The Pharisees
   were the leaders in inflicting the religious penalties. (Joh 12:44)
   (Joh 12:45)

   44. Jesus cried a said. John does not say when, or where, but I think,
   gives a sort of summary of what he had said, now that his appeal to the
   Jewish nation was closed. In verses 44 and 46 he declares his oneness
   with him who sent him. (Joh 12:46)

   46. I am come a light into the world. It was the office of Christ to
   make all things clear. His mission and person illuminate the mysteries
   of our being and destiny when they are seen in their fulness. In many
   respects he is a Sun. Those who abide in his light will have their
   doubts solved, mysteries cleared up, and the clouds rolled away from
   the future. It is interesting and instructive to compare the various
   titles and symbols that the Savior applies to himself in this Gospel.
   In addition to the Son of Man, the Christ, and the Son of God, which
   are common to all the Gospels, he used the following designations: I am
   the Bread of Life (6:35); I am the Light of the world (8:12 and in this
   passage); I am the Door of the sheep (10:7); I am the Good Shepherd
   (10:11); I am the Resurrection and the Life (11:25); I am the Way, the
   Truth, and the Life (14:6); I am the True Vine (15:1). Each of these
   symbols conveys a different and vital truth concerning his nature or
   mission. Besides these he describes himself seven times, five in his
   public discourses, and twice to his disciples, by the profound and
   lofty phrase "I am," the significance of which I have discussed in
   another place. [10]See note on 8:58. (Joh 12:47) (Joh 12:48)

   47, 48. I judge him not. In declaring that he judges not those who hear
   his words and believe not, he is not inconsistent. In the day of
   judgment he shall sit upon the throne, not to condemn the world that he
   came to save. It will always be either saved or condemned. The words
   that he left in it as his will shall decide the destiny of every man.
   "He that rejecteth me . . the word that I have spoken, the same shall
   judge him in the last day." (Joh 12:49)

   49. I have not spoken of myself. Of my own mind and will, but it was
   the Father who had spoken in him. He gave a commandment what the Son
   should say. It will be seen that this summary repeats ideas that have
   been made prominent in discourses of the Savior that John has already
   reported. (Joh 12:50)

   50. I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The commandment of
   the the Father is not only directed to the bestowment of life on men,
   but it is life. There is life in the truth of God when it is received
   into the heart and becomes the law of life. His commandment is truth.
   Christ says: "My words are spirit and they are life." Thus closes
   John's record of the Revelation of Christ to the world. In the
   discourses of the next five chapters there is a fuller revelation of
   himself to his disciples.

The Last Supper.

   The events of this wonderful week have passed rapidly. We have followed
   the Savior in his entry into Jerusalem upon Sunday and his visit to the
   temple. On Monday occurred the incident of cursing the fig tree, as he
   went from Bethany to Jerusalem, and a second time he entered into the
   temple to assert his authority to cleanse his Father's house by casting
   out the traffickers and money changers, returning in the evening again
   to his beloved retreat at Bethany. Tuesday was one of the busiest,
   stormiest, and most fruitful days of his ministry. On his appearance at
   the temple he was accosted by the demand, "By what authority doest thou
   these things?" Then came the attempts of the various parties to
   entangle him, a succession of parables directed against the Jewish
   nation, the awful denunciation of its sins recorded in Matthew, chapter
   XXIII., the final and sad farewell to the temple and the nation that
   closes that chapter, the discourse on the fate of the nation, the end
   of the world and the day of judgment recorded in the next two chapters,
   and, after these, a return to Bethany, where the next day, Wednesday,
   seems to have been passed in rest and preparation for the approaching
   struggle. From thence on Thursday afternoon he went into the city to
   eat the passover. This last interview with the disciples before his
   suffering is one of an unusually confidential and affectionate nature
   and is the occasion of the sweetest and most consolatory teachings of
   our Lord.

   John passes over the second cleansing of the temple and the conflicts
   of Tuesday, and the prediction of the fate of Jerusalem, which we
   gather from the other historians, and takes his readers, at once to the
   little gathering in the Upper Room where the Master and his disciples
   had gathered to eat the passover, and where the Supper was instituted.
   John speaks of the Supper, but he, only, of the four historians, omits
   to give an account of its origin. He, only, gives a full account of the
   remarkable discourses that the Savior delivered on that memorable
   occasion. I cannot here enter into the discussion whether the Savior
   ate the passover before the real time or not, nor is it needful to
   settle that, in order to understand his teaching.

   It was on the morning of Thursday,--Green Thursday as it used to be
   called during the Middle Ages,--that some conversation took place
   between Jesus and his disciples about the paschal feast. They asked him
   where he wished the preparation to be made. As he had now withdrawn
   from public teaching, and was spending this Thursday, as he had spent
   the previous day, in complete seclusion, they probably expected that he
   would eat the passover at Bethany, which for such purposes had been
   decided by rabbinical authority to be within the limits of Jerusalem.
   But his plans were otherwise. He, the true Paschal Lamb, was to be
   sacrificed once and forever in the Holy City, where it is probable that
   in that very passover, and on that very same day, some 260,000 of those
   lambs of which he was the antitype were destined to be slain.

   It was towards the evening, probably when the gathering dusk would
   prevent all needless observation, that Jesus and his disciples walked
   from Bethany, by that familiar road over the Mount of Olives, which his
   sacred feet were never again destined to tread until after death. . . .
   We catch no glimpse of the little company till we find them assembled
   in that "large upper room,"--perhaps the very room where three days
   after the sorrow-stricken Apostles first saw their risen
   Savior,--perhaps the very room where, amid the sound of a mighty
   rushing wind, each meek brow was first mitred with Pentecostal
   flame.--Farrar. It is at this supper, at the very foot of the cross,
   that all believers are invited to sit down to angels' food in enjoying
   the wonderful revelation of the Master in the next five chapters.

   "It may be that the very act of taking their seats at the table had,
   once more, stirred up in the minds of the apostles those disputes about
   precedence which, on previous occasions, our Lord had so tenderly and
   carefully rebuked. The mere question of a place at table might seem too
   infinitesimal and unimportant to ruffle the feelings of good men at an
   hour so supreme and solemn; but that love for 'the chief seats at
   feasts,' and elsewhere, which Jesus had denounced in the Pharisees, is
   not only innate in the heart, but is so powerful that it has, at times,
   caused the most terrific tragedies."--Farrar.

   Matthew Henry points out that the paschal lamb was typical of "the
   Lord, our Passover," in the following features: (1) It was a lamb, as
   Christ was the Lamb of God. (2) A male, of the first year. In its
   prime. (3) Without blemish, as Christ was perfectly pure, without spot.
   (4) Set apart four days before, the 10th of Nisan. Christ's triumphal
   entry was four days before the crucifixion, on the 10th. (5) It was
   slain, and roasted with fire, denoting the death and exquisite
   sufferings of Christ. (6) It was killed between the two evenings, three
   to six o'clock. Christ suffered at the end of the world. He died at
   this same hour, and at the passover feast. (7) Each person must have a
   slain lamb. So Christ died for all. (8) Not a bone was broken. (9) It
   was eaten with bitter herbs of repentance. (10) Its blood must be
   applied to be effectual. (11) It looked forward to future deliverance,
   and became, after the death, a feast of hope and joy. (12) It was a
   feast of separation from the world; and (13) of protection as God's
   children. (Joh 13:1)

   1. Now before the feast of the passover. Immediately before, just as
   Christ was about to sit down with his disciples to the paschal feast.
   Jesus knew that his hour was come. The scenes of this hour, the
   passover, the Lord's Supper, the washing of feet, and the solemn
   teaching were in immediate view of the cross. The Lord saw the dark and
   bloody path of suffering just before him. In this hour of sorrow the
   pre-eminent love that he had for "his own" shone forth resplendent. "He
   loved them to the end." (Joh 13:2)

   2. Supper being ended. The Revision says, "During the Supper," which
   expresses the meaning of the original. It is likely that Christ arose
   near the beginning of the feast, washed the feet, and then he sat down
   again to the feast. See verse 12. For reasons that we will explain
   later, he arose after the feast began. The devil having already put
   into the heart of Judas Iscariot, etc. The devil planted the seed, but
   the soil of his heart was ready. The devil has no power except where
   there is preparation for him. The covetous disposition of Judas had
   prepared the way. His disappointment over the costly box of ointment
   had enraged him. John calls attention, to the fact that Judas was
   there, already a traitor at heart, and that Christ knew it, in order to
   show the wonderful condescension that would stoop to wash his feet.
   (Joh 13:3)

   3. Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands.
   It was with a full consciousness of his divinity, his divine power and
   majesty, of the glory that he had and would enjoy with God, that he
   stooped to the menial office that he was about to fill. John points out
   with care the wonderful sight of God in Christ washing the feet, not
   only of the apostles, but of the traitor. John's astonishment at what
   followed finds expression in this verse. (Joh 13:4)

   4. He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments. Shortly after
   they had sat down to the table, he arose, laid aside his outer robe,
   girded a towel upon him, and began the lowly office of washing the feet
   of twelve men, without a word of explanation. Something more than
   ordinary must have caused so remarkable an act. The fact that the cause
   has been lost sight of, has caused many to misunderstand the
   significance, and to think the Savior was instituting a church
   ceremonial, rather than giving a deep, practical, spiritual lesson for
   all ages. I will endeavor to explain the circumstances: 1. The
   disciples still expected the immediate manifestation of the kingdom.
   When they sat down to this Supper they felt that it was a kind of state
   occasion, and a strife arose among them for precedence. Each wanted the
   "chief seat at the feast." An account of this unseemly controversy over
   the, old question, "Who should be greatest?" is found in Luke 22:24-30.
   2. The owner of the house had furnished the guest chamber for the
   feast, had provided table, seats, water and vessels, but his duties on
   a passover occasion had ended there. He had to arrange for the passover
   with his own family. Jesus and his disciples had come in hot and dusty
   from their walk from Bethany; their sandals had been laid off according
   to custom. They sat down to the table with dry and dusty feet, but no
   one brought water to wash their feet, an eastern duty of hospitality
   made necessary by their hot, dusty climate. No apostle volunteered to
   attend to the office, the duty of a servant. They were rather filled
   with angry, envious thoughts who should have the most honorable place.
   3. Then, when they were filled with their ambitious, envious feelings,
   and had engaged in strife right at the Lord's table, after waiting long
   enough to have it shown that no one would condescend to the menial, but
   needful duty, the Lord, the Son of God, full of conscious divinity,
   arose, girded on the towel, and began the office. A rebuke, an awful
   rebuke, to their ambitious strife, far more powerful than words could
   have spoken; such a rebuke that never again do we see a hint of the old
   question, "Who should be greatest?" It was Christ's answer to their
   unseemly conduct, and a lesson to those Christians "who love the
   pre-eminence" for all time. It said, "Let him that would be greatest
   become the servant of all." (Joh 13:5)

   5. Poureth water into a basin. Girded as a servant the Lord does a
   servant's work. The feet were not put into the basin, but water was
   poured from it on the feet and they were then wiped with the towel.
   (Joh 13:6)

   6. Lord, dost thou wash my feet? The language of Peter is that of
   confusion, of astonishment and of remonstrance. The emphasis is on the
   word thou. Dost thou, the Lord and Master, do the work of a servant?
   (Joh 13:7)

   7. Thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. "You do not
   understand this matter fully now, but thou shalt know hereafter." There
   was much that was not clear to the dull understandings of the apostles
   that became clear later. Knowledge comes by submissive obedience if we
   will wait patiently. (Joh 13:8)

   8. If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Peter, not yet
   reconciled to the Master discharging the duty that he now feels he
   ought to have discharged, exclaims: "Thou shalt never wash my feet." It
   was his characteristic obstinacy. Christ replied as above, in
   substance, "If thou art not submissive to me, thou art not my
   disciple." Washing, with the Jews, was a symbolical act, signifying
   purification from uncleanness. That Christ referred to more than a
   washing with water was understood by Peter as is evident from his
   reply. Christ could only wash with blood the obedient. (Joh 13:9)

   9. Not my feet only, but my hands and my head. Peter, not yet content,
   continues the argument. If thou dost insist on washing me, why not my
   hands and head as well as my feet? His language is partly due to
   embarrassment and partly to his great repugnance to have the Savior
   perform such a duty upon him. (Joh 13:10)

   10. He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet. The Lord first
   speaks of the material facts. It was only the feet that needed washing.
   After a tramp over the dusty roads they needed cleansing. It must be
   born in mind that only sandals were worn and that these were laid off
   when they entered the house. There is also a spiritual meaning. He who
   is once cleansed by the blood of Christ only needs, after this, to come
   to Christ for partial cleansing; for the forgiveness of the special
   sins that make him unclean. (Joh 13:11)

   11. Ye are not all clean. Not all who enter into his service ostensibly
   are cleansed. Judas was not. Some do not enter through the "Door of
   entire obedience," but are thieves and robbers (see John 12:1). (Joh
   13:12)

   12. Know ye what I have done to you? When he had completed his task, he
   laid aside the towel, resumed his robe, sat down to the table, and
   asked, "Do you understand what I have done to you?" They knew the act,
   but did they comprehend its meaning? Hence the emphasis that follows.
   (Joh 13:13) (Joh 13:14)

   13, 14. Ye call me Master and Lord. You recognize the fact that I am
   your Lord and Master, or rather the Lord and Master. Master is used in
   the sense of teacher, but Lord in the sense of ruler. He then draws his
   conclusion from the promise that they admit: "If I, your Lord and
   Master, wash your feet, ye ought also to wash one another's feet." Ye
   ought to follow the example of humility, self-sacrifice, and service to
   others, that your Lord sets you. Instead of seeking the pre-eminence,
   disputing concerning the seats of honor, and shrinking from humble
   service to each other, ye should follow my example. (Joh 13:15)

   15. For I have given you an example. Christ gave an example, not a
   church ordinance. It is our duty to follow the example and render the
   same kind of service to fellow Christians. To make his example a
   ceremonial and follow it literally would be to lose its spirit. We wish
   every student to note the fact that not once elsewhere is it referred
   to in the New Testament as a church ordinance, and only once mentioned
   at all. In 1 Tim. 5:10, it is named as a mark of a godly widow. Nor is
   there any mention of it as a church ordinance until the fourth century
   when the tide of corruption was sweeping in. The Pope now washes the
   feet of twelve beggars once a year, the German Baptists (Dunkards),
   Mennonites, and a few other minor sects practice it, but with rare
   exceptions Christendom, from the days of the apostles to our time, has
   looked upon the Savior's example as a sublime act of humility whose
   spirit must always be followed, but has rejected the idea of him
   establishing a church ordinance. There is a wide difference between an
   example and a church ordinance. When Christ wept with sympathy, or fed
   the hungry, or ministered to the sick, or taught lowly service by
   washing the feet of his disciples, he set an example, and happy are we
   if we know what he did, drink in his spirit, and follow the example.
   That feet washing belongs to the class of examples, rather than of
   church ordinances, is demonstrated by the fact that when we turn to the
   inspired history of the church as recorded in Acts and in the Epistles,
   it is silent concerning any such ordinance. The Savior, the night
   before he was crucified, established a church ordinance, the Lord's
   Supper. We discover it just as soon as the church is organized on the
   day of Pentecost. The converts "continued steadfastly in the apostles'
   doctrine, and in the fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in
   prayers." In his commission, just before the ascension, he established
   another ordinance, baptism. This we find, also, to appear immediately.
   On Pentecost Peter commands it and "they that gladly received the Word
   were baptized." Thus it continues; these undoubted church ordinances
   are constantly named throughout Acts, through the Epistles, the
   Apostolic Fathers and early writers of Christianity, while feet washing
   is named only once more in the New Testament, and then in such a way as
   to show that it was observed as a private benevolence, not as a church
   ordinance, and is never mentioned in the latter aspect until the time
   of Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo, when the apostasy had been fully
   inaugurated and the Bishop of Rome was claiming to take precedence of
   all other dignitaries in the church. This silence during the ages of
   apostolic purity settles the interpretation we are to place on the
   Savior's language. It is our duty to be always ready to do to others as
   he did, to serve them in a spirit of humility and self-sacrifice. (Joh
   13:16)

   16. The servant is not greater than his Lord. If the Lord then should
   thus condescend, how much rather the servant. To follow the Lord's
   example the necessary thing is not that he should gird on a towel and
   go through a form, but that he should drink in the Lord's spirit.
   Spiritual pride has been one of the greatest perils of the church. The
   Lord seeks to guard against it. (Joh 13:17)

   17. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. Know what
   things? Of course they knew that Christ had washed their feet. But did
   they know what it meant? The meaning is clearly, "If ye understand the
   meaning of my act, happy are ye if ye exemplify the same spirit in your
   lives." This language itself shows that his act was not to be taken in
   its literal form. Any one can know that, but there are many who call
   themselves Christians who do not know its significance. Those who catch
   his spirit and obey it are happy in the Lord's approval. The word
   translated, "Happy are ye" is the same one that is translated "Blessed
   are" in the opening of the sermon on the mount. Here, therefore, we
   have another beatitude. (Joh 13:18)

   18. I speak not of you all. There is one present to whom knowledge will
   not bring happiness. He had been alluded to in verse 10. I know whom I
   have chosen. Christ refers to the choice to the apostolate, not to
   election to salvation. He declares that he knew Judas, but chose him
   that the Scripture might be fulfilled. Judas was no surprise to Christ.
   He had known his sordid nature from the beginning and to what it would
   lead him. The Evangelists do not conceal the fact that the traitor was
   one of their own number. Why was such a man chosen to be one of the
   twelve? (1) There was needed among the disciples, as in the Church now,
   a man of just such talents as Judas possessed,--the talent for managing
   business affairs. (2) Though he probably followed Christ at first from
   mixed motives, as did the other disciples, he had the opportunity of
   becoming a good and useful man. (3) It doubtless was included in God's
   plan that there should be thus a standing argument for the truth and
   honesty of the gospel; for, if any wrong or trickery had been
   concealed, it would have been revealed by the traitor in self-defence.
   (4) It is a relief to modern churches to know that God can bless them,
   and the gospel can succeed, even though some bad men may creep into the
   fold. (Joh 13:19)

   19. Now I tell you before it come to pass. Hitherto the Lord had borne
   his sorrow alone, but now that the hour was at hand and the traitor
   would soon be compelled to show his hand, he would declare it to his
   disciples, before it come to pass, in order that the fulfillment,
   instead of being a crushing disappointment, might increase their faith.
   Believe that I am he. Rather, "Believe that I am." The reader can
   hardly have failed to note how frequently the Lord thus speaks of
   himself. He does not say, "I am he," the latter pronoun being an
   interpolation. The "I AM'S" of our Savior associate him with the
   burning bush of Horeb where, when Moses asked the name he should report
   to the children of Israel of the God who had appointed him as their
   leader, he was told to say, "I am that I am hath sent thee." The
   self-existent, uncreated Deity is revealed in these words and the
   similar terms used by Christ are an affirmation of absolute existence.
   He did not, like man, have a dependent being, but said, "I am," "I
   exist." This exalted claim was demonstrated when he laid down his life
   of his own will "to take it up again." (Joh 13:20)

   20. He that receiveth . . . receiveth me. They whose faith was made
   strong to believe in him would be commissioned as his heralds, sent
   from him, as he was sent from the Father. To receive them, the King's
   messengers, would be to receive him; to receive him would be to receive
   the Father who sent him.

Practical Observations.

   1. The desire to be greater than others is the cause of many quarrels
   and much evil.

   2. Man's way to be great is to seek to be greater than
   others,--self-seeking.

   3. God's way to be great is to serve others, to do all we can for
   them,--love.

   4. It is Pharisaism to cling to a form, but to neglect the spirit.

   5. Often spiritual pride clothes itself in humble forms. We have known
   a man very proud of a buckskin watch guard, or of the hooks and eyes
   that fastened his coat. Pride may put on a towel and wash feet. Once
   when Dr. Bethune preached against pride, a man went to him and pointed
   to leather buttons on his coat, saying, "See, I am not proud." "Yes,"
   said the doctor, "you are proud of your leather buttons."

   6. The great law of the kingdom of heaven is not this,--Use thyself for
   thyself. Still less is it this,--Use others for thyself. But it is
   this,--Use thyself for others.--Morison.

   7. Voluntary service in the kingdom of love, and under the impulse of
   humility and self-denial, makes a man a spiritual power, gives him an
   unconscious and blessed greatness.--Lange.

   8. Peter was always the chief speaker, and already had the keys given
   him; he expects to be lord chancellor, or lord chamberlain of the
   household, and so to be the greatest. Judas had a bag, and therefore he
   expects to be lord treasurer, which, though now he comes last, he hopes
   will then dominate him the greatest. Simon and Jude are nearly related
   to Christ, and they hope to take the place of all the great officers of
   state as princes of the blood. John is the beloved disciple, the
   favorite of the Prince, and therefore hopes to be the greatest. Andrew
   was first called, and why should not he be first preferred?--Matthew
   Henry.

When Christ Ate the Passover.

   It must be acknowledged that one of the most difficult questions of
   solution presented in the history of the Lord's ministry is the time
   when he ate the supper which must have been, in some sense, at least, a
   passover. That the supper described by John in chapter XIII, is not the
   feast at the house of Simon the Leper in Bethany, as Lightfoot insists,
   but the paschal feast described by Matthew, Mark and Luke at which the
   Lord's Supper was instituted, is, I think, evident to any one who makes
   a comparison of the accounts. As far as John gives an indication of the
   time, the supper was just before, or at the passover, and from this
   feast the Lord retired to the garden of Gethsemane. At this feast Judas
   was exposed and the fall of Peter predicted, events that took place,
   according to the other Gospels, the evening of the paschal supper. The
   authorities are therefore almost unanimous in the view that John
   describes the feast that took place at the guest chamber in the city of
   Jerusalem.

   A far more difficult question is whether the Lord's paschal feast was
   eaten at the regular time of the Jewish passover, or one day before. If
   we were to read only the first three Gospels we would conclude that he
   ate the Jewish passover at the regular time. If we were to read only
   John's account we would be compelled to conclude that the Savior died
   on the day the passover lamb was slain, before the Jews ate the
   passover. Matthew, Mark and Luke each speak of "the first day of
   unleavened bread, when they killed the passover," as the day when the
   disciples "made ready the passover." It is not to be denied, however,
   that there are difficulties even in their accounts. "The first day of
   unleavened bread" was strictly the Jewish day that began in the evening
   with the passover feast; that day was a legal Sabbath and it would have
   been unlawful to conduct judicial business upon it, for Simon Cyrenian
   to carry the cross, or for Joseph of Arimathea to bring a hundred
   pounds weight of myrrh and aloes to embalm and bury the body of Christ.
   These things were all done on the day on which the Savior was
   crucified.

   In Exodus 12:16 it is said: "And in the first day (of unleavened bread)
   there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall
   be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them,
   save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you." The
   prohibition of all regular work, except the dressing of food, shows
   that the first day of unleavened bread was a Sabbath, and it was always
   so regarded by the Jewish writers. I cannot believe that all the
   violations of the law could have been made by devout Jews, which have
   to be admitted, if the passover was eaten by the Jewish nation the
   evening before Christ was crucified.

   I suspect, from these circumstances, that there is something in the
   language which alludes to the time in the first three Gospels that must
   be interpreted in the light of Jewish usages, which we do not fully
   understand. They were written with especial reference to Jewish
   Christians, who understood all the customs of the Jews in that age, and
   who, in view of that fact, would probably put a different
   interpretation on "the first day of unleavened bread when the passover
   was killed" from that which seems most probable to us, under the
   conditions of our limited knowledge. It is objected, however, to the
   view that the Lord ate the passover before the regular time that this
   would not be in accordance with the Jewish law. It may be replied that,
   whether he kept the regular passover or not, he departed from the law.
   It enjoined that no one should go out until the morning. He sent Judas
   out from the supper table, and a little later went out himself with his
   disciples beyond the Kedron to Gethsemane.

   I now pass to a consideration of the statements of John. 1. From John
   13:1 it seems that the supper took place "before the passover." 2. In
   13:29 the disciples suppose that the Lord told Judas to buy some things
   needed for the feast, which would be impossible if the real passover
   feast had begun. 3. In 18:28 the Jews refuse to enter the presence
   chamber of Pilate lest they should be so defiled that they could not
   eat the passover, a passage irreconcilable with the view that they had
   eaten it the evening before. 4. In 19:14, on the day of the
   crucifixion, it is stated that it was "the day of preparation of the
   passover," language irreconcilable with the fact that it had been eaten
   the night before. 6. It is said in 19:31 that it was the "preparation,"
   and that the next day, the Sabbath, "was a high day," a statement
   understood to mean that it was a double Sabbath, not an ordinary
   Sabbath, but one that coincided with the day following the eating of
   the passover, which was hallowed as an annual Sabbath.

   From these premises I accept the conclusion of Alford, which I
   condense, as follows: 1. That on the evening of the 13th of Nisan (that
   is, the beginning of the 14th), the Lord ate a meal with his disciples,
   at which it was announced that one should betray him, and from which he
   went to Gethsemane; 2. That in some sense this meal was regarded as
   eating a passover; 3. That it was not at the regular time of the Jewish
   passover, but the evening before, since the disciples understood when
   Judas left that he went to buy something, which could not have been
   done during the first Jewish day after the passover feast began, as it
   was a Sabbath. 4. On that night the Lord was seized, and on the next
   day, before the Jews ate the passover, but the day the paschal lambs
   were slain, the Lord, our Passover, was crucified. "His hour," of the
   coming of which he so often speaks, was the hour when he should die, as
   the passover for man, on the very day when the paschal lambs were
   slain.

Judas Exposed.

   In washing the disciples' feet, Jesus had said, "Ye are clean, but not
   all. For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, Ye are not
   all clean." So early, from the very first, did the thought of Judas and
   his meditated deed press upon the Savior's spirit. When the washing of
   feet was over, and Jesus sat down, and the repast began, they all
   noticed that there was a cloud on the Master's countenance, and the
   disciple who, sitting next to him, could best read the expression of
   his face, saw that he was "troubled in spirit." They were not left long
   in doubt as to the cause. Still sitting at the table and engaged in the
   solemn feast, he began to speak of his betrayer. Already Judas had been
   to the chief priests and agreed, for a certain sum of money, to betray
   the retreat of Jesus at night. The time of the deed had not been
   determined and the Savior brings it about that Judas, at once, leaves
   the company and perpetuates his dark crime that night. (Joh 13:21)

   21. When Jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit. He had just
   closed his remarks on the lesson of humility and service, illustrated
   by feet washing, and now a cloud comes over his soul. The phrase,
   "troubled in spirit," occurs also in chapter 11:33 and 12:27. The Greek
   word always implies indignation mingled with sorrow. Here there is deep
   sorrow but condemnation of the traitor. The "trouble of spirit" may be
   understood better by our own experience. If we have present a company
   of loving friends and one comes in whom we know to be false, a traitor,
   uncongenial in every respect, it throws a cloud. I believe that Jesus
   wanted to speak to his friends alone the glorious last words of
   chapters 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th, and that he deliberately exposed
   Judas and sent him away. One of you shall betray me. Christ had before
   foretold his betrayal (see Matt. 17:22 and 20:18), but had not declared
   that one of the twelve should be the betrayer. Judas, led captive by
   his covetousness, had already agreed to betray him, immediately after
   his disappointment over the alabaster box of ointment. See Matt.
   26:14-16. None else of course knew of it and it is no wonder the
   Savior's words startled the apostles. (Joh 13:22)

   22. Looked at one another. In wonder and questioning. They did not
   venture to doubt the Savior's prophecy, but it seemed to them
   impossible that one of their number could prove a traitor. (Joh 13:23)

   23. There was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples. The party
   were reclining at the table in the Greek and Roman fashion. A wide
   couch was placed along the table and each guest reclined on his left
   elbow with his feet extended outward. The disciple next in front of the
   Savior would, therefore, be very near his bosom. He only needed to bend
   back a little to throw himself on his bosom. Whom Jesus loved. This
   phrase occurs seven times in John's Gospel, twice in speaking of
   Martha, Mary and Lazarus, and five times as the designation of the one
   of the disciples who wrote this Gospel. Though John never declares that
   he is the one meant, it has always been so understood by the church.
   One reason for this view is found in the fact that he names all the
   other apostles freely, but never names himself otherwise. Some have
   insisted that it was egotism to thus designate himself. Rather, I
   suppose that it was such a joy to John to know and feel that one so
   glorious as Christ had loved "even him," that he could hardly suppress
   his joy. After long years of work and trial had passed and he was a
   gray-haired man, it filled his soul with transports to think that Jesus
   loved him and that he had reclined on his bosom. (Joh 13:24)

   24. Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him. All are eager to know more,
   for they are filled with anxiety. Peter, always impulsive, as usual is
   the one who acts. He does not speak but beckons to John who was next to
   Christ to find out whom he meant. It must be kept in mind that he did
   not speak, and probably none but John, whose eye he had caught, saw him
   beckon. Therefore none else knew what John would ask Christ, and as he
   asked in a low tone of voice, the answer was not understood by the
   company. (Joh 13:25)

   25. He then, lying on Jesus' breast, saith . . . Lord, who is it? The
   Revision says, "leaning back." The reader must not forget their
   positions. As Lucke says: "Since the captivity, the Jews lay at table
   in the Persian manner, on divans or couches, each on his left side,
   with his face to the table, his left elbow resting on a pillow and
   supporting his head. The second guest to the right hand lay with head
   near the breast of the first, and so on." John, being the disciple next
   to the Lord, let his head drop back on the bosom of Jesus and asked in
   a low tone, unheard by the others: "Who is it?" (Joh 13:26)

   26. He it is to whom I shall give a sop. In a low tone also, in the ear
   of John, the Lord answers that he will show. There was upon the table a
   dish of bitter herbs, a kind of sauce that was always eaten at the
   passover. No knives, forks or spoons are used at an Eastern table, but
   the fingers only, which are always carefully washed before eating.
   These are dipped in the dish. The Lord took a piece of the unleavened
   bread, dipped it into the dish of sauce and handed it to Judas. John
   saw the act and understood what it meant. The rest did not yet
   comprehend that Judas was the traitor. (Joh 13:27)

   27. After the sop Satan entered into him. We learn by comparison with
   the other accounts of this scene that the apostles each asked when
   Christ declared one should betray him, "Is it I?" Judas, who knew what
   he had sold himself to do, at last asked the same question and the Lord
   answered, "Thou hast said." It is evident from John 13:28, that this
   was answered in the ear of Judas and was not understood by his
   companions. Startled to know that his treachery was exposed to the
   Master, as soon as he receives the sop, he casts aside an hesitation
   and gives himself up wholly to Satan's work. This is what I understand
   by the statement, "Satan entered into him," for already he was under
   the devilish influence. Up to this time he had doubts and impulses to
   do better, but now he plunges headlong into the bottomless pit. That
   thou doest, do quickly. Judas understood these words. He was fully
   exposed. He had covenanted to do the wicked deed; Christ bids him do it
   at once. Christ wished the work done that night and he wished the
   traitor to leave at once that he might be alone to give a last sweet
   and loving charge to the faithful disciples. (Joh 13:28) (Joh 13:29)

   28, 29. No man at the table know for what intent he spake. None but
   John knew that Judas was the traitor. Hence none could understand what
   the Lord charged Judas to do. They supposed that Judas was directed to
   spend some money for some purpose; for things needed for the feast week
   of the passover which began with the passover meal; or to give
   something to the poor. Judas carried the small purse of the company,
   and scanty as it was, the poor had a share in it. See John 12:6. (Joh
   13:30)

   30. He . . . went immediately out. He ate the sop, Christ spoke to him
   at once, and he immediately arose and went out. The question has been
   much discussed whether Judas was present when the Lord's Supper was
   instituted. I do not consider it vitally important that this should be
   settled, but I am of the opinion that he was not. We have just had the
   account of the passover; it was at the passover meal that Judas ate the
   sop; he went out immediately, leaving the Lord and the rest of the
   apostles at the table. After the passover meal the Supper was ordained;
   then followed the touching discourses recorded by John. It will be
   observed that this is the order of Matt. 26:17-30. Matthew was present
   and undoubtedly followed the chronological order. His order is, 1. The
   Passover; 2. The exposure of Judas; 3. (Omitting to mention the
   departure of Judas which John records.) The institution of the Supper.
   Mark and Luke were not present, and neither follows closely the
   chronological order, as is done by the two apostolic writers who were
   present.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Son of Man Glorified.

   We have entered upon the Holy of Holies of the Gospel history. The
   farewell discourses of our Lord, extending from chapter 13:31 to 17:26,
   are unique even in this unique Gospel of John who was nearest the heart
   of Jesus and best qualified to drink in those words of comfort and
   instruction before the great sacrifice of the cross. Lange calls them
   "the most mysterious and most holy of the sayings of Christ, and a
   spiritual ante-celebration of his own glorification and that of his
   people in the new celestial life opened up by his death and
   resurrection." The parting song and blessing of Moses (Deut., chapters
   32 and 33), the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, the evangelist of the
   prophets, and the farewell address of Paul to the Ephesian elders (Acts
   20:17-36), bear a remote resemblance. We may also compare these last
   discourses with the Lord's final discourses in Matthew, chapters 24 and
   25, Mark, chapter 13, and Luke, chapter 21. In John the Lord revealed
   the inner consummation of his work and the spiritual revolution to be
   accomplished; in the other Gospels he prophesied the overthrow of the
   Jewish theocracy and the establishment of his kingdom. Such an evening
   as the 14th of Nisan in the year of the crucifixion occurred only once
   in the world's history; the full meaning of eternity was condensed into
   a few hours. The last words of our Lord to his eleven disciples combine
   the deepest emotion with serene repose; they are unutterably solemn,
   weighty and comforting; they seem to sound directly from heaven, and
   they lift the reader high above time and space. We have more here than
   words; we have things, verities, acts of infinite love going out from
   God and going into the hearts of men. The main ideas are: "I in the
   Father; the Father in me; I in the believer; the believer in me; I came
   from my Father in heaven; I fulfilled his will on earth; I now return
   to my Father, and prepare a place for my disciples in the many mansions
   of my Father's house that they may be where I am and share my
   glory."--Schaff. (Joh 13:31) (Joh 13:32)

   31. When therefore he was gone out. When Judas had gone out the last
   disturbing element seems to have been removed from the mind of the
   Lord. The clouds of the world are lifted and there begins the most
   remarkable discourse recorded in history. The hour has come; the Master
   is about to part from his disciples; he will go through his bloody
   pathway to the presence of the Father; they will be left without him to
   meet the storms, trials and persecutions of earth. It is the time,
   therefore, for the Lord to pour forth the deepest feelings of his soul
   in their behalf. The discourse that follows, comforts, consoles,
   instructs and points them to the glory, power, and grace of their Lord.
   In it he apparently strives, as never before, to reveal himself to them
   so fully that every doubt of his divine majesty shall pass away. And
   when the gloom that gathered around his tomb was broken every doubt was
   forever dispelled in the deep knowledge of his glory. Now is the Son of
   man glorified. To him, now that Judas has gone, and he is at the foot
   of the cross, the struggle is passed, his weary ministry ended, and the
   glorification begun. There is an emphasis and exultation in "now." His
   disciples were not yet fully freed from their carnal ideas of his
   earthly glorification. They had expected its accomplishment in his
   coronation as King of the Jews in Jerusalem. He had, however, already
   pointed to the cross as the means of his glorification and as its
   shadow already falls upon him he anticipates the "lifting up" as a
   sacrifice, as a risen Savior, and as an ascending Lord to take seat
   upon a universal throne. It is his work now to more especially prepare
   his disciples for the disappointment of the false hopes that they had
   cherished, born of their Jewish education, by pointing them to his
   greater majesty, filling them with larger hopes and investing them with
   higher prerogatives and honors than they could ever have had in an
   earthly kingdom. The Lord's Supper, instituted this night, pointed
   unmistakably to the cross; now he points to it as the beginning of his
   glorification. His glory, while engaged in his lowly ministry, had not
   been seen. Nor would it be seen on the cross. The world's idea of his
   glory was different, but proceeding right from the cross would begin an
   honor and exaltation that even the world would recognize and from it he
   would ascend, after a few days' instruction to his disciples, to enjoy
   the glory he had with the Father before the world was. (Joh 13:33)

   33. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Observe the
   tenderness of the term applied to his disciples, a term applied nowhere
   else except in 1 John 2:1, 12. He had told the Jews (7:34; 8:21) that
   he would go away and they could not follow him. So now he says to his
   disciples, but he comforts them by the assurance (14:3) that he will
   return for them. (Joh 13:34)

   34. A new commandment I give unto you. The commandment to love was not
   new, but such love as the Savior commanded was new. It was such love
   for each other as he had shown for them that he commanded. That love
   was one so intense as to give up all things. His love led him to leave
   heaven, to take our infirmities upon him, to endure a weary and painful
   ministry, to become a servant, even to wash the feet of his disciples,
   and it was about to show itself forth in the outpouring of his blood
   for the sake of his people. It was such love as he would inspire in the
   hearts of his disciples for each other; a self-denying,
   self-sacrificing love which is not of the earth, but carries its own
   demonstration that it is of heavenly origin. The "new life" is love.
   (Joh 13:35)

   35. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples. Such love as
   this excited the wonder of the heathen in the earlier ages of the
   church when it burned with such a heavenly flame, and they said, "See
   how these Christians love one another." But the presence of such love
   does more than cause those who behold it to marvel. It points them to
   Christ as its author, for all must admit, when it shines forth in its
   excellency, that it is of heavenly origin. Hence, when it is fully
   exhibited men know that those who possess it are the disciples of
   Christ. So it has been in all ages. The men who have loved their race,
   given themselves for it, have gone as missionaries to the wretched,
   have built the hospitals and refuges; the Oberlins, Judsons, Howards
   and Florence Nightingale, have been those who were filled with the love
   of Christ. When did an infidel build a hospital! (Joh 13:36)

   36. Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? I believe that
   in the interval after the departure of Judas and before this question
   the Lord's Supper was instituted. The Lord said, "Do this in
   remembrance of me until I come again." Peter, after the supper is
   eaten, not yet able to comprehend the Lord's death, asks, "Whither
   goest thou?" Here begins what Olshausen calls the "Most Holy Place" in
   John's Gospel; the last moments the Lord spent with his own before his
   suffering, a moment in which he speaks words full of tenderness and
   heavenly meaning; if possible, the most precious words of Christ
   himself. At first there is a conversation around the table; then they
   arise from it (John 14:31) and the discourse takes a higher form,
   culminating in the touching prayer of chapter 17th. The Savior's first
   words are to Peter in answer to his question. Whither I go thou canst
   not follow me now. The Lord's way was to the cross, the sepulcher, the
   ascension, and to heaven. Peter might follow in due time, but the Lord
   had other work for him now. He does not, however, answer Peter's
   question directly. According to tradition, Peter did follow Christ to
   the cross in death. He was also crucified. (Joh 13:37)

   37. Why cannot I follow thee now? It was very hard for Peter to give
   up. He was impetuous, generous and self-willed. His conduct now was
   characteristic of the man. Christ has spoken of death; Peter declares
   that he will die too for his Master's sake. (Joh 13:38)

   38. Wilt thou lay down thy life? The Lord reveals to him his weakness.
   It was then night. Before the cock shall crow for the dawn of the next
   morning he will have thrice denied his Lord. For the fulfilment of this
   prediction, see Luke 22:54-60. Peter had bravely attempted to defend
   his Master with a sword when the company came, led by Judas, but when
   Christ was led away, he "followed afar off." His courage was departing.
   First, in the hall of the high priest, he denied to the maid servant
   that he knew Christ; then, a little while after, he denied to another
   man. About an hour later another said, "Of a truth this fellow was with
   him; for he is a Galilean." And Peter denied with oaths, declaring,
   "Man, I know not what you say." Just then the cock crowed for the
   approach of day.

Practical Observations.

   1. The love of money is the root of all evil. If a man surrenders to a
   sordid desire for wealth he will be prepared for any deed.

   2. The only way to deal with temptation is to say, "Get behind me,
   Satan!" If we cherish the thought of wrong doing, the desire will grow
   upon us until "Satan enters into us." "Resist the devil and he will
   flee from you."

   3. Beware of the beginnings of evil. The seed may be small as a grain
   of mustard, but if nourished it becomes a great tree that overshadows a
   life. When Judas began to pilfer from the bag, he had no thought that
   he would ever sell his Master. When Nero first ascended the Roman
   throne, a tender youth, he mourned that he had learned to write, he
   shuddered so to sign a death warrant. He lived to become the bloodiest
   tyrant of the earth by the gradual growth of the evil within that he
   did not seek to repress.

   4. Wouldest thou sell Jesus? Dost thou not? Dost thou forsake him for
   the sake of making money? or for pleasure? or for friends? Then for
   these things dost thou betray the Master. You sell him and your
   birthright for a mess of pottage.

   5. Before the cock crow. Before three o'clock in the morning. Three
   crowings of the cock were distinguished,--the first between midnight
   and one o'clock, the second about three, the third between five and
   six. The mention of those two crowings, the first of which should have
   already been a warning to Peter, perhaps makes the gravity of his sin
   the more conspicuous.

The House of Many Mansions.

   "No sooner had Judas left the room than, as though it had been relieved
   of some ghastly incubus, the spirits of the little company revived. The
   presence of that haunted soul lay with a weight of horror on the heart
   of the Master, and no sooner had he departed than the sadness of the
   feast seems to have been sensibly relieved. The solemn exultation that
   dilated the soul of their Lord--that joy like the sense of a boundless
   sunlight beyond the earthborn mists--communicated itself to the spirits
   of his followers. In sweet, tender communion, perhaps two hours glided
   away at that quiet banquet."--Farrar. (Joh 14:1)

   1. Let not your heart be troubled. The darkness of night had settled
   down on Jerusalem and Christ well knew that before the morning dawned
   he would be in the hands of his enemies. Just before him was
   Gethsemane, the betrayal, the denial, the mock trial, the scourging and
   the cross, but with these in full view, such are the wonders of his
   love that he does not think of himself. He does not ask comfort but he
   gives it. His heart is full of the sorrow of his disciples over his
   departure. It is a disappointment of all their hopes, for they cannot
   yet understand it, and the last moments of this sacred hour are devoted
   to cheering and instructing them. Believe also in me. They had believed
   in him, but they were so confused over the prospect of his death and
   departure, that they stumbled. He bids them to believe in him as they
   believed in God; to trust him even if they did not comprehend; to walk
   by faith rather than by sight through the darkness of that hour. To
   understand these words the confusion, sorrow and despair of his
   disciples over his death must not be forgotten. (Joh 14:2)

   2. In my Father's house are many mansions. By the "Father's house" is
   meant the heavenly abode. He is about to return there, from whence he
   had come. It was not a small, narrow place, where few could be
   admitted, but it had many "abiding places," room enough for all, room
   enough for them to follow him in due time and be with him, so that the
   separation about to take place would not be an eternal separation. Had
   it been otherwise he would have told. I go to prepare a place for you.
   If the separation was to be an eternal one he would have forewarned
   them. Rather, he goes before to prepare a home for them where they can
   all be together. The departure of Jesus was needful to open an entrance
   to them and us. From the cross he went to rend the vail of the temple
   "thus signifying that the way into heaven was now open." On the cross
   he shed the blood that cleanses us from sin, defiled with which we
   could never enter. He not only prepares a place for us, but prepares
   the way. It is a blessed thought that in heaven his thoughts are upon
   us and that he is preparing a congenial home for us. Just how he makes
   that preparation we may not understand but the fact is sure. (Joh 14:3)

   3. I will come again, and receive you unto myself. The reference is not
   to Christ's return from the grave, but to a return from heaven, the
   second coming of the Lord, which is a part of the Christian faith.
   There is a presence of the Lord with his people, there is a call of the
   Lord to those who die in him to "depart and be with Christ," but there
   is also a personal coming of the Lord to summon all men to his presence
   and then, at the final judgment, every saint shall be "received to
   himself," when the Lord shall say, "Come ye blessed of my Father." Then
   shall they be "forever with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4:17). Death is simply
   a going home to be with Christ (Phil. 1:23). (Joh 14:4)

   4. Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. The Lord probably made
   this statement to provoke questions, such as followed. He had stated so
   clearly before that it seems strange to us that the apostles did not
   understand, but they were wedded to the idea that Christ was to be an
   earthly king, like all the rest of the Jews. The place to which he was
   going was the presence of the Father from whom he came and the way by
   which he would go was the cross, the tomb, the resurrection and the
   exaltation. He had often spoken of these things. See Matt. 16:21, also
   17:22 and 20:17. (Joh 14:5)

   5. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not, etc. Thomas, a plain,
   honest apostle, lost all hope when the Lord died; nor could he believe
   in the resurrection until he saw with his own eyes. Now he declares,
   "we do not know whither thou goest." We have heard thee talking of
   going away and dying when we expected thee to stay here and reign as
   the Christ. We cannot understand thy departure nor whither thou goest.
   Then, How can we know the way? (Joh 14:6)

   6. I am the way, the truth, and the life. The Lord only answers his
   difficulty in part. He points him to the way in which he must walk if
   he would follow him. He must follow Christ in his life if he would
   follow him to the Father's house. He is the Way. The words of Christ
   here are words that could have only been spoken by a divine being. "I
   am the way," the exemplar, the living embodiment of what is needful to
   impart immortality. He who follows in his footsteps will tread the sure
   path. He is the Truth; not merely truth, but the Truth, truth embodied
   and speaking to men; the key of all truth, and in himself a revelation
   of all truth needful to lift men to God. And the Life. He is life
   itself , the living waters, the bread of life, the source from whence
   the germ of immortal being is imparted to the human soul. Without him
   there would be no Way revealed; no divine and saving truth, no immortal
   life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me. Not only can no one enter
   the Father's house without him, but no man can come to the Father on
   earth so as to enjoy his favor. "There is no other name given under
   heaven among men whereby we must be saved." Hence all must cling to him
   as the way. "By me" is equivalent to "follow in the way that I point
   out." (Joh 14:7)

   7. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. After over
   three years under the ministry of Christ they did not yet know him,
   except in part. The great truth declared is that the way to study God
   and know him is to know Christ. The universe may reveal his matchless
   grandeur, the Old Testament may reveal his moral government, but it is
   only in Christ that he reveals his surpassing love, tenderness and
   mercy, his solicitude for the salvation of the race. It is in the Son
   that he reveals himself as a Father. Until Christ came men did not dare
   to bow upon their knees and pour out such a prayer as "Our Father who
   art in heaven," etc. From henceforth ye know him and have seen him.
   From the cross. On the next morning they would see Christ dying. From
   the sepulcher would burst forth upon their minds a new revelation of
   the character and mission of the Son whom they had up to this time
   supposed to be only an earthly, temporal king. Then, comprehending
   Christ, understanding that he would ascend a heavenly throne, that "all
   power" would be given into his hands, they would also know that "he was
   the brightness of the Father's glory and the express image of his
   person." They would know that in Christ they had beheld the revelation
   of the Father. (Joh 14:8)

   8. Shew us the Father and it sufficeth us. Philip fails to comprehend
   that the Father was to be seen in Christ and when the Lord declares
   that henceforth they have seen the Father; he at once requests such a
   revelation. He perhaps expected such a manifestation as Moses saw on
   the holy mount and from whence he came with a face shining like the sun
   (Ex. 33:18). The disciples were not only confused but filled with
   wonder; almost stupefied with the immediate prospect of the death of
   the Lord, but still had some expectation of the manifestation, in some
   way, of the kingdom. Philip's request is for a vision of God, of which
   he may have thought that Christ spoke. He wanted to walk by sight,
   instead of by faith. (Joh 14:9)

   9. He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. Philip, one of the chosen
   apostles, over three years an attendant on the ministry of Christ,
   seeing and hearing him daily, after such opportunities and "so long
   time, had not known" the Lord in his real character. He did not yet
   comprehend that the Son came to reveal the Father. He wanted a literal
   sight of God with the natural eyes, when God incarnate had been present
   with him for three years, manifesting the mind, the purity, the saving
   power, the fatherly tenderness, the unutterable love of the Father.
   Natural eyes cannot behold him who is "Spirit" no more than they can
   see the human soul; hence man "cannot see God and live," but we can see
   and understand "God manifest in the flesh." Let it be noted that Christ
   was not an ambassador from God, but "Immanuel, God with us," the
   "Godhead in bodily form." No man, nor any angel, nor any created being
   could say, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." Even the best,
   most Christlike Christian, would not dare to say, "He that hath seen me
   hath seen Christ." (Joh 14:10)

   10. Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
   There was the completest union of the personalities of the Son and the
   Father. We may never on earth comprehend fully its nature, but we can
   understand it to be so complete that he was the manifestation of God in
   the flesh. In him was no sin and in him was the fulness of the Godhead
   bodily (Col. 2:9). Hence his words were not his own but the words of
   God, and "the Father that dwelt in him did the works" that he wrought.
   The source of Christ's authority, wisdom and power, was in the Father.
   (Joh 14:11)

   11. Believe me that I am in the Father. The Lord did not wish only that
   they would accept his statement but that they would rise to such
   spiritual discernment as to behold in him the revelation of the
   Father's will and character. If needful to their faith they should
   believe for his works' sake. These, such as man had never wrought,
   ought to convince them that the Father worked through him. (Joh 14:12)

   12. Greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my Father.
   Those who believe shall have power given to do works, in some respects
   greater; not greater miracles, but to effect greater moral and
   spiritual revolutions. At the time of his death, as far as we know, he
   had only about five hundred disciples, but he "went to his Father" and
   "shed forth the things seen and heard" on Pentecost, and the eleven
   apostles converted 3,000 in a single day. Paul made far more converts
   than the Master. It was needful that he go to the Father in order to
   enable his disciples to accomplish these "greater works." (Joh 14:13)
   (Joh 14:14)

   13, 14. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do. What
   man would dare to make such a promise? It will be noted that in order
   to enjoy the fulness of these glorious promises we must, 1. Believe. It
   is limited thus in verse 12. Without faith it is impossible to please
   God. 2. We must ask in his name, or, in dependence upon the merit and
   intercession of Christ. 3. As shown elsewhere, we must come with a
   spirit of complete submission to the Father's will, feeling that his
   will is best, and saying in our hearts, Thy will be done. Every prayer
   "in the name," must be in the spirit of Christ, and that always says,
   "Not my will but thine be done."

Practical Observations.

   1. Never has earth seen a greater triumph of love than the Savior,
   about to be crucified, comforting his disciples. As he loved them then
   so he loves them still.

   2. As he loves us so doth the Father, for the Father is in him as he is
   in the Father. The Father and the Son are one, and both love us with a
   love that passeth all comprehension.

   3. Christ came down to earth on a mission of mercy, ministered mercy
   here, died in mercy, and ascended to heaven impelled by mercy and love.
   He has gone to prepare a place for us in the Father's house; a Home.

   4. Christ is the Way there. There is no other way. He that would seek
   to enter in some other way is a thief and a robber. To reject him is to
   reject the Truth and the Life; to turn from heaven and immortality.

   5. There was but one place of safety when the flood came--the ark.
   There was but one man to whom the Egyptians could go for corn during
   the famine--Joseph. There was but one way to keep off the angel of
   death on the Passover night--the way of the sprinkled blood. There was
   but one word that could save the Ephraimites at Jordan's ford (Judges
   12)--the word Shibboleth. So there is but one name that hath power to
   save men now--the name of Jesus.--J. C. Ryle.

   6. If men need not to go to heaven by the Cross, but by some other way,
   then the Cross may become an old, worn, unused way; no footfall of a
   traveler may cheer it, heaven may be filled through other avenues, and
   other songs than those of Praise to the Lamb may echo through the
   arches of the Upper Temple. If Christ is not the exclusive Savior, then
   other Saviors could be made without the Cross, and the Cross is all an
   idle waste. We are lost men outside of God's kingdom. There is a way
   into it--Jesus Christ. There is a name, one name, given whereby we can
   be saved--that name is Jesus. There has come from the sweet heavens
   over us no other. It is enough. We need no other.--J. Drummond.

The Advocate Promised.

   15. If ye love me keep my commandments. This is not a command, but a
   declaration that if his disciples love him they will obey him. See
   Revised Version. Obedience is the fruit of love. Disobedience is the
   proof that love is not in the heart. "This is the love of God," or
   proof of the love of God, "that you keep his commandments." 1 John 5:3.
   The faithful outward observance of the will of Christ is a proof of a
   heart filled with his love, and therefore fitted to enjoy the promise
   contained in the next verse that depends on the condition of faithful
   obedience. (Joh 14:16)

   16. And I will pray the Father. Rather "request" the Father. There are
   three Greek verbs used in the New Testament which mean respectively,
   "request," "ask," and "entreat." Christ never uses the last in his
   petitions to the Father. It belongs to the petitions of the creature to
   the Creator. And he shall give you another Comforter. The word rendered
   Comforter is not exactly translated by any word in our language. It
   comes from two Greek words that mean "to call to one's side." It occurs
   four times in John's Gospel and is rendered each time as here. It is
   used by no New Testament writer but John, who employs it also in 1 John
   2:1 where it is translated Advocate, a term preferred by many scholars.
   Wickliffe first rendered it Comforter and has been followed by Tyndale,
   and all the authorized British versions down to the Revision. Some
   translators have preferred to transfer the Greek word Paraklete, rather
   than to adopt any English term that does not fully express its meaning.
   The Spirit promised is more than a Comforter. He is our Strength, our
   Peace-giver, a present help in time of need, a source of knowledge to
   the church, a witness, God and Christ with us. Probably no single term
   would more nearly express the meaning than the word Helper, which was
   probably nearly the meaning of Comforter in Wickliffe's time. That word
   is derived from con and fortis, and means, etymologically, to encourage
   or strengthen. That he may abide with you forever. The Lord had been
   with them for about three years, but was on the eve of departure. He
   has been a Helper to his disciples, and in his absence will send
   another Helper, who shall always remain with his people. (Joh 14:17)

   17. The Spirit of truth. So called because he speaks the truth. The
   Comforter strengthens, guides, liberates, sanctifies by the truth. See
   chapter 17:19; 1 Cor. 2:4; 1 Thess. 1:5. He also bears witness of the
   truth. See Acts 2:4; Acts 5:32; Heb. 2:4. Whom the world cannot
   receive. The reason why the world cannot receive the Comforter is
   indicated in verses 15 and 23. There must be a preparation of the soul
   for his indwelling. The heart must be purified by faith, the soul must
   be filled with love of Christ, this condition must be demonstrated by
   obedience to his commandments. This is in harmony with the entire
   teaching of the New Testament. "Except a man be born again he cannot
   see the kingdom of God." John 3:3. The necessity of a loving obedience
   in order to the reception of the Holy Spirit is taught emphatically.
   Peter said to the Jews (Acts 5:32), "We are witnesses of these things,
   and so is also the Holy Spirit which God gives to them who obey him."
   In John 7:39 it is declared that the Savior "spake of the Spirit which
   they that believe on him should receive." In Acts 2:38 Peter, in reply
   to the anxious inquiry of convicted sinners, answers: "Repent and be
   baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
   remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit;"
   the gift being made dependent upon repentance and obedience. The temple
   of the human heart has to be prepared by obedience for the indwelling
   of the Father and Son, and hence the world cannot receive the Comforter
   through whom they are manifested. The Spirit can convict the world of
   sin (chapter 16:8), the world can receive his testimony when he bears
   witness; hence the apostles were directed to "go into all the world and
   preach the gospel to every creature," "baptizing them into the name of
   the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit," and God "gives the Holy
   Spirit to those who obey him," but in its unconverted condition the
   world cannot "see" or "know" the Comforter. The world can only see with
   the carnal eyes and recognize material manifestations. The saints
   prepared for his presence by faith, love and obedience, have a
   spiritual perception of his presence. (Joh 14:18)

   18. I will not leave you comfortless. The word in the Greek is
   orphaned. It is applied to childless parents, or fatherless children,
   or any one bereaved. The term "desolate" used in the Revision probably
   expresses the idea. The disciples were bewildered and stupefied with
   grief at the thought of the Master's departure, but he assures them
   that they will not be left desolate. He will come again; not only as
   the risen Lord who shall visit them for a little while on the earth,
   but he will come to be "with them always," as manifest in their hearts
   by the Holy Spirit after it is given. He does not refer to his second
   coming "without a sin offering unto salvation," for then "every eye
   shall see him," while now he speaks of a coming in which "the world
   shall see him no more," but in which his disciples shall see, or
   recognize him. (Joh 14:19)

   19. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more. After the next
   evening the world would see him no more. When it took him and buried
   him out of sight it looked upon him for the last time. But ye see me.
   They would see him with the natural eyes after he had veiled himself to
   the world. This, however, does not exhaust the sense. There is a sight
   that is not of the natural eyes, such a sight as those old worthies had
   who walked "as seeing him who is invisible," and the living Christ
   would so dower with heavenly life his disciples that, because "he
   lived, they should live also," and should have a constant recognition
   of his presence. There is a promise of an unbroken communion with the
   Lord. The manner in which they should have his abiding presence is
   pointed out in verse 21, and more fully in verse 23. (Joh 14:20)

   20. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father. "That day" began
   on the day of Pentecost. The apostles and brethren "waited the promise
   of the Father" until "the day of Pentecost was fully come," and then
   the risen and exalted Savior "shed forth" the Holy Spirit which he had
   promised should abide with his people forever. "That day" still comes
   to each soul which believes upon the Lord, repents of sin, and giving
   up all worldly lusts, surrenders himself unreservedly to the will of
   Christ and does his commandments. (Joh 14:21)

   21. He that hath my commandments. The conditions upon which Christ may
   be present in each soul, seen and enjoyed, are next shown. As before
   seen, obedience and love are essential. "Hath" the commandments implies
   more than a mere possession of them. It implies that they are clearly
   apprehended. This must be the case before one can be said to "keep"
   them. This verse gives the same idea as verse 15, but in a converse
   form. There active obedience is seen to follow as the result of love.
   Love is the cause, and obedience the effect. Here the effect is placed
   first and traced back to its cause. The active obedience is a proof of
   love. He that loveth me. Having pointed out the test by which our love
   for Christ is determined, he shows the blessed consequences that flow
   from this love. The heart that loves the loving Savior is a heart that
   is pleasing in the sight of the Son and the Father. It is in sympathy
   with the great loving heart of the universe and fit for abiding
   communion with the Son. Hence he declares: I will manifest myself to
   him. He will come, as the Comforter, to make his abiding place in such
   a heart. There will be such a manifestation that his presence will be
   revealed. In other words, the loving and beloved disciple will have an
   abiding sense of a living Christ who will "never leave nor forsake
   him." (Joh 14:22)

   22. Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot. John is careful to state that
   this apostle was not the traitor who had gone out a little while
   before. What hath come to pass? etc. This question indicates the
   bewilderment of all the apostles. They had, in spite of his teachings,
   adhered to the Jewish ideas that had been educated into them from
   childhood, and assumed that as the Messiah he would manifest himself
   publicly to the world. The question implies that Christ had departed
   from his former purposes, in that he should determine to manifest
   himself to his disciples, but not unto the world. It indicates that, up
   to this time, Judas entirely failed to comprehend either the mission or
   the words of the Redeemer. This dullness on the part of all the
   apostles continued until after the resurrection, and was only finally
   dissipated by the "manifestation of Christ" in their hearts after the
   descent of the Holy Spirit. (Joh 14:23)

   23. If a man love me, he will keep my words. The Lord again
   compassionately states the conditions needful for his manifestation, as
   already pointed out, but adding another and a sweeter idea; that is,
   that the loving soul shall be a temple of God, and that as of old the
   Shekinah came and dwelt between the cherubim, so the Father and the Son
   will come and make their abode in the heart that is prepared for the
   divine fellowship by love. Observe the steps that lead to the glorious
   consummation: 1. Love of Christ; 2. Keeping his words; 3. The Father's
   love bestowed; 4. The coming of the Father and the Son; 5. Their
   indwelling in the loving heart. Christ stands at the door and knocks
   for entrance (Rev. 3:20); he that hath his commandments hears the
   voice; he that keeps them opens the door; he enters in and sups and
   abides. (Joh 14:24)

   24. He that loveth me not keepeth not, etc. Disobedience springs from
   the absence of the love of Christ in the heart, and Christ only
   manifests himself in the heart that loves him. But he who refuses to
   obey Christ is disobedient to the Father also, because Christ's word is
   the Father's. (Joh 14:25)

   25. These things have I spoken, being present. "These things" is put in
   contrast with "all things" in the next verse. They were yet so dull
   that they could not fully comprehend even what he said, but the time
   would come when they would understand better. The next verse points out
   that time. (Joh 14:26)

   26. The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. The Revision gives, instead
   of "Ghost," which is not correct, "Spirit," as the word Pneuma should
   always be translated. The Savior now identifies the Comforter with the
   Holy Spirit, soon to be sent. Whom the Father will send in my name.
   What is done in the name of Christ is, not independent of him, but in
   recognition of his mission and authority. The Holy Spirit will be sent
   because the Son requests it (verse 16), will be sent to carry on his
   work, bear witness of him, and to bring the world to recognition of his
   name. It is in Christ's name that the Spirit was first shed forth; it
   is in his name that he acts, and it is to those believing upon his name
   that he is imparted. Shall teach you all things. He shall not only
   enable you to "understand the Scriptures" and my words that you do not
   now comprehend, but will reveal to you new truths by inspiration, and
   bring to remembrance all things that I have said to you. It is due to
   this gift of the Spirit that we have the privilege of reading and
   studying these memorable discourses of the Master. The Gospel
   historians had "all things brought to their remembrance." As Alford
   remarks: "It is in the fulfillment of this promise to the apostles that
   their sufficiency as witnesses of all that the Lord did and taught, and
   consequently the authenticity of the Gospel narrative, is grounded.
   While most of the promises in this grand discourse are of general
   application, there are some that the Savior himself limits and here
   declares that the Comforter shall teach "all things," and "bring all
   things to remembrance." Whatsoever I have said unto you. This limits
   the promise so that it contains no warrant for the doctrine of a
   progressive revelation through the ages, as advocated by Abbott in his
   Commentary on John (see this passage) and held by H. W. Beecher and
   others. Its only application to the saints in general is that the
   Spirit will aid their remembrance and understanding of the recorded
   word contained in the completed revelation of the Holy Scriptures. (Joh
   14:27)

   27. Peace I leave with you. This is a solemn and affectionate farewell,
   in view of the cross, a parting benediction. As Isaac, about to depart,
   bestowed his blessing; as Jacob, "leaning on the top of his staff,"
   blessed the twelve patriarchs, so the departing Lord will leave his
   peace to his disciples. My peace I give. Not such peace as the world
   gives; not an idle and empty form as were the wishes of peace in the
   salutations of the world, but his own peace, the peace he enjoyed; the
   peace that caused him to sleep sweetly while tossed on the billows of
   Galilee, to be calm and unruffled before the Sanhedrim and Pilate; the
   peace that is a deep and placid sea that the storm cannot disturb, such
   peace he will bestow. Such peace be did and does bestow. Such peace had
   Stephen when the stones crushed him down, Peter when in Herod's
   dungeon, and Paul and Silas when they sang in the night at Philippi.
   Such peace may all have who love, obey and receive into their hearts
   the manifested Lord. (Joh 14:28)

   28. Ye have heard, etc. . . . If ye loved me ye would rejoice. This is
   a gentle rebuke. It declares that the desire of his disciples to
   prevent him from going away springs from selfish motives. They ought to
   rejoice because his own glory would be secured by his departure. He
   would return to his Father, whence he came, to be exalted to the right
   hand of God and to have "all power in heaven and earth." My Father is
   greater than I. Therefore, when I return to the Father, and my union
   with him is complete, all the earthly hindrances to the establishment
   of my kingdom and my exaltation to the throne of glory will be removed,
   and my work will be accomplished on the earth. There has been a vast
   amount of needless discussion concerning the words, "My Father is
   greater than I." It is not a statement that the Father is of a
   different nature, or that Christ is a dependent creature, but is in
   entire harmony with all the teaching of the Son during his earthly
   ministry. He teaches that he does the will of the Father, not his own
   will; that he speaks the Father's words and does his works, not his
   own; that the Father sent him into the world, not that he came of his
   own will except in the sense that he always does the Father's will; the
   Son proceeds from the Father, not the Father from the Son; there is a
   subordination of the Son to the Father, not of the Father to the Son.
   All his words on his relation to the Father declare the superior
   greatness of the Father; not that the Father is of different essence or
   nature in any respect, but possessing the natural precedence of Father
   over Son. Yet, as I write these words, I feel that the subject of this
   relation is too high for the human understanding, and that it is almost
   trenching "where angels would not dare to tread" to discuss it. It is
   one of the mysteries whose solution men have vainly sought for eighteen
   centuries and which eternity alone will fully reveal. (Joh 14:29)

   29. I have told you before it come to pass. Told you of my going away
   that "when it is come you may believe," by knowing that I foresaw it
   all the time and that it was a part of my plan that I should go away.
   (Joh 14:30)

   30. The Prince of this world cometh. Satan, who is regarded as the
   embodiment and contriver of the sins and iniquities of the earth. At
   the temptation of Christ he had offered the kingdoms of the world as if
   they were his own, and at the time the Savior came it must be admitted
   that these kingdoms were thoroughly loyal to the prince of evil. Who
   hath nothing in me. There was nothing in common whatever between the
   prince and spirit of the world and Christ, and hence no sympathy
   whatever. Nor does Satan ever make a capture unless he can find
   something in a man in common with himself. If he can find a sinful
   ambition or lust he will seize upon it and make it the means of ruining
   a soul. Satan, finding in all but Christ, something in common with
   himself, enforces death as his due, but as Christ was sinless he died
   voluntarily, and could not be holden by death, hence did not see
   corruption. Hence, the coming of the prince of this world did not force
   him to death, but he died. (Joh 14:31)

   31. That the world may know that I love the Father. His, death was a
   sublime act of self-sacrifice. In the prayer of Gethsemane the burden
   was, "Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt." Hence, because in
   the mysteries of the divine government it was the Father's will, he
   died in demonstration of his love of the Father, and "even as the
   Father gave commandment so" he obeyed. Arise, let us go hence.
   Immediately following these words the Lord continues his discourse as
   recorded in chapters XV and XVI, and then closes with the touching
   prayer of chapter XVII. As soon as this prayer is closed it is stated
   that "When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
   disciples, over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, etc." Some
   judicious authorities hold that at the utterance of the words closing
   verse 31, the Savior and his disciples left the upper room, that the
   rest of the discourse was delivered on the way, and that when it is
   said he "went forth" it is meant that he went out of Jerusalem. I
   cannot, however, think that the character of the next three chapters is
   consistent with the view that they were spoken on the way, when the
   narrow streets of Jerusalem were crowded by the presence of at least a
   million strangers in attendance at the great festival. Such a prayer as
   the Lord's prayer in chapter XVII could not have been offered upon the
   street, amid the confusion of a noisy city. I cannot doubt that when
   the Lord "lifted up his eyes," he was in the quiet of a room and
   surrounded only by his disciples. It is far more probable, therefore,
   that the words, "Arise, let us go hence," were a signal to make ready
   for departure; that when all had arisen, he continued his discourse as
   he stood with the little group around him, with their sandals and outer
   robes girded upon them, and that, when he had closed with the prayer so
   graven on the heart of all who love him in every age, then "he went
   forth with his disciples," as is stated in 18:1.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. "Love is the fulfilling of the law." He that "loves God with his
   whole heart, mind, soul and strength, and his neighbor as himself shall
   live." Such a soul has passed from death unto life, is a partaker of
   the divine nature, and a fit abode for the indwelling of the living
   Christ.

   2. The test of our love for Christ is "keeping his words," not some of
   them, but a complete surrender of our will to his. As he loved the
   Father and "pleased him in all things," so if we love Christ we must
   make his will supreme in all things. When there is no discord between
   our will and that of the Master, then our hearts shall be fitted for a
   temple of the Lord and the Son will make his abode in the heart.

   3. The soul that is completely resigned to the will of Christ, can
   always pray "thy will be done," will enjoy the presence of Christ
   always and, with his presence and his peace such will ever feel,
   whatever may betide, that Christ is with them, that they are held in
   his hand, and that "all things shall work together for good to them
   that love God."

The True Vine.

   The solemnity of the moment, when the Redeemer rose to leave the Upper
   Room where he had eaten the Passover, must have produced a powerful
   effect upon the hearts of his disciples. Up to this period they had
   been a united and a peaceful band, and the beloved Master was yet with
   them; what a separation awaited them in a few hours! The anticipation
   of this arrested their steps; the assembly broke up but no one moved;
   they stood in silence around their Lord. Then it was that he again
   opened his lips, and delivered the following discourses, which made an
   indelible impression on the mind of the beloved disciple. It may be
   that some incidental circumstance led Jesus to begin the comparison;
   perhaps a twig stretched through the window into the room where he then
   was, or the apartment was decorated with the foliage of the vine.
   According to Josephus, on the door, 70 cubits high, which led into the
   Holy Place of the temple, an artificial vine was spread out, the
   branches and leaves of which were made of gold, and its clusters of
   diamonds and pearls. Rosenmuller thinks that it was this that led Jesus
   to institute the comparison before us.--Olshausen. I am of the opinion
   rather that the comparison sprang from the juice of the grape which had
   just been used to represent his blood. After the Lord choosing and
   distributing the fruit of the vine to represent the blood that should
   cleanse from all sin, and declaring, "I will not drink of the fruit of
   the vine until the kingdom of God is come," what more natural than for
   him to say, "I am the true vine?" As before stated, the Lord did not
   pass out over the Kedron, until after the discourses of the 15th and
   16th chapters and the prayer of the 17th. It is, then, almost certain
   that these were spoken in the Upper Room. It then becomes probable that
   the feast was broken up with the words that close chapter 14, the
   preceding discourse having been at table; that with the command, Arise,
   all arose from table to prepare for departure, but as they were
   standing the Savior, out of his full heart, spoke the words that are
   contained in the three chapters, closing with the 17th. The student is
   then to picture to himself the Master with the eleven apostles, in the
   dimly-lighted chamber, standing, girt for departure; and they, eagerly
   watching every look and gesture, and drinking in every word, while he
   begins, "I am the true Vine." (Joh 15:1)

   1. I am the true vine. On the table from whence they had just risen was
   the "fruit of the vine," and the Lord had said that he would never
   drink it again upon the earth. That may have been the occasion of the
   striking figure that he now uses, in which he exemplifies union with
   Christ. In the Old Testament the Vine is often used as the type of
   Israel, planted and tended by the Almighty as the husbandman. See Isa.
   5:1; Ps. 80; Jer. 2:21. Israel, however, had proved a wild and
   fruitless Vine. Instead of it, therefore, Christ had now been planted
   by the Father as the True Vine. He is the true Bread, the true Light,
   as well as the Good Shepherd. All these figures fitly express some of
   his relations to his people and the world. The Vine stands in a much
   closer relation to the branches than the Shepherd to the sheep. The
   latter cares for the sheep, but the Vine imparts its life to the
   branches and there is one life in the whole, the branch having no life
   except as it draws it from the vine. The relation is similar to that
   expressed by Paul when he describes Christ as the Head of the body, and
   the servants of Christ as the various members of that body, all
   pervaded by the life and will of the Head. See Eph. 5:23, and Col.
   2:19. My Father is the husbandman. God had planted the old Jewish Vine,
   which was not the True Vine, but "a figure of the true," Heb. 9:24, and
   God had also sent his Son, the True Vine, into the world, or "planted"
   him, and his care was always over the Son and has been ever since the
   Vine was left to grow and fill the earth. "God giveth the increase."
   (Joh 15:2)

   2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away. As the
   husbandman cuts off the unfruitful branches of the vine, so the Father
   severs the unfruitful branches from his Son. Judas, an unfruitful
   branch which did not have in it the life of the Vine, had just been
   severed and had gone forth. So any branch that ceases to have the life
   of the true Vine and bear fruit, that becomes lifeless and barren, is
   cut off. It often dies and drops off from the Church, which is the
   earthly representative of the True Vine, of its own weight and is lost
   sight of. Sometimes it is needful to cut it off lest it injure the
   other branches. Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it. The
   husbandman prunes and dresses the branches in order that they may be
   more healthy and fruitful. The Father cleanses, purifies, frees from
   sin, all who become branches of the True Vine. This is done, not merely
   for their own sake, but that they may be fruitful branches. The means
   employed to cleanse them from sin and impurity is next described. (Joh
   15:3)

   3. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. The
   spoken word is the instrument appointed by God for the cleansing of the
   soul. He who hears the word, believes it, receives it into his soul,
   obeys it and makes it the rule of his life, is "cleansed," or freed
   from sin. The "Word" tells the sinner what to do in order to the
   remission of sins. See Mark 16:16 and Acts 2:38. It is God in Christ
   who cleanses, but the means employed is the "Word," which must be
   received in obedient faith. (Joh 15:4)

   4. Abide in me, and I in you. The idea is, Abide in me that I may abide
   in you. Christ abiding in us is dependent on our abiding in him. We
   abide in him by keeping his words, or having his "word abide in us"
   (verse 7), and all who "keep his sayings" (chap. 14:23) will have
   Christ abide in their souls. We must prepare for the presence of Christ
   by loving him, for he can find no congenial home in any heart that does
   not love him, but he says, "If a man love me he will keep my words, and
   my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode
   with him." See the steps: 1. Love of Christ; 2. Keeping the words of
   Christ; 3. The Father's love; 4. The Father and Son come to abide with
   the one who loves and obeys. To abide in Christ and to have his life in
   us is needful, because "As the branch cannot bear fruit without the
   vine," as an its life and strength and fruitfulness comes from the
   vine, and it dies if severed, so No more can ye, except ye abide in me.
   We are dead, fruitless branches, without the Christ-life. The whole
   history of the world demonstrates that fruitfulness is only found in
   union with Christ. Where are the colleges, hospitals and benevolent
   institutions that have been reared by infidelity? What fallen and
   savage race has infidelity lifted up? What has it done for mankind?
   Where are its fruits, or the benevolent fruits of heathenism or false
   religions? There was not a hospital or benevolent institution in Rome,
   the capital of the world, when it was visited by Paul. The fruit of
   pure, holy, sweet lives, full of helpfulness to the race, is borne by
   abiding in Christ, living with his life, being moved by his Spirit.
   (Joh 15:5)

   5. I am the vine; ye are the branches. He has already declared (verse
   1) that he is the True Vine, but he had not yet declared that every
   disciple is a branch of the Vine. Had he not declared, "Ye are the
   branches," they might have concluded when, a little later, separate
   congregations were organized in various portions of the earth, that
   these were the branches; or denominationalism might have a little
   warrant for speaking of "branch churches of Christ;" but the relation
   is a much nearer, sweeter one. Every Christian is a branch of the Vine.
   His life is drawn directly from the Vine. If he clings to the Vine,
   keeps Christ's words, so that Christ abides in him, and has the life of
   the Vine, the same bringeth forth much fruit. But the branch that is
   severed from the vine is not only fruitless but dies. So the disciple,
   without Christ, can do nothing. Paul declared, "I can do all things
   through Christ who strengtheneth me." (Joh 15:6)

   6. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
   withered. The lifeless, fruitless branches in the vineyard are lopped
   off and carried out, and wither and are burned. So, too, any one who
   does not abide in Christ, is severed from the Vine, and they (the
   angels at the great day, not men as in the Common Version. See
   Revision.) cast them into the fire and they are burned. The Lord sweeps
   on over time to the eternal judgment and fate of the dead branches.
   Note 1. These have been branches of the Vine; 2. They did not "abide"
   in the Vine (Greek remain); 3. Hence they were cast forth; 4. Hence at
   the end they are gathered, by the angels, to be burned. Hence there may
   be a falling away by those who have been branches of the Vine, or "a
   falling from grace," and hence the need of watchful, prayerful
   diligence that we may abide in the Vine. (Joh 15:7) (Joh 15:8)

   7, 8. Ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. The condition of
   this blessed promise is that we abide in the Vine, by having Christ's
   words abide in us. If we maintain thus the life union so that we are
   alive with the Christ life, from his presence in us, then whatsoever we
   ask will be granted. Do you ask whether God hears prayer? I answer, "If
   we abide in Christ and he in us." Has he heard your prayers? Are you
   thus united to Christ? But this "effectual prayer" is needful to our
   fruitfulness in Christ and the glorification of the Father. For herein
   is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit. The best comment on
   this is the Savior's injunction, "Let your light so shine before men,
   that they, seeing your good works, shall glorify your Father who is in
   heaven." Those who are fruitful show that they have the life of the
   Vine and thus demonstrate that they are true disciples. "So shall ye be
   my disciples." (Joh 15:9)

   9. As the Father hath loved me, so I have loved you. The Father loved
   the Son and dwelt in him as the Son in the Father, because of their
   mutual love. Love opens the heart of the disciple to Christ that he may
   abide there (chap. 14:23) and hence the union of the disciple with
   Christ may be as close as that of Christ with the Father. Hence he
   enjoins: Abide ye in my love. This is the Revision and is better than
   the Common Version, the Greek word being that before rendered abide.
   The Lord next tells how they shall "continue" or abide in his love.
   (Joh 15:10)

   10. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love. He abode in
   the love of the Father by a life of perfect obedience. So we must abide
   in his love. The wilful, disobedient disciple cannot dwell there. Only
   he in whose heart Christ is enthroned as King and who has an absolute
   empire over the soul. To keep Christ's commandments is, not to obey
   those that suit us, but to follow him and obey all he says. Some set
   aside his commandment to be baptized. Such do not keep his
   commandments. Some obey it faithfully, but fail to observe the other
   things he has commanded, and especially the great law of love. Such do
   not keep his commandments. (Joh 15:11)

   11. These things have I spoken . . . that my joy might remain in you.
   Strange words, that one about to be crucified should speak of his joy!
   His joy was union with and the presence of the Father. He had "anointed
   him with the oil of gladness above his fellows." He desired his
   disciples to have that joy, the constant consolation of the sense of
   the presence of Christ. If Christ abode in them, his joy would remain
   in them. All spoken above was that they might have this joy. If this is
   realized their joy will be fulfilled. They "shall see the travail of
   his soul and be satisfied." The soul that has Christ in it is "full."
   (Joh 15:12)

   12. That ye love one another, as I have loved you. The greatness of his
   love for the disciples has been shown. Thus they must love one another.
   The thought developed is, 1. Love the bond that unites Father and Son.
   2. Such love the bond that unites the Son and the disciples. 3. How
   much love must also exist between the disciples in order to unite them?
   Mutual love, instead of an iron chain of commands, binds them together.
   (Joh 15:13) (Joh 15:14)

   13, 14. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
   life for his friends. The highest human exhibition of love that earth
   has ever seen was this. Damon had been ready to die for Pythias;
   fathers had died for their families; mothers for their children. Christ
   was about to exhibit this highest human type of love by dying for his
   friends. He did even more, as Paul shows us, Romans 5:6; he died for
   enemies, something that man had never done. The Lord here, however,
   points his disciples to his love for them. They are his friends, if
   they obey him. That is the condition. One may "lay down his life for
   another" without dying. If he lives to consecrate his life to his
   welfare, he gives, if possible, a higher proof of love. (Joh 15:15)

   15. I call you not servants . . . I have called you friends. Christ's
   disciples serve him, but their service is not bondage, but that of
   love. Hence, they are friends instead of servants. They have his
   presence abiding in them and the will of the Father is made known to
   them. (Joh 15:16)

   16. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you.
   Each one of the eleven apostles present had been chosen, called, by the
   Lord, from among his disciples. They did not choose him, but he them,
   in order that they might bring forth abundant fruit in the conversion
   of the world. The same is true, in part, of each disciple. Christ calls
   them by the gospel, and if they hear and obey, then they are called and
   chosen to his work. These words, however, have a special, rather than a
   general signification. The Lord selected every apostle, and called them
   to become his representatives in the church when he had ascended his
   heavenly throne. Peter, Andrew, James and John were taken from their
   boats and nets at the Sea of Galilee; Matthew from his place at the
   receipt of custom, the rest of the eleven from their various callings,
   and, last of all, Saul of Tarsus was arrested by the Lord himself on
   the way to Damascus and told that he was to become "a minister and a
   witness" to the Gentiles. As God chose Noah to build the ark, Abraham
   to found the Jewish nation, Moses to be its law-giver, David to leave
   his flocks and be its king, the Baptist to prepare the way for Christ,
   so the Lord chose out the apostles and ordained (appointed) them to
   their special work. So, too, I cannot doubt that he chooses servants in
   all ages to become the leaders in great works which are called for by
   the interests of his kingdom. Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name. They
   were ordained to "go forth and bring forth fruit." While engaged in
   that work they are promised the divine help. If at any time their own
   arms are too short they are authorized to call for the help they need
   in Christ's name. This help is to the end that they may bear fruit, or
   be efficient in the work of converting men. The principle that
   underlies the promise is of general application. The men of prayer have
   in all ages been those that have been most abundantly fruitful in their
   labors.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. The life of the branch springs from the life of the vine. The branch
   does not give life to the vine, but the vine to the branches. So Christ
   is our life.

   2. If the connection between the branch and the vine is severed it will
   at once die. As the sap must flow from the vine into the branch to give
   it life and keep it alive, so the life of the True Vine must flow into
   our souls. Christ is not only the fountain of our life, but we must
   abide in him in order to maintain it. If we let sin come between and
   cut us off we are dead.

   3. Whatever works of beneficence and love are done by the church, or by
   Christians, serve to honor and glorify Christ, because it is his life
   in us that works and bears fruit. Without him we can do nothing.

   4. Christ and sin cannot abide in the heart together. If sin abides
   there, Christ will not enter; if Christ abides there, sin can find no
   room.

   5. The beneficent work of Christ for man. Now, if there were to be made
   two maps of the world, one showing the happiness, comforts, morality,
   good deeds, benevolent gifts, means of innocent enjoyment, the light
   shades showing the countries in which a large degree of happiness is
   enjoyed, and the shades growing darker as the blessings grow less; the
   other map showing the prevalence of Christianity, the lands where the
   purest Christianity is most prevalent being represented in white, and
   the shades darkening as the lands have a less pure Christianity, or it
   is less prevalent, down to the blackness of utter heathenism,--it would
   be found that these two maps almost exactly coincide.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Church and the World.

   17. These things I command you that ye love one another. "These things"
   are all the precepts the Lord had spoken since the interview began with
   chapter XIII. It is remarkable how frequently and with what emphasis he
   enforces this duty. Indeed, to fill the heart with earnest, active
   love, love to God and to man, is the great end of the mission of
   Christ. "We know that we have passed from death unto life because we
   love the brethren." 1 John 3:14. See also Matt. 22:37-40; Rom. 13:8-10;
   1 Cor., chapter XIII, etc. In the next verse the powerful need of his
   disciples being indissolubly bound together by love is pointed out in
   the fact that they shall be hated by the world. (Joh 15:18)

   18. If the world hates you, ye know that it hated me. The world, as
   used by the Savior, means the unconverted, unspiritual, sensual,
   selfish and worldly portion of mankind, nearly all of our race at the
   time that he spoke. Of that world the spirit of evil was the prince,
   and the kings and rulers of the earth were his willing servants. When
   the Lord was about to begin his ministry the prince of the world
   tempted him with the offer of worldly glory and empire, and when the
   offer was rejected became his bitter enemy. The world hated him because
   he rebuked its sins, rejected him and crucified him. His disciples, who
   bear his likeness, have his spirit and speak his words, will also be a
   constant rebuke to the lusts and wrongs of the world and, hence, will
   not enjoy its favor. When they are hated they can remember that the
   world hated their Lord also. (Joh 15:19)

   19. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own. It is the
   nature of all intelligent persons to love best what is in sympathy with
   themselves. Christ loves most tenderly the disciples who obey his
   commandments and seek to be like him. The world loves those best that
   are in harmony with its ambitions, aims and pleasures. Hence, when the
   church lowers itself to a worldly standard, is complaisant toward sin,
   and full of the worldly spirit, it will not come into collision with
   the world. It is the servants who are "chosen out of the world," who
   are not of the world and who testify against it, that it hates. This
   has been illustrated in all ages. John the Baptist and Christ might
   have chosen smooth paths that would have secured worldly favor, but
   their rebukes of sin brought them to death, and in every generation the
   faithful servants, such men as Huss, Waldo, Wickliffe, Savonarola,
   Luther, Roger Williams, and the great army of martyrs, have been hated
   and persecuted. See chapter 7:7 where Christ shows that the world
   cannot hate those who act in accordance with its worldly policy and
   principles, and also, 1 Peter 4:12, 13; 1 John 3:13, 14, and 4:4, 5.
   (Joh 15:20)

   20. Remember the word, . . . The servant is not greater than his lord.
   For this admonition to which the Lord refers see John 13:16; Matt.
   10:24; Luke 6:40. The servants who represent the Master, show his
   spirit, obey his commands and do his work, must expect similar
   treatment to that which the world would award to the Master himself.
   They represent a spirit and policy that comes into direct collision
   with the world. Those who would persecute the Lord will persecute the
   disciples also. Those who would receive the Lord's words will also
   receive and keep their words also. Some will persecute; others will
   accept the gospel. The disciple must expect both results, persecution
   and glad reception. This has been the experience of all devoted
   proclaimers of the gospel, from Paul down to our own day. See in Paul's
   experience, Acts 13:42-45. (Joh 15:21)

   21. All these things will they do unto you for my name's sake. The name
   of Christ, so sweet to his followers, is an object of hatred to his
   enemies. Not many months passed after these words were uttered until
   those that now heard Christ were under arrest by the Sanhedrim and were
   asked by the high priest, "By what power, or by what name, have ye done
   this?" Then Peter answered, "By the name of Jesus Christ, whom ye
   crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man
   stand before you whole." Then, after a conference, the Sanhedrim
   "commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus"
   (Acts, chapter IV). Again, Acts 5:28, "The high priest asked, Did we
   not straitly charge that you should not teach in this name?" And they
   departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were
   counted worthy to suffer shame for his name (verse 41). See also 1 Pet.
   4:14 and Rev. 3:8. What was true of the first age of persecution has
   been true of later ages. The Roman emperor, Diocletian, declared that
   he "would abolish the Christian name from the face of the earth." The
   infidel Convention of France, at the time of the Reign of Terror, tried
   to destroy all that would recall his name, and there is nothing that
   excites the animosity of the haters of Christ more intensely than his
   name. One ground of the intense hatred of the Jews to "the name" was
   that Jesus proclaimed himself to be the Christ predicted by the
   prophets, and the use of this "name" was a constant indictment of them
   for crucifying the "Holy One" of Israel. They had rejected him because
   they knew not God, God who had sent Jesus into the world, though they
   professed to honor him. (Joh 15:22)

   22. If I had not come and spoken . . . they would not have had sin.
   There are three principles involved in this declaration. 1. The degree
   of sin is determined by the measure of our opportunities. Those in
   total darkness cannot be blamed for not seeing unless they are
   responsible for being in the darkness. Those who have had no light from
   heaven will be lightly judged for breaking laws of which they could
   have no knowledge. 2. Increased opportunities bring the consciousness
   of sin. A ray of sunlight in the chamber reveals, but does not create,
   the motes. They were there before. So, too, the motions of sin in the
   soul are imperfectly recognized until the light comes, but in that
   light they are seen to be sin, and the conscience is alive to sin.
   "Without the law sin is dead. For I was alive without the law once: but
   when the commandment came, sin revived and I died." Rom. 7:8, 9. So the
   knowledge of Christ, flooding the soul with light, brings sin into full
   view and takes away all excuse for continuance therein. Henceforth it
   is known, conscious sin. 3. The sin of sins is the rejection of Christ.
   He is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. He has not
   only shed his blood to cleanse from all sin, but comes to men and
   pleads with them to let him be their Savior. He who refuses him
   chooses, deliberately chooses sin, as his portion. He declares by the
   rejection of Christ that he clings to his sins and will abide by their
   consequences. He not only willfully retains his past sins but he adds
   to them the fearful sin of rejecting heaven's offer of mercy as
   embodied in the gospel. By the rejection of Christ he shows himself a
   stubborn and determined rebel against the King of kings. Had heaven
   offered no mercy, showed no love, sent no Lamb of God to take away sin,
   there might have been less, or even no responsibility for sin, because
   many were so in darkness that they knew not sin, but now they have no
   cloke for their sin. There is no excuse for it, no shelter, no
   covering, nothing that can extenuate sin. Ignorance might be an excuse,
   but when the offer of pardon is made and refused ignorance cannot be
   pleaded. Christ's offer takes away every excuse and leaves the sinner
   at the judgment day to the sentence of condemnation. Men are lost
   because "they will not have life." Luther says: "No man shall die in
   his sins, except him who, through unbelief, thrusts from him the
   forgiveness of sin, which, in the name of Jesus Christ, is offered to
   him. This is the real sin that contains all others. For if the word of
   Christ was received every sin would be forgiven and remitted, but since
   men will not receive it this constitutes a sin which is not to be
   forgiven." (Joh 15:23)

   23. He that hateth me hateth my Father also. This follows from the fact
   that Christ is Immanuel, God with us, the manifestation of the Father.
   As Christ is revealed to us, so is the Father. Every one who hates God
   in Christ, hates the Father who sent him. The Jews thought they did
   not, but they did. They knew not God, but worshiped another god whom
   their own imaginations had created. Christ was the manifestation of the
   God of their Fathers, but when they saw him they hated him. (Joh 15:24)

   24. If I had not done . . . they had not had sin. The attestation of
   his divine mission was such that they were without excuse. His whole
   life work, including his sinlessness, his beneficence, his divine
   teaching and his superhuman signs, were such as no man had ever shown.
   They therefore demonstrated that he was more than man. Sometimes
   cavilers call for a scientific argument that Jesus is divine. The
   Savior here gives it. The syllogism is as follows: 1. No man that ever
   lived was sinless, was a teacher who never erred, or unlocked the
   portals of the dead, or made those whose souls were dead, live again as
   new creatures in a new and beautiful life. 2. Jesus of Nazareth did and
   does all these things. 3. Therefore, he is more than man and is divine.
   (Joh 15:25)

   25. They hated me without a cause. He had just stated that "they hated
   both him and his Father." This hatred was without any justifiable
   cause, and therefore fulfilled of Psalm 35:19. "These words (Christ's
   words from verse 21 to 26) are perhaps the most terrible words in the
   Old or New Testament. No description of divine punishment which is
   written anywhere can come into the least comparison with them in
   awfulness or horror. This gratuitous hatred, this hatred of Christ by
   men because they hate God, this hatred of God because he has manifested
   himself and proved himself to be love, is something which passes all
   our conception, and yet which would not mean anything to us if our
   conscience did not bear witness that the possibility of it lies in
   ourselves. Such a hatred is only possible to nations which, like the
   Jewish, is full of religious knowledge and of religious
   profession."--Maurice. (Joh 15:26)

   26. When the Comforter is come. For discussion of the Comforter, his
   nature and work, [11]see notes on the preceding chapter. In chapter
   14:26, he says that the Father will send the Comforter in his name,
   while here he says that he will send him from the Father. These
   passages are in harmony and merely show how intimate the union between
   the Father and the Son. What one does the other may be said to do, for
   the same mind is in each. Christ often emphasized the fact that what he
   did and said was done by the Father. In Acts 2:33, when this promise
   was first fulfilled, Peter declared that it was Christ "which hath shed
   forth this, which you now see and hear." Which proceedeth from the
   Father. Christ attributes all the blessed and redemptive powers to his
   Father as the final cause. As he came himself from the Father so the
   Holy Spirit is from the Father. He is called the Spirit of God, and
   also the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9; Gal. 4:6; Phil. 1:19; 1 Peter
   1:11.) He shall testify of me. One principal office of the Spirit is to
   testify of Christ. See chapter 16:13-15. Nor is it difficult to
   ascertain how the Spirit testifies. Holy men of God spoke as they were
   moved by the Holy Spirit. On the day of Pentecost the apostles "spake
   as the Spirit gave them utterance." Testimony is given in words, or by
   acts, and the Spirit speaks through the saints whom he chooses as his
   agents. Hebrews 10:15, 16, shows how the Spirit bears witness: "Whereof
   the Holy Spirit is a witness to us; for after that he said before, This
   is the covenant," etc. The words which the Holy Spirit "said before"
   and by which he became "a witness" were spoken by the prophet Jeremiah.
   There is not an example recorded in the Bible of the Spirit testifying
   otherwise than in words spoken by those moved by his power, and in the
   lives of those in whom he dwells. I emphasize this fact because there
   is much idle speculation and error on the subject. (Joh 15:27)

   27. Ye also shall bear witness. The apostles were double witnesses.
   They had been with Christ "from the beginning" and knew all the facts.
   If he had been a deceiver they would have known it. If he was true they
   knew it. When he was risen they were witnesses of the fact. If they had
   never received the Comforter they could have been witnesses of the
   facts of his life, death and resurrection. But when the Holy Spirit was
   given, the dark things made plain, the Scriptures understood, power
   from on high sent upon them, and when they could speak with tongues and
   work miracles, then also the Holy Spirit in them bore witness. There
   was their witness as men, eleven competent witnesses to every fact, and
   then in addition there was the divine witness through them. They still
   testify, and added to this, there are those in whom Christ dwells by
   his Spirit. Every true Christian life is a witness to the living power
   of Christ. It must be kept clearly in mind that there is not the
   slightest intimation in the Scriptures of a testimony independent of
   those who have received the Spirit through the acceptance of Christ.

     __________________________________________________________________

The Holy Spirit and the World.

   1. These things have I spoken unto you, that you should not be
   offended. "These things" may refer generally to all that the Lord has
   spoken in these discourses, as some have urged, but, in my judgment,
   refers more particularly to what he has stated in the last chapter
   about the hatred of the world, a subject that he now continues by
   pointing out how this hatred will manifest itself. The reader must keep
   in mind that there was no break in the Savior's discourse between the
   15th and 16th chapters and the same subject is continued without
   change. "These things" the Lord spoke that they should be forewarned,
   expectant, and hence should not be made to stumble (offended). The word
   "offended," or, more properly, "stumble," points out the danger of
   falling during persecution. The weak in faith are likely to give way
   before the storm, to fancy that the odds are too great, that it is
   useless for a small minority to contend against mankind. Hence the Lord
   reveals to his disciples that there is an irrepressible conflict
   between the sinful world and himself, points out the issues and shows
   how it will involve his followers, in order that they may expect it, be
   prepared for it, and when it comes only see in it the fulfillment of
   his prediction. (Joh 16:2)

   2. They shall put you out of the synagogues. The first persecutions
   shall come from the Jews, and hence the Lord speaks of these. The first
   punishment shall be excommunication. I have pointed out (chapter 9:22,
   [12]note) the nature of this punishment. It was more than spiritual. It
   made its subject outcasts. Hence Paul, in speaking of the sufferings of
   the saints, declares they are made outcasts. But this is not all, for
   the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think he doeth God
   service. No language could describe more forcibly the most intense
   fanaticism. Yet "the hour" was coming and close at hand when murder
   would be sanctified in the eyes of the murderer. Even Saul of Tarsus,
   as he afterwards confessed, thought he was doing God's service when he
   sought to kill the saints. In the Rabbinical books is found a proverb:
   "Whoever sheds the blood of the impious does the same as if he offered
   a sacrifice," and the Jews held that those who accepted Christianity
   were traitors to God. The same spirit has been often manifested in
   religious persecutions. The cruel crusades of the French kings against
   the Albigenses were conducted in the name of religion; the Pope of Rome
   celebrated a Te Deum when the news of the barbarous massacre of St.
   Bartholomew reached him, the "Holy Inquisition" tortured men, broke
   them upon the rack or wheel in the name of religion, or burned them in
   Auto de Fes, as "Acts of Faith." Madame Roland, about to die on the
   scaffold, exclaimed, "Oh, Liberty, what crimes are perpetrated in thy
   name!" So many a martyr might have exclaimed of Religion. (Joh 16:3)

   3. These things they will do . . . because they have not known the
   Father or me. This ignorance of God and Christ lies at the root of all
   spirit of persecution. Could the tender love of God as revealed in the
   Son, his long suffering and compassion, be known, it would end all
   intolerance. The hard-hearted, cruel and exacting, whatever they may
   pretend, do not believe in the true God and the Son. They may believe
   in some being whom they call God, but it is not the God who "so loved
   the world that he sent his only begotten Son to save the world." They
   may believe in a being they call Christ, but it is not the tender,
   loving and compassionate Savior who taught, "Blessed are the merciful,
   for they shall obtain mercy." All intolerance is born of spiritual
   pride, selfishness and self-worship. The Pharisees, the most bigoted
   and self-righteous sect of the Jewish nation, were the bitterest
   opposers of Christ. The Papal church, which has held that salvation was
   only found within its fold, has always been a persecuting body wherever
   it was in power. (Joh 16:4)

   4. These things have I told you . . . that ye may remember. When the
   hour of trial would come there would come also the remembrance that the
   Lord had foreseen it from the beginning, had promised to be with them,
   and even to give to them what they should say to their accusers. These
   things I said not in the beginning because I was with you. His
   instructions had been lesson by lesson as they were prepared to receive
   it. Only gradually had he unfolded to them the dark, rugged and bloody
   pathway that they should be called to tread. In the beginning of his
   ministry he did not teach of these things, in the second year of his
   ministry he began to present the lesson, but only in the hour of
   departure does he fully reveal the trials before his disciples. The
   greatest of all their trials, unless the promised Comforter came, would
   be the departure of the Lord. While he was upon the earth the bolts of
   hatred would strike him instead of his followers; but when he was gone
   and they represented him on the earth these bolts would strike them.
   (Joh 16:5) (Joh 16:6)

   5, 6. Now I go my way to him that sent me. To the Father, by way of the
   Cross, the Sepulcher, the Resurrection and the Ascension. None of you
   asketh me, Whither goest thou? They had asked this question, but in the
   stupefaction of their sorrow they had ceased to ask. Their thoughts
   were fixed more upon their own disappointment and bereavement than upon
   what was before their departing Lord. He desires to turn their thoughts
   to the grand results that are to be accomplished "because he goes to
   the Father." They had, however, failed to look into these matters
   because sorrow had filled their heart. (Joh 16:7)

   7. It is expedient for you that I go away. What seemed then a crushing
   sorrow was a real blessing. His mission could never be accomplished
   unless he went away. These same apostles who were now so overwhelmed
   with sorrow, forty days later, saw the Lord depart, and a cloud receive
   him from their sight, and yet "they returned to Jerusalem with great
   joy" (Luke 24:52). How often the "dark clouds break in blessings on our
   heads!" For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come. By the
   Comforter is meant the Holy Spirit, which was first shed forth on the
   day of Pentecost. The Greek word (Paraclete) is also rendered Advocate,
   or Helper. The Holy Spirit fills all these offices. This Spirit, given
   only to a few inspired men, under the Jewish dispensation, was now to
   become the heritage of the church that Christ would soon establish on
   the earth. While Christ was present in person, in bodily form, the Holy
   Spirit, the representative of the Godhead, could not come. Christ, as
   King, must send it, and on the day of Pentecost Peter declared, "He
   hath shed forth the things ye do see and hear." For a universal
   kingdom, in which the King should everywhere manifest his presence by
   abiding in his subjects, it was needful that be go away in person and
   send, instead of his personal presence, the "omnipresent Spirit."
   Hence, ten days after his ascension, the saints, "waiting for the
   promise of the Father, that they should be endued with power from on
   high," enjoyed the fulfillment in the outpouring of Pentecost. (Joh
   16:8)

   8. Will reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.
   The Revision more correctly renders, "Will convict the world of sin."
   There are three points concerning which the world would be convicted,
   concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment. The Holy Spirit would
   effect these important results through some means. If we would
   understand its methods we have only to turn over to the fulfillment of
   these predictions recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. In Acts 2:38,
   the Holy Spirit fell upon the eleven apostles and they spoke as "it
   gave them utterance." The words that they spoke were the words of the
   Holy Spirit. In the record of what it said by the mouth of Peter we
   find that it convicted (1) of sin, in that those who heard had rejected
   the Lord of life and glory; (2) of righteousness, in that it was
   demonstrated by the manifestations of that hour that God had exalted
   the Lord whom they had condemned to his own right hand, of which they
   had the proof in that "he had shed forth" what they saw and heard; (3)
   of judgment, in that they were assured of the "wrath to come" and
   warned to "save themselves from this untoward generation." Thus has the
   Holy Spirit, in every age, convicted; by the words of Holy Writ that it
   has spoken, or by the earnest stirring words of the saints, either
   spoken or written. It "convicts" by acting through those into whose
   hearts it is sent, "because they are the sons of God." (Joh 16:9)

   9. Of sin, because they believe not on me. In naming sin, the chief of
   all sins is singled out. All sin springs from unbelief. There was a
   lurking unbelief in the heart of Judas when he sold his Master; in
   Peter's when he denied him; in that of Ananias when he lied to the Holy
   Spirit. It was unbelief that rejected Christ and nailed him to the
   cross; unbelief that rejects him still; unbelief that fills the land
   with vice. To destroy sin, the heart of man must be pierced with the
   sword of the Spirit. Hence the aim of the Spirit on Pentecost, and
   always, is to destroy unbelief. When the three thousand, convicted
   before their consciences of unbelief, cried, "Men and brethren, what
   shall we do?" then the answer of the Holy Spirit was ready, "Repent and
   be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
   remission of sins." (Joh 16:10)

   10. Of righteousness, because I go to my Father. Human tribunals
   convicted him of blasphemy because he said he was the Son of God, and
   put him to death. God exalted him to a throne, thereby showing that the
   condemnation was wrong and that he was righteous. Of this the Holy
   Spirit bore witness in words and by miracles. Hence, when they "saw him
   no more," the Holy Spirit "convicted of righteousness." Now, all the
   world, Saint and sinner, believer and infidel, admit that he was the
   sinless One. (Joh 16:11)

   11. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. In chapter
   14:30, he declared, "the prince of this world cometh." It was the
   prince of this world, the spirit of the world, Satan as the ruler of
   the world, who slew him. When he rose from the dead and all power was
   given into his hands, this was a judgment in the court of the universe
   against the prince of the world, a decree that he should be shorn of
   his power, and that all the kingdoms of the earth should become the
   kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ. (Joh 16:12)

   12. I have yet many things to say . . but ye cannot bear them now. All
   wise teachers give out truth as the minds of people are prepared for
   it. Jesus did not at once announce himself as the Christ, nor that he
   would be crucified. He added new lessons as the minds were prepared.
   Even yet there were lessons, after three and a half years teaching,
   that his apostles could not bear. (Joh 16:13)

   13. When the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.
   He is about to go away and his own personal teachings will be ended,
   but those things that he desires them to know will be taught them
   still. The Spirit of truth will guide them into all truth; the Holy
   Spirit will not be sent to testify of himself, but to represent Christ,
   as he represented the Father, and to continue his work. He will speak,
   not only what he has heard about Christ and his work, but of things to
   come. In the Acts, Epistles and Revelation we have recorded those
   things which the Spirit of truth taught the apostles, and to which
   Christ referred. Through John, especially, he showed "things to come"
   in Revelation. (Joh 16:14) (Joh 16:15)

   14, 15. He shall glorify me. "All things that the Father hath are
   mine," and the Spirit "shall receive of mine and shew it to you."
   "These three are one;" a striking illustration of the unity of the
   Godhead. They are so united that what proceeds from one proceeds from
   all. (Joh 16:16) (Joh 16:17)

   16, 17. A little while, and ye shall not see me: again, a little while,
   and ye shall see me. On the morrow he would die at the ninth hour; that
   evening he would be buried, and for "a little while," three days and
   nights, they would not see him; then he would rise, and for another
   "little while," a space of forty days before "he went to his Father,"
   they would see him, while he remained on the earth. When he ascended to
   his Father they, in a spiritual sense, would "see him coming in the
   kingdom of God." This is all very plain to us, but the apostles, to
   whom it was yet future, could not understand it. (Joh 16:18) (Joh
   16:19)

   18, 19. What is this that he saith? They were so awed and amazed by the
   mysteries that were gathering around them that they hesitated to ask,
   but the Lord, observing their whispered words, took up their question.
   (Joh 16:20)

   20. Ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice. This was, in
   a few hours, fulfilled. How sad were the broken-hearted disciples, as
   they wept at the tomb! "We trusted that he would restore the kingdom to
   Israel," is the wail of buried hopes. At the same time their enemies
   were gloating over their triumph. Soon all was changed, for your
   sorrow, shall be turned into joy. The glad news came, "The Lord is
   risen." Then they heard that "all power was his," then they saw him
   ascend into heaven, then they "returned to Jerusalem in great joy."
   Their sorrow was turned into joy. (Joh 16:21)

   21. A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, . . . for joy that a
   man is born. The figure of a woman in travail is one of frequent
   occurrence in the Old Testament to illustrate sudden sorrow and great
   anguish (Isa. 21:3; Hosea 13:13; Micah 4:9). The Lord gives the figure
   a new application by showing that joy is born out of the pangs of
   travail. Thus the bitter anguish that his disciples will experience on
   account of the crucifixion and burial of their Lord will be followed by
   the greatest joy when they behold him risen and triumphant. While this
   is the apparent, many interpreters, notably Olshausen, hold that it has
   a deeper meaning. According to this view there is a reference to that
   which caused the sorrow of the disciples, the sufferings of Christ, a
   painful act of travail on the part of humanity as represented in the
   second Adam, as the result of which the new man in Christ Jesus is born
   into the world, a source of eternal joy to all, even to the angels who
   rejoice more over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine
   just persons who need no repentance. "Thus the death of Christ becomes
   a fact in the history of the world, which everything before it was
   intended to usher in, and from which the entire development of
   succeeding ages is matured. This state of perfect joy and complete
   satisfaction is indicated by the words, 'Ye shall ask me
   nothing."--Olshausen. "The death of Christ is the agonizing travail of
   humanity, from which labor the God-Man issues, glorified, to the
   eternal joy of the whole body of mankind."--Lange. "The words are
   applicable also to the travails of the church in bringing forth
   children to God. Yet we should not overlook the immediate reference. A
   touching and comforting proof of the Savior's tender sympathy with
   woman's deepest trial."--Schaff. (Joh 16:22)

   22. Ye now therefore have sorrow. It was because the hour had come. The
   "therefore" shows that there was something in their position analogous
   to that of a suffering mother, something more than the mere change from
   sorrow to joy. The figure is that of suffering endured and comforted by
   the thought that it is the needful pathway to joy. The time of that
   transition state, of travail with their Master, was now come. This,
   therefore, was the hour of sorrow, but when new life for humanity was
   born into the world as Christ burst the bonds of death, then rejoicing
   would come. I will see you again. The Lord refers here to his own
   appearance to them after his sufferings, which would turn their sorrow
   into joy. That joy would be stable, permanent. Their enemies might
   assail them, but "no man could take it" away. This began to be realized
   as soon as they knew their Lord was not holden of the pangs of death,
   but was fully consummated only when they were "endued with power from
   on high" on the day of Pentecost. (Joh 16:23)

   23. In that day ye shall ask me nothing. When the new revelation is
   fully realized and they enjoy the fulness of the Lord's glorified
   presence. "That day" refers directly to Pentecost when the new era of
   joy began. "Ye shall ask me nothing" does not refer to prayer, for the
   apostles always continued to pray, but means they shall ask him no
   questions because of their ignorance and misunderstanding. While
   attending his earthly instruction they were dull of comprehension and
   often ask questions because they did not understand him, but when the
   Comforter was come he would teach the apostles all things (14:26).
   Enigmas would be solved, mysteries would be clear. Or the passage may
   mean that they shall not ask directly of Jesus, as while he was on
   earth, but of the Father in his name. Either interpretation is in
   harmony with the context and the teachings of our Lord. All prayer now
   is to be offered in the name of Christ, and the answer is given in his
   name. I believe that both meanings are involved. In verse 17, the
   disciples ask a question in bewilderment, and the Savior in his reply
   declares that in "that day" you will have no need to ask for
   explanations, and then he adds, that dispensation will be one of great
   power in prayer; "whatsoever you ask in my name of the Father, he will
   give it you." (Joh 16:24)

   24. Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name. When he taught his
   disciples what we are wont to style the Lord's Prayer, he did not
   direct that the petition should be in his name, for his relation to the
   Father was not yet unfolded. It was only as the end of his earthly
   sojourn approached that he directed prayer in his name. When he
   ascended on high he became our Divine Mediator, "our Advocate with the
   Father," our "High Priest who maketh intercession for us." His is not
   only the "only name whereby we must be saved," but through which we
   have access to the Father. Hence, if our petitions would carry any
   recommendation they must ascend in the name of the Son. Indeed
   "whatever we do, all must be done in the name of the Lord Jesus." See
   also Eph. 1:21 and Phil. 2:9, 10. God has determined that his name
   shall be exalted above every name. (Joh 16:25)

   25. These things have I spoken to you in proverbs. All that he said
   from the beginning of chapter XV. The term translated "proverbs" would
   be more correctly rendered "figures." The revelations had been partly
   veiled in figures, such as that of the True Vine, and the Woman in
   travail. A deeper meaning lay beneath his words than they could yet
   understand. All that he had spoken since the discourse began was in
   part enigmatical to his disciples, but the time would come when there
   would be no more enigmas, no more half understood sayings, but when he
   would "shew them plainly of the Father." The reference is still to that
   Spirit which he would send who would guide them into all truth. There
   is a kind of summary in what follows to the end of the chapter of all
   he has before promised. (Joh 16:26)

   26. At that day, the day when they were baptized with the Holy Spirit,
   Pentecost, and from that time on, ye shall ask in my name. This fulness
   of knowledge is connected with fulness of prayer. For days before the
   descent of the Holy Spirit "the apostles, disciples and brethren of the
   Lord, continued with one accord in prayer, with the women." The
   apostolic church founded on Pentecost "continued steadfastly in the
   apostles' teaching, and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread and
   prayers." Those filled with the Holy Spirit engage in bolder petitions
   in Christ's name. I say not . . that I will pray the Father for you.
   Their relation to the Father, who "has sent his Spirit into their
   hearts because they are sons," making them temples of God in which the
   Father dwells, as well as the Son, is so intimate that they may
   approach him themselves, and he does not need to say that he will pray
   the Father for them. (Joh 16:27)

   27. For the Father himself loveth you. This declares the reason why it
   is not needful for him to pray the Father for them, and should be read
   in immediate connection with the preceding verse. It must be borne in
   mind that Christ does not say that he will not pray the Father, but
   teaches that no intercession is needed to win the love of the Father.
   Christ elsewhere teaches that he is our Intercessor. Because ye have
   loved me and have believed, etc. This is the reason why the Father
   loves us. It is true that he loved the world even while in sin so well
   as to send his Son to save, but the fulness and sweetness of his love
   cannot be bestowed upon those who reject his love as manifested in his
   Son. Those can only enjoy its full fruition who by faith in, and love
   of, Christ enter into the adoption of the children of God. The love of
   the father to the prodigal in a far-off country, wasting his substance
   in riotous living, is very different from the love of the Father to the
   penitent, broken-hearted sinner who returns to confess his sins and ask
   forgiveness. (Joh 16:28)

   28. I came from the Father, . . . into the world; . . go to the Father.
   Meyer says that this verse contains "a simple and grand summary of
   Christ's entire life, his incarnation, and his destiny." The disciples
   now fully believed that he came from the Father. In order to awaken
   their hopes he declares that he returns to his abode on high from
   whence he came. His near departure is only a return home. (Joh 16:29)

   29. His disciples . . . now speakest thou plainly. The last words
   uttered seemed to the disciples plain and simple. They thought that
   they gave the key to all the "proverbs" before spoken. He had come from
   God, into the world, now he would leave the world, and return to God.
   That seemed plain. Yet the disciples did not understand so well as they
   supposed. Their stumbling while the Lord was in the hands of his
   enemies, and their fear, and their despair while he lay in the tomb,
   shows that they did not understand. Augustine says: "They so little
   understood that they did not even understand that they did not
   understand. For they were babes." (Joh 16:30)

   30. Now are we sure that thou knowest all things. A little before he
   had read their thoughts and interpreted them (verse 18). The fact that
   he had discerned them and answered their questionings so plainly as in
   verse 28, confirmed their faith and they declare, "by this we believe
   that thou comest forth from God." (Joh 16:31) (Joh 16:32)

   31, 32. Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come. The answer of the
   Lord shows that he recognized the incompleteness of the faith of his
   disciples. The words, "Do ye now believe?" question the power of the
   faith they had just affirmed. In the very hour that was now at hand it
   would be tried. Instead of clinging to him they would be scattered,
   every one would look out for himself, and would leave him alone in the
   hands of his enemies. For the fulfillment, read all the accounts of the
   arrest, trial and crucifixion of the Savior. Yet I am not alone. Though
   men might desert him he would not be left alone, for be would have the
   Father's help. (Joh 16:33)

   33. These things have I spoken. All the preceding discourse, especially
   from the beginning of chapter XIV., was spoken to the end that they
   might have peace. "In this world ye have tribulation: but be of good
   cheer." Though the world may afflict them it will only be for a season,
   for the world in a conquered foe. Christ has overcome it. When he died
   in the conflict with the world on the cross he sapped the very
   foundations of its empire. Hence his disciples may carry on the warfare
   with hearts full of cheer and by faith they shall overcome the world.
   As Christ overcame the world by dying, so, too, the faith of the
   martyrs is often the faith that gains the victory.

Practical Observations.

   1. Often our sorrows are big with blessings. They that sow in tears,
   reap in joy. The sorrow of the heart-broken disciples was soon turned
   into joy.

   2. Often we do not know what is best. The disciples thought it a great
   misfortune for Christ to die. But it behooved him to die and to rise
   again from the dead. His rising was the burst of sunrise on a world
   dark with the shadow of death.

   3. It would be a delightful thought that by going to Palestine we could
   look upon the face of Christ. It is a far sweeter thought that he is
   with us, wherever we are; "abides" with us. It was needful that he go
   away that all in every land might have his presence by the Spirit.

   4. The Spirit is not only a Comforter, but a Conqueror. The Sword, by
   which he subdues, convicts and conquers to Christ, is "the Word of
   God." Every preacher, teacher and Christian should pray for the
   presence of the Spirit and that he may speak through him with power, as
   he tries to impart the word to sinners. Paul may plant, Apollos water,
   but God gives the increase. The words of the preacher need to be "in
   the Spirit" to have power.

   5. "Resist not the Spirit." He who does, fights against God. The Spirit
   is resisted when idle and rebellious ears are turned to the words of
   the Spirit. When the preacher pleads with you to accept the Redeemer,
   it is the Spirit's voice, for he impelled him to speak. The Holy Spirit
   still by the word and testimony "convicts of sin, and righteousness,
   and judgment."

   6. As the body without the spirit is dead, so a church, or a professor
   of religion, without the Spirit is dead. The prayer should ascend, all
   over the land, from the inert, lifeless churches and Christians, that
   they may be endued with power from on high. Then, and then only, can
   they have power to convert men to Christ.

   7. Death is often the travail from whence victory is born. Arnold
   Winkelreid swept ten spears within grasp at the battle of Sempach and
   as he died made a breach by which victory was won. Christ on the cross
   received into his bosom the weapons of the world's hate and won a
   victory for us. The victory is won. The blows of death and hell fall
   upon him in vain. In spite of all he overcame death in the grave and
   rose triumphant. He fought the battle for all in him, and for all such
   the victory is won. "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second
   death."

The Holy Spirit.

   In the three preceding chapters Christ presents the fullest delineation
   of the work of the Holy Spirit, or Comforter, that is found in the
   Bible. It will be profitable to recapitulate and systematize the
   teaching he presents upon this important and imperfectly understood
   subject. And, first, I wish to present the fact that while the Fourth
   Gospel has much more to say of the Holy Spirit than the three
   preceding, they are by no means silent upon the subject. Not to enter
   into a summary of passages that speak of his work I note these items:
   That Luke declares that the miraculous conception was due to the Holy
   Spirit; the other Gospels declare that Christ shall baptize in the Holy
   Spirit; they point out sin against the Holy Spirit as the sin that hath
   no forgiveness; they allude to the promise of the Holy Spirit, which
   was fulfilled at Pentecost, give the great Commission which commanded
   to "baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Spirit," and leave the disciples waiting in Jerusalem "until they are
   endued with power from on high." In addition we have the significant
   and wonderful circumstance of the Holy Spirit descending upon the
   Savior at his baptism, and also the fact that he commands his disciples
   to pray for the Holy Spirit as God's good gift to his children.

   Nor is the doctrine of the Holy Spirit peculiar to the New Testament.
   Though more prominent as the period for the dispensation of the Holy
   Spirit, dating from Pentecost, approached, it is as old as the
   revelation of God; nay, as old as Creation. When first the darkness
   begins to lift from the chaos in which the original created matter
   first appears, "the Spirit of God is moving upon the face of the
   waters," and just before the Deluge God declares, "My Spirit shall not
   always strive with man." Frequent mention is made by the Old Testament
   writers of the "Spirit of God," "the Spirit of Jehovah," and the
   doctrine is fundamental in the Jewish Scriptures that "Holy men spake
   as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."

   It is, however, in the Gospel of John that the work of the Spirit is
   first fully outlined, while in Acts and the Epistles we see the
   influence and work of the Spirit as he dwells in the church and through
   it displays his power, and testifies to the world. Those who have
   followed the teachings of the Savior in these chapters have found, 1.
   That while the Holy Spirit might have seized upon and influenced
   certain ones chosen to present God's will in past times, he had never
   been imparted to the people of God in general before the Savior's
   ascension, as the heritage of all the children of God. Not even the
   Apostles enjoyed his influence, nor could they while Christ remained
   upon the earth. 2. It was needful that he go away in order that this
   permanent and universal manifestation of God should come. He would be
   "sent from the Father;" the Savior would "shed him forth;" he should be
   the possession of every heart prepared by faith, love and obedience; he
   should be an indwelling of the Father and the Son in the soul; his work
   in the heart of the believer would be to cheer, console, strengthen, to
   aid in bearing witness for Christ, and in bearing the fruits which
   glorify him, and prove that his followers enjoy his presence, while to
   the Apostles themselves, as witnesses of the resurrection of Christ, he
   should have an extraordinary operation, "teaching all things," "guiding
   them into all truth," and "bearing witness through them," "with signs
   and wonders" to Christ. 3. The time when this beneficent manifestation
   should begin is named as "that day," and the time is pointed out so
   unmistakably that it can never be overlooked. On the day of Pentecost
   the saints "received the promise of the Father," "were endued with
   power from on high," "baptized in the Holy Spirit," and from that epoch
   the dispensation of the Spirit began; from that time is dated the
   promise made to all who repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus
   Christ, "Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

   "God who spoke at sundry times and in divers manners unto the fathers
   by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken by his Son." It was
   needful, however, that the Son should cease to speak in person, and go
   away in order that the Comforter might come. As Christ is a
   manifestation of the Father, so the Holy Spirit is the presence in the
   heart of the believer, the temple of God, of the Father and the Son
   (14:23). Nor will he dwell in any temple until it is prepared for his
   presence by love of Christ and an entire surrender to his will. The
   enjoyment of the Spirit is confined to the disciples of the Lord. "The
   world cannot receive or know him." He has no home in unconverted
   hearts, and yet he has an important office to effect upon the world
   itself. That office is fully pointed out in chapter XVI., 7-15. His
   work towards the world divides itself into two parts; he shall convict
   it of sin, establish the righteousness of Christ, and arraign it for
   judgment; he shall also testify of Christ. In the light thrown upon
   this passage by the rest of the Scriptures it is of easy
   interpretation. The Spirit does not act upon the world as a mysterious,
   abstract influence, but through the saints in whom he dwells and by
   whom he exerts his power. "That day" of the descent of the Holy Spirit
   illustrates his mode of acting upon the world. The saints on the day of
   Pentecost were "filled with the Holy Spirit," and then the Apostles
   "began to speak as the Spirit gave them utterance." As the result of
   the testimony of the Holy Spirit spoken by men in words that he
   dictated, three thousand men of the world were "convicted of sin.,
   "were convinced of the "righteousness" of Christ, and of the danger of
   "judgment," and hence sought to "save themselves from that untoward
   generation." Thus, by the words spoken by the Holy Spirit and recorded,
   by the word of preaching and exhortation that saints are moved to
   speak, by the pure lives and kind words and deeds of those to whom the
   Spirit is a helper, he convicts the world, and testifies to it of
   Christ. It should never be lost sight of that the Holy Spirit testifies
   by words that are spoken and thus became a joint witness with the
   Apostles to the exaltation of Christ. See Acts 5:32, Heb. 10:15, 16,
   and Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; Rev. 3:6, 13, 22. He still bears witness in
   the word of God that has come down to us in the Holy Scriptures, and
   those who resist this word "resist the Spirit." While he aids in the
   conquest of the world for Christ, the weapon that he uses, "the sword
   of the Spirit, is the WORD or GOD."

   It only remains to ask what are the proofs of the Spirit's presence?
   Not loud claims, nor fleshly feelings. "Spiritual things are
   spiritually discerned." The tree is known by its fruits. Whoever enjoys
   the indwelling of the Spirit will exhibit its fruits (Gal. 5:22) and
   will mind the things which the Spirit has commanded (Rom. 8:5). The
   test that Paul enjoins in 1 Cor. 14:37, is the one by which the claims
   of every man who asserts that he is "spiritual," or enjoys the presence
   of the Spirit, must be tried: "Let him acknowledge that the things I
   write unto you are the commandments of God." The person who ignores
   God's ordinances, sets them aside, and does not "mind the things of the
   Spirit," or bear its fruits, deceives himself if he thinks he has the
   presence of the Comforter.

The Lord's Prayer.

   This prayer, so solemn and so tender, would never have been recorded
   had it not been intended for our study and profit, but I approach it
   with a feeling that it is almost too sacred for the usual verbal and
   textual criticism. It is the overflow of the full soul of the Lord in
   devotion to the Father, a fitting close to the wonderful discourses
   beginning in chapter 13; offered, standing, in the Upper Room, just
   before the Lord led his disciples out into the moonlit night, on the
   way to Gethsemane. This is the real Lord's Prayer of the sacred word;
   the prayer of Matt. 6:9-13, is the disciples' prayer, taught to them by
   the Lord. In order to drink in its spirit, the student must realize
   that the Lord stands at the foot of the cross, is about to suffer, and
   before the separation from his disciples and the agony and shame of the
   cross, he goes to the Father in their behalf and in his own.

   Dr. Wm. Milligan, of Aberdeen, outlines this remarkable prayer as
   follows: "The chapter on which we now enter contains what is generally
   known as our Lord's High-priestly Prayer. Such a name is appropriately
   given it; partly, because it is the longest and most solemn utterance
   recorded of the intercessions with which Jesus approached the throne of
   his heavenly Father on his people's behalf; partly, because he was at
   this moment standing on the threshold of his especial work as their
   great High Priest. No attempt to describe the prayer can give a just
   idea of its sublimity, its pathos, its touching yet exalted character,
   its tone at once of tenderness and triumphant expectation. We are apt
   to read it as if it were full of sorrow; but that is only our own
   feeling reflected back upon what we suppose to have been the feelings
   of the Man of Sorrows. In the prayer itself sorrow has no place; and to
   think that it was uttered in a tone of sadness is to entirely mistake
   what must have been the spirit of Jesus at the time. It speaks
   throughout of work accomplished, of victory gained, of the immediate
   expectation of glorious reward. It tells, not of sorrow, but of 'joy,'
   joy now possessing his own soul, and about to be 'fulfilled' in his
   disciples (verse 13). It anticipates with perfect confidence the
   realization of the grand object of his coming,--the salvation of all
   that have been given him (verse 12), their union to himself and the
   Father (verse 21), their security amid the evils of this world while
   they execute in it a mission similar to his (verses 11, 15, 18,) and,
   finally, their glorification with his own glory (verse 24). . . . The
   prayer naturally divides itself into three parts; in the first of which
   Jesus prays for himself, in the second for his immediate disciples, and
   in the third for all who, in every age, shall believe in him. But the
   three parts are pervaded by one thought--the glorification of the
   Father in those successively prayed for, the accomplishment in each of
   the Father's purpose, and the union of a in the perfect, the spiritual,
   the eternal bond of love."

   "Here is holy ground; here is the gate of heaven. No such prayer was
   ever heard before or since. It could only be uttered by the Lord and
   Savior of men, the mighty Intercessor and Mediator, standing between
   heaven and earth before his wondering disciples. Even be could pray it
   only once, in the most momentous crisis of history, in full view of the
   approaching sacrifice for the sins of the world, which occurred only
   once, though its effect vibrates through the ages. It is not so much
   the petition of an inferior suppliant, as the dialogue of an equal, and
   a solemn declaration of his will and mission. He intercedes with the
   eternal Jehovah as the partner of his counsel, as the executor of his
   will of saving mercy. He looks back on his pre-mundane glory with God,
   and forward to the resumption of that glory, and comprehends all his
   present and future disciples in unbroken succession as a holy and
   blessed brotherhood in vital union with himself and his
   Father."--Schaff. (Joh 17:1)

   1. Father, the hour is come. After the discourses were ended, he
   "lifted up his eyes," the very attitude being stamped on the memory of
   John, and began his prayer. "The hour" of the great sacrifice, of the
   tragedy of the cross, the hour for which Christ came into the world had
   now come; in this hour he needs the Father's presence. Glorify thy Son.
   He was about to stoop to shame. It was an unutterable humiliation for
   the Son to die as a malefactor. He prays that God may lift him from
   this humiliation to his former glory, that he may glorify the Father.
   Had he been left in the tomb, the shame would have been complete.
   Christ not only prays that he shall be "lifted up," but that he may so
   "drink the cup" that the cross itself shall be a glory. The
   glorification of the Son in his resurrection and exaltation
   demonstrates the glory of his self-sacrifice and humiliation. (Joh
   17:2)

   2. As thou hast given him power over all flesh. This shows how the Son
   is to be glorified. It is by "giving him all power in heaven and
   earth," and "committing all things" to him, raising him from the dead
   so that "he should give eternal life." (Joh 17:3)

   3. This is life eternal, that they might know thee, etc. The knowledge
   of God as manifested in Jesus Christ is the first requisite to
   salvation and life eternal. When there is full knowledge, a recognition
   by the heart as well as the intellect, of God in Christ, then comes
   submission and eternal life. Man cannot know Christ by the intellect
   alone. That knowledge requires faith and love. Not God alone must be
   known, but Christ also, for he "is the way, the truth, and the life."
   (Joh 17:4)

   4. I have glorified thee on the earth. He had done this because he
   could say, "I have finished the work that thou gavest me to do." In a
   few hours he would cry from the cross, "It is finished." (Joh 17:5)

   5. And now, O Father, glorify me, etc. In this prayer the word Father
   occurs six times. Jesus never says, "Our Father," as he teaches us to
   pray, nor "My Father," which would separate him from us, but "Father."
   He repeats the requests to be glorified and explains what he means. He
   asks a restoration of his former glory, that he had before he took on
   himself human form. (Joh 17:6)

   6. I have manifested thy name to the men which thou gavest me, etc. In
   the first five verses he had prayed for himself. Now he prays for his
   disciples. The apostles are especially meant. To them he had
   "manifested the name by revealing the Father in himself and showing
   God's matchless love. (Joh 17:7)

   7. That all things . . . given me are of thee. The Lord had taught with
   great emphasis that he and the Father were one, and that his words and
   works were of the Father. This the apostles were now learning. As all
   was of God it would stand firm and eternal, in spite of the cross. (Joh
   17:8)

   8. They have believed that thou didst send me. The life, teaching and
   miracles of Jesus had wrought profound faith in his disciples, but they
   were startled and staggered when he told them he was about to die.
   Hence, we have these long and tender discourses for their preparation.
   They have the desired effect, for in chapter 16:29, 30, they repeat
   their declaration of love, saying: "We believe thou comest from God."
   (Joh 17:9)

   9. I pray for them. The apostles. The prayer from verse 9 to verse 19
   is for these. I pray not for the world. Not at this time; he came into
   the world to save it, and we are not to conclude that he would never
   pray for its conversion and welfare. Now, however, his petition is
   confined to the apostles, the little band who are hanging upon his
   words. He even bids us to pray for our enemies (Matt. 5:44), yet some
   rigid Calvinists have insisted that Christ would only pray for his
   chosen ones. Paul bids us pray for all men. (Joh 17:10)

   10. I am glorified in them. Christ's glory here upon the earth is
   manifested by his disciples. These are all God's, for "all mine are
   thine, and thine are mine." There are no separate interests. He
   therefore pleads for his disciples; 1. Because they are the Father's;
   2. To them is entrusted the work of manifesting the glory of the Son's
   redeeming love. They are to proclaim the gospel to the world. (Joh
   17:11)

   11. I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. He now goes
   to the Father; these are left behind to preach the gospel, establish
   his kingdom, manifest his glory. Hence, he pleads that he may "keep
   them through his name," or power and love. He especially pleads that
   they may be kept "one," united as the Father and the Son. They had
   often shown jealousies and ambitions, but in order to do Christ's work
   they must be united as a band of loving brothers, of one family, with
   one interest and one work. (Joh 17:12)

   12. None of them is lost but the son of perdition. God had given him
   twelve; he had kept them in the name of the Father, and only one was
   lost, Judas, the traitor, the son of perdition, which the Scripture had
   predicted. See Ps. 41:9. So, even one of those that God had given him
   could be lost. (Joh 17:13)

   13. I speak these things in the world. I am now coming to thee, and
   about to leave the world, but before I leave it, I speak these things
   in order that my joy, the joy I feel over my completed work and return
   to my Father, might be fulfilled in them, by their being partakers of
   my joy. (Joh 17:14)

   14. I have given them thy word. I have entrusted to them the word of
   the Lord, to preach it, the gospel, to men. (Joh 17:15) (Joh 17:16)

   15, 16. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world. The
   world had hated the Master and was about to slay him, because he was
   not of the world. So it would hate the apostles, who were not of the
   world, and seek to slay them; he does not pray that they should be
   taken out of, the world, for they have a work to do, but that the
   Father would keep them from the power of the evil one. See Revision.
   Like him, they are to be "separate from sinners, and undefiled," but to
   remain that they may carry on the saving work. (Joh 17:17) (Joh 17:18)

   17, 18. Sanctify them by thy truth: thy word is truth. To sanctify is
   to render holy, or to consecrate. Those sanctified are saints. The
   means of canonization is not a Pope, but the truth, and lest some
   should mistake, Christ adds, "Thy word is truth." He prays for their
   consecration by the power of the word in their hearts. Every disciple
   should be thus consecrated, but the means is not "the second blessing,"
   a miraculous work of grace, but the reception of God's word into our
   hearts and the complete surrender to his will spoken in his word. The
   apostles needed that consecration for the work named in verse 18. They
   were to be sent into the world to work and suffer, as the Father has
   sent the Son. (Joh 17:19)

   19. For their sakes I sanctify myself. He did this when he came into
   the world, when he made it his meat to do the Father's will, and when
   he gave himself to death. We sanctify ourselves when we "present our
   bodies as living sacrifices." (Joh 17:20)

   20. Neither pray I for these alone. We enter upon the third section of
   the prayer, that for all disciples in every age, a prayer for us, for
   all who should believe on the Lord through the preaching of the gospel
   by the apostles. Every one who loves the Redeemer should reverently
   seek what the Lord prays for in his behalf. (Joh 17:21)

   21. That they all may be one; . . . that they my be one in us. This is
   a prayer for the closest union among the saints. As the Father and Son
   are one they are to be one. The Lord all through this discourse has
   shown the intimate union between the Father and himself. The Father is
   in him and he in the Father, all that is the Father's is his, and his
   is the Father's. They have no separate will, kingdom, or interests.
   Such a union is demanded among the disciples of Christ. It is
   impossible while they are divided into various denominations with
   separate work, property and interests, separate churches, colleges,
   papers and missions. Denominationalism is utterly opposed to this
   prayer, and every apologist for it is disloyal to the spirit of the
   prayer. Nor is it fulfilled in any church where there are factions,
   where "all are not perfectly joined together, of the same mind and the
   same judgment." If Christ abides in the heart, the one life will draw
   all who have Christ formed within them, into one family. This unity is
   needful and the Lord prays for it, That the world may believe that thou
   hast sent me. There is no other source of skepticism so fruitful as
   church quarrels and sectarian divisions. The consecration and unity of
   Christendom would speedily convert the world. The most potent argument
   of the infidel against the Kingship of Christ is that he has not power
   to unite his followers. (Joh 17:22) (Joh 17:23)

   22, 23. The glory . . thou gavest me I have given them. God gave Christ
   the glory of Sonship and this resulted in their unity. So Christ gives
   to his disciples the glory of becoming the sons of God (John 1:12; 1
   John 3:1). This glory, the adoption and gift of the Spirit, ought to
   effect that they be one as we are one, with Christ in them, and God in
   Christ. With Christ in us and God in Christ, we ought to be "perfectly
   joined together," and be so "perfect in one" that the world would see
   in our peace, love and unity, that God had sent Christ and that he was
   reigning in our hearts. (Joh 17:24)

   24. I will that they . . . be with me where I am. That in due time all
   my disciples shall follow me to heaven, where they shall see the glory
   of Christ. (Joh 17:25)

   25. I have known thee. The world knew not God, and Christ came to
   reveal him. He had revealed him to his disciples and they would reveal
   him to the world. (Joh 17:26)

   26. I have declared unto them thy name. The character and love of God
   and the blessings of his service.

Practical Observations.

   1. Our Lord prayed for himself, not for temporal benefits, but for
   eternal glory. So, too, we may pray, but not that we may have to spend
   upon our lusts. We may pray for consecration.

   2. We should especially pray for what the Lord prayed, that we may be
   one as he and the Father are one. Every saint ought to speak, labor and
   pray for the unity of Christendom.

   3. We cannot pray the prayer of Jesus and labor to build up
   sectarianism. In the spirit of love we should oppose it, and labor to
   destroy sectarian names, creeds, organizations and interests. As the
   Son and the Father are one, have one work, one kingdom, one spirit, one
   interest, so must all that are Christ's. We must "keep the unity of the
   Spirit in the bond of peace." There is "one body" and "one Spirit," as
   there is "one Lord."

   4. Division is the shame of Protestants. The Catholics point to it and
   exclaim, "Is Christ divided?" Infidels point to it and say, "This is
   Babylon, confusion. All is uncertainty. These people cannot see alike
   or agree." As long as this division prevails the world will be
   unconverted.

   5. It is one thing to preach union, and another to have the spirit of
   union. None have it unless the love of Christ abides in the heart. A
   church, rent with antagonism, defeats the Savior's prayer. The man who
   preaches union with a narrow, exclusive, sectarian spirit in his heart,
   defeats Christ's will. He who preaches union must be so filled with
   Christ's love that he will extend his hand to all who love the Master.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Lord's Prayer for Unity.

   The most remarkable feature of this wonderful portion of the word of
   God is the Lord's prayer for those who would believe upon him in the
   coming ages. It seems as if the very climax of earnestness is reached
   when he travails in soul for the saints who in after times, should be
   gathered to him from out of the world by the preaching of the gospel.
   Such a prayer uttered with such heartfelt fervency, right at the foot
   of the cross, should have a pre-eminent sacredness for every believer
   in every age; in other words, for every subject of the prayer, and no
   one upon whose heart rests the petition that came from the Savior's
   heart can refuse to do all in his power to secure the results for which
   the Master prayed. Indeed, one who could harbor a thought in opposition
   to that for which the Lord travails in soul, certainly has some other
   spirit rather than that of Christ.

   There is just one thought in this petition and that one thought is the
   unity of his people. Am analysis of the petition in their behalf will
   show how this burden rested upon his soul. He prays (1) "That they all
   may be one;" (2) "As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they
   may also be one in us;" (3) He prays for the oneness "that the world
   may believe that thou hast sent me;" (4) "The glory which thou gavest
   me I have given them that they may be one, as we are one;" (5) "I in
   them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one, even as we are
   one." Four times the petition goes to the Father for their oneness,
   such unity as that of the Son and the Father, and as this divine unity
   is secured by a reciprocal indwelling, so he asks that believers may be
   in him and that he may dwell in them by the Holy Spirit, in order that
   they may keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Hence, as
   the Father hath given him glory, he imparts the same glory to them that
   they may be one. Finally he asks for this oneness because without it
   the world will not be brought to the faith.

   No true disciple can appropriate this prayer without the deep
   conviction that all that hinders the "oneness" prayed for, is sinful,
   in disobedience to the will of both the Father and the Son, and
   calculated to defeat the object of Christ's coming into the world. What
   opposes this oneness is Anti-christ. It becomes him, therefore, to
   ascertain what this petition really asks for and to see that his own
   course is in harmony with the Lord's will, as revealed in the prayer.
   While the word church is not named, all concede that in praying for the
   unity of believers the Lord prays for the unity of the body into which
   believers are gathered. It will aid in ascertaining his meaning to see
   the characteristics of the early church in which we know that he dwelt
   by his Spirit. Its history tells that "the multitude of them that
   believed were of one heart and soul" (Acts 4:32), and that "walking in
   the fear of the Lord and the comfort of the Holy Spirit they were
   multiplied" (Acts 9:31). Here, then, was oneness, oneness of heart and
   soul in one body, and the result is that the world believed upon
   Christ, and the believers were multiplied. These early Christians
   fulfilled the conditions of the Savior's prayer and the results in
   behalf of which he prayed, followed.

   These believers, though in a few years counted by tens of thousands,
   composed of Jews and Gentiles, bond and free, and scattered through
   western Asia and southern Europe, were only one body, and the different
   members of this body were bound to each other by the most indissoluble
   ties. A favorite figure of Paul is the likeness of the church to the
   human body, which is composed of various members but all with one life,
   interest and mutual dependence upon each other. No less than twelve
   times be speaks of the church as the body of which Christ is the Head,
   often emphasizing the fact that there is but one body. "In one Spirit
   ye are baptized into one body and all partake of one spirit" (1 Cor.
   12:13). Taking Jews and Gentiles Christ "makes in himself of two one
   new man, so making peace, that he might reconcile both to God in one
   body" (Eph. 2:15, 16). In the apostolic age there was no thought of
   bodies of Christians. The church was a unit. All the figures point to
   its unity. There is one kingdom; the Lord says, "I will build my
   church;" he is the Bridegroom and the church is the bride; "there is
   one fold, and one shepherd; the "one loaf" on the Lord's table Paul
   tells us represents the "one body;" there is one Head even as there is
   one body, and

   Paul (Eph. 4:3-6) commands us to keep the unity of the Spirit In the
   bond of peace and names seven characteristics that imply and compel
   unity. "There is one body, and one spirit, even as ye are called in one
   hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
   Father of all, who is above all and through all; and in you all."

   On the one hand we have these emphatic declarations of the unity of the
   church, and on the other the strongest rebuke of divisions, schisms and
   sects. The word hairesis occurs nine times in the Greek of the New
   Testament, is rendered four times heresies, and five times sect. It
   always means a split, or sect, and is condemned as one of the works of
   the flesh. Anything that divides God's people is a hairesis, and a sect
   comes under the strongest condemnation.

   It is clear from this examination of the Scriptures that the oneness
   prayed for by the Savior is inconsistent with the existence of
   denominationalism. It implies the breaking down of all divisions among
   the people of God as completely as those between Jew and Gentile were
   destroyed by the cross so as to mould them into one body. It implies
   such unity between all saints as exists between the various members of
   the human body. It implies oneness of life and of spirit, in one body
   under one Lord. Such a union, one that would unite all believers into
   one army, take away the reproach of Zion, and oppose a solid front to
   the adversary, would cause the world at once to believe that the Father
   sent Christ into the world. In order that this unity may have an effect
   upon the world it must be seen; hence there must be organic unity that
   it may be visible. Such unity did exist in the apostolic ages but then
   there were no sects; it has not existed since the apostasy and will not
   be restored until God's people all stand together as one body, having
   one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one calling, one hope,
   one Father. The fiction of an invisible church and an invisible unity
   does not meet the demand.

   A unity that introduces religious rivalry into every country village,
   that refuses to unite in combined effort to save the world, that breaks
   up the soldiers of the cross into guerrilla bands rather than combine
   them into one great and invincible army, and that breaks to pieces at
   the door of the church or the communion table, has none of the
   conditions of that oneness for which the Savior prayed. Those
   conditions will never be met, until "all the multitude of them that
   believe are of one heart and soul." For this consummation all who love
   the Lord ought to labor and to pray.

   I am well pleased to give, as an evidence of the increasing sense of
   the need of unity, the following passage from a published discourse of
   Dr. John Fulton, a leading Episcopal minister: "Unless I have greatly
   misunderstood one of our Savior's most solemn utterances, I suspect
   that our divisions are worse than negatively unchristian; in their
   effects they are decidedly anti-christian. What else can our Lord have
   meant when he prayed to the Father, 'that they may all be one, that the
   world may believe that thou hast sent me?' If these affecting words
   mean anything, is it not that, in some way or other, the unity of
   Christ's followers is a divine condition of the conversion of the
   world? If that is his meaning, then is not every needless division
   treason to the kingdom of Christ? And, to speak very practically, what
   can it be but treason to permit the helplessness caused by our
   divisions to hand over to perdition, so far as we are concerned,
   perhaps more souls than our divided ministry is saving? With what
   consistency are we spending millions of money in foreign missions,
   while the wasteful wantonness of our denominational divisions, together
   with the crippled inefficiency which is caused by them, is virtually
   and needlessly consigning more thousands of our own countrymen to
   heathenism in one year than all our missionaries put together have ever
   converted in five? God forbid that I should disparage any effort to
   spread his Gospel at home or abroad; but while we are rejoicing over
   the heathen whom we save, let us not forget the account we have to give
   of the heathen whom our divisions are making by the thousand in every
   great city of this land."--Christian Unity and Christian Faith, page
   12.

     __________________________________________________________________

The Betrayal.

   Leaving the Upper Room, Jesus and his disciples went out into the
   moonlit night, for there was full moon at the passover, and took their
   way through the streets out of the eastern gate, across the Kedron, to
   the garden of Gethsemane, about a half mile from the city walls, near
   the western base of Mt. Olivet. The Garden, or orchard, takes its name
   from a word meaning oil press, and doubtless was shaded by the olive
   trees, from which the hill takes its designation. Still the traveler
   meets on this slope with giant olives, no doubt the descendants of
   those under the shade of which Jesus reposed. Here the Lord endured the
   Agony of the Garden, that wonderful struggle, with its sublime victory,
   recorded in the words, "Not as I will, but as thou wilt." Immediately
   after this we may place the appearance of the band led by Judas. How
   wonderful the events of this night! It is the only night of the life of
   Jesus that we can trace. We see first, the Passover in the upper room,
   then the washing of feet, the exposure of Judas, the warning to Peter,
   the tender discourses to the disciples, the agony at Gethsemane, the
   betrayal, the arrest, the trial before the Sanhedrim, the trial before
   Pilate, the scourging, &c., &c. (Joh 18:1)

   1. He went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron. The eleven
   apostles were with Jesus when he left the Upper Room and departed on
   this eventful journey, the most eventful in the history of the world.
   The brook Kedron, which he crossed, flowed through a ravine east of
   Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives. The name means the
   black torrent. It was dry during the dry, but a rushing torrent during
   the rainy season. Where was a garden. John does not give the name, but
   all the other writers designate it. Gethsemane means "oil-press." It
   was probably an enclosed olive vineyard, containing a press and
   garden-tower, perhaps a dwelling-house. It was at the western foot of
   the Mount of Olives, beyond the Kedron. The spot now pointed out as
   Gethsemane lies on the right of the path to the Mount of Olives. The
   wall has been restored. Eight olive trees remain, all of them very old,
   but scarcely of the time of our Lord, since Titus, during the siege of
   Jerusalem, had all the trees of the district cut down.--Schaff. (Joh
   18:2)

   2. Judas . . . . knew the place; for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither.
   The movements of Judas, after the Last Supper, we may readily picture
   to ourselves in their outline. Going immediately to Caiaphas, or to
   some other leading member of the Sanhedrim, he informs him where Jesus
   is, and announces that he is ready to fulfill his compact, and at once
   to make the arrest. It was not the intention to arrest Christ during
   the feast, lest there should be a popular tumult (Matt. 26:5); but, now
   that an opportunity offered of seizing him secretly at dead of night,
   when all were asleep or engaged at the paschal meal, his enemies could
   not hesitate. Judas knew the place, for it was a frequent resort of
   Jesus with his disciples. He had been there ofttimes. No hallowed
   associations with that sacred spot deterred his treason for one moment.
   (Joh 18:3)

   3. Judas, then, having received a band of men. The multitude, guided by
   Judas, is described by Mark as "great." It consisted (1) of the band
   (John 18:3, 12), or Roman cohort, which, consisting of 300 to 600 men,
   was quartered in the tower of Antonia, overlooking the temple, and ever
   ready to put down any tumult or arrest any disturber. Probably so much
   of the band as could be spared was present. (2) There were the captains
   of the temple (Luke 22:52), with their men, who guarded the temple and
   kept order. (3) Some of the chief priests and elders (Luke 22:52). (4)
   And, finally, their servants, such as Malchus. The priests, ignorant of
   the spirit and purposes of Jesus, expected resistance. The "lanterns
   and torches" show that they expected that he might hide in the dark
   shadows of the valleys and crags. Otherwise they would not have been
   required when there was the full passover moon. (Joh 18:4)

   4. Jesus, knowing all things that should come upon him. Knowing their
   objects and all that he had to endure on the morrow. He submitted of
   his own will, and after the troubled hour of Gethsemane, is as calm as
   the unruffled sea. Whom seek ye? Jesus "went forth" from the shadow of
   the trees into the moonlight, or from the garden walls, advancing in
   front of his disciples, in order to save them from arrest (verse 8),
   and asked whom they sought. (Joh 18:5) (Joh 18:6)

   5, 6. Judas, also, which betrayed him, stood with them. To the Lord's
   question, his foes replying that they sought Jesus of Nazareth, he
   calmly replied, "I am he." Then follows a scene designed to show all
   the world that the Lord laid down his own life. His foemen were
   powerless in his hands. As he answers, either his majesty and their own
   terror so impressed them, that, awed, they fell backward to the earth,
   or his divine power was exerted to prostrate them. Then the Lord
   submitted himself "as a lamb to the slaughter," and his power is not
   again exerted until he rises from the tomb, except to heal the smitten
   servant of the high priest. John calls attention to the fact that Judas
   was with the band thus discomfited. The other writers mention, what
   John omits, that Judas betrayed the Lord with a kiss. See Mark 14:44,
   45. This probably occurred just before what John records in verses 5th
   And 6th. (Joh 18:7) (Joh 18:8) (Joh 18:9)

   7, 8, 9. Let these go their way. After the guard had recovered from its
   sudden terror, perhaps wondering how it could have been so smitten to
   the earth, but still standing as if they did not know what to do, Jesus
   again asks whom they seek, and on their answer, repeats that he is the
   one they seek, adding the request that, if their object is to take him,
   they should lot his disciples go. In this hour his thoughts were not on
   himself, but concerning the safety of his followers. In their safety
   the Scripture would be fulfilled, his own words, uttered in his prayer
   (John 17:12). The present deliverance of the eleven would be the
   beginning of the fulfillment of that promise, and the same power that
   protected them now, would protect them to the end. (Joh 18:10)

   10. Then Simon Peter . . . smote the high priest's servant. We learn
   from Luke 22:38, that there were but two swords in the whole company of
   the twelve. One of these naturally was in Peter's possession, as being
   the foremost of the whole band. Abbott surmises that the attack on the
   guard followed their sudden terror. All the disciples were eager to
   make it (Luke 22:49), though Peter was the only one who carried the
   will into action. In Luke 22:49, Peter first asks if they shall fight.
   He waits not for the answer, but impelled by the natural courage of his
   heart, and taking no heed of the odds against him, aims a blow at one,
   probably the foremost of the band,--the first that was daring to lay
   profane hands on the sacred person of the Lord. (Joh 18:11)

   11. Put up thy sword into the sheath. Matthew 26:52, 53, is in some
   respects fuller, and is full of instruction: "Put up again thy sword
   into its place; for all they that take the sword shall perish by the
   sword." There is no possibility of advancing Christ's kingdom in such
   worldly ways, by force, by depending on the rich, or on state
   patronage. And there is no need of such aid, either for Christ or his
   kingdom. God only can save them from worldly trouble if that were the
   best; for "thinkest thou I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
   presently give me twelve legions of angels?" The same thought is
   expressed here: "The cup which my Father hath given shall I not drink
   it?" He was, by the will of the Father surrendering himself, for the
   time, to the power of his enemies. They could have no power over him
   without his consent. (Joh 18:12)

   12. Then the band, and the captain and officers of the Jews, took Jesus
   and bound him. The disciples "all forsook him and fled" (Mark 14:50),
   probably at this moment, and the soldiers of the Roman band, and the
   Jewish temple officers, rough, cruel men, seized and bound the Son of
   God. The terror inspired by the gentle but mighty Jesus is shown in the
   fact that all unite to seize him and to bind him. While they were
   binding him the disciples had an opportunity to escape. (Joh 18:13)

   13. And led him away to Annas first. The actual high priest at the time
   was Caiaphas; but this Annas had been high priest, and as such enjoyed
   the title by courtesy. Being also a man of great wealth and influence,
   and of active habits, he took upon him much of the business of that
   high office, as a sort of assessor to, or substitute for, Caiaphas, who
   was his son-in-law. Hence the evangelist describes them both as "high
   priests" (Luke 3:2), as they were in fact. (Joh 18:14)

   14. Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, etc. Caiaphas
   had already committed himself to the policy of condemnation (John
   11:50). He was appointed high priest by the Roman procurator about 27
   a.d., held the office during the whole administration of Pilate, was
   deposed 36 or 37 a.d. Both Annas and Caiaphas were creatures of the
   Roman court; both belonged to the Saddusaic party; both, that is, were
   openly infidel concerning some of the fundamental truths of the Hebrew
   faith. Originally the high priest was appointed for life but the Romans
   set him aside and appointed a successor whenever they wished. Annas had
   been thus deposed, but was probably still regarded as the real high
   priest by many of the Jews.

   The reader will observe, as in 11:49-52, the statement that Caiaphas
   was priest "that same year" and "gave counsel that Jesus should die." I
   wish to emphasize the thought that John does not intend to intimate
   that the high-priesthood was an annual office, but that Caiaphas was
   the high priest that same remarkable year, and that he was instrumental
   in the death of Christ, by declaring "that it was expedient that one
   man should die for the people." "Every high priest is ordained to offer
   gifts and sacrifices" and was wont to enter "the holy place once a
   year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins
   of the whole people" (Heb. 9:7). Hence, John indicates not only that
   Caiaphas unconsciously prophesied, but unconsciously, also, "being high
   priest that year," sent the great Victim to the sacrifice who died for
   the sins of the world.

Practical Observations.

   1. It is not strange that some bad professors creep into the church,
   since one in twelve, even of Christ's own disciples, was false. The
   church can prosper in spite of some unworthy members.

   2. We see the powerlessness of mere good example to save men. No one
   ever lived in better company than Judas.

   3. Bad men will always find an opportunity to sin. God uses even bad
   men, and compels them to carry out his designs; but wrong-doing is none
   the better on that account.

   4. THIS CUP.--When Jesus, in his prayer, said, "Not as I will, but as
   thou wilt," then he was "strengthened," his soul was at peace, and
   henceforth he was calm and dignified. He was brought into the perfect
   peace and calmness of a submissive will, so that every desire and
   feeling and choice was in harmony with the Father. He was enabled to go
   on with his work of redemption, to glorify God and magnify his love
   (see Phil. 2:7-10). The cross was changed to a crown, Gethsemane into
   Paradise, death into immortal glory. So perfect resignation to the will
   of the Father strengthens us, fills us with perfect peace, and fits us
   for every noble work.

   5. I AM HE.--That answer, so quiet and so gentle, had in it a strength
   greater than the eastern wind, or the voice of thunder, for God was in
   that still voice and it struck them down to the ground. Instances are
   not wanting in history in which the untroubled brow, the mere glance,
   the calm bearing of a defenceless man, has disarmed and paralyzed
   enemies. The savage and brutal Gauls could not lift their swords to
   slay the majestic senators of Rome. "I cannot slay Marius!" exclaimed
   the barbarian slave, flinging down his sword and flying headlong from
   the prison into which he had been sent to murder the aged
   hero.--Farrar.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Trial Before the High Priest.

   "Reading the Gospels side by side, we will, with care and study, see
   how all they tell us falls accurately into its proper position in the
   general narrative, and shows us a six-fold trial, a quadruple decision,
   a triple acquittal, a twice repeated condemnation of Christ our Lord.
   We soon perceive that of the three successive trials which our Lord
   underwent at the hands of the Jews, the first only--that before
   Annas--is related to us by John; the second--that before Caiaphas--by
   Matthew and Mark; the third--that before the Sanhedrim--by Luke alone.
   Nor is there anything strange in this, since the first was the
   practical, the second the potential, and the third the actual and
   formal decision, that sentence of death should be passed upon him. Each
   of the three trials might, from a different point of view, have been
   regarded as the most fatal and important of the three. That of Annas
   was the authoritative pre-judgment, that of Caiaphas the real
   determination, that of the Sanhedrim, at daybreak, the final
   ratification. "--Farrar. (Joh 18:15)

   15. Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple. At the time of
   the seizure of Christ all the apostles fled in panic (Matt. 26:56), but
   in a short time some of them recovered and followed (Matt. 26:58), one
   of them being Peter. The other "disciple" named is admitted by all
   commentators to be John. He was "known to the high priest," how we
   cannot say; some have supposed that he was a relative; others that he
   had a home in Jerusalem (19:27) and had thus become acquainted. As an
   acquaintance he was at once admitted through the gates of the high
   priest's palace, while Peter was refused admission. High priest. In
   verse 13 it is stated that Jesus "was led away to Annas first," while
   here he is taken into the "high priest's palace," though we have just
   been informed that "Caiaphas was high priest that year." This may be
   explained in two ways. Annas who had been high priest for seven years,
   who was the father of four sons who were high priests, and whose
   son-in-law was high priest, was probably the most influential man among
   the Jews and was dignified with his old title of high priest. In Luke
   3:2, both Annas and Caiaphas are named as high priests; in Acts 4:6,
   Annas is spoken of as high priest. Though his son-in-law was now by
   Roman appointment in the position, he was still called high priest, and
   from what we learn elsewhere, his counsels swayed the ruling party. It
   is, however, likely that he still had a home in the official residence
   of the high priest and that he and his son-in-law lived under the same
   roof. The band that had arrested Jesus brought him to Annas first,
   perhaps because at that midnight hour Caiaphas was asleep while the
   more active and vigilant Annas was on the alert. Perhaps because Annas,
   the power behind the throne, had directed them to do so; or, as some
   have urged, he held some high dignity that entitled him to examine
   Jesus and commit him for trial. His was a preliminary examination. It
   seems certain that he and Caiaphas lodged in the same palace and hence,
   that all that is recorded of Peter's denials in the four accounts,
   occurred at the same place. (Joh 18:16)

   16. But Peter stood at the door without. The damsel who kept the door,
   for it was a common Jewish custom to have female porters, seeing that
   Peter was a stranger, refused to admit him. John went in, evidently
   expecting Peter to follow, but when he did not, returned and spoke to
   the maid, who at once, suffered him to pass, John being an
   acquaintance. (Joh 18:17)

   17. Art thou not also one of this man's disciples? John was known to
   the maid as a disciple of Christ. The maid, fancying that Peter was
   another, from his acquaintance with John, asked the question, after
   Peter had gone in, from curiosity. There was no occasion for Peter to
   deny, but from sudden fear he said, "I am not." As some have insisted
   that there is a discrepancy in the four accounts of the denial of Peter
   it will be well to note, 1. That each Evangelist records the prediction
   of a three-fold denial; 2. That each Evangelist records three acts of
   denial; 3. That they all represent these to have occurred at the palace
   of the high priest; 4. That all declare that the first denial was in
   answer to a question of a maid servant; 5. All refer to the same place
   in the immediate connection, the court or inner open space around which
   the building was constructed, and where the fire was built on the
   pavement. This would be within the building, but outside of the rooms.
   Thus far, then, there is harmony. (Joh 18:18)

   18. Servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals. As
   we learn from Mark 14:66, the fire was made in the court, the open
   space left in the center for light and ventilation around which the
   building was constructed, and which was reached by an arched way called
   (Matt. 26:71) "the porch." The court within, which was a common feature
   of great houses, was paved. The fire was of charcoal. It was cold. As a
   general rule the nights of Palestine at the season of the passover were
   warm throughout, and the cold is named as unusual. Peter, having denied
   his Master, probably thought he was less likely to be suspected if he
   threw himself in the midst of his enemies and hence he "stood and
   warmed himself," while John seems to have pressed on after his Lord.
   (Joh 18:19)

   19. The high priest then asked Jesus . . . of his doctrine. Is not
   certain whether this "high priest" was Annas or Caiaphas, but I agree
   with the opinion of Canon Farrar that it was Annas, and that John,
   therefore, gives an account of the informal examination by this great
   dignitary which he personally witnessed and which is omitted in the
   other Gospels. In the Common Version verse 24 reads that "Annas had
   sent him to Caiaphas bound," which has been supposed to mean that he
   was sent before the examination described just before. The Revision,
   however, reads, "Annas, therefore, sent him," etc., which is correct as
   the Greek verb is not in the past perfect, but in the aorist tense.
   This can only mean that Annas sent him after the examination that John
   describes. Since, as we have found, Annas is called high priest, as
   well as Caiaphas, there is no difficulty in the use of that term. Annas
   had now conducted his informal trial, decided upon the case, and
   delivered over the prisoner, "bound," for official investigation. The
   next investigation, which is described by Matthew and Mark, was not
   conducted by the whole Sanhedrim, but a portion. The Jewish writers
   speak of three Sanhedrims, of which two were, in fact, great committees
   of the Sanhedrim, twenty-three members being required for a meeting.
   This was probably such a section. On the other hand, Luke records the
   meeting of the great body, the whole Sanhedrim, at dawn of the day
   (Luke 22:66), since, according to Jewish writers, it could not condemn
   a man to death at night. The high priest's examination of Jesus was in
   the hope that he could extort some admission on which a charge could be
   framed. The answer of the Savior, though calm and dignified, is a
   rebuke. (Joh 18:20) (Joh 18:21)

   20, 21. I spake openly to the world. The Lord ignores the question
   concerning his disciples, but answers with reference to himself. He had
   taught openly in the synagogue and temple; he had entered into no
   conspiracies, as Annas himself had done; all his life and teaching
   could be learned by inquiry. Let them, if they wanted information, seek
   it of those who had heard him. There are several emphatic words, the I
   five times repeated in two verses, in contrast with you, and the ever.
   Jesus had no secret clique, but "taught the world." It will be observed
   that the Lord claims that the examination may proceed in the regular
   order by calling witnesses. "Ask them;" "Why askest thou me?" (Joh
   18:22)

   22. One of the officers . . struck Jesus. This is the first blow that
   was laid upon him "by whose stripes we are healed." The word rendered
   "palm of the hand" is "rod" in the margin, which is probably the
   meaning. The officer, a courtier, was not accustomed to hear a
   prisoner, in plain and independent language, stand upon his rights, and
   hence insolently struck the prisoner, and exclaimed, as though to
   justify the act, "Answerest thou the high priest so?" (Joh 18:23)

   23. If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil. Observe the
   calmness and dignity of the reply. Paul, under similar circumstances
   (Acts 23:3), answers like a man, but Christ, like the Son of God. If
   there was evil in the words just spoken, let it be pointed out; but if
   not, to smite him was a crime. These words are spoken to the servant.
   Violence is the resort of those who are in the wrong. (Joh 18:24)

   24. Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas. If this a correct
   translation, the Lord was sent to Caiaphas before the examination just
   recorded. The Revision, however, reads: "Annas, therefore, sent him,"
   etc., indicating that he was now sent. The latter is the correct
   translation, and points out this as the time be was sent. (Joh 18:25)

   25. And Simon Peter . . . Art thou also one of his disciples? In verse
   18 Peter is described as among the enemies of Christ, warming himself.
   It is repeated in order to give the circumstances of the second denial.
   It is by a comparison of all the Gospels that we get the full facts.
   They do not contradict each other but relate different parts of the
   same story. "Another maid" (Matthew) saw him and spoke to the others
   about him. Then "a man saw him" (Luke) and accused him; then those to
   whom the maid had spoken also accused (John). To all he made his second
   denial, Matthew says, "with an oath." This occurred partly in the
   "porch" (Matthew and Mark), or passage way to the court, and partly in
   the court (John). John and Luke omit the aggravation of the denials
   which Matthew and Mark record. (Joh 18:26)

   26. One of the servants of the high priest . . . Did I not see thee?
   etc. There is no mention of where the third denial occurred. Some time
   had passed, "about an hour" (Luke), since the last denial. Matthew and
   Mark describe the charge by "them that stood by;" Luke as made by
   another man, and John as made by a kinsman of Malchus. From all these
   accounts it seems clear that the conversation had been going on,
   probably around the fire. Peter joined in it and his Galilean
   pronunciation was recognized. Attention was called to it, and then many
   brought the charge against him. One of the servants, also a kinsman of
   Malchus, asserted that he had seen him in the garden. To all of these
   Peter made his denial with an oath, even "cursing and swearing" as
   though in a great passion (Matthew). All the Evangelists then give the
   three acts of denial, but each has taken different circumstances that
   were most significant for his purpose. All three denials took place in
   the high priest's house, in the court or the entrance to it, all within
   range of the light and heat of the fire kindled within; the first in
   the court, the second in the entrance, and the third again within. (Joh
   18:27)

   27. Immediately the cock crew. As the oaths were sullying the lips of
   him who had declared that he would die for the Master, the cock crew
   the second time to herald the approach of day. At that very moment the
   Lord, probably now being led to the meeting of the Sanhedrim which Luke
   tells us met at daylight, turned and looked on Peter with a look that
   pierced his soul. The recreant disciple went out into the night, like
   Judas; broken down, however, by repentance instead of remorse, and
   "wept bitterly" (Matt. 26:75). "They upon whom Jesus looks mourn their
   misdeeds. Peter at first denied and wept not, for the Lord had not
   looked upon him. He a second time denied, yet wept not; for the Lord
   hitherto had not looked on him. He denied a third time, and Jesus
   looked on him and then he wept most bitterly."--Ambrose.

   Following this, at dawn of day, the Savior was tried before Sanhedrim,
   as related in Luke 22:66-71, and as all attempts to prove him guilty of
   some crime or violation of the law had failed, in spite of false
   witnesses, he was called upon to answer, and upon his affirmation of
   divine majesty, they condemned him to die as guilty of blasphemy. To
   carry the sentence into effect the approbation of the Roman governor
   was needful. Hence, their prisoner is next sent to Pilate.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. From the accounts of the trial before the Sanhedrim, given more
   fully by the other Evangelists, we learn clearly the ground of
   condemnation. Failing to convict Jesus of any capital charge by
   witnesses, they examined him and the high priest exclaimed, "I adjure
   thee, Art thou the Christ, the Son of God." When he replied "I am," the
   high priest rent his garments, as if in horror, and cried: "What need
   have we of further testimony?" and all affirmed, "He is worthy of
   death." He was condemned, not because he said he was the Christ, but
   for asserting that he was the "Son of God," the crime of blasphemy from
   the point of view that he was only a man. Hence, before Pilate, when he
   found the Savior guiltless, they brought the additional charge: "We
   have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the
   Son of God." It follows, therefore, that Christ died on his own
   testimony that he was the Son of God. He heard the sentence of death
   passed by the Sanhedrim, on this ground, without a word of explanation.
   These facts are all consistent with his Sonship, his real Divinity, but
   are incapable of explanation if he was less than the Son of God. The
   only way to free his character to to accept him as the Son of the
   Highest.

   2. Now with the eye of sense we look on Jesus an he stands before this
   Jewish tribunal. It is the Man of sorrows, despised and rejected of
   men; treated by those lordly judges, and the brutal band of servitors,
   as the vilest of felons, the very refuse of the earth. Again, with the
   eye of faith we look upon him, and he seems transfigured before us,
   when, breaking the long-kept silence, he declares, "I am the Son of
   God, and hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right
   hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven." From what a depth
   of earthly degradation, to what a height of superhuman dignity does
   Jesus at once ascend! And is it not striking to notice how he himself
   blends his humiliation and exaltation, his humanity and divinity, as he
   takes the double title and binds it to his suffering brow: The Son of
   Man; the Son of God.--Hanna
     __________________________________________________________________

Christ Before Pilate.

   John only gives the detailed account of the private examinations of
   Jesus by Pilate during the civil trial recorded in 18:33-37. He
   probably went within Pilate's palace as he would not be deterred by the
   scruples of the Jews, having eaten his passover, and he was therefore a
   personal witness. His account aids much in explaining Pilate's language
   to the Jews and to Christ, which is recorded in the other Gospels. The
   trial before Pilate divides itself into the following acts: 1. Without
   the PrÃ¦torium. The Jews demand the death of Christ (18:28-32). 2.
   Within the PrÃ¦torium. Christ "witnesses a good confession." Christ a
   King (18:32-37). 3. Without the PrÃ¦torium. Jesus declared innocent.
   Barabbas proposed (18:38-40). 4. Within. The Lord scourged and mocked
   (19:1-3). 5. Without. Second and third declarations of innocence.
   "Behold the Man!" "The Son of God" (19:4-7). 6. Within. Authority
   (19:8-11). 7. Without. Pilate gives way before Jewish clamor and
   tramples on his convictions (19:12-16). In the appeal to Pilate the
   Sanhedrim, at first, concealed the real grounds on which they had
   condemned Jesus, and sought to have him put to death as a dangerous
   character who aimed to secure the kingly power.

   The transference of the trial from the Sanhedrim to the "judgment seat"
   of Pontius Pilate was made necessary by the political condition of
   Judea. One badge of the servitude of the Jewish nation to the Roman
   yoke was, that while the Jewish courts were permitted to try and to
   punish minor offenses, the final judgment of all capital offenses was
   reserved for the Roman tribunals. A Roman judge must sign the warrant
   before the condemned person could be led to execution, and the
   punishment was then indicted by the Roman officials. These capital
   cases at Jerusalem were usually brought up at the great feasts, at
   which time the Roman Governor came up from his home at Cesarea to the
   Jewish capital. Pontius Pilate, at this passover occasion, had come up,
   and as he would probably return as soon as the passover was over, it
   was needful to make their appeal to him at once. Besides, after the
   passover began it would be unlawful for them to conduct civil business,
   and unless they were prepared to hold Jesus for a week as a prisoner
   the death warrant would have to be obtained this very morning, and the
   crucifixion follow immediately, in order that the bodies might be
   removed before the feast began. It is needful to consider these facts
   in order to understand the extreme hurry and urgency of the members of
   Sanhedrim. Hence, early upon that Friday morning, the great dignitaries
   of Israel were assembled before the hated judgment hall of Pilate, a
   building they could not enter at this time without defilement. No Jew
   was permitted, during the passover week to enter any house that had not
   been purged of leaven, under the penalty of death, and this would, of
   course, exclude them from all buildings occupied by Gentiles. Though
   the rulers could trample the law of justice to the earth, they were
   scrupulous in observing the ceremonial law. (Joh 18:28)

   28. Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment. The
   first examination was at the house of Annas, where an officer had
   smitten Jesus. Then Annas sent him to Caiaphas. Still later he was
   tried before the Sanhedrim (see Matt. chap. 27) and condemned. Then he
   was led from Caiaphas to Pilate's judgment hall. Pontius Pilate, now
   mentioned by John for the first time, made conspicuous before all the
   world by his connection with the crucifixion, was the Roman governor,
   or rather "procurator" of Palestine. The principal duties of his office
   were to preserve order, collect the tribute and, in certain cases,
   administer justice. Since a.d. 6 Palestine had been thus governed and
   Pilate had entered upon his office two or three years before. His usual
   residence was in Cesarea, but at the time of the great feasts he was
   wont to come up to Jerusalem to prevent tumult. His name indicates that
   he belonged to the warlike gens of the Pontii, of whom the great
   Samnite general, Caius Pontius, was most conspicuous. His history, as
   given by profane authorities, indicates that he was a bold,
   unscrupulous, cruel man. He was removed from office about a.d. 36 on
   account of his cruelties and banished. The traditions report that he
   killed himself from disappointment, or remorse, and Mt. Pilatus in
   Switzerland, is pointed out as his last earthly home. Justin Martyr, in
   his defence of Christianity, cites Pagans to the official report of
   Pilate to the Emperor Tiberius concerning the death of Jesus Christ,
   which he says, they could find in the archives at Rome. Tertullian,
   Eusebius and others also speak of it. A very ancient document, entitled
   the Acts of Pilate, is still extant, but the weight of scholarship is
   against its authenticity. It was early. Probably after the hour of
   sunrise, about six or seven A. M. The informal meeting of the
   Sanhedrim, held some time before dawn on this Friday morning, at the
   palace of Caiaphas, had adjourned, and the mob were mocking Jesus. But
   as soon as morning dawned, and it was lawful to condemn Jesus, the
   Sanhedrim assembled, probably in their own council chamber--either the
   hall Gazith, in the temple court, or a hall near by--and proceeded to
   pass formal sentence of death upon Jesus. But they could not inflict
   the death penalty. The Romans were now the rulers of Judea, and had
   taken to themselves the right to decide on all cases of capital
   punishment. Hence, it was needful for the Jews to go to Pilate, the
   Roman governor, to secure this condemnation of Christ. They themselves
   went not into the judgment hall. The judgment hall, or PrÃ¦torium,
   literally, was the name given to the headquarters of the Roman military
   governor, wherever he happened to be. These Jewish leaders, filled with
   the hate of Christ, and ready to secure his judicial murder by the
   foulest means, were yet so scrupulous that they would not enter the
   house of a Gentile lest "they should be defiled" (see Deut. 16:4), so
   that they would not be able to eat the passover. The Pharisees held
   that contact with a Gentile, or to enter his house was a source of
   defilement. Hence, this deputation of the Sanhedrim waited without and
   Pilate "went out unto them" to ascertain their business. Men can be
   very religious and yet great sinners. (Joh 18:29)

   29. What accusation bring ye against this man? As a detachment of Roman
   soldiers had been furnished to assist in the arrest, he probably knew
   already that they regarded the prisoner an evil doer, but he did not
   know what were the specific charges. (Joh 18:30)

   30. If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up
   unto thee. Their reply shows that they had hoped that Pilate would take
   their verdict that Jesus was a malefactor, worthy of death, and would
   send him to death without a trial. They had condemned Jesus to death on
   the charge of blasphemy, because he declared that he was the Christ,
   the Son of God, but they knew well that Pilate would be indifferent to
   a charge of this kind. Such a claim on the part of Jesus would be no
   offence against the Roman law. (Joh 18:31)

   31. Take ye him, and judge him according to your own law. They had
   judged and condemned according to their own law and Pilate, on their
   refusal to state their charges, bade them proceed according to their
   own laws. They answered that this could not be done for "it was not
   lawful for them to put any man to death." The Roman laws forbade it.
   The power of life and death had been taken away from them as a subject
   people. (Joh 18:32)

   32. That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled. Had the Jews been
   allowed to put Christ to death, he would have been stoned, as Stephen
   was, by a mob in Jerusalem, stoning being the usual Jewish method of
   execution, but he had "signified what death he should die" (John 12:32,
   and Matt. 20:18, 19) and had declared that he should be crucified. This
   was the method of punishment that the Roman uniformly adopted towards
   conquered races. (Joh 18:33)

   33. Then Pilate entered the judgment hall again. Before Pilate returned
   into the judgment hall, where Jesus had been taken, the Jews had made a
   formal charge that must demand the attention of Pilate, that Jesus was
   aiming at the sovereignty of Judea and seeking to overturn the Roman
   government. See Luke 23:2. These charges were well adapted to perplex
   Pilate. Jesus did claim that he would establish a kingdom and had come
   into the world to be a King; he had a few days before entered
   Jerusalem, hailed by the throng as King of the Jews. It was not to be
   expected that Pilate would understand that his kingdom was spiritual,
   especially when a dishonest and wily priesthood was perverting every
   fact to give color to their accusation. Art thou the King of the Jews?
   This was a private investigation within the PrÃ¦torium, after the Jews,
   carefully suppressing the religious grounds on which they had condemned
   our Lord, had advanced against him a triple accusation of, (1)
   seditious agitation; (2) prohibition of the payment of the
   tribute-money, and (3) the assumption of the suspicious title of "King
   of the Jews" (Luke 23:3). This last accusation amounted to a charge of
   treason--the greatest crime known to Roman law. Of the three points of
   accusation, (2) was utterly false; (1) and (3), though in a sense true,
   were not true in the sense intended. (Joh 18:34) (Joh 18:35)

   34, 35. Sayest thou this thing of thyself? or, etc. This question of
   Jesus is not for information, but it strikes right at the merits of the
   charge. Who made it? Did any Roman ever see me breaking the Roman laws?
   If a Roman had preferred the charge of insurrection, it might be
   examined, but when did the Jews find fault with a man who sought to
   free them? Pilate knew well how restive they were under the Roman yoke,
   how ready to rebel, and the very hate shown Christ was proof that he
   was not aiming to be such a King as they desired. Pilate comprehends
   the point, for he exclaims at once, "Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and
   the chief priests have delivered thee unto me." That disproves their
   charge. But what hast thou done? (Joh 18:36)

   36. My kingdom is not of this world. Jesus did not hesitate to relieve
   the honest perplexity of Pilate; still it would be hard for Pilate,
   with his gross ideas, to form any conception of a kingdom not of this
   world, a kingdom of which the subjects did not fight with carnal
   weapons to defend its king, or to extend its borders. But such was
   Christ's. It was not of this world, did not spring from it, was
   heavenly in its origin, and hence his servants would not fight that he
   should not be delivered to the Jews. The fact that no resistance was
   made to his arrest was a proof that his servants did not propose
   resistance to worldly governments. Note what this remarkable
   declaration contains: 1. Christ's kingdom is supernatural, not of human
   origin. It is in the world but not worldly. 2. It is maintained, not by
   carnal weapons, but by spiritual and moral means. All attempts to
   propagate Christianity by the sword are prohibited. (Joh 18:37)

   37. Art thou a king then? If Christ has a kingdom he must be a King.
   Some commentators have thought that Pilate asked this question in
   contempt of the poor, bound prisoner that was before him, but the
   gravity of the answer of Jesus shows that it was sincerely asked. The
   Lord did not reply to sneers. Hence he declares that he had come into
   the world to be a King, that he was a King, and that all who were under
   the influence of the truth would hear his voice, because he bore
   witness to the truth. (Joh 18:38)

   38. What is truth? Pilate's inquiry was not answered in words, but
   Truth sat embodied and bound before him. It matters not whether his
   question was sincere, or in pity of one whom he may have thought an
   enthusiast, it is evident that he was profoundly impressed, for at once
   he stepped out of the hall to the street, where the priests were
   waiting, and declared, I find in him no fault at all. It is his formal
   acquittal in the face of the Sanhedrim. Unless he had been profoundly
   stirred, he, a bloody, unscrupulous man, would not have cleared a
   helpless prisoner in the face of the Jewish nation which sought to
   destroy him. (Joh 18:39)

   39. Ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the
   passover. By a comparison of the other accounts it is evident that, in
   the interval, before his effort to release Jesus according to the
   custom of the passover feast, he sent Jesus to Herod in order to
   shuffle off the responsibility, but Herod had sent him back. Then he
   asks whether he shall not release him, according to the custom. He was
   placed in a very trying position. Jesus was accused of treason against
   the Roman emperor; he declared that he was not guilty; the priests then
   accused Pilate of not being CÃ¦sar's friend, intimating that they would
   accuse him to CÃ¦sar. Had he been accused of letting a man go who
   claimed to be King of the Jews it would have gone hard with him. Still
   he is intensely averse to being the instrument of the murder of Jesus,
   and he hopes that they will accept his liberty on account of the
   passover. The custom had arisen of the Roman governors always
   dismissing, as an act of favor at that time, one prisoner who had
   offended the Roman authority. There were only two such prisoners of
   note in Pilate's hands. One was Barabbas, a man who had been engaged in
   sedition in Jerusalem as the leader of a band of robbers, a desperate
   man and a murderer; the other was Jesus, of whom he had said, "I find
   in him no fault at all." (Joh 18:40)

   40. Not this man, but Barabbas. He had not named Barabbas, but they, in
   their anxiety to reject Christ, at once name him. The people were
   stimulated to this choice by the bitter hatred of the priests. It is
   remarkable that this man Barabbas was confessedly guilty of the very
   crime with which the priests and rulers had falsely charged Jesus--that
   of sedition; and no plainer proof of their hypocrisy could be given to
   the watchful Pilate than their efforts to release the former and
   condemn the latter.
     __________________________________________________________________

Practical Observations.

   1. The practical, vital question for every mortal, is that which
   confronted Pilate, What shall I do with Christ? To every one comes
   Pilate's hour, when he must make his decision.

   2. The Jews carried Jesus to Pilate "because it was not lawful for them
   to put any man to death." That proved that the "scepter (power) had
   departed from Judah." But that was the proof that Shiloh had come. See
   Gen.49:10.

   3. Are you members of that kingdom which is not of this world? Then you
   cannot be filled with the spirit of this world. "Be not conformed to
   this world." "The friendship of the world is enmity to God."

   4. Are you of the truth? The test is hearing the voice of Christ.
   "Every one that is of the truth hears" his voice. Those who can behold
   his sinless life, his matchless love, and hear his words such as man
   never spake, and then turn away from him, demonstrate that they do not
   love the truth. He is the truth itself.

   5. What shall I do with Jesus? (1) Every person must do something with
   Jesus. He must accept or reject him. (2) Some try to escape this
   decision: (a) by refusing to decide, but that is deciding against him;
   (b) by substitution of other virtues in the place of believing in
   Christ; (c) by laying the blame on others, on circumstances, on
   temptations; (d) but it is all in vain. (3) To reject Christ is to
   reject the sum and soul of all goodness. (4) Rejecting Christ is the
   great sin of the world. (5) The time will come when those who reject
   Christ will have to ask," What can I do without Christ?"--P.

   6. Jesus long since was nailed to the cross and hanged up against the
   Judean sky, but the old question, "What shall I do with Jesus?" is
   still the question of the hour. Barabbas, the robber, who was preferred
   to Jesus, sleeps in an unknown grave, but there are thieves and
   highwaymen still. There are moral Barabbases who would rob us of the
   religion that made this country great and free--that dotted it with
   school-houses, as the heavens are with stars--that comforts us in
   affliction and cheers us when our feet touch the dark waters. There are
   appetites and lusts to rob our hearts of peace, our homes of joy and
   our souls of the crown of life. Behold! Jesus knocks at my heart's
   door! Shall I receive and honor him? Shall I, with the multitude say,
   "Away with him! Release Barabbas?" It is the old question, "What shall
   I do with Jesus?" Like Banquo's ghost it will not down at my bidding. I
   cannot evade it. I must be for him or against him. It is the old
   question still, "Jesus or Barabbas?"--J. B. Johnson.

Christ Crucified.

   By a comparison of the four accounts of this momentous trial it is easy
   to trace its successive stages. 1. We have an account of the informal
   examination before Annas, recorded only by John (18:13-24), which
   terminates with the statement that Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas. 2.
   Next is the preliminary examination conducted by Caiaphas aided by a
   section of the Sanhedrim, of which accounts are given in Matt. 26:57-68
   and Mark 14:55-65. 3. Luke gives an account of the formal meeting of
   the great Sanhedrim after the dawn of day (22:66-71). 4. Next comes the
   formal accusation before Pilate, recorded in all the Gospels. 5. The
   first conference between Christ and Pilate is recorded in John
   18:33-38. 6. Pilate's first acquittal; further charges; Christ's
   silence (Matt. 27:12-14; Mark 15:3-5; Luke 23:4, 5). 7. Case sent to
   Herod (Luke 23:6-12). 8. Before Pilate again; second formal acquittal
   (Luke 23:13-16). 9. Jesus or Barabbas (Matt. 27:15-18; Mark 15:6-10).
   10. Message of warning from Pilate's wife (while people are deciding)
   (Matt. 27:19). 11. Barabbas chosen. Cries of "Crucify him!" (Matt.
   27:20-22; Mark 15:11-13.) 12. Efforts of Pilate to save Jesus (Matt.
   27:23; Mark 15:12-14). 13. Pilate washes his hands; declaration of
   Christ's innocence (Matt. 27:24, 25). 14. Sentence of crucifixion (Mark
   15:15; Luke 23:24, 25). 15. Scourging and mockery (Matt. 27:26-30; Mark
   15:16-19; John 19:1-3). 16. Further efforts of Pilate to save Jesus
   (John 19:4-16). 17. Led away to be crucified (Matt. 27:31; Mark 15:20).

   The great tragedy moves rapidly on. The chief priests, members of the
   Sanhedrim, and Jewish leaders, had prepared their plans well; so well
   that Pilate, with all his well-meant endeavors, found himself unable to
   frustrate them. A great crowd of their creatures surrounded his palace
   and met every expostulation against the injustice of murdering Jesus
   with hoarse remonstrances, loud cries and ferocious threats. Accustomed
   to the inflammatory temper of the Jewish population he feared an
   uprising at a time when the passover had brought two or three millions
   of people to the city and when it would be easy to overwhelm the little
   Roman garrison of 600 men. He feared still more the accusations against
   him that they proposed to despatch to CÃ¦sar, for he had already learned
   by their victory over him in a former collision that they were not
   without influence at Rome. Hence, rather than sacrifice himself, he
   begins to yield to demands to which he is bitterly opposed and knows to
   be cruel and unjust. His attempt to relieve himself of responsibility
   by sending the prisoners to Herod had failed. (Joh 19:1)

   1. Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. Scourging was the usual
   preliminary of the Romans to an execution, but Pilate still hoped to
   appease the Jews by the suffering and humiliation of Jesus, without his
   death. The Roman scourging was terribly cruel. The word used for
   scourging implies that it was done, not with rods, for Pilate had no
   lictors, but with what Horace calls the "horribile flagellum," of which
   the Russian knout is the only modern representative. The person to be
   scourged was bound to a low pillar, that, bending over, the blows might
   be better inflicted. The scourge was made of several thongs with a
   handle; the thongs were made rough with bits of iron or bone, for
   tearing the flesh, and thus fitted, it was called a scorpion. See Psalm
   129:3; Isaiah 53:5. It was our sins that made Christ suffer thus. Paul
   was scourged also more than once. See 2 Cor. 11:24.

   It would not be difficult for us to draw from the description of
   ancient eye-witnesses accounts of the scourging inflicted by the
   Romans, which would give us some idea of the shame and torture now
   endured by the Son of man, but perhaps it is better to look beyond the
   purely physical sufferings of our Savior. It is well to keep in mind,
   however, that a more brutal soldiery never existed in the world than
   the Roman. Even the Indian savage is not more unfeeling than was the
   soldier of the Roman legion. The national brutality which could choose
   for its sports the combats of gladiators in the arena, or of prisoners
   with ferocious beasts in the amphitheatre, reached its climax in the
   men whose trade was war. The laws, made in self-preservation, aimed to
   protect Roman citizens, but the prisoner of a subject race might as
   well have appealed for pity to the tiger of an Indian jungle. It is
   true that Pilate had become strangely interested in Jesus. There was
   something about the prisoner that excited his wonder and awe; his
   conscience had probably been stirred as never before, and he had made
   strenuous efforts to appease the Jewish clamor and to release a
   prisoner "in whom he found no fault at all." But while averse to
   decreeing an act of injustice, he had not that stern rectitude that
   would make him willing to sacrifice himself rather than do wrong, and
   he had therefore weakly yielded, after an ineffectual struggle. The
   delivery of Christ to his soldiers for the preliminary scourging, the
   cruel Roman method of preparing a prisoner for execution, would
   therefore be a signal to the ferocious men of war in his palace to
   expend their natural love of brutality on the Lord. Hence, we learn,
   not only that he was subjected to the scourge, but to the additional
   shame of mockery. When he was covered with blood and torn with stripes,
   a most pitiable object to human eyes, in mockery of his kingly claims
   they array him in the robes of royalty, crown him with thorns, and
   while pretending adulation, heap indignity on indignity. Oh, the
   wonders of his love and long-suffering! (Joh 19:2) (Joh 19:3)

   2, 3. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns. The crown of thorns
   was probably a wreath of thorny leaves something like the common
   cactus. While presenting the appearance of a crown it would be an
   instrument of torture. To this emblem of royalty was added a purple, or
   scarlet robe (both colors are named and with the ancients differed
   little), which was thrown around him as a royal mantle. Matthew adds
   that a reed was placed in his hand as a scepter. Then, when they had
   thus arrayed their torn and bleeding victim, the brutal soldiers began
   to mockingly salute him and to cry, "Hail, King of the Jews!" Their
   whole conduct was designed to render his claims of kingly power
   contemptible. In order to make the humiliation greater they would
   approach him, as they saluted him as King, extending their hands as if
   to offer him royal tribute, and then strike him a blow. Whenever I
   think of one that could have called twelve legions of angels to his
   rescue, enduring these things, I am amazed beyond expression. Mark adds
   that they spit on him. In that vast hall were hundreds of ferocious
   soldiers and they would vie with each other in efforts to insult the
   prisoner whom they, in their ignorance, supposed to be a rebel seeking
   royal power. (Joh 19:4) (Joh 19:5)

   4. Pilate went forth again. He went out of his palace to the crowd upon
   the street, preceding Jesus, and again affirming that he found no fault
   with him, although he had scourged him. From Luke 23:16, we learn that
   he had proposed to scourge him and then let him go. He seems now to
   hope that the pitiable condition of the torn and bloody prisoner, as
   well as his humiliation, will appeal to the better feelings of his
   enemies. As Jesus, wearing the painful crown and the mocking robe, is
   led out he exclaims, Behold the man! His own heart is touched. He no
   longer speaks of him as King, but points to him as a human sufferer.
   Pilate, unconsciously, described the sufferer aright. That mocked and
   despised prisoner, with the thorny crown and the streams of blood
   trickling down from his brow, humiliated, beaten and insulted, was THE
   MAN, the one perfect man of the human race, the type of ideal manhood.
   To him all ages point and exclaim, Ecce homo! Behold the man! (Joh
   19:6)

   6. When the chief priests and officers saw him, etc. If Pilate had
   hoped to excite pity he was doomed to disappointment. Even his hard,
   heathen heart could not fathom the depths of Jewish hate. His repeated
   declaration that Jesus was guilty of no crime against Roman law, and
   the appearance on the porch, of the prisoner in so wretched a state,
   only provoked the cry, "Crucify him, crucify him!" This cry was
   evidently tumultuous and threatening. Pilate replies, "Take ye him and
   crucify him, for I find no fault;" not a permission to crucify him, but
   an angry answer: "If you want him crucified do it yourselves; I will
   not, for he has done nothing." This they had no power to do. Pilate's
   reply is both a taunt and an accusation of the priests of a wish to
   crucify an innocent man. (Joh 19:7)

   7. We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, etc. We is emphatic.
   Pilate has decided that Christ is guilty of no crime against Roman law.
   Then they assert that he has merited death by the violation of their
   law. They refer to the law against blasphemy in Lev. 24:16. Let it not
   be forgotten that the Sanhedrim condemned Jesus to death because he
   declared that he was the Son of God, and now when other means had
   failed they make the same charge before the Roman tribunal. Jesus died
   for the "good confession." (Joh 19:8) (Joh 19:9)

   8, 9. When Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid. The
   calmness and majesty of the prisoner had profoundly moved the stern
   Roman. Man had never endured with such patience and kingly dignity. Now
   when he heard the statement that he had said that he was the Son of
   God, he thought at once of all those stories in his heathen mythology,
   of the gods taking human form. What if this marvelous prisoner was the
   son of one the gods? He was alarmed. He retired into the judgment hall
   with Jesus for a fresh examination. He asks, Whence art thou? Art thou
   of earth or of heaven, human or divine? No answer was returned. The
   motive of the question was not to know his claims that he might worship
   him, but to got some knowledge that would relieve his perplexity.
   Christ gave no answer that would tend to save himself. (Joh 19:10)

   10. Knowest thou not . . . that I have power to release thee? Pilate
   was baffled and piqued by Christ's calm silence. To extort an answer he
   boasted of his power and appealed to the motive of fear. He had power
   to crucify or release. The prisoner would do well to seek to please
   him. (Joh 19:11)

   11. Thou couldest have no power against me, etc. Jesus breaks the
   silence and at once assumes the position of Pilate's judge. His
   language shows that Pilate was the poor, powerless victim of his
   environment. He could have no power over himself unless it were given
   him. The divine majesty could blaze forth and smite at once Jew and
   Roman. Christ submitted because it was the Father's will that he should
   drink the cup. Poor, helpless Pilate was not so great a sinner as the
   Jews who might have known better, who were filled with devilish hate,
   who were now forcing Pilate to the crime. The words of Christ are
   really words of compassion. The prisoner to be crucified pities the
   judge that sends him to the cross! (Joh 19:12)

   12. From thenceforth Pilate sought to release him. He continued his
   efforts, which John passes over with the statement. That they were
   persistent is indicated by the threatening reply of the Jews: If thou
   let this man go, thou art not CÃ¦sar's friend. This means that he will
   be accused before CÃ¦sar's tribunal of overlooking treason. The CÃ¦sar
   then on the throne was Tiberius, dark, suspicious, cruel in character.
   Such a charge from the representatives of the Jewish nation at Rome
   would probably prove fatal to Pilate; would certainly end his career as
   a public man. The risk is too great. He would rather sacrifice an
   innocent man than himself. Hence he at once surrenders. The struggle is
   over. (Joh 19:13)

   13. Sat down in the judgment seat. He had sat in the judgment seat
   before and had acquitted Jesus. Now he is brought forth again and
   Pilate takes the judgment seat in order to condemn him. The judgment
   seat was a raised platform, a kind of throne, from whence judicial
   decisions were rendered. John marks the spot where this, the most
   momentous of earthly decisions, was rendered. It was a spot called the
   Pavement, probably a square with mosaic pavement in front of the tower
   of Antonia. Here the seat of judgment was placed. (Joh 19:14)

   14. It was the preparation of the passover, and the sixth hour. John
   marks the exact time when this remarkable judgment was rendered. It was
   about six o'clock in the morning, on Friday, the day of preparation for
   the passover. Mark says that the crucifixion began at the third hour,
   nine o'clock, as the Hebrews began to count at six. John wrote many
   years later, after Jerusalem had fallen, among people who began to
   count at midnight, as did all the Roman world, and he therefore used
   their language and called six o'clock the sixth hour, as we do, rather
   than the first hour as the Hebrews did.

   Another difficulty occurs in the preparation for the passover. Christ
   and his apostles had eaten the passover already. How then could it be
   that that was the preparation day? Amid conflicting views I can only
   give what seems to me the best solution: 1. It is certain that Christ
   ate a meal the evening before in the Upper Room which was called a
   passover. 2. It is certain from John 18:28, that the Jews had not eaten
   the passover at that time. 3. It seems clear to me that Christ, anxious
   to eat this passover (see Luke 22:15), ate it in advance of the usual
   time, in order that he, the true Paschal Lamb, "Our Passover," might be
   offered on the same day that the passover was eaten. The priests
   hurried the trial and execution of Jesus so that they might proceed to
   the preparation for the passover that evening. As the Lord's supper was
   anticipatory of the suffering on the cross, so was the Lord's last
   passover. (Joh 19:15)

   15. Shall I crucify your King? Pilate had yielded. His decision was
   made, but he was full of resentment against the Jews and the words with
   which he presented Jesus, prepared for crucifixion, were designed to
   taunt them. "Behold your King!" When they reply with the cruel shout,
   "Crucify him, crucify him!" he asks with a sneer, "Shall I crucify your
   King?" To this they reply: We have no king but CÃ¦sar. They had not now.
   They had rejected the divine King, had chosen Barabbas instead, for
   life, and now make choice of CÃ¦sar as their king instead of the Lord's
   Anointed. To CÃ¦sar's tender mercies they commit themselves, and in
   about a generation CÃ¦sar will trample them in the wine press of wrath.
   (Joh 19:16)

   16. Then delivered he him . . . to be crucified. He gave to the Jewish
   leaders a guard of Roman soldiers ordered to take charge of the
   prisoner and to execute the sentence. The mob had triumphed, and the
   Roman had been forced to yield. Thus had been fulfilled the declaration
   of the prophet that his condemnation should be extorted (Isaiah 53:8).
   To be crucified. The death to which the Savior was now formally
   sentenced was regarded by the ancients as the most awful form of
   punishment known. Even burning was considered preferable. It was never
   inflicted by the Jews but was common among the Persians, Carthaginians,
   Greeks and Romans. It is spoken of by Cicero as "the most cruel and
   disgraceful of punishments," and was never inflicted upon a Roman
   citizen, though often upon slaves. It was preceded by scourging and the
   condemned was required to carry his own cross, or a part of it at
   least, to the place of execution. The place selected was outside of the
   gates, and on arrival, the sufferer was stripped naked, his clothing
   becoming a perquisite of his executioners, and the cross was so erected
   that his feet would only be one or two feet from the earth. Sometimes
   he was nailed to the cross after it was erected and sometimes before,
   being thrown upon his back upon the ground, and nails driven through
   each extended hand and through the feet. A medicated cup was usually
   given before the nailing out of humanity, in order to stupefy the
   sufferer and render him less sensible to the exquisite pain. This our
   Lord refused to take in order that he might meet his fate with his
   senses all clear. These details are gathered from Smith's Bible
   Dictionary, which adds: "It only remains to speak of the manner of
   death, and the kind of physical suffering endured, which we shall
   briefly abridge from the physician Richter. These are, 1. The unnatural
   position and violent tension of the body, which causes a painful
   sensation on the least motion. 2. The nails being driven through parts
   of the hands and feet which are full of nerves and tendons (and yet at
   a distance from the heart), create the most exquisite anguish. 3. The
   exposure of so many wounds and lacerations brings on inflammation,
   which tends to become gangrene, and every moment increases the
   poignancy of suffering. 4. In the distended parts of the body more
   blood flows through the arteries than can be carried back into the
   veins; hence, too much blood finds its way from the aorta into the head
   and stomach, and the blood vessels of the head become swollen and
   pressed. The general obstruction of the circulation which ensues,
   causes an internal excitement, exertion and anxiety, more intolerable
   than death itself. 5. The inexpressible misery of gradually increasing
   and lingering anguish. To all of which we may add, 6. Burning and
   raging thirst."

   When left to the effect of the cross victims usually lingered about
   three days and have been known to suffer nine, before death ended their
   agonies. Sometimes methods of hastening death were resorted to, in
   mercy, one of which was the breaking of the legs; others were to build
   fires beneath and stifle with smoke, or to turn wild beasts upon the
   victim. The first Christian emperor, Constantine, abolished crucifixion
   as a method of punishment.

Practical Observations.

   1. Think of the love of Him who endured these things from those he came
   to save, and when he had the power to destroy them in a moment if he
   would!

   2. While thou pourest down thy drunken carouses, thou givest thy Savior
   a portion of gall; while thou despisest his poor servants, thou
   spittest in his face; while thou puttest on thy proud dresses, and
   liftest up thy vain heart with high conceits, thou settest a crown of
   thorns on his head; while thou wringest and oppressest his poor
   children, thou whippest him and drawest blood from his hands and
   feet.--Bishop Hall.

   3. They put a reed in his hands as a mock sceptre. Even in the midst of
   the mockery the truth made itself felt. Herod recognizes his innocence
   by a white robe, the Roman soldiery his royalty by the sceptre and
   crown of thorns; and that has become the highest of all crowns.--Cook.

   4. Pilate consented to do a deed of injustice rather than suffer the
   loss of an office and perhaps of his life. Three years later he lost
   the office and was sent into exile. He tried to "save his life and lost
   it." For 1800 years he has been pilloried in the estimation of the
   world. But the prisoner he scourged, suffered to be mocked and
   crucified, has become the King of men, and rules over a world-wide and
   eternal empire. "I came to be a king," said he, and he is King forever.
     __________________________________________________________________

Christ Crucified and Buried.

   17. He went forth bearing his cross. It was customary to make the
   condemned carry the timbers of the cross to the place of execution. The
   cross was laid on Christ, but from weakness, perhaps caused by the
   scourging and abuse to which he had been subjected, he sinks under the
   burden. Simon, a Cyrenian who was met in the way, was then compelled by
   the soldiers to bear the cross. Called the place of a skull . . .
   Golgotha. A Hebrew word, meaning a skull. From its Latin equivalent,
   calvaria, comes our English word Calvary, which occurs in the English
   New Testament only in Luke 23:33, where it should be translated "a
   skull." The significance of the name is uncertain. Some suppose that it
   was the common place of execution, and that the skulls of those who
   were executed lay about; others that it was a bare rounded knoll, in
   form like a skull.--Abbott. It was, (1) apparently a well-known spot;
   (2) outside the gate (compare Heb. 13:12); but (3) near the city (John
   19:20); (4) on a thoroughfare leading into the country (Luke 23:26);
   and (5) contained a "garden" or "orchard" (John 19:41). (Joh 19:18)

   18. Where they crucified him. The cross was an upright pole or beam,
   intersected by a transverse one at right angles, generally in the shape
   of a T. In this case, from the "title" being placed over the head, the
   upright beam probably projected above the horizontal one, as usually
   represented. To this cross, the criminal, being stripped of his
   clothes, was fixed by nails driven through the hands, and not always,
   nor perhaps generally, though certainly not seldom, through the feet,
   separate or united. The body was not supported by the nails, but by a
   piece of wood which passed between the legs. A death by crucifixion
   seems to include all that pain and death can have of the horrible and
   ghastly--dizziness, cramp, thirst, starvation, sleeplessness, traumatic
   fever, tetanus, publicity of shame, long continuance of torment, horror
   of anticipation, mortification of untended wounds--all intensified just
   up to the point at which they can be endured at all, but all stopping
   just short of the point which would give to the sufferer the relief of
   unconsciousness. And two other with him. These two are called "thieves"
   and "malefactors" elsewhere. They may have been zealots who believed in
   a coming Judean kingdom, made their patriotism a cover for robbery and
   murder, and had finally been arrested and condemned. It is a reasonable
   hypothesis that they belonged to the band of which Barabbas was the
   chief. See Mark 15:7. (Joh 19:19)

   19. Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. It was the Roman
   custom to place on the cross over the criminal's head, a placard,
   stating the crime for which he suffered. Luke (23:38) says that the
   title was written in Greek, Latin and Hebrew, the chief languages then
   spoken, and all spectators would be able to read it. The superscription
   is given differently by each evangelist. This is Jesus the King of the
   Jews (Matt. 27:37). The King of the Jews (Mark 15:26). This is the King
   of the Jews (Luke 23:38). Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews (John
   19:19). Although no serious and sensible writer would dream of talking
   about "a discrepancy" here, it is very probable that the differences
   arise from the different forms assumed by the title in the three
   languages. (Joh 19:20)

   20. It was written in Hebrew, and Greek and Latin. The Greek was the
   universal language of literature; the Latin was the language of the
   Roman Empire; the Hebrew was spoken vernacularly by the Jews. The
   rabbins say there are three most powerful languages: The Roman for
   battle, the Greek for conversation, the Hebrew for prayers. (Joh 19:21)
   (Joh 19:22)

   21, 22. Write not, The King of the Jews. This was the crime of which
   our Savior had been guilty they said. Pilate intended that the
   inscription should have a sting in it for the chief priests and elders
   and scribes. He had been frustrated and galled; and he took his revenge
   by flashing the idea before the public mind, that it was a crime, in
   the estimation of at least the chief priests and scribes and elders, to
   seek to have a Jewish king. Pilate's shaft did not miss his mark. The
   chief priests wished him to amend the description thus: "He said, I am
   King of the Jews;" but he silenced them with the answer, "What I have
   written, I have written." Thus the cross proclaimed the Kingship of
   Jesus. (Joh 19:23)

   23. Then the soldiers . . . . took his garments, and made four parts.
   There were four soldiers at the cross and the garments were a
   perquisite of the soldiers. The outer garments were divided into four
   parts, one to each, but the coat, rather the "tunic," an inner garment,
   was seamless, woven in one piece, probably of wool. As it would have
   been spoiled by dividing it, the soldiers decided to cast lots for it,
   thus fulfilling another prophecy (Psalm 22:18). This has given occasion
   to the remark that Christians have, in their party divisions, paid less
   respect to their Master than the heathen soldiers did. (Joh 19:24)

   24. Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it. Romans did not gamble
   with cards, but dice. Gamblers will ply their trade even in the shadow
   of the cross, and in the presence of death. The 22d Psalm, from whence
   a quotation was made, has been universally regarded by Christian
   critics as referring to the Messiah. (Joh 19:25)

   25. There stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, etc. While the
   apostles mostly were afar off, the women were near the cross. Some have
   held that there were only three, "his mother's sister" being "Mary the
   wife of Cleophas," but the best Bible students think otherwise and
   suppose that Salome, the mother of James and John, is the sister meant.
   Matthew names among the women, "Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of
   Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children." The last, Salome, is
   supposed to have been the sister of the mother of Jesus (Matt. 27:56).
   (Joh 19:26) (Joh 19:27)

   26, 27. Woman, behold thy son! Agonizing as the sight was, it was the
   part of a mother to press as near her great suffering son as possible,
   and she, with other saintly women, were near the foot of the cross.
   Jesus, in that awful hour, thought of others rather than himself, and
   looking at John, the nephew of Mary if Salome was her sister, he said
   to his mother, "Behold thy son!" No doubt a widow, and now bereft of
   her son, he commends her to the watch-care of John, an example of
   filial affection most wonderful when we consider the agonies of the
   cross. The original is more graphic than our English Version. The
   Savior's words are: "Woman, look! thy son I" and "Look! thy mother!"
   words brief, ejaculatory, in perfect harmony with his state of mortal
   agony. From that hour, or time, John took Mary to his own home, and
   she, doubtless, remained there till her death. (Joh 19:28)

   28. After this, Jesus . . . . saith, I thirst. All things were now
   accomplished, the end was at hand, and in order that the predictions of
   the, Old Testament Scriptures might be fulfilled by his death, he comes
   to the last moment saying, "I thirst." I hold this to be the meaning,
   as there is no prediction that he should utter these words. (Joh 19:29)

   29. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar. This was the sour wine
   used by the soldiers; not mixed with myrrh, as in the case of the
   stupefying draught Jesus had refused before crucifixion (Mark 15:23).
   The sponge had probably served instead of a cork to the jar in which
   the soldiers had brought the drink that was to refresh them in their
   long day's work. Some one, probably a soldier, heard the cry, "I
   thirst," and, prompted by a rough pity, stretched out a cane or stalk
   of hyssop (John 19:29), with the sponge that had been dipped in the
   wine upon it, and bore it to the parched lips of the Sufferer. It was
   not now refused. (Joh 19:30)

   30. He said, It is finished. This is a cry of triumph. He had won the
   victory and had reached the end of his cruel pathway. It betokens a
   deep sensation of relief, relief from a crushing burden, rest after
   agonizing toil. The work of redemption was wrought. He had said, "I
   have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be
   accomplished!" His baptism of suffering was now over. It is interesting
   to study all the words uttered by Jesus on the cross. By a comparison
   of all the Evangelists this will be found to be his sixth utterance.
   The three Evangelists all dwell upon the loudness of the cry, as if it
   had been the triumphant note of a conqueror. The last words from the
   cross were those recorded in Luke 23:46, "Father, into thy hands," etc.
   This cry of Jesus teaches us that his death does not proceed from the
   decay of his strength, but from the excess of his love; that his life
   is not taken from him by violence, but that he gives it up by his
   power. It is, on the part of the Jews, a Deicide and a sacrilege; but
   on his own it is a holy and voluntary sacrifice. He bowed his head and
   gave up the ghost. "Gave up his spirit" (Revision). The record does not
   say that he died. He, voluntarily, of his own act, surrendered up his
   spirit. He had declared, "I lay down my life to take it up again." He
   died by his own act; he was raised by his own power. If he died by his
   own surrender of his spirit, his death was not due to the effect of the
   cross. The two malefactors outlived him, and were put to death by other
   means in the evening in order that they might not be upon the cross
   upon the passover sabbath (see verses 31-33), but Jesus was already
   dead. The physical cause of Christ's death has been thought by many to
   have been rupture of the heart. (1) Crucifixion was generally a very
   lingering death; the victim lived seldom less than twenty-four hours,
   often three or four days. (2) Usually the victim died of sheer
   exhaustion; but Christ was not exhausted, as he cried with a loud
   voice. (3) John records that blood and water flowed from Christ's side
   when pierced by the spear. This could only occur if the heart had been
   ruptured, and the blood, before death, had flowed out into the cavity
   which surrounds the heart. Christ then literally died of a broken
   heart. This theory draws our hearts away from the mere bodily tortures
   which Christ endured, to the mysterious woe that pressed upon him on
   account of imputed sin. For a full discussion of this question, see
   Hanna's Life of Christ, vol. 3, in which the views of the most eminent
   British physicians are given. Dr. Simpson, whose reputation is world
   wide, declares that the cross could not have caused the death so soon,
   and the thrust of the spear was a rude post mortem examination,
   revealing the blood and water, which could only result from a rupture
   of the heart. For further information on this subject we refer the
   reader to Dr. Stroud's Physical Cause of the Death of Christ, chap.
   iv., and also to McClintock & Strong's Cyclopedia, art. on Crucifixion.
   Gave up the ghost. More correctly, gave up the spirit. The word
   rendered ghost (pneuma) occurs in the New Testament 393 times, is
   applied to the spirit of God 288 times, to evil spirits some 30 times,
   and to the human spirit 40 times, while it is applied to the
   disposition 17 times. "God is a spirit," and he created man in his own
   image, that is, gave him a spirit also. When death occurs the spirit,
   or deathless portion of our being "returns to God who gave it." Stephen
   said: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit;" the Lord said: "Father, into thy
   hands I commit my spirit;" John says of the Lord's death, "He gave up
   the spirit." We have a body, soul and spirit, and Paul, writing to the
   Thessalonians, prays God to preserve "their whole spirit, soul and
   body, blameless unto the coming of the Lord." The body perishes, the
   soul dies, but the spirit departs. The soul (psuchee) is never
   commended by the dying saint to God, but the never-dying spirit
   (pneuma). Nowhere in the divine volume is the spirit said to be
   destroyed, to die or cease to exist. Mortality belongs to the mortal
   portion of our being, but is never predicated of a spirit. The words
   applied here to the Savior's death are those that apply to his death as
   a member of our race. (Joh 19:31)

   31. The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation. Some urge that
   this refers to the preparation for the Sabbath day, but John explains
   the meaning in which he uses the word "preparation," in verse 14, where
   he says distinctly "it was the preparation of the passover." It is true
   that the next day was the Sabbath and "that Sabbath was an high day."
   It was more than an ordinary Sabbath. The annual Sabbath of the
   passover, "the first day of unleavened bread," which was set apart as a
   Sabbath by the law, coincided with the weekly Sabbath, making that
   Sabbath of unusual solemnity. That the bodies should not remain upon
   the cross. It was the Roman custom, as well as that of other Gentile
   lands, to leave the body on the cross to putrefy and be devoured by
   carrion eating birds and beasts, but this was forbidden by the Jewish
   law which, partly as a sanitary measure and partly as a ceremonial
   obligation, required immediate burial (Deut. 21:23). Hence, in Judea,
   out of deference to Jewish prejudices the Romans yielded their custom.
   These Jews, who had no scruples about sending an innocent man to death
   on trumped-up charges, and who resorted to the most unscrupulous
   methods to defeat justice, were such sticklers for these ceremonials
   that they would have considered it an awful profanation of sacred
   things if the body of one whom they had murdered had remained on the
   cross over the Sabbath day! Their legs might be broken. Breaking the
   legs was a barbarous method adopted to hasten death, probably
   instituted as much to add horror as to terminate sufferings. The legs
   were crushed with a hammer somewhat like a sledge, and the shock would
   bring speedy death. The Jewish authorities simply request Pilate that
   he shall order the coup de grace to be administered in order that the
   bodies may be taken down from the cross. (Joh 19:32) (Joh 19:33)

   32, 33. Then came the soldiers. At the orders of Pilate the soldiers,
   beginning with the two outside sufferers, broke their legs in
   succession, but when they came to Jesus, the central figure, they found
   him already dead, and, hence, "broke not his legs." Thus as the paschal
   lambs, slain at that very hour, and eaten that evening, were preserved
   with bones unbroken, so "the Lord our passover" descended from the
   cross, pierced and mangled, but not a bone was broken. (Joh 19:34)

   34. One of the soldiers . . . pierced his side. The object of this
   thrust is apparent. When they came to him to break his bones he was
   lifeless. It occurred to the soldiers that he might have swooned away,
   and to put his death beyond a doubt, he thrust his spear into his left
   side, the side of the heart. There came out blood and water. The blood
   and water that followed the withdrawal of the spear shows that the
   heart was pierced. The soldier, no doubt, aimed at the heart. The
   water, with clots of blood, can only be accounted for naturally by the
   previous rupture of the heart and the flow of blood into the
   pericardium, or outer sac of the heart, where it would be liable to
   separate very rapidly into water and clots of blood. Hence, as already
   stated, the Savior died of a broken heart. (Joh 19:35)

   35. He that saw it bear record. The writer here identifies himself as
   an eye-witness, as one standing near the cross, as in fact, John the
   apostle. The reader cannot but note the emphasis that he places upon
   what he has just recorded concerning the spear thrust and the blood and
   water. Already in the days of John there was prevalent an agnostic
   skeptical theory that Jesus did not really, but only seemed to, die;
   and John proposed to set this matter at rest. What he saw proves the
   death of the Lord beyond a doubt. His testimony equally sets at rest
   the suggestions of modern skepticism that Christ merely fainted from
   exhaustion and was taken down from the cross, and subsequently restored
   by his disciples. There has been much spiritualizing of the blood and
   water by a class of mythical commentators who see in everything a deep,
   mysterious, hidden meaning. The fact that in 1 John 5:8, it is stated
   that three bear witness, the Spirit, the water and the blood, furnishes
   some warrant for allowing a special emphasis upon the blood and the
   water, but not for some of the curious interpretations. If we seek aid
   from the epistle we find that there John declares that Christ came by
   "water and by blood;" that is, his work was inaugurated by his baptism
   and the great tragedy was ended when he shed his blood. Then he adds
   that the three bear witness, the Spirit, the water, and the blood. It
   must be kept in mind that John is citing these as witnesses to Christ,
   and to understand him we must seek how they bear witness. 1. We have
   already ascertained, in the discussion of the Comforter, how the Spirit
   bears witness and to this discussion I refer the reader. 2. Taking up
   the blood, it is also clear how it bears witness. The Lord himself
   appointed an institution, in which a chosen symbol represents his
   blood, and he has said, "As oft as ye do this (use this symbol in the
   appointed way) you do show forth my death." As the passover bore
   witness to the first passover in Egypt, so every celebration of the
   Lord's Supper, a memorial institution appointed at the foot of the
   cross, bears witness to his death, and the "blood of the New Testament,
   shed for many for the remission of sins," to his blood shed on the
   cross. 3. It thus becomes clear that the water must refer to the other
   great positive institution established by our Lord. Every baptismal
   rite bears witness also. The burial in the water is emblematical of the
   Lord's death and burial, and "we are buried by baptism into death,"
   while the uplifting from the watery grave is "in the likeness of his
   resurrection." Hence, the water of the baptismal rite bears witness to
   the Lord's death, burial and resurrection, or to the three great facts
   of the gospel (1 Cor. 15:1-4). If, therefore, John attaches any deep
   meaning to "the water and the blood" it is because they symbolize the
   two great positive institutions established by our Lord, and which are
   two of the "three witnesses" which testify to the vital facts of his
   life, death, burial and resurrection. (Joh 19:36) (Joh 19:37)

   36, 37. For these things were done that the scripture should be
   fulfilled. The prophetic Scriptures alluded to are Exodus 12:46, and
   Zech. 12:10. The paschal lamb, the bones of which were not to be
   broken, was regarded by the Jews, and is spoken of both in the Old and
   New Testaments, as a type of the "Lamb of God that taketh away the sins
   of the world." As the writers of the Gospels were Jews and had in mind,
   to a great extent, while writing, a Jewish class of readers, they pay
   great attention to the fulfillment of prophecy in Christ. We find the
   same thing in the speeches of Peter and Paul to Jewish audiences, of
   which a report is given Acts. Nothing conveyed conviction quicker to a
   Jew than to see that, even in the minutest particulars, Jesus
   corresponded, not only with the predictions of the prophets, but the
   types of the law. (Joh 19:38)

   38. After this Joseph of Arimathea. Joseph of Arimathea is not named
   except in connection with the burial of Christ, and we know nothing of
   him save what is related in that connection. We learn by a comparison
   of statements that he belonged to Arimathea, a place now unknown, that
   he was a member of the Sanhedrim like Nicodemus, both of whom were
   absent or overawed during the trial of Christ, that he was a rich man,
   was a disciple "secretly for fear of the Jews," and in this respect,
   like Nicodemus, and that he had a new sepulcher "wherein no man had
   been laid" near where the Lord was crucified. The death of Christ seems
   to have given new courage to both him and Nicodemus. Coward before, be
   now boldly asks Pilate for the body, and the secret disciples do not
   hesitate to take the body from the cross and to bury it lovingly in the
   new-made, rock-hewn sepulcher. Pilate gave him leave. We learn from
   Mark that Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was so soon dead, and
   that he sent to ascertain whether it was really true. As soon as he
   learned, he gave assent. As the Savior died at 3 o'clock, the burial
   took place between that hour and sunset. (Joh 19:39)

   39. There came also Nicodemus. This is the third mention of Nicodemus,
   the first in 3:1, the second 7:50, where he enters a protest against
   the injustice of the Sanhedrim, and here he come to assist in the
   burial of Christ, bringing along an hundred weight of myrrh and aloes.
   The Sanhedrim had condemned Christ to death, but two Sanhedrists gave
   him a costly burial. Myrrh and aloes. These were fragrant materials,
   and placed, in a pulverized condition, in the linen grave-clothes with
   which the body was wrapped. They not only gave off a pleasant fragrance
   but delayed decomposition. The great quantity used shows that his very
   couch was formed of spices. (Joh 19:40) (Joh 19:41)

   40. As the manner of the Jews is to bury. The Jews did not embalm as
   did the Egyptians, though in the case of King Asa there seems to be a
   hint of it, but it was the custom to wash the body, anoint it, and then
   wrap it in fine linen with spices and ointments enveloped in the folds.
   It is probable that the approach of the Sabbath hurried the preparation
   of the body, and it seems from the return of the women after the
   Sabbath that they did not consider the burial rites fully completed.
   Comparing the four accounts we learn that the body was wrapped in fine
   linen clothes with spices, and laid in a new rock-hewn sepulcher in a
   garden near the place of crucifixion, and that the sepulcher had never
   before been used. It was common in Palestine to cut vaults for the
   burial of the dead in the sides of the rocky cliffs and to close them
   with stones. It is probable that Joseph had built this for the
   sepulcher for himself and family. Thus is fulfilled the prediction of
   Isaiah (chap. 53), that though Christ was "numbered with the
   transgressors," "he was with the rich in his death." (Joh 19:42)

   42. There then because of the Jew's preparation . . . and they laid
   Jesus. This probably is mentioned to explain that the burial was
   hurried and not fully completed, a fact that seems to be indicated in
   the Gospels. How much pathos in the words, "there they laid Jesus!" In
   the tomb of Jesus the Jews supposed his works to be buried forever. In
   it were buried the hopes of his disciples who had "trusted that he
   would restore the kingdom to Israel." In it, had he not risen, would
   have been buried the Gospel, Christian civilization, and the hopes of
   the world. The future of the world was sleeping in his tomb.

Practical Observations.

   1. To the cross the Old Testament pointed. From the cross the New
   Testament histories radiate, and thence comes all the inspiration of
   the Christian life.

   2. At the crucifixion scene, Rome, with her paganism, was represented
   in the executioners; Judaism with its formalities, in the rulers and
   the people whom they swayed; and Christianity with its tender fidelity,
   in the women, who with John, stood by.

   3. The parted garments are an emblem of the Church in its universality,
   to be sent out into the four quarters of the globe; the unparted
   garment is emblematic of the Church in its unity, to be kept whole and
   unparted; the gambling soldiers are an emblem of those who treat the
   unity of the Church of Christ as a matter of indifference.--Wordsworth.

   4. Christ crucified shows (1) the evil of sin; (1) the greatness of our
   danger; (3) the value of salvation; (4) the wonderful love of God; (5)
   it strengthens every motive for being good; (6) it is the culmination
   of our perfect example.

   5. THE ATONEMENT.--We read in the introduction of the Holy Word that
   "he suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust;" "he was crucified
   for us;" "he was made sin for us;" "he made his soul an offering for
   sin;" "he put away sin by the sacrifice of himself by one offering he
   hath perfected forever them that are sanctified;" "he is the
   propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins
   of the whole world;" "he hath reconciled us to God by his blood;" "he
   gave his life a ransom for many;" "he redeemed us to God by his own
   blood;" "his blood was shed for many for the remission of sins;" "he
   hath washed us from our sins in his own blood;" "his blood cleanseth
   from all sins;" "we are justified freely by God's grace through the
   redemption that is in Christ Jesus;" "God was in Christ reconciling the
   world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses;" "Christ
   purchased us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us."
   It is futile to say that all these passages are more or less
   figurative. So is nearly all language. Sir William Hamilton showed that
   most of the apparently literal terms used in logical discussions are
   faded metaphors. There are certain unmistakable thoughts conveyed in
   these sacred texts, and they are that the atonement made by Christ for
   the sins of men is a ransom, a propitiation, a sacrifice.--Joseph Cook.

   6. THE RETRIBUTION OF HISTORY.--And now mark, for one moment, the
   revenges of history. Has not His blood been on them, and on their
   children? Has it not fallen most of all on those most nearly concerned
   in that deep tragedy? Before the dread sacrifice was consummated, Judas
   died in the horrors of a loathsome suicide. Caiaphas was deposed the
   year following. Herod died in infamy and exile. Stripped of his
   Procuratorship very shortly afterwards, on the very charges he had
   tried by a wicked concession to avoid, Pilate, wearied out with
   misfortunes, died in suicide and banishment, leaving behind him an
   execrated name. The house of Annas was destroyed a generation later by
   an infuriated mob, and his son was dragged through the streets, and
   scourged and beaten to his place of murder. Some of those who shared in
   and witnessed the scenes of that day--and thousands of their
   children--also shared in and witnessed the long horrors of that siege
   of Jerusalem which stands unparalleled in history for its unutterable
   fearfulness. "It seems," says Renan, "as though the whole race had
   appointed a rendezvous for extermination." They had shouted, "We have
   no king but CÃ¦sar!" and they had no king but CÃ¦sar; and leaving only
   for a time the fantastic shadow of a local and contemptible loyalty,
   CÃ¦sar after CÃ¦sar outraged, and tyrannized, and pillaged, and oppressed
   them, till at last they rose in wild revolt against the CÃ¦sar whom they
   had claimed, and a CÃ¦sar slaked in the blood of its best defenders the
   red ashes of their burnt and desecrated Temple. They had forced the
   Romans to crucify their Christ, and though they regarded this
   punishment with especial horror, they and their children were
   themselves crucified in myriads by the Romans outside their own walls,
   till room was wanting and wood failed, and the soldiers had to ransack
   a fertile inventiveness of cruelty for fresh methods of inflicting this
   insulting form of death. They had given thirty pieces of silver for
   their Savior's blood, and they were themselves sold in thousands for
   yet smaller sums. They had chosen Bar-Abbas in preference to their
   Messiah, and for them there has been no Messiah more, while a
   murderer's dagger swayed the last counsels of their dying nationality.
   They had accepted the guilt of blood, and the last pages of their
   history were glued together with the rivers of their blood, and that
   blood continued to be shed in wanton cruelties from age to age. They
   who will, may see in incidents like these the mere unmeaning chances of
   History; but there is in History nothing unmeaning to one who regards
   it as the Voice of God speaking among the destinies of men; and whether
   a man sees any significance or not in events like these, he must be
   blind indeed who does not see that when the murder of Christ was
   consummated, the axe was laid at the root of the barren tree of Jewish
   nationality. Since that day Jerusalem and its environs, with their
   "ever-extending miles of grave-stones and ever-lengthening pavement of
   tombs and sepulchres," have become little more than one vast
   cemetery--an Aceldama, a field of blood, a potter's field to bury
   strangers in. Like the mark of Cain upon the forehead of their race,
   the guilt of that blood has seemed to cling to them--as it ever must
   until that same blood effaceth it. For, by God's mercy, that blood was
   shed for them also who made it flow; the voice which they strove to
   quench in death was uplifted in its last prayer for pity on his
   murderers. May that blood be efficacious I may that prayer be
   heard!--Farrar.

The Resurrection.

   At the request of the priests, Pilate sealed the door of the sepulcher
   with the Roman seal and placed a guard of sixteen Roman soldiers over
   it, lest "his disciples should steal away the body." There, upon the
   last seventh day Sabbath of the world, the torn and weary body of the
   Lord lay at rest. The faithful and loving women, who had stood at the
   cross, had followed the body to its resting place, and "Mary Magdalene,
   and Mary the mother of Jesus, beheld where it was laid," having
   observed it before the Roman guard was placed there. After the Sabbath
   was passed, they returned, early on the first day of the week, to
   embalm the body with sweet spices, a tribute not satisfactorily
   attended to amid the confusion of the hurried burial. They found no
   body in the tomb.

   Farrar says with great force and justice: At the moment when Christ
   died, nothing could have seemed more abjectly weak, more pitifully
   hopeless, more absolutely doomed to scorn and extinction and despair,
   than the Church which he had founded. It numbered but a handful of weak
   followers. They were poor, they were ignorant, they were hopeless. They
   could not claim a single synagogue or a single sword. So feeble were
   they, and insignificant, that it would have looked like foolish
   partiality to prophesy for them the limited existence of a Galilean
   sect. How was it that these dull and ignorant men, with their cross of
   wood, triumphed over the deadly fascinations of sensual mythologies,
   conquered kings and their armies, and overcame the world? There is one,
   and one only, possible answer--the resurrection from the dead. All this
   vast revolution was due to the power of Christ's resurrection.

   THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS.--There has been much discussion of the
   time that the Savior's body was in the grave. As he had spoken of it
   being three days and nights in the earth, some have insisted that he
   was crucified on Thursday, buried Thursday evening, and was in the tomb
   Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. If the passover had come that
   year on Thursday evening, there would be no inconsistency between this
   hypothesis and the facts, for Friday would have been an annual Sabbath.
   This view, which has been ably advocated by some learned writers,
   reconciles the four expressions that refer to the time of burial, (1)
   "On the third day," (2) "After three days, (3) "In three days," and (4)
   "After three days and three nights" as follows. It is said that "on the
   third day" may include a period beginning with the first minute of the
   first day and ending with the last minute of the third, embracing in
   all seventy-two hours. "After three days," it is insisted, means the
   same as "three days and three nights," while "in three days" may
   include the last minute of a period of seventy-two hours. It is,
   therefore, held that this is the exact period that the Savior's body
   was in the tomb, extending from the time of burial on Thursday evening
   until the time of resurrection on Sunday, three days and three nights
   being the measure by which we are to settle the duration of the
   indefinite expressions. While all this seems plausible it labors under
   the difficulty that it does not harmonize with the facts. These facts
   should be noted: 1. The Savior was buried on the day he was crucified.
   He was crucified and buried on "the day of preparation," and "the next
   day that followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and
   Pharisees came together unto Pilate" to ask a guard. According to
   Matthew, then, the first day of burial is the day of the crucifixion.
   Mark also says that Christ was buried on the evening of the day of
   preparation. Luke also says that he was buried on the day of
   preparation. John says the same thing. This, then, is the first day, in
   the evening. The Savior is buried near the close of the first, instead
   of the beginning. If it was Thursday, Friday would be the second day,
   Saturday the third, and Sunday, on which all admit that he rose, the
   fourth day. The theory named above would require that the burial take
   place the very beginning of the first and the rising at the very close
   of the third, whereas the very opposite is true. If he was buried on
   Thursday and rose on Sunday, he rose on the fourth day. This view,
   therefore, is to be rejected, and we are to understand the expression
   "three days and three nights," not according to ours, but according to
   the Hebrew idiom. A day and a night was expressed by a single term
   meaning a day-night. Any part of the period was made to stand for the
   whole. The parts of Friday and Sunday that the Savior was in the tomb
   would stand for the Friday and Sunday "day-nights," while the whole of
   Saturday is, of course, included. See 2 Chron. 10:5, 12, where the
   people sent away for three days returned on the third day. Also 1 Sam.
   30:12, 13, where three days is the same period as three days and three
   nights. These two references show that the "third day." "three days"
   and "three nights," according to Hebrew usage, means the same period of
   time.

   1. The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early. The Sabbath
   ended at sunset, so that Jesus had been dead and buried Friday night,
   Saturday, and Sunday morning, beginning at the previous sunset, three
   days according to Jewish reckoning. See 1 Sam. 30:12, 13; 2 Chron.
   10:5, 12. This visit John says was "early, while it was yet dark;" Mark
   says "very early in the morning;" Matthew says "As it began to dawn."
   John names Mary Magdalene as the important one of these women who
   visited the tomb, but does not say she was alone. From the other
   evangelists we learn that Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and
   Salome were with her, and that they came with sweet spices to embalm
   the body of Jesus, expecting to secure aid to remove the stone. The
   fact that they came to embalm the body shows that they were not
   satisfied with the coarser, but loving treatment of Joseph and
   Nicodemus, and that they did not expect a resurrection. To their
   astonishment they found the stone rolled away.

   2. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, etc. The reason that
   John mentions Mary Magdalene alone is shown in this statement. She was
   the one who ran and met Peter and himself. Her sad cry, "They have
   taken the Lord away out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they
   have laid him," shows that others were with her at the sepulcher. Her
   only explanation was that the enemies had taken away the body. While
   Mary had gone to seek the disciples the other women entered the
   sepulcher and saw an angel there. See Matt. 28:6-7.

   3, 4, Peter . . . came to the sepulcher. As soon as Peter and John
   heard the story of Mary Magdalene they at once hurried out of the city
   to the sepulcher. They were intensely excited by the startling story,
   and ran with their utmost speed to the sepulcher. John seems to have
   been the swifter of the two and reached it first. The circumstantial
   details he gives are those of an eye witness.

   5, 6, 7. And he . . . saw the linen clothes lying. Though John reached
   the sepulcher first he was so awed that he did not enter in, but
   through the open door he saw the tomb to be empty, but linen clothes
   that Joseph and Nicodemus had used for burial garments (see John 19:40)
   lying within. Peter, more impulsive and bolder, as soon as he reached
   the tomb, went within and also noted the linen wrappings, carefully
   folded, and even the napkin that was about his head, placed in such a
   way as to show that the tomb had not been rudely robbed.

   8, 9. Then went in that other disciple . . . and he saw and believed.
   When John entered in, saw the careful attention paid to the grave
   clothes, and knew that rude robbers could not have taken the body, it
   flashed upon his mind, for the first time, that the Lord had risen. So
   dull had they all been, according to his confession, notwithstanding
   the clear, Scripture statements and the teachings of the Lord, that
   they had not before understood that he should rise from the dead. This
   is the first gleam of faith in the Lord's resurrection. John was the
   first believer.

   10. The disciples went away again to their own home. Probably to the
   house of John, which there is reason to believe was in Jerusalem. The
   tomb was empty; there was nothing more they could do but simply to
   await the developments that might come.

   11. Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping. She had followed Peter
   and John more slowly, and when all the other disciples departed she
   remained to weep at the place where the Lord had lain. She also stooped
   and gazed through her tears into the sepulcher, but without hope, when
   suddenly she

   12, 13. Seeth two angels, clothed in white. It is not certain that she
   at first knew them to be angels; she was stupefied almost with grief,
   and they had the appearance of men, as did the angel seen by the other
   women whom she had not met since she ran for Peter and John. They asked
   her, Why weepest thou? and her answer shows that the stone rolled away
   from the door of the sepulcher has not been lifted from her heart;
   "Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have
   laid him." To her, still, the broken tabernacle of clay laid in the
   tomb, is her Lord.

   14. She turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing. As she spoke of
   her Lord her Lord was there, though she did not recognize him. Her
   failure to do so was due probably in part to her preoccupation and
   excitement of mind and to the dimness of the light. She saw a man, and
   paid little heed at first to his appearance, though it may be possible
   that her "eyes were holden," as in the case of the disciples on the way
   to Emmaus.

   15. Woman, why weepest thou? The same question is asked, first, by the
   Lord that had been by his angels in the tomb. Mary, still heedless of
   all but her sorrow, without looking, takes it for granted that it is
   the gardener who has charge of the garden in which the sepulchre was
   placed, for who else would be likely to be there so early? She at once
   asks him about the body. As yet her hope is dead.

   16. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. . . . Rabboni. Before she had been
   listless, but when she heard her name in the accents she remembered so
   well, she at once beheld her Lord, and crying out, Rabboni, Master, she
   attempted to throw herself at his feet.

   17. Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. She, in her
   gladness, sought to grasp her Lord about the feet. There has been much
   conjecture as to the reasons underlying the Savior's prohibition. It
   seems to me that the explanation is about as follows: She desired to
   fling herself upon the Lord and retain him, but it was needful that he
   come and go, during the time he showed himself to his disciples, until
   he "ascended to his Father." Then would he come again by the Spirit to
   be with his disciples forever. Had he permitted her embrace he would
   have been compelled, in a moment, to escape from her, but since he has
   ascended to his Father he abides with the saints forever! Though Mary
   is not allowed to embrace him, there is assigned to her a higher
   privilege. She is told to go and tell the glad story to my brethren. He
   is still our Brother. I ascend to my Father. The time of the ascension
   is viewed as present. He has risen; he ascends; another step in his
   exaltation. The Father to whom he ascends is "your Father" also. The
   disciples are brethren of the Lord and children of his Father.

   18. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
   Lord. The women were last at the cross; they followed the body to the
   tomb; they were first to see the open tomb; first to hear the story of
   the resurrection from an angel, and Mary was the first to see the Lord.
   Great is the faith and devotion of the sex; great is the honor with
   which the Lord has crowned the faith and devotion of women.

Proofs of the Resurrection.

   I have been used for many years to study the history of other times,
   and to examine and weigh the evidences of those who have written about
   them; and I know of no one fact in the history of mankind which is
   proved by better and fuller evidence of every sort, to the mind of a
   fair inquirer, than that Christ died, and rose again from the
   dead.--Dr. Arnold.

   I. Proved by the enemies of Christ. (1) It was impossible for these
   enemies to deny that Christ had by some means left the grave. (2) It
   was impossible for them to give any other explanation than that which
   they now invented--that his disciples stole the body. (3) It was
   impossible for this, the only explanation they could give, to be
   credited; for the disciples could not have stolen him if they would.

   II. Proved by the friends of Christ. (1) The apostles had the most
   powerful faith in the fact. They were unanimous in their declaration of
   it a few days after, on the very spot on which it occurred, and that to
   men who were prepared to do anything to conceal the fact. (2) This
   faith came in direct opposition to their previous beliefs and worldly
   interests. They had no expectation and no hope of such resurrection.
   (3) They had every opportunity for thoroughly satisfying themselves on
   the point. (4) By their declaration of the fact they induced thousands
   of the enemies of Christ to believe in it, and that close to the time
   and near the spot on which it occurred. The early Church universally
   believed in it; and it is incredible that a myth, a false story, should
   have So grown up without substantial foundation.--From Thomas' Genius
   of the Gospel. (5) They attested this fact, not only by their lives,
   but by their death. (6) Only the fact of the resurrection can account
   for the marvelous change in the spirit and character of the apostles.
   The resurrection completely transformed them; inspired them with a new
   conception of Christ's, kingdom as for all people, with a new courage
   to suffer for the sake of their risen Lord and his kingdom, and with a
   new purpose to preach Christ and him crucified everywhere as a
   spiritual redemption for sin (Acts 2:39; 5:41; 10:43). Neither fraud
   nor fiction is competent to account for the moral contrast. (7) A
   singular and significant testimony to the truth of the resurrection is
   afforded by the change in the Sabbath day. It was changed, not by any
   express command in the New Testament, but by the almost universal
   consent of the Church, which could not endure to observe as a day of
   joy and gladness that on which Christ lay in the tomb, nor forbear to
   mark as a weekly festival that on which he arose.--Abbott.

Practical Observations.

   1. The most glorious hopes are sometimes born out of the womb of
   darkness.

   2. The stone that was rolled away from the door of the sepulcher has
   been rolled from human hearts.

   3. Those that seek Christ need not fear though they do not find him at
   first, and in the way they expect.

   4. Go to the cross and tomb of Christ and perhaps there will be
   revealed to thee the risen Lord.

   5. THE RESURRECTION.--(1) It demonstrates that Christ is the Son of
   God. If he could not conquer death, and come back from heaven, he could
   prove that at the first he came from heaven. (2) It is the proof of
   immortal life beyond the grave: that death does not end all, but the
   soul lives after the body dies. (3) It is the assurance of our own
   resurrection. (4) It shows that our Savior has power over every one of
   our enemies. (5) It teaches the moral resurrection, that being dead to
   sin we should be alive unto God.

   6. THE DEATH OF CHRIST.--The death of our Lord is the most remarkable
   event of history, far more astounding in the development of the plans
   of God than his coming into the world. Yet it has a fitness that
   demonstrates it to be in harmony with the divine arrangement. Though
   the Jews could not understand, their own law with its sacrifices and
   its types, and their own prophets were pointing forward all through
   their history to the sacrifice of Calvary. Their Scriptures showed
   "that it behooved Christ to suffer and to be raised again from the
   dead." All prophecy points him out as one who came into the world to
   die, the only being who ever came with death as the principle object of
   his coming. Yet "it behooved him to die," 1. To demonstrate the
   exceeding sinfulness of man; 2. The surprising love of God; 3. To
   accomplish human redemption; 4. To bring to light immortality; 5. To
   achieve the victory of the cross. By the cross he conquered.

The Lord Seen by the Apostles.

   After the Savior's first recorded appearance, that to Mary Magdalene,
   he revealed himself at some time during this eventful day, the first
   Lord's day in the history of the world, to Simon Peter, and late in the
   evening appeared to the disciples on the way to Emmaus. These hurried
   back at once to Jerusalem with the glad story, and found the eleven
   gathered, with others, discussing the account told by the women and by
   Peter. They added their testimony, but still there was such skepticism
   of the resurrection that many refused to believe. Then, while the
   company sat at meat, with the doors closed for fear of the Jews,
   suddenly the Lord appeared in their midst, with the salutation, "Peace
   be unto you."

   The following are the recorded appearances of the Savior after his
   crucifixion. There were ten or eleven in all.

   1. To Mary Magdalene alone (Mark 16:9; John 20:11-18), near
   Jerusalem,--Sunday, April 9. 2. To the women returning from the
   sepulchre (Matt. 28:9, 10), near Jerusalem,--Sunday, April 9. I suspect
   this is another version of the appearance to Mary Magdalene. 3. To
   Simon Peter alone (Luke 24:34), near Jerusalem,--Sunday, April 9. 4. To
   the two disciples going to Emmaus (Luke 24:13), etc.,--Sunday, April 9.
   5. To the apostles at Jerusalem, excepting Thomas, who was absent (John
   20:19),--Sunday, April 9. 6. To the apostles at Jerusalem a second
   time, when Thomas was present (John 20:26, 29),--Sunday, April 16. 7.
   At the Sea of Tiberias, when seven disciples were fishing (John 21:1).
   8. To the eleven disciples on a mountain in Galilee (Matt. 28:16). 9.
   To above 500 brethren at once (1 Cor. 15:6), in Galilee, near the time
   of the last. It is possible that these two are identical. 10. To James
   only (1 Cor. 15:7). 11. To all the apostles on Mount Olivet at his
   ascension (Luke 24:51),--Thursday, May 18.

   19. Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week. John
   particularly marks the time of this important event. It is the third or
   fourth appearance of the Savior upon this memorable day, and the first
   one to the apostolic body. By a comparison with (Mark 16:14-16, and
   Luke 24:36, we learn that at the moment of his appearance they were
   discussing the story of the resurrection of which many refused to be
   convinced, so incredulous were they. The doors were shut . . . for fear
   of the Jews. Probably barred as well as shut. It was only natural to
   suppose that the vengeance that had fallen on the Master would also
   visit his followers. He had himself forewarned them of persecution.
   Peter's fear had been shown by his repeated denial of Christ. Came
   Jesus and stood in the midst. They suddenly saw him among them. How he
   came, whether by miracle, or whether his body now had new conditions
   which freed it from material hindrances, it is useless for us to
   discuss, as it is an untaught question. It is enough for us to know and
   accept the fact. Luke states that they were "affrighted," which was
   only natural, and this explains the loving salutation that John
   records, Peace be unto you, the usual salutation of friendship and
   love.

   20. He shewed unto them his hands and his side. The Lord showed his
   wounds to convince them beyond a doubt that it was not a fantasy or an
   apparition, but the crucified one arisen. A week later he shows his
   wounds to Thomas. The resurrected body still bore these proofs of his
   suffering and love. Sixty years later, when John, at Patmos, saw the
   Lion of the Tribe of Judah, he beheld "a Lamb as it had been slain."
   Perhaps our Lord in glory continues to bear the marks of the cross.
   Perhaps these will forever, as we gaze in glory, remind us of the story
   of our redemption. When the apostles beheld these marks they were glad.
   All doubt had passed away. The test was indisputable. The Savior had
   risen indeed.

   21. Peace be unto you: as my father hath sent me, even so send I you.
   Now that they know that he is their Master, he again repeats his
   blessing, and then reminds them of their work upon earth. As he had
   come to the world because the Father sent him, and represented the
   Father, so they, the apostles, are now sent by him and will speak his
   will. They are the executors of the Testament of Jesus Christ, the New
   Testament, that comes into force after the Testator dies, (Heb.
   9:15-17), and are to be sent forth to proclaim its provisions. This is
   the first development of the Great Commission, more fully developed in
   Galilee a little later, and finally completed on Mt. Olivet, just
   before the Lord ascended. The Lord had trained the apostles for three
   years in order to fit them for this important work.

   22. Breathed on them, and said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Breath is
   the symbol of life. God breathes into man the breath of life (Gen.
   2:7), and Christ breathed upon his apostles as a symbol of the
   impartation of the Holy Spirit. I suppose that he imparted a measure of
   the Spirit at this time to guide and strengthen them during this
   preparatory period, but the baptism of the Spirit, "the power from on
   high," was not imparted until the day of Pentecost, after the Lord
   ascended.

   23. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, etc. There
   is hardly a passage in the New Testament that has caused more
   discussion, which is more obscure, unless the proper key to its
   explanation is secured, or which is plainer from the right standpoint.
   It will be seen at once, by a comparison with Matt. 16:19, that the
   keys then promised to Peter are now given to all the apostles, and all
   have similar power to open and shut, to remit sin, and to bind. There
   are three explanations: 1. That of the Romish Church, which holds that
   to Peter as to the "prince of the apostles," and after him, to all the
   priesthood, is given the power to pardon sin. This is the basis of
   their doctrine that the priest can grant absolution to the sinner. 2. A
   kind of confused and uncertain view of Protestants, who deny to the
   priest individually, the power to absolve, but hold that the Church,
   acting through its officials, can remit penalties for sin, free from
   sin, on the one hand, and can anathematize upon the other. 3. The third
   and correct view is plain when we consider, first, the charge that the
   Savior was making, and, secondly, look forward and see how that charge
   was carried out, or, in other words, observe the apostles "remitting
   sins" and retaining them. It is the Great Commission to preach the
   gospel that the Savior gives for the first time in verse 21. It is with
   reference to carrying out that Commission that he speaks in verse 23.
   It was in order that they might present the terms of that Commission
   infallibly to the world that the baptism of the Holy Spirit was
   imparted, of which there is a foreshadowing in verse 22. The great end
   of that Commission was to declare to men "repentance and remission of
   sins" in the name of Christ. The following facts are manifest: 1. The
   Savior gave to his apostles his Commission that they might make known
   his will. 2. He bade them preach "remission of sins." 3. He gave them a
   measure of the Holy Spirit, and bade them wait until "endued with power
   from on high" by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. 4. When the Holy
   Spirit fell they spoke as it "gave them utterance." Acts 2:4. 5. They
   then declared, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, the terms on
   which "sins could be remitted." To anxious sinners they answer, "Repent
   and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
   remission of sins. "Here, then, they, directed by the Holy Spirit,
   "remit" and "retain" sins by declaring the terms on which Christ will
   pardon. Thus, also, they, do in their preaching recorded through the
   Acts of the Apostles, the very thing that the Savior gave them power to
   do. This power was not imparted to a hierarchy, nor to any
   ecclesiastical body, but to the apostles, and was fulfilled by them in
   declaring to the world the conditions of pardon and condemnation under
   the Commission of our Lord.

   24. But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them.
   Didymus, which means the Twin, is the Greek for the Hebrew name,
   Thomas. He was one of the Twelve, of whom history has recorded but
   little. It is reported by tradition that he carried the gospel to India
   and died there. He seems to have been an honest, affectionate man, but
   of a rather skeptical turn of mind. This incident, as well as the
   unbelief of the others prior to the meeting of the Savior with the
   apostles, shows that they were very incredulous, and hard to convince,
   notwithstanding the Lord had said he would rise again. Only "infallible
   proofs" could convince them. The failure of Thomas to be present with
   the other disciples was probably due to his utter despair.

   25. He said unto them . . . . I will not believe. At some time during
   the week they meet him and tell their joyful story, but he meets it
   with skepticism. He will believe no man, not even his eyes; he must
   feel the wounds as well as see them before he will believe. His
   language is not merely skepticism, but defiance. His position was
   nearly that of modern materialists and positivists who hold that no
   testimony will prove such a miracle.

   26. After eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with
   them. It was on the second Sunday after the resurrection; the second
   Lord's day in the history of the world. Let it be noted: 1. On the
   seventh day the Lord was in the tomb and the hearts of his disciples
   buried with him. It was the last Sabbath of the old dispensation. The
   Sabbath institution went out in gloom. Its last memory is of the dead
   Savior and buried hopes. 2. It is on the Lord's day, the first day of
   the week, that he bursts the tomb and brings life and immortality to
   light. 3. On that day occurs the first recorded meeting of the
   disciples of the crucified Lord and he meets with them. 4. During the
   entire following week, including the seventh day, there is silence; no
   appearance of the Savior and no meeting of the disciples. 6. But on the
   next Lord's day, the first day of the week, they meet again, probably
   because he had directed it, and he appears again. 6. When we add that
   the meeting of Pentecost was on the first day also, that there are
   positive evidences in Acts and 1 Corinthians of the custom of the
   churches of meeting on the first day, and not a single account, after
   the resurrection of the Savior, of a church meeting for worship on the
   seventh day, and lastly, that church history shows it to have been the
   unbroken usage of the ancient churches to meet on the first day of the
   week, we may well wonder at the Sabbatarian folly.

   27. Reach hither thy finger. The Lord suddenly appeared in their midst,
   as one week before, and uttered his salutation of peace. Then turning
   to the skeptical Thomas, he asks him to apply the tests that he had
   declared would be necessary before he could believe. His compassion for
   the unbelief of Thomas shows the patient tenderness of the Savior with
   the difficulties of an honest seeker. Christ never wasted words on the
   unsincere.

   28. Thomas answered, . . . My Lord and my God. Thomas did not need to
   apply the test. Every shadow of doubt passed away, and from out of his
   full and astonished heart came forth the ejaculation, which was a
   confession of his faith: It is his Lord, and his divine Savior, God
   manifest in the flesh.

   29. Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. Thomas
   "saw" (he did not need to handle), and believed. We have not seen, but
   nevertheless, believe upon the same Lord. Upon us he pronounces a
   special blessedness, because we walk by faith instead of sight.

   30. Many other signs truly did Jesus. Not near all that occurred,
   either before or after the resurrection, is recorded. Each of the
   evangelists records some features that the others omit and they each
   reveal the fact that they only outline the wonderful story.

   31. But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
   Christ, etc. This is the object of all the gospel histories. They are
   to so reveal Christ as to produce faith in him. He is the one object of
   belief. He is the Christian's creed. Faith in him, a faith that takes
   him as the Christ, saves the soul. All who have such faith wrought by
   the word of God will "have life through his name."

   Here, with these words, John ends the great argument that he entered
   upon with the first chapter and which continues with unbroken
   connection until it reaches its culmination in the remarkable
   declaration of the purpose with which he had written. The chain of
   argument embraces the testimony of Moses and the prophets, the witness
   of John the Baptist, whom the Jews acknowledged as a man of God, the
   wonderful life of Christ, the supernatural wisdom and authority of his
   teaching, his supernatural works, and last and greatest of all, the
   fact of his death, burial and resurrection. The last is the crowning
   argument, and it is after he has established it beyond a doubt, if such
   a wonderful fact can be proven by human testimony, that he closes with
   the declaration, These were written that you might believe that Jesus
   is the Christ the Son of God, etc.

   The resurrection is so vital that, in addition to the condensed
   argument given at the close of the preceding section, I think it
   important, here, where the argument of John reaches its climax, to add
   some additional remarks. First, I will cite the admissions of great
   German scholars of the Rationalistic school, and then add the argument
   given by Dr. Philip Schaff in his history of Apostolic Christianity.

   1. Dr. Baur, of Tubingen, who might well be called the head of the
   celebrated Tubingen school of rationalistic criticism, after the study
   of a lifetime, came at last to the conclusion, stated in revised
   editions of his Church History of the First Three Centuries, published
   shortly before his death, that nothing but the miracle of the
   resurrection could disperse the doubts which threatened to drive faith
   itself into the eternal night of death. While he adds that the nature
   of the resurrection itself lies outside of historical investigation, he
   states that "the faith of the disciples in the resurrection of Jesus
   becomes the most solid and irrefutable certainty. In this faith only,
   Christianity gained a firm foothold of its historical development. . .
   . No psychological analysis can penetrate the inner spiritual process
   by which in the consciousness of the disciples their unbelief at the
   death of Jesus was transformed into a belief of his resurrection. . . .
   We must rest satisfied with this, that for them the resurrection of
   Christ was a fact of their consciousness, and had for them all the
   reality of a historical event." Vol. I, pp. 39, 40.

   2. Dr. Ewald, of Gottingen, while resolving the resurrection into a
   purely spiritual one, through long-continued manifestations from
   heaven, declares, "Nothing is historically more certain than that
   Christ rose from the dead and appeared to his own, and thus, their
   vision was the beginning of new, higher faith and of all their
   Christian labors."--Apostolic Age, p. 69.

   3. Dr. Keim, of Zurich, a pupil of Dr. Baur, in his Life of Christ,
   expresses the conviction that "it was the crucified and living Christ
   who, not as the risen one, but rather as the divinely glorified one,
   gave visions to his disciples and revealed himself to his society." In
   his last work on the great problem which has defied all rationalistic
   explanations, he comes to the conclusion that we must either, with Dr.
   Baur, humbly confess our ignorance, or return to the faith of the
   apostles "who have seen our Lord." See last edition of Life of Christ,
   p. 362. To these might be added other testimonies, but these are enough
   to show the bewilderment and confusion of the rationalistic "higher
   criticism" of Germany. For further treatment of this subject, see Dr.
   Schaff on the Resurrection, in the [13]Appendix.

                                  Chapter XXI.
     __________________________________________________________________

In Galilee.

   This chapter is regarded by all modern critics as an appendix to John's
   Gospel, probably written at a later day than the body of the work. The
   reason for this view is not that its subject matter or style is not in
   harmony with the preceding chapters, but the closing verses of the
   preceding chapter seem to draw the whole to a fitting close. Westcott
   says: "It is impossible to suppose that it was the original design of
   the Evangelist to add the incidents of chapter XXI. after the verses
   which form a solemn close of his record of the great history of the
   conflict of faith and unbelief in the life of Christ. And the general
   scope of the contents of this chapter is distinct from the development
   of the plan that is said to be completed in chapter XX. The
   manifestation of the Lord, which is given in detail in it, is not
   designed to create faith in the fact of his resurrection, but to
   illustrate his action in society; he guides, supports and assigns their
   parts to his disciples.

   "On the other hand it is equally clear that the chapter was written by
   the author of the Gospel. The style and general character of the
   language alike lead to this conclusion; and there is no evidence to
   show that the Gospel was published before the appendix was added to it.
   The reason of the addition is probably to be found in the circulation
   of the saying of the Lord to John in verse 23. The clear exposition of
   this saying carried with it, naturally, a recital of the circumstances
   under which it was spoken." Alford takes the same view, saying: "In
   every part of it his (John's) hand is plain and unmistakable; in every
   part of it his character and spirit are manifested in a way which none
   but the most biased can fail to recognize. I believe it to have been
   added some years, probably, after the completion of the Gospel; partly,
   perhaps, to record the important miracle of the second draught of
   fishes, so full of spiritual instruction, and the interesting account
   of the Lord's sayings to Peter; but principally to meet the error that
   was becoming prevalent concerning himself," referring to the saying
   that he should not die. As these incidents, the Feeding of the Five
   Thousand, the Night Storm on Galilee, and the teaching and incidents of
   Capernaum recorded in chapters IV. and VI., all occurred upon the
   shores or waters of the same sea, I here insert, as a help, a map of
   that celebrated body of water, so sacred as the center of the greater
   part of the Savior's earthly labors.

   ntc3306

   Map of Sea of Galilee
   (Joh 21:1)

   1. After these things Jesus showed himself again to his disciples at
   the sea of Tiberias. For some reason the Savior had desired to gather
   the whole band of his followers on the shores of Galilee, before his
   departure, and had directed (Matt. 28:7; Mark 16:7) them to repair to
   Galilee. There, after his resurrection, he was seen by the Twelve, and
   by about five hundred brethren at once (1 Cor. 15:6). The apostles,
   having arrived at the appointed place, engaged in their old occupation
   of fishing, until they were interrupted by the appearance of the
   Savior. This is not to be regarded as an abandonment of hope or of
   their sacred calling, but rather as a determination to employ
   themselves usefully while they are waiting for the fulfillment of the
   promise of the Lord. We are not told how long "after these things" the
   appearance at the sea of Galilee occurred, and can only be certain that
   it occurred during the last thirty days of the period that preceded the
   ascension. Sea of Tiberias. A name of the sea of Galilee bestowed upon
   it because the capital of Galilee bore that name and was located on the
   margin of the lake. This name does not occur elsewhere in the Gospels.
   In the preceding chapter John has only noted the appearances of the
   Savior at Jerusalem; Luke notes those only; while Matthew mentions both
   those of Galilee and Jerusalem, he only speaks of the appearance to the
   "eleven" in Galilee. John, by the addition of this chapter, makes a
   record of both. Shewed himself. There is a significance in the words,
   "Jesus showed himself," or that he manifested himself after his
   resurrection, showing that he was visible only by a distinct act of his
   own will. From the time of his resurrection the disciples did not see
   him, in the usual sense in which we use that term, but he appeared unto
   them, or was seen of them when he so willed. The language is changed,
   and in language of this kind all his appearances after the resurrection
   are narrated. The same kind of language is applied to his appearances
   that is used of angels and all heavenly manifestations. Men do not see
   them, in the sense that it was a matter that lay in their will to do so
   or not, as we see any material object. Language that is appropriate to
   objects of sense is not appropriate to these manifestations. They
   rather appear to men and are only visible to those for whose sakes the
   appearances are vouchsafed, and to whom they are willing to show
   themselves. The risen Christ, therefore, though seen on many occasions
   by his disciples, and on one occasion by hundreds of them, does not
   reveal himself to his enemies. In his appearances to his disciples he
   leaves no doubt but that he is the risen Lord, yet there is a mystery,
   and an air of strangeness that inspires them with awe, and which
   restrains them from the former familiar fellowship. (Joh 21:2)

   2. There were together. Seven disciples are named, most of whom, and
   probably all, belonged to that very neighborhood. All that are named
   were apostles, unless Nathanael be an exception, who is only named in
   the first, second and last chapters of the Gospel. Most scholars regard
   him an apostle who appears, elsewhere, under the name of Bartholomew.
   The latter name is a patronymic like Barjona, a name applied to Peter,
   and means "the son of Tholmaius." John, one of the "sons Zebedee" was
   among the number. (Joh 21:3)

   3. Simon Peter saith, I go a fishing. Peter here is true to the
   character portrayed in all the Gospels as well as Acts. He is the
   leader. It is upon his proposition and example that the disciples
   resort to the calling once more from which they were taken to become
   "fishers of men." "They went forth" from the house where they were
   stopping, possibly at Capernaum or Bethsaida, entered a "ship," or
   fishing boat, and engaged in the work at night, the most favorable time
   for fishing, but "that night they caught nothing." We may learn from
   the readiness with which the other disciples follow the example of
   Peter the importance of correct leadership. The masses of mankind, in
   politics, in society, in church or family, are constantly moulded by
   the example and influence of leading men. A few lead; the multitude are
   led where these leaders point out the way. (Joh 21:4)

   4. When the morning was now come. The true reading, "When the day was
   breaking," gives a more vivid picture. As the dawn appeared they
   observed some one upon the shore whom they did not yet recognize,
   either because of the indistinct light, or because of his changed
   appearance. It will be noted that in all the appearances after the
   resurrection the Lord came and went suddenly, and was recognized or not
   as he desired. Still it may be that the reason the disciples failed to
   recognize him was their preoccupation of mind and the dim light. (Joh
   21:5)

   5. Children, have ye any meat? The word translated "children" means,
   literally, "boys," and we take it that the Savior asked in the
   familiar, colloquial language of the locality, "Boys, have you caught
   any fish?" There was nothing in his question that made the disciples
   suspect who he was. It would be natural for them to suppose that the
   inquiry was made by one wishing to purchase fish. The word rendered
   "meat" is a general term applied to food of any kind. (Joh 21:6)

   6. Cast the net on the right side of the ship. This direction was
   promptly followed and resulted in the net being so crowded with fishes
   that they could not draw it into the boat. The command, itself, though
   promptly obeyed, did not suggest to the disciples that it was Jesus.
   They might suppose that he had seen some fishes playing on the other
   side of the vessel. The ship must be understood as a small fishing
   boat, propelled by either oars, or a sail, and capable of carrying
   about a dozen men, such as are still seen on the waters of Galilee.
   (Joh 21:7) (Joh 21:8)

   7, 8. That disciple whom Jesus loved, saith, It is the Lord. John, with
   his quickness of perception, as soon as it was seen that the net was
   filled with an astonishing draught of fishes, remembering a former
   miracle of the same kind, exclaimed, It is the Lord! Peter, impulsive
   as usual, when he heard it, at once plunged into the sea in order to
   reach the shore. During the work of the night he had laid off his
   "fisher's coat," a kind of loose blouse, and counting it unseemly to
   appear before the Savior half clad, he put it on. In a moment he was
   standing upon the shore by the Lord. The rest of the disciples, less
   impulsive, came more slowly. It was 200 cubits, 100 yards to the shore,
   and they, as they came in the boat, slowly dragged the net with its
   living load after them. This, Peter seemed to have forgotten, though
   the fish had been caught under Christ's directions. We rather admire
   the course of those disciples who continued faithful to the duty of
   that moment. (Joh 21:9) (Joh 21:10)

   9, 10. They saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon. The
   preparations were already begun for a simple meal. The commentators
   have discussed, idly, the origin of this fire. As we are not told we
   have simply to leave it to conjecture. It might have been miraculous,
   which we prefer to believe, or it might have been built by human hands.
   There were fish already broiling, but still, Christ bids them bring of
   the fish just caught. (Joh 21:11)

   11. Simon Peter . . . drew the net to land. Peter, at once, at the
   Master's command, springs back to duty and draws the net on the shore.
   The number of fish was carefully counted, one hundred and fifty-three
   large ones, and yet the net with such a strain, remained unbroken. (Joh
   21:12) (Joh 21:13)

   12, 13. Durst not ask, Who art thou? The disciples knew that it was the
   Lord, but there was something in his mien, his majesty, his altered
   appearance, that amazed them, filled them with awe, and prevented them
   from asking questions that they were curious to know. How many
   questions occur to us concerning which we would like to know! The Lord
   himself takes the bread and fish and distributes to his disciples. He
   is the host; they are the guests. (Joh 21:14)

   14. The third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples. John
   does not say that this was the third appearance of Jesus, but the third
   time he had showed himself to the disciples, or apostles, for that is
   the sense in which disciples is here, and often used. The first time
   was his appearance to the ten apostles, on the evening of the day of
   the resurrection (John 20:19). The second was to the eleven (Thomas was
   now present) one week later (John 20:26). The third is this appearance
   in Galilee. Besides these, he had appeared to Mary Magdalene (John
   20:16), and to two disciples near Emmaus (Luke 24:13). At this
   appearance he furnishes fire and food to them after a night of
   sleepless toil; an illustration of his tender care of his own. (Joh
   21:15)

   15. Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? At the close
   of the feast the Lord turned to Peter with this question, one that he
   repeated twice, and which has caused much perplexity. I think that it
   is easily explained in view of what had passed only a short time
   before. On the night of the betrayal, when Christ intimated that his
   disciples would forsake him in the trial he was about to suffer, Peter
   spoke up and asserted that though all others forsook him, he would
   never forsake him. What Christ had said might be true of the rest, but
   he was so loving, faithful and true, that he would die for him. Yet
   before the cock crow of the next morning he had thrice denied that he
   knew Jesus, even with oaths. Such was the collapse of the confident
   disciple who "loved the Master better than these" other disciples.
   Since that fall, Christ had met with Peter among the rest of the
   disciples but had not referred to this subject, but now has come the
   time for a restoration of Peter. Hence he probes him with the question,
   Lovest thou me better than these? That question would at once recall to
   Peter his boastful claim, his awful fall, and would pierce him to the
   heart. He no longer claims that he is the truest of the apostolic band,
   does not even affirm confidently, but answers, Thou knowest my heart;
   thou knowest that I love thee. Then said the Savior, Feed my lambs. The
   modesty of Peter's answer is better indicated in the Greek than in our
   version. The word used by the Savior for "lovest" is a very strong
   term; that used by Peter for "I love" is far less strong. After his
   shameful denial he was ashamed to even claim the highest love. Christ
   then, once more, assigns a work to Peter. If he loves him he may feed
   his lambs, take care of the tender disciples of the Lord. The Good
   Shepherd will give him work as an under shepherd. (Joh 21:16)

   16. Feed my sheep. A second time the Lord probes Peter with the
   question. Let it be noted that he does not call him Peter, "the rock,"
   any longer. So frail a disciple could only be called Simon. Again he
   uses the strong term for love (agapao). Again Peter answers as modestly
   as before. He not only cannot claim to love best of all, but can hardly
   claim to love, only "to have affection" (phileo). Then Christ again
   commissions him to work, "Feed my sheep." Not only the lambs, but he
   may look after the sheep of the fold, watch over the disciples of the
   Lord, young and old. (Joh 21:17)

   17. Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. The
   third time the Lord asks the question. Only once had he compared
   Peter's love with "these." The third time the Lord himself drops the
   strong term for love and uses the weaker one, "have affection." Peter,
   pierced to the heart by these repeated questions, throws himself on the
   knowledge the Lord has of his heart. The third time the Lord charges
   him to act as a shepherd under him and to take care of the sheep. Three
   times Peter had denied the Master; three times the Master questions his
   love; three times he gives him charge concerning his work. The
   questioning was painful, Peter was grieved, but the grief was wholesome
   and Peter's whole subsequent life bore proof of the discipline. His
   rashness was forever gone. (Joh 21:18)

   18. When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself. Peter had denied his
   Master to save his own life. Now that he is reinstated in the old
   confidence and charged with the Master's work, he is told that he will
   be called on to die for it. He will be girded, not with a girdle, but
   with bonds, and he shall be led where he would not, unto death. (Joh
   21:19)

   19. By what death he should glorify God. These two verses can only be
   understood as declaring that Peter should die the death of a martyr.
   John wrote after Peter's death, and may be understood as affirming that
   he did thus "glorify God." The universal testimony of the ancient
   Church is that he did thus die. It is asserted that Peter was
   crucified, a fact that is probable, as he was not a Roman citizen.
   Follow me. He had once forsaken Christ through fear of death. Now, with
   a prospect of violent death before him, he is bidden to resume the
   Master's work and to follow him. He did this, from this time,
   faithfully and gloriously, whether threatened by the Jewish Sanhedrim,
   in prison, or dying as a martyr on the cross. He was to follow until he
   tasted the cup that his Master had drunk. It will be noted that at the
   beginning of the Lord's ministry the command "Follow me," had a
   different, though analogous meaning to that which was now attached to
   it. Then it meant primarily to follow the Lord in his ministry,
   abandoning previous occupations, and sharing with him danger and
   disgrace. At the time of the seizure of Christ, Peter had ceased to
   follow and even had denied him. Now, with the certain prospect of death
   in the end, he is bidden to follow in a life of obedience to his will
   which would manifest Christ to the world. The special charge here given
   to Peter is one demanding work, activity for the Lord. It will be
   observed that, while the Lord emphasizes action to Peter, it is waiting
   that is made the special duty of John. Of Peter, Augustine, commenting
   on this passage, says: "This denier and lover of Christ has revealed to
   him this end: puffed up by presumption, prostrated by the denial of the
   Master, purged of his sin by weeping penitence, once more approved by
   humble confession, he is at last crowned by suffering for Christ.

Tarry Till I Come.

   20, 21. Peter, turning about, saw the disciple, etc. Three years before
   on the banks of the same sea, Jesus had called Peter and Andrew, and
   the sons of Zebedee to become fishers of men by the very same words
   that he had now just addressed to Peter. The latter, not unnaturally,
   thinks of his companions, and turning to look at John, asks: "Lord,
   what shall this man do?" It is probable that during the conference,
   Peter had been drawn apart, and that John, so intimate with Peter, and
   who had "leaned his head on the Savior's breast at supper," had drawn
   near to them. By omitting the words in Italics the reader can catch the
   laconic form of the Greek: "Lord, this man, what?" Peter understands
   the prophecy with regard to himself, but what shall become of his
   friend? (Joh 21:22)

   22. If I will that he tarry till I come. Observe (1) that each one must
   work in the place where the Lord wills; "If I will." (2) that as
   Peter's duty was restless activity in following Christ, it is indicated
   that John's work in part at least, is calm, trustful and patient
   waiting; tarry till I come. These words of the Savior here give rise to
   much discussion. It has been held 1. That they have no special
   signification but to rebuke Peter and to assure him that John's future
   was the Lord's business, not his. Such a view is disproved by the deep
   significance that always inheres in the Savior's words. 2. That these
   words refer to a second coming at the destruction of Jerusalem. But all
   the weight of authority is to the end that John wrote his Gospel after
   the fall of Jerusalem; yet his language in the next verse shows that,
   while he pondered the Savior's words, he did not understand their
   meaning. The prophecy was, therefore, yet unfulfilled, as far as he was
   concerned. 3. That the coming referred to was death. That would deprive
   the Savior's words of any significance whatever, as they would be as
   true of every man as of John. 4. That they refer to the promised second
   coming of Christ, and that John did not die a natural death. Even Godet
   suggests that the primitive epoch of humanity had its Enoch; the
   theocratic epoch its Elijah and that the Christian epoch may have had
   its John who was translated without seeing death. In the face of the
   fact that the grave of John was pointed out at Ephesus until the chaos
   of Mahometan invasion swept over the East, such a view is absurd.
   Discarding all these hypotheses as inadequate, I may be allowed to
   express my surprise that the commentators have not perceived that John
   did literally tarry until the Savior came, until he saw him, heard him
   speak, and recorded the last revelation of the Lord to the world. About
   sixty years from the time that Christ spoke these words, according to
   the testimony of the early Church, the aged John was an exile in,
   Patmos. There, upon the Lord's day, he "heard a great voice," and
   turning, he says, "I saw one like the Son of Man" blazing with such
   glory that he fell, "fell at his feet as dead, and then he laid his
   right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not." Then follow the Seven
   Letters to the Church dictated to John by our Lord, and the sublime
   prophecies of Revelation. It is, therefore, a historical fact that John
   did "tarry" on the earth long after the other apostles were wearing
   crowns of martyrdom, and until the Lord came to him visibly to make the
   last inspired revelation of his will to man. This view, which is the
   only one in which the Savior's words and the historical facts are in
   exact harmony, incidently shows that Revelation was not written when
   John penned this chapter. Had that been the case he would not have been
   at loss to understand just what the Savior's words could mean, but
   would have referred at once to the wonderful "coming" he witnessed on
   Patmos. All the testimony of the ancient Church agrees that Revelation
   was the last book of the Bible written, but a class of modern
   expositors, solely in the interest of a preconceived interpretation,
   have dated its composition before the fall of Jerusalem. (Joh 21:23)

   23. This saying went abroad among the brethren. John corrects the
   mistake that had gone abroad. Christ had not said that he should not
   die, but simply, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to
   thee." His language shows that he was uncertain what the Savior might
   mean. The scenes of Patmos finally made all clear. (Joh 21:24)

   24. This is the disciple which testifieth these things. The one named
   just before, concerning whom Peter asked the question. Most of the
   critics hold that this verse and probably the next were added by
   another hand. The plural, "we know," seems to be a kind of attestation
   and the hypothesis is offered that they were added by the Elders of
   Ephesus to whom John committed his gospel. They are found in all the
   manuscripts and, if not written by John, were appended to the original
   copy before it was published. (Joh 21:25)

   25. Also many other things which Jesus did. "Many other things" are
   recorded by the three preceding gospels which John does not record. The
   ministry of Christ was so busy, his teaching so voluminous and his
   deeds of mercy so numerous, that the verse states that it would be
   impossible to make a minute record, and in order to convey this idea
   forcibly an oriental hyperbole is employed.

   I will close this comment by an extract from Godet which treats of the
   authorship of this chapter, as well as the whole gospel. "1. The
   narrative in chapter 21:1-23, is from the hand of John. 2. Verse 24 is
   from the friends of John, who had called forth the composition of this
   gospel, and to whom he committed it after composition. 3. Verse 25 was
   written by one of them, with whom the work was deposited, and who
   thought himself bound to close it thus in honor, not of the author, but
   of the subject of the history. By these last words the entire work
   becomes a whole. Accordingly we are shut up to hold either that John is
   the author of our gospel, or that the author is a forger, who, 1,
   palmed himself off on the world with all the characteristics of the
   Apostle; who, 2, carried his shamelessness so far that he got made out
   for him, by an accomplice in the fraud, a certificate of identity with
   the person of John; or who, more simply still, to save falsehood, made
   out this certificate for himself, in the name of another, or of several
   others. And he who had recourse to such ways was the author of a
   writing in which lying is treated as the work of the devil (8:44) and
   truth glorified as one of the two essential features of the divine
   character. If any one will believe such a story . . . let him believe
   it." (1 Cor. 14:38).

Dr. Philip Schaff on the Resurrection.

   The resurrection of Christ from the dead is reported by the four
   Gospels, taught in the Epistles, believed throughout Christendom, and
   celebrated on every "Lord's Day," as an historical fact, as the
   crowning miracle and divine seal of his whole work, as the foundation
   of the hopes of believers, as the pledge of their own future
   resurrection. It is represented in the New Testament both as an act of
   the Almighty Father who raised his Son from the dead, and as an act of
   Christ himself, who had the power to lay down his life and to take it
   again. The ascension was the proper conclusion of the resurrection: the
   risen life of our Lord, who is "the Resurrection and the Life," could
   not end in another death on earth, but must continue in eternal glory
   in heaven. Hence, St. Paul says, "Christ being raised from the dead
   dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For the death that
   he died he died unto sin once; but the life that he liveth, he liveth
   unto God."

   The Christian church rests on the resurrection of its Founder. Without
   this fact the church could never have been born, or if born, it would
   soon have died a natural death. The miracle of the resurrection and the
   existence of Christianity are so closely connected that they must stand
   or fall together. If Christ was raised from the dead, then all his
   other miracles are sure, and our faith is impregnable; if he was not
   raised, he died in vain, and our faith is vain. It was only his
   resurrection that made his death available for our atonement,
   justification and salvation; without the resurrection, his death would
   be the grave of our hopes; we should be still unredeemed and under the
   power of our sins. A gospel of a dead Savior would be a contradiction
   and wretched delusion. This is the reasoning of St. Paul, and its force
   is irresistible.

   The resurrection of Christ is therefore emphatically a test question
   upon which depends the truth or falsehood of the Christian religion. It
   is either the greatest miracle or the greatest delusion which history
   records.

   Christ had predicted both his crucifixion and his resurrection, but the
   former was a stumbling-block to the disciples, the latter a mystery
   which they could not understand till after the event. They no doubt
   expected that he would soon establish his Messianic kingdom on earth,
   Hence their utter disappointment and downheartedness after the
   crucifixion. The treason of one of their own number, the triumph of
   hierarchy, the fickleness of the people, the death and burial of the
   beloved Master, had in a few hours rudely blasted their Messianic hopes
   and exposed them to the contempt and ridicule of their enemies. For two
   days they were trembling on the brink of despair. But on the third day,
   behold, the same disciples underwent a complete revolution from
   despondency to hope, from timidity to courage, from doubt to faith, and
   began to proclaim the gospel of the resurrection in the face of an
   unbelieving world and at the peril of their lives. This revolution was
   not isolated, but general among them; it was not the result of an easy
   credulity, but brought about in spite of doubt and hesitation; it was
   not superficial and momentary, but radical and lasting; it affected not
   only the apostles, but the whole history of the world. It reached even
   the leader of the persecution, Saul of Tarsus, one of the clearest and
   strongest intellects, and converted him into the most devoted and
   faithful champion of this very gospel to the hour of his martyrdom.

   This is a fact patent to every reader of the closing chapters of the
   Gospels, and is freely admitted even by the most advanced skeptics.

   The question now rises whether this inner revolution in the life of the
   disciples, with its incalculable effect upon the fortunes of mankind,
   can be rationally explained without a corresponding outward revolution
   in the history of Christ; in other words, whether the professed faith
   of the disciples in the risen Christ was true and real, or a
   hypocritical lie, or an honest self-delusion.

   There are four possible theories which have been tried again and again,
   and defended with as much learning and ingenuity as can be summoned to
   their aid. Historical questions are not like mathematical problems. No
   argument in favor of the resurrection will avail with those critics who
   start with the philosophical assumption that miracles are impossible,
   and still less with those who deny not only the resurrection of the
   body, but even the immortality of the soul. But facts are stubborn, and
   if a critical hypothesis can be proven to be psychologically and
   historically impossible and unreasonable, the result is fatal to the
   philosophy which underlies the critical hypothesis. It is not the
   business of the historian to construct a history from preconceived
   notions and to adjust it to his own liking, but to reproduce it from
   the best evidence and to let it speak for itself.

   1. THE HISTORICAL VIEW, presented by the Gospels and believed in the
   Christian church of every denomination and sect. The resurrection of
   Christ was an actual though miraculous event, in harmony with his
   previous history and character, and in fulfilment of his own
   prediction. It was a re-animation of the dead body of Jesus by a return
   of his soul from the spirit-world, and a rising of body and soul from
   the grave to a new life, which, after repeated manifestations to
   believers during a short period of forty days, entered into glory by
   the ascension to heaven. The object of the manifestations was not only
   to convince the apostles personally of the resurrection, but to make
   them witnesses of the resurrection and heralds of salvation to all the
   world.

   Truth compels us to admit that there are serious difficulties in
   harmonizing the accounts of the evangelists, and in forming a
   consistent conception of the nature of Christ's resurrection-body,
   hovering as it were between heaven and earth, and oscillating for forty
   days between a natural and a supernatural state, of a body clothed with
   flesh and blood and bearing the wound-prints, and yet so spiritual as
   to appear and disappear through closed doors and to ascend visibly to
   heaven. But these difficulties are not so great as those which are
   created by a denial of the fact itself. The former can be measurably
   solved, the latter cannot. We do not know all the details and
   circumstances which might enable us to clearly trace the order of
   events, But among all the variations the great central fact of the
   resurrection itself and its principal features "stand out all the more
   sure." The period or forty days in the nature of the case the most
   mysterious in the life of Christ, and transcends all ordinary Christian
   experience. The Christophanies resemble in some respects the
   Theophanies of the Old Testament, which were granted only to few
   believers, yet for the general benefit. At all events the fact of the
   resurrection furnishes the only key for the solution of the
   psychological problem of the sudden, radical and permanent change in
   the mind and conduct of the disciples; it is the necessary link in the
   chain which connects their history before and after that event. Their
   faith in the resurrection was too clear, too strong, too steady, too
   effective to be explained in any other way. They showed the strength
   and boldness of their conviction by soon returning to Jerusalem, the
   post of danger, and founding there, in the very face of the hostile
   Sanhedrim, the mother-church of Christendom.

   2. THE THEORY OF FRAUD. The apostles stole and hid the body of Jesus,
   and deceived the world.

   This infamous lie carries its refutation on its face: for if the Roman
   soldiers who watched the grave at the express request of the priests
   and Pharisees, were asleep, they could not see the thieves, nor would
   they have proclaimed their military crime; if they, or only some of
   them, were awake, they would have prevented the theft. As to the
   disciples, they were too timid and desponding at the time to venture on
   such a daring act, and too honest to cheat the world. And finally a
   self-invented falsehood could not give them the courage and constancy
   of faith for the proclamation of the resurrection at the peril of their
   lives. The whole theory is a wicked absurdity, and insult to the common
   sense and honor to mankind.

   3. THE SWOON THEORY. The physical life of Jesus was not extinct, but
   only exhausted, and was restored by the tender care of his friends and
   disciples, or (as some absurdly add) by his own medical skill; and
   after a brief period he quietly died a natural death.

   Josephus, Valerius Maximus, psychological and medical authorities have
   been searched and appealed to for examples of such apparent
   resurrections from a trance or asphyxy, especially on the third day,
   which is supposed to be a turning-point for life or putrefaction.

   But besides insuperable physical difficulties--as the wounds and loss
   of blood from the very heart pierced by the spear of the Roman
   soldier--this theory utterly fails to account for the moral effect. A
   brief sickly existence of Jesus in need of medical care, and
   terminating in his natural death and final burial, without even the
   glory of martyrdom which attended the crucifixion, far from restoring
   the faith of the apostles, would have only in the end deepened their
   gloom and driven them to utter despair.

   4. THE VN-THEORY. Christ rose merely in the imagination of his friends,
   who mistook a subjective vision or dream for actual reality, and were
   thereby encouraged to proclaim their faith in the resurrection at the
   risk of death. Their wish was father to the belief, their belief was
   father to the fact, and the belief, once started, spread with the power
   of a religious epidemic from person to person and from place to place.
   The Christian society wrought the miracle by its intense love for
   Christ. Accordingly the resurrection does not belong to the history of
   Christ at all, but to the inner life of his disciples. It is merely the
   embodiment of their reviving faith.

   This hypothesis was invented by a heathen adversary in the second
   century and soon buried out of sight, but rose to new life in the
   nineteenth, and spread with epidemical rapidity among skeptical critics
   in Germany, France, Holland and England.

   The advocates of this hypothesis appeal first and chiefly to the vision
   of St. Paul on the way to Damascus, which occurred several years later,
   and is nevertheless put on a level with the former appearances to the
   older apostles (1 Cor. 15:8); next to supposed analogies in the history
   of religious enthusiasm and mysticism, such as the individual visions
   of St. Francis of Assisi, the Maid of Orleans, St. Theresa (who
   believed that she had seen Jesus in person with the eyes of the soul
   more distinctly than she could have seen him with the eyes of the
   body), Swedenborg, even Mohammed, and the collective visions of the
   Montanists in Asia Minor, the Camisards in France, the spectral
   resurrections of the martyred Thomas a Becket of Canterbury and
   Savonarola of Florence in the excited imagination of their admirers,
   and the apparition of the Immaculate Virgin at Lourdes.

   Nobody will deny that the subjective fancies and impressions are often
   mistaken for objective realities. But, with the exception of the case
   of St. Paul which we shall consider in its proper place, and which
   turns out to be, even according to the admission of the leaders of
   skeptical criticism, a powerful argument against the mythical or
   visionary theory--these supposed analogies are entirely irrelevant;
   for, not to speak of other differences, they were isolated and passing
   phenomena which left no mark on history; while the faith in the
   resurrection of Christ has revolutionized the whole world. It must
   therefore be treated on its own merits as an altogether unique case.

   (a) The first insuperable argument against the visionary nature, and in
   favor of the objective reality, of the resurrection is the empty tomb
   of Christ. If he did not rise, his body must either have been removed,
   or remained in the tomb. If removed by the disciples, they were guilty
   of a deliberate falsehood in preaching the resurrection, and then the
   vision-hypothesis gives way to the exploded theory of fraud. If removed
   by the enemies, then these enemies had the best evidence against the
   resurrection, and would not have failed to produce it and thus to
   expose the baselessness of the vision. The same is true, of course, if
   the body had remained in the tomb. The murderers of Christ would
   certainly not have missed such an opportunity to destroy the very
   foundation of the hated sect.

   To escape this difficulty, Strauss removes the origin of the illusion
   away off to Galilee, whither the disciples fled; but this does not help
   the matter, for they returned in a few weeks to Jerusalem, where they
   were all assembled on the day of Pentecost.

   This argument is fatal even to the highest form of the vision
   hypothesis, which admits a spiritual manifestation of Christ from
   heaven, but denies the resurrection of the body.

   (b) If Christ did not really rise, then the words which he spake to
   Mary Magdalene, to the disciples of Emmaus, to doubting Thomas, to
   Peter on the lake of Tiberias, to all the disciples on Mount Olivet,
   were likewise pious fictions. But who can believe that words of such
   dignity and majesty, so befitting the solemn moment of the departure to
   the throne of glory, as the commandment to preach the gospel to every
   creature, to baptize the nations in the name of the Father, the Son,
   and the Holy Spirit, and the promise to be with his disciples always to
   the end of the world--a promise abundantly verified in the daily
   experience of the church--could proceed from dreamy and self-deluded
   enthusiasts or crazy fanatics any more than the Sermon on the Mount or
   the Sacerdotal Prayer! And who, with any spark of historical sense, can
   suppose that Jesus never instituted baptism, which has been performed
   in his name ever since the day of Pentecost, and which, like the
   celebration of the Lords Supper, bears testimony to him every day as
   the sunlight does to the sun!

   (c) If the visions of the resurrection were the product of an excited
   imagination, it is unaccountable that they should suddenly have ceased
   on the fortieth day (Acts 1:15), and not have occurred to any of the
   disciples afterwards, with the single exception of Paul, who expressly
   represents his vision of Christ as "the last." Even on the day of
   Pentecost Christ did not appear to them, but, according to his promise,
   "the other Paraclete" descended upon them; and Stephen, saw Christ in
   heaven, not on earth.

   (d) The chief objection to the vision-hypothesis is its intrinsic
   impossibility. It makes the most exorbitant claim upon our credulity.
   It requires us to believe that many persons, singly and collectively,
   at different times, and in different places, from Jerusalem to
   Damascus, had the same vision and dreamed the same dream; that the
   women at the open sepulcher early in the morning, Peter and John soon
   afterwards, the two disciples journeying to Emmaus on the afternoon of
   the resurrection day, the assembled apostles on the evening in the
   absence of Thomas, and again on the next Lord's day in the presence of
   the skeptical Thomas, seven apostles at the lake of Tiberias, on one
   occasion five hundred brethren at once, most of whom were still alive
   when Paul reported the fact, then James, the brother of the Lord, who
   formerly did not believe in him, again all the apostles on Mount Olivet
   at the ascension, and at last the clear-headed, strong-minded
   persecutor on the way to Damascus--that all these men and women on
   these different occasions vainly imagined they saw and heard the
   self-same Jesus in bodily shape and form; and that they were by this
   baseless vision raised all at once from the deepest gloom in which the
   crucifixion of their Lord had left them, to the boldest faith and
   strongest hope which impelled them to proclaim the gospel of the
   resurrection from Jerusalem to Rome to the end of their lives! And this
   illusion of the early disciples created the greatest revolution not
   only in their own views and conduct, but among Jews and Gentiles and in
   the subsequent history of mankind! This illusion we are expected to
   believe, by the unbelievers, gave birth to the most real and most
   mighty of all facts, the Christian Church which has lasted these
   eighteen hundred years and is now spread all over the civilized world,
   embracing more members than ever and exercising more moral power than
   all the kingdoms and all other religions combined!

   The vision-hypothesis, instead of getting rid of the miracle, only
   shifts it from fact to fiction; it makes an empty delusion more
   powerful than the truth, or turns all history itself at last into a
   delusion. Before we can reason the resurrection of Christ out of
   history we must reason the apostles, and Christianity itself out of
   existence. We must either admit the miracle, or frankly confess that we
   stand here before an inexplicable mystery.--Schaff's History of the
   Christian Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

Some Peculiarities of John's Gospel.

   These have already been partly indicated in what has been said
   concerning its character, in the introduction, but there are a few
   features not yet noticed that can be most appropriately considered in
   an appendix.

   1. John is the only one of the Evangelists who observes the
   chronological order of the events in the ministry of Christ. The
   earlier Gospels have been very appropriately styled "Synoptical," nor
   are they careful in their synopsis to regard the order of events. They
   might be called memoranda, or "Memorabilia" of Christ, while John
   writes a systematic treatise with a definite object in view. Since they
   take no note of time, if we were left to them alone, we could not be
   certain that the Savior's ministry continued for more than a year,
   whereas John gives us data from whence we learn that it continued more
   than three. While he selects events, miracles and discourses, here and
   there, we may always be assured that they occur in the order of time.
   Thus the miracle of the water turned into wine is the "beginning of
   miracles;" the healing of the nobleman's son is the "second miracle
   that Jesus did" in Galilee.

   2. The Synoptical Gospels confine themselves mostly to the Galilean
   ministry of our Lord. If John had never written we would only have
   references that would lead us to wonder, "How often" the Lord "would
   have gathered your children (those of Jerusalem) together, and ye would
   not." But from John we learn of earnest and long continued work in the
   city of Jerusalem and Judea, sojourns of many months at the time, and
   such revelations of himself as left "no cloke for their sin." We trace
   right in Jerusalem, the heart of Judaism, the inception, development
   and culmination of the hatred of Christ, beginning at the first
   passover after the Savior began his ministry, growing with each
   succeeding visit and the accompanying typical miracle, and at last,
   after the resurrection of Lazarus, crystalizing into the official
   resolve of the Sanhedrim to put him to death.

   3. A difference in the style of the Savior's discourses, as reported by
   John and the other Evangelists, has been detected. It can hardly be
   supposed that any of the writers have reported verbatim. If that were
   true there would be no difference in their reports, but we find while
   there is a general agreement of the thought and often of the language,
   it is by no means true that the words are always the same. No believer
   doubts that the Spirit brought all things to remembrance, but not so as
   to make the writers machines. Their memories were strengthened, made
   accurate, and then they related what they remembered in their own words
   and style. While John has preserved to us the thoughts of Jesus, and in
   great part his very words, there can be no doubt but that his record is
   shaped by his own qualities of mind. It would be only natural that the
   style of report should change somewhat with the reporter, even if the
   substance of all the reports should be the same.

   4. There is not a real parable in the whole of the Fourth Gospel, a
   fact partly accounted for by the principle that parables were delivered
   to unbelievers in the hope that thus a seed of truth might be received
   that would afterwards bring forth fruit, while the longest discourses
   of John are to the disciples, to whom Christ did not speak in parables.
   Nor does he give the sermon on the Mount, the Prayer taught the
   disciples, nor an account of the institution of the Lord's Supper, or
   of Christian Baptism, or of the Ascension of our Lord. At the same time
   he presents the spiritual significance of both baptism (chapter III.)
   and of the Supper (chapter VI.); nor does he give a list of the Twelve,
   though he often alludes to them; nor mention the prophecies of the fall
   of Jerusalem, probably because it had fallen before he wrote; nor use
   the word "church," though he alludes to it under other designations.
   These differences, as well as others that might be noted, show that
   John wrote at a later date, and while not aiming to supply a
   supplemental Gospel, was not careful to state facts that could be
   clearly understood from what had been already written by the other
   Evangelists. Nor should we fail to note that he does not give a single
   instance of the Savior casting out demons, a fact easily explained when
   we bear in mind that the miracles narrated were chosen bemuse of their
   bearing on the object before the writer's mind. It has been inferred
   from this by some that John did not believe in demoniac possession,
   although it is plainly recognized by him on several occasions. We might
   just as well draw an argument from the fact that John gives no account
   of the healing of a leper, or of causing the dumb to speak.

   5. Nor will any one study this "Crown of the Gospels" to the best
   purpose who loses sight of the fact that it was written for a specific
   purpose which the author himself has declared. Whatever heresies he may
   have sought to correct his great aim was to create faith that Jesus is
   the Christ, the Son of God (20:31). The proposition that he sought to
   establish had two parts: (1) That he is the Christ of whom the Jewish
   prophets had spoken, and (2) That he is the Son of God, or God manifest
   in the flesh. This proposition is before him from beginning to end, and
   his selections from the words and acts of Christ all look toward the
   establishment of this double proposition. In support of it he arrays,
   (1) The witness of John; (2) The witness of the Jewish Scriptures; (3)
   The witness of seven typical miracles of Christ; (4) The witness of the
   Father; (5) The witness of his own words, words of him "who spake as
   never man spake;" (6) The witness of apostles, himself and others to
   his resurrection from the dead. Then he closes the direct record with
   these words: "Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
   disciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written
   that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and
   that believing you might have life through his name."

Commentaries and Standards on the Birth of Water and Spirit.

   Inasmuch as there is some tendency, in the interest of a modern view of
   baptism, to reject the interpretation that the church, in all ages, has
   placed on John 3:5, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he
   cannot enter into the kingdom of God," I have taken pains to collate
   the views of a large number of authorities upon the meaning to be
   attached to the phrase, "Birth of water." I have quoted, in each
   instance, the words bearing on that feature.

   Except he experience the great inward change of the Spirit, and be
   baptized (wherever baptism can be had) as the outward sign and means of
   it.--Wesley's Notes.

   Governing ourselves by the cardinal canon, that we are to understand
   Christ as Christ expected his auditor to understand him, it cannot be
   difficult to understand this declaration. . . . Nicodemus would then
   have certainly understood by Christ's expression, "born of water," a
   reference to baptism.--Lyman Abbott's Commentary on John.

   Water signifies the baptism of John with Jesus Christ; by omitting this
   baptism, the colleagues of Nicodemus despised the counsel of God.--The
   Critical English Testament.

   John himself declared that his baptism was incomplete,--it was only
   with water. One was coming who should baptize with the Holy Ghost. That
   declaration of his is the key to the understanding of this verse.
   Baptism, complete, with water and the Spirit, is the admission into the
   kingdom of God.--Alford's Greek Testament.

   The preposition used (ek--out of), recalls the phrase
   "baptize,"--plunge--in water, in Spirit . . Hence all interpretations
   which treat the term water as here simply figurative and descriptive of
   the cleansing power of the Spirit are essentially defective, as they
   are opposed to all ancient tradition.--Canon Westcott in the Bible
   Commentary.

   The reference of the expression to baptism (especially according to
   Titus 3:5) certainly is clear.--Olshausen's Commentary.

   The mention of water was intended to assist Nicodemus in understanding
   the phrase, and to indicate its reference to baptism.--Tholuck.

   This regeneration, which our church in so many places ascribes to
   baptism, is more than being admitted into the church. . . . This is
   grounded on the plain words of our Lord in John 3:5. By water, then, as
   a means, the water of baptism, we are regenerated or born again; whence
   it is called by the apostle, the washing of Regeneration.--Doctrinal
   Tracts, M. E. Church Edition of 1825.

   The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it
   is administered; "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he
   cannot enter into the kingdom of God." John 3:5.--Westminster
   Confession of Faith, Art. Baptism.

   Forasmuch as our Savior Christ saith, None can enter into the kingdom
   of God except he be regenerated and born anew of Water and of the Holy
   Ghost; I beseech you to call upon God the Father, through our Lord
   Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous goodness he will grant to these
   persons that which by nature they cannot have; that they may be
   baptized with Water and the Holy Ghost, and received into Christ's Holy
   Church, and be made lively members of the same.--Book of Common Prayer,
   Art. Baptism.

   "John said: I baptize with water; the One coming after baptizes with
   Spirit; but Christ says: The baptism of both is necessary. One must be
   born of water and the Spirit."--International Revision Commentary,
   Edited by Dr. Schaff.

   As really, then, as salvation comprehends two facts, pardon and
   regeneration, so really did Jesus sum in two words, Water and Spirit,
   the whole of salvation, and consequently, man's entrance into the
   kingdom.--Godet.

   Then Jesus to explain his former meaning, answered, Verily, verily, I
   say unto thee, and again repeat it, that unless a man be born of water
   and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, or in plain
   terms, whoever would become a member of it must not only be baptized,
   but as ever he desires to share in its spiritual and eternal blessings,
   he must experience the renewing and sanctifying influences of the Holy
   Spirit on his soul.--Family Expositor by Dr. Philip Doddridge.

   That our Lord here speaks of baptismal regeneration, the whole
   Christian Church from the beginning hath always taught, and that with
   very good reason, for, 1st. Though water is sometimes put to signify or
   represent the purifying operations of the Holy Spirit, yet to be born
   of water is a phrase never used in Scripture for being born of the
   Spirit; but very properly it is used of that baptism which is the laver
   of regeneration and was by all the ancients called paligenesia or
   regeneration. See Titus 3:5.--Commentary on New Testament by Dr. Daniel
   Whitby.
