                               The Godhood of God

   The Godhood of God! What is meant by this expression? Ah, sad it is
   that such a question needs to be asked and answered. And yet it does:
   for a generation has arisen that is well nigh universally ignorant of
   the important truth which this term connotes. That which is popular
   today in the colleges, in the pulpits, and in the press, is the
   dignity, the power, and the attainments of man. But this is only the
   corrupt fruit that has issued from the Evolutionary teachings of fifty
   years ago. When Christian theologians (?) accepted the Darwinian
   hypothesis, which excluded God from the realm of Creation, it was only
   to be expected that more and more God would be banished from the realm
   of human affairs. Thus it has proven. To the twentieth-century mind God
   is little more than an abstraction, an impersonal "First Cause," or if
   a Being at all, One far removed from this world and having little or
   nothing to do with mundane affairs. Man, forsooth, is a "god" unto
   himself. He is a "free agent" and therefore the regulator of his own
   life and the determiner of his own destiny. Such was the Devil's lie at
   the beginning--"Ye shall be as God" (Gen. 3:5). But from human
   speculation and Satanic insinuation we turn to Divine revelation.

   The Godhood of God! What is meant by the expression? This: the
   omnipotency of God, the absolute sovereignty of God. When we speak of
   the Godhood of God we affirm that God is God. We affirm that God is
   something more than an empty title: that God is something more than a
   mere figure-head: that God is something more than a far-distant
   Spectator, looking helplessly on at the suffering which sin has
   wrought. When we speak of the Godhood of God we affirm that He is "King
   of kings and Lord of lords." We affirm that God is something more than
   a disappointed, dis-satisfied, defeated Being, who is filled with
   benevolent desires but lacking in power to carry them out. When we
   speak of the Godhood of God we affirm that He is "the Most High." We
   affirm that God is something more than One who has endowed man with the
   power of choice, and because He has done this is therefore unable to
   compel man to do His bidding. We affirm that God is something more than
   One who has waged a protracted war with the Devil and has been worsted.
   When we speak of the Godhood of God we affirm that He is the Almighty.

   To speak of the Godhood of God then, is to say that God is on the
   Throne, on the Throne as a fact and not as a say so; on a Throne that
   is high above all. To speak of the Godhood of God is to say that the
   Helm is in His hand, and that He is steering according to His own good
   pleasure. To speak of the Godhood of God is to say that He is the
   Potter, that we are the clay, and that out of the clay He shapes one as
   a vessel to honor and another as a vessel to dishonor according to His
   own sovereign rights. To speak of the Divine Despot doing "according to
   His will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth;
   and none can stay His hand, or say unto Him what doest Thou?" (Dan.
   4:35). Therefore, to speak of the Godhood of God is to give the mighty
   Creator His rightful place; it is to recognize His exalted majesty; it
   is to own His universal scepter.

   The Godhood of God stands at the base of Divine revelation: "in the
   beginning God"--in solemn majesty, eternal, un-caused, self-sufficient.
   This is the foundation doctrine, and upon it all other doctrines must
   be built, and any other doctrine which is not built upon it will
   inevitably fail and fall in the day of testing. At the beginning of all
   true theology lies the postulate that God is God--absolute and
   irresistible. It must be so. Without this we face a closed door: with
   it we have a key which unlocks every mystery. This is true of Creation;
   exclude an Almighty God and nothing is left but blind and illogical
   materialism. This is true of Revelation: the Bible is the solitary
   miracle in the realm of literature; exclude God from it and you have a
   miracle and no miracle-Worker to produce it. This is true of Salvation.
   Salvation is "of the Lord," entirely so; exclude God from any aspect or
   part of salvation, and salvation vanishes. This is true of History, for
   history is His story: it is the outworking in time of His eternal
   purpose; exclude God from history and all is meaningless and
   purposeless. The absolute Godhood of God is the only guaranty that in
   the end it shall be fully and finally demonstrated that God is "All in
   all" (1 Cor. 15:28).

   "In the beginning God." This is not only the first word of Holy
   Scripture but it must be the firm axiom of all true philosophy--the
   philosophy of human history, for example. Instead of beginning with man
   and his world and attempting to reason back to God, we must begin with
   God and reason forward to man and his world. It is failure to do this
   which leaves unsolved the "riddle of the universe." Begin with the
   world as it is today and try to reason back to God, and what is the
   result? If you are honest of heart and logical of mind, this--that God
   has little or nothing at all to do with the world. But begin with God
   and reason forward to the world as it is today and much light is cast
   on the problem. Because God is holy, His anger burns against sin.
   Because God is righteous, His judgments fall on those who rebel against
   Him. Because God is faithful, the solemn threatenings of His Word are
   being fulfilled. Because God is omnipotent, no problem can master Him,
   no enemy defeat Him, and no purpose of His can be withstood. It is just
   because God is who He is and what He is that we now behold what we
   do--the gathering clouds of the storm of Divine wrath which will
   shortly burst upon the earth.

   "For of Him, and through Him and to Him, are all things" (Rom. 11:36).
   In the beginning--God. In the center--God. At the end--God. But as soon
   as this is insisted upon men will stand up and tell you what they think
   about God. They will prate about God working consistently with His own
   character, as though a worm of the earth was capable of determining
   what was consistent and what was inconsistent with the Divine
   perfections. People will say with an air of profound wisdom that God
   must deal justly with His creatures, which is true, of course, but who
   is able to define Divine justice, or any other of God'sattributes? The
   truth is that man is utterly incompetent for forming a proper estimate
   of God'scharacter and ways, and it is because of this that God has
   given us a revelation of His mind, and in that revelation He plainly
   declares, "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
   my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
   so are My ways higher then your ways, and My thoughts than your
   thoughts" (Is. 55:8, 9). In view of such a scripture as this it is only
   to be expected that much of the contents of the Bible conflicts with
   the sentiments of the carnal mind which is "enmity against God." And
   further: in view of such a Scripture as the above we need not be
   surprised that much of human history is so perplexing to our
   understandings.

   The natural world, to begin with the simplest, presents sufficient
   problems to humble man, were it not that he was blinded by pride. Why
   should there be diseases and remedies for them? Why poisons and their
   antidotes? Why rats and mice, and cats to kill them? Why not have left
   un-made the evils, and then no necessity for the instruments to remove
   them! Ah, why are we so slow to learn that God'sways are different from
   ours? And when we enter the human realm the mystery deepens. What is
   man placed here for at all? To learn some lesson or lessons or to
   undergo some test or experience which he could not learn or undergo
   elsewhere? If so, then why is such a large proportion of the race
   removed in infancy, before such lessons can be learned and such
   experiences be gained? Why indeed! Such questions as these might be
   multiplied indefinitely, but sufficient has been said to point out the
   manifest limitations of human wisdom. And if we are confronted with
   insolvable problems in the domain of nature and of human existence,
   what of the Divine realm! Who can fathom the ways of the Almighty?
   Canst thou by searching find out God? No indeed. "Clouds and darkness
   are round about Him" (Ps. 97:2). If God were not a mystery He would not
   be God to us.

   But why write in this strain? Surely the need of our day is for that
   which will strengthen faith, not that which paralyzes it. True; but
   what is faith? we mean faith in the abstract. Faith is, essentially, an
   attitude rather than an act: it is that which lies behind the act.
   Faith is an attitude of dependency, of recognized weakness. Faith is a
   coming to the end of ourselves and looking outside of ourselves--away
   from ourselves. Faith is that which gives God His proper place. And if
   we give God His proper place, we must take our proper place, and that
   is in the dust. And what is there that will bring the haughty,
   self-sufficient creature into the dust so quickly as a sight of the
   Godhead of God! Nothing is so humbling to the human heart as a true
   recognition of the absolute sovereignty of God. So then, instead of
   seeking to weaken faith, we write to promote and strengthen it. The
   chief trouble is that so much that passes for faith today is really
   only maudlin sentimentality. The faith of Christendom in this twentieth
   century is mere credulity, and the "god" of many of our churches is not
   the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, but a mere figment of the
   imagination. Modern theology has invented a "god" which the infinite
   mind can understand, whose ways are pleasing to the natural man, a
   "god" who is altogether "such a one as" (Ps. 50:21) those who profess
   to worship him, a "god" concerning whom there is little or no mystery.
   But how different the God which the Holy Scriptures reveal! Of Him it
   is said, His ways are "past finding out" (Rom. 11:33). To
   particularize:

   1. The "god" of the moderns is altogether lacking in power. The popular
   idea of today is that deity is filled with amiable intentions but that
   Satan is preventing the making good of them. It is not God'swill, so we
   are told, that there should be any wars, for wars are something which
   men are unable to reconcile with their ideas of Divine mercy. Hence,
   the conclusion is, that all wars are of the Devil. Plagues and
   earthquakes, famines and tornadoes, are not sent from God, but are
   attributed solely to natural causes. To affirm that the Lord God sent
   the recent Influenza epidemic as a judgment scourge, would be to shock
   the sensibilities of the modern mind. All such things as this are a
   cause of grief to "god" for "he" desires nought but the happiness of
   everybody.

   2. The "god" of the moderns is altogether lacking in wisdom. The
   popular belief is that God loves everybody, and that it is His will
   that every child of Adam should be saved. But if this be true, He is
   strongly lacking in wisdom, for He knows quite well that under existing
   conditions the majority will be lost. If He is really desirous that
   every creature should have an equal chance to be saved, then why suffer
   so many to be born into families (of criminal parents, for example) and
   be brought up under conditions where they will never hear the
   Gospel--and there are many thousands such in this country. If it should
   be said in reply God has not created these criminal conditions, the
   point is readily ceded, but nevertheless God is responsible for sending
   children into them, for the fruit of the womb is solely in His hands.
   Why not produce sterility among criminals, if it is contrary to His
   will for children to be born into such conditions, conditions which
   frequently preclude all reading of the Scriptures and all hearing the
   Gospel.

   3. The "god" of the moderns is lacking in holiness. That crime deserves
   punishment is still allowed in part, though more and more the belief is
   gaining ground that the criminal is really an object of pity rather
   than censure, and that he stands in need of education and reformation
   rather than of punishment. But that SIN--sins of thought as well as
   deed, sins of the heart as well as life, sins of omission as well as
   commission, the sinful root itself as well as the fruit--should be
   hated by God, that His body nature burns against it, is a concept that
   has gone almost entirely out of fashion; and that the sinner himself is
   hated by God is indignantly denied even among those who boast most
   loudly of their orthodoxy.

   4. The "god" of the moderns is altogether lacking in a sovereign
   prerogative. Whatever rights the deity of present-day Christendom may
   be supposed to possess in theory, in fact they must be subordinated to
   the "rights" of the creature. It is denied, almost universally, that
   the rights of the Creator over His creatures is that of the Potter over
   the clay. When it is affirmed that God has the right to make one as a
   vessel unto honor, and another as a vessel unto dishonor, the cry of
   injustice is instantly raised. When it is affirmed that salvation is a
   gift and that this gift is bestowed on whom God pleases, it is said He
   is partial and unfair. If God has any gifts to impart, He must
   distribute them evenly, or else bestow them on those that merit them,
   whoever they may be. And thus God is allowed less freedom than I, who
   may disburse my charity as I best please, giving to one beggar a
   quarter, to another a dime, and to a third nothing at all if I think
   well.

   How different is the God of the Bible from the "god" of the moderns!!
   The God of Scripture is all-mighty. He is one who speaks and it is
   done, who commands and it stands fast. He is the One with whom "all
   things are possible" and "who worketh all things after the counsel of
   His own will" (Eph. 1:11). He is the One "who hath measured the waters
   in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and
   comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the
   mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance" (Is. 40:12). He is the
   One with whom "the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
   as the small dust of the balance," with Whom "all nations before Him
   are as nothing and they are counted to Him less than nothing, and
   vanity" (Is. 40:15, 17). He is One that "sitteth upon the circle of the
   earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that spreadeth
   them out as a tent to dwell in; that bringeth the princes to nothing;
   He maketh the judges of the earth as vanity" (Is. 40:22, 23). He is the
   One who declares, "Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, and He that
   formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things; that
   stretched forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by
   Myself. That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners
   mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge
   foolish. That confirmeth the word of His servant, and performeth the
   counsel of His messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be
   inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will
   raise up the decayed places thereof. That saith to the deep, Be dry,
   and I will dry up thy rivers: That saith of Cyrus (a heathen idolater)
   he is My shepherd, and shall perform all My pleasure" (Is. 44:24-28).
   Such is the God of the Bible, the God who throws out the challenge, "To
   whom then will ye liken God, or what likeness will ye compare unto
   Him?" (Is. 40:18). And as though that were not enough, in the same
   chapter He asks again, "To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be
   equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high and behold who
   hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He
   calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is
   strong in power, not one faileth...Hast thou not known? has thou not
   heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of
   the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?" (Is. 40:25, 26, 28).

   The God of Scripture is infinite in wisdom. No secret can be hidden
   from Him, no problem can baffle Him, nothing is too hard for Him. God
   is omniscient--"Great is our Lord, and of great power: His
   understanding is infinite" (Ps. 147:5). Therefore is it said, "There is
   no searching of His understanding" (Is. 40:28). Hence it is, that in a
   revelation from Him we expect to find truths which transcend the reach
   of the creature'smind, and therefore the presumptuous folly and
   wickedness of those who are but "dust and ashes" undertaking to
   pronounce upon the reasonableness or unreasonableness of doctrines
   which are above their reason, and of speculating upon things that are a
   matter of pure revelation. Instead of coming to the Scriptures to be
   taught thereof, men first fill their minds with objections, and then
   instead of interpreting the Divine Oracles according to their obvious
   meaning, they submit and twist them according to the dictates of their
   own finite reason. Surely if we are unable to comprehend the mode of
   God'sexistence, because it is infinitely above us, then for the same
   reason we are unable to comprehend the counsels of infinite wisdom.
   Such is the explicit assertion of Holy Writ itself--"The natural man
   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness
   unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
   discerned" (1 Cor. 2:14).

   The God of Scripture is infinite in Holiness. The "only true God" is He
   who hates sin with a perfect abhorrence and whose nature eternally
   burns against it. He is the One who beheld the wickedness of the
   antediluvians and who opened the windows of Heaven and poured down the
   flood of His righteous indignation. He is the One who rained fire and
   brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah and utterly destroyed these cities of
   the plain. He is the One who sent the plagues upon Egypt, and destroyed
   her haughty monarch together with his hosts at the Red Sea. He is the
   One who caused the earth to open its mouth and swallow alive Korah and
   his rebellious company. Yes, He is the One who "spared not His own Son"
   when He was "made sin for us...that we might be made the righteousness
   of God in Him." So holy is God and such is the antagonism of His nature
   against evil, that for one sin He banished our first parents from Eden;
   for one sin He cursed the posterity of Ham; for one sin He turned
   Lot'swife into a pillar of salt; for one sin He sent out fire and
   devoured the sons of Aaron; for one sin Moses died in the wilderness;
   for one sin Achan and his family were all stoned to death; for one sin
   the servant of Elisha was smitten with leprosy. Behold therefore, not
   only the goodness, but also "the severity of God" (Rom. 11:22). And
   this is the God that every Christ-rejector has yet to meet in judgment!

   The God of Scripture has a will that is irresistible. Man talks and
   boasts of his will, but God also has a will! Men had a will on the
   plains of Shinar and undertook to build a tower whose top should reach
   unto heaven; but what came of it? God had a will, too, and their
   willful effort came to naught. Pharaoh had a will when he hardened his
   heart and refused to allow Jehovah'speople to go into the wilderness
   and there worship Him, but what came of it? God had a will, too, and
   being Almighty His will was performed. Balak had a will when he hired
   Balaam to come and curse the Hebrews; but of what avail was it? The
   Canaanites had a will when they determined to prevent Israel occupying
   the promised land; but how far did they succeed? Saul had a will when
   he hurled his javelin at David, but instead of slaying the
   Lord'sanointed, it entered the wall instead. Jonah had a will when he
   refused to go and preach to the Ninevites; but what came of it?
   Nebuchadnezzar had a will when he thought to destroy the three Hebrews;
   but God had a will too, and so the fire did not harm them. Herod had a
   will when he purposed to slay the Child Jesus, and had there been no
   living and reigning God, his evil desires had been effected; but in
   daring to pit his puny will against the irresistible will of the
   Almighty, his efforts came to naught. Yes, my reader, and you had a
   will when you formed your plans without first seeking counsel of the
   Lord, and therefore did He overthrow them. As well might a worm seek to
   resist the tread of an elephant; as well might a babe step between the
   railroad tracks and attempt to push back the express train; as well
   might a child seek to prevent the ocean from rolling, as for a creature
   to try and resist the outworking of the purpose of the Lord God--"O
   Lord God of our fathers, art not Thou God in heaven? and rulest not
   Thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in Thine hand is there
   not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?" (2 Chron.
   20:6).

   The God of Scripture is absolute Sovereign. Such is His own claim:
   "This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is
   the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. For the Lord of
   hosts hast purposed, and who shall disannul it? and His hand is
   stretched out, and who shall turn it back?" (Is. 14:26, 27). The
   Sovereignty of God is absolute and irresistible: "All the inhabitants
   of the earth are reputed as nothing: and He doeth according to His will
   in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none
   can stay His hand, or say unto Him, What doest Thou?" (Dan. 4:35). The
   Sovereignty of God is true not only hypothetically, but in fact. That
   is to say, God exercises His sovereignty, exercises it both in the
   natural realm, and in the spiritual. One is born black, another white.
   One is born in wealth, another in poverty. One is born with a healthy
   body, another sickly and crippled. One is cut off in childhood, another
   lives to old age. One is endowed with five talents, another with but
   one. And in all these cases it is God the Creator who maketh one to
   differ from another, and "none can stay His hand." So also is it in the
   spiritual realm. One is born in a pious home and is brought up in the
   fear and abomination of the Lord; another is born of criminal parents
   and is reared in vice. One is the object of many prayers, the other is
   not prayed for at all. One hears the Gospel from early childhood,
   another never hears it. One sits under a Scriptural ministry, another
   hears nothing but error and heresy. Of those who do hear the Gospel,
   one has his heart opened by the Lord to receive the truth, while
   another is left to himself. One is "ordained to eternal life" (Acts
   13:48), while another is "ordained to condemnation" (Jude 4). To whom
   He will God shows mercy, and whom he wills He "hardens" (Rom. 9:18).
     __________________________________________________________________

               1. The Absolute Godhood of God is Seen in Creation

   With whom took He counsel in creation? Whom did He consult when He
   determined the various and manifold arrangements, adjustments,
   adaptations, relationships, equipments of His myriad creatures? Did He
   not do everything after the counsel of His own will? Did He not decide
   that birds should fly in the air, beasts roam the earth, and fishes
   live in the sea? Did He not decide there should be one vast gradation
   among the creatures of His hand, instead of making everything equal and
   uniform? Did He not determine to make a revolving world on the one
   hand, and a floating atom on the other? Did He not determine to create
   the exalted seraphim to stand before His throne throughout endless
   ages, and also to make another creature which dies the same hour it is
   born? Was He not undisputed Sovereign in all His creative acts? Yea,
   verily, for the Three Persons of the Godhead were all alone in their
   solitary majesty. Why should God take counsel? Could man add to His
   knowledge, or correct His errors? God sovereignly assigned His myriad
   creatures their various habitations, members, movements, as it pleased
   Him. God never consulted man about a single member of His body, or
   about its size, color, or capacity; instead, "God set the members
   everyone of them in the body, as it hath pleased Him" (1 Cor. 12:18).
   Man is as truly the product of Sovereign creation as any other of
   God'screatures--sovereign, we say, not arbitrary.
     __________________________________________________________________

            2. The Absolute Godhood of God is Seen in Administration

   God not only created everything, but everything which He created is
   subject to His immediate control. God rules over the works of His
   hands. God governs the creatures He has made. God reigns with universal
   dominion. When He pleased, the sun and moon stood still (Josh. 10:12,
   13); and at a word from Him the sun went backward ten degrees on the
   dial of Ahaz (Is. 38:8). At His command the Red Sea ceased to flow, and
   at His command it resumed its normal course (Ex. 14). In response to
   the prayer of Elisha, He made iron to float on the top of the water (2
   Kings 6:5). Yes, when He pleases, He reverses the order of nature, as
   when the fires of Nebuchadnezzar'sfurnace burnt not, as when the hungry
   lions touched not Daniel, as when the ravens, which are birds of prey,
   were made to minister of Elijah. At a word from Him who made it, a fish
   carried a coin to Peter, a tree withers suddenly (Matt. 21:4), the
   raging tempest becomes a calm.

   So it is also with men; they, too, are ruled by God; ruled by and
   unseen Hand; often, unknown to themselves. Little did they know it, yet
   nevertheless, the sons of Jacob were but performing the pleasure of
   Jehovah when they sold Joseph into the hands of the Ishmaelites who
   carried him down into Egypt. Little was she aware of it, but when
   Pharaoh'sdaughter went to the Nile to bathe, she was being directed by
   God, directed there to rescue from the waters the babe Moses. Little
   did he know it, but in issuing the decree that all the world should be
   taxed (Luke 2:1) Caesar Augustus was but setting in motion a movement
   which caused the word and decree of God to be fulfilled. Yes, even "The
   King's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: He
   turneth it whithersoever He will" (Pro. 21:1). And so it is with Satan
   himself. He, too, is the (unwitting and unwilling) servant of God. He
   could not touch Job without first gaining Divine permission. He could
   not sift the apostles till he gained consent from Christ. At a word
   from the Lord Jesus Satan "left" Him (Matt. 4:10, 11). Of him, also,
   God has said, Thus far shalt thou go and no farther.

   Even death, the "king of terrors," that which no arts of man can defy,
   is absolutely subject to the bidding of the Lord. In his sermon on Ps.
   68:20, 21--"unto God the Lord belong the issues from death"--the late
   C. H. Spurgeon well said, "The prerogative of life or death belongs to
   God in a wide range of senses. First of all as to natural life, we are
   all dependent upon His good pleasure. We shall not die until the time
   which He appoints: for our death-time, like all our time, is in His
   hands. Our skirts may brush away the portals of the sepulchre, and yet
   we shall pass the iron gate unharmed if the Lord be our guard. The
   wolves of disease will hurt us in vain until God shall permit them to
   overtake us. The most desperate enemies may waylay us, but no bullet
   shall find its billet in any heart unless the Lord allows it. Our life
   does not even depend upon the care of angels, nor can our death be
   compassed by the malice of devils. We are immortal till our work is
   done, immortal till the immortal King shall call us home to the land
   where we shall be immortal in a still higher sense. When we are most
   sick, we need not despair of recovery, since the issues from death are
   in Almighty hands. The Lord killeth and maketh alive: He bringeth down
   to the grave and bringeth up!' When we have passed beyond the skill of
   the physician we have not passed beyond the succour of our God, to whom
   belong the issues from death."

       3. The Absolute Godhood of God is Seen in Giving of the Scriptures

   What part or lot did man have in the composition of the Bible? None
   whatever. Its very words are the words of God. "All Scripture is given
   by inspiration of God." No part of it was of human origination, "for
   the prophecy came not at any time by the will of man" (2 Pet. 1:21).
   Did not holy men of God speak "moved by the Holy Spirit?" And how did
   they then record what the Holy Spirit communicated to them--in words of
   man'sselecting? Nay verily, "not in the words which man'swisdom
   teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth" (1 Cor. 2:13). Balaam
   longed to speak otherwise than he did; but he could not. Caiaphas
   prophesied "not of himself" (John 11:51). Pilate was asked to make a
   change in the one sentence which God moved him to write, but he
   declared "What I have written I have written" (John 19:22). God acted
   sovereignly in the writing of the Scriptures as in everything else. The
   very words were chosen by Him; and did He not sovereignly choose? Did
   He take counsel with either angels or men as to the words He should
   select for the communicating of His thoughts? No indeed.

              4. The Absolute Godhood of God is Seen in Salvation

   God'sabsolute and irresistible proprietorship has been and is being
   displayed in the spiritual realm as manifestly as in the natural. Isaac
   is blessed, but Ishmael is cursed. Jacob is loved, but Esau is hated.
   Israel becomes God'sfavored people, while all other nations are
   suffered to remain in idolatry. Jesse'sseven sons were all passed by,
   and David the shepherd-boy was found to be the one after God'sown
   heart. The Saviour took on Him the "seed of Abraham" (Heb. 2:16), not
   the seed of Adam. His ministry was not worldward, but confined to the
   people chosen of God. The proud Pharisees were rejected, while
   publicans and harlots were sweetly compelled by sovereign grace to sit
   down at the Gospel feast. The rich young ruler, who from his youth up,
   had kept the commandments, was allowed to go away from Christ
   "sorrowing," even though he had sought Him with real earnestness and
   humility, while the fallen Samaritan woman (John 4) who sought Him not
   is made to rejoice in the forgiveness of her sins. Two thieves hung by
   Christ on the cross; they were equally guilty, equally needy, equally
   near to Him. One of them is moved to cry: "Lord, remember me" and is
   taken to Paradise, while the other is suffered to die in his sins and
   sink down into a hopeless eternity. Many are called, but few are
   chosen.

   Yes, Salvation is God'ssovereign work. "God does not save a man because
   he is a sinner, for if so He must save all men, for all are sinners.
   Nor because he comes to Christ, for no man can come except the Father
   draw him;' nor because he repents, for God gives repentance unto life;'
   nor because he believes, for no one can believe except it were given
   him from above;' nor yet because he holds out faithful to the end, for
   we are kept by the power of God.' It is not because of baptism, for
   many are saved without it, and many are lost with it. It is not because
   of regeneration, for that would make the new birth a practical duty. It
   is not because of morality, for the moralist is the hardeth to reach,
   and many of the most immoral are saved--the ground of distinguishing
   grace is the Sovereignty of God: Even so Father, for so it seemed good
   in Thy sight'" (J. B. Moody).

   But is God partial? We answer, Has He not a right to be? Again we quote
   from Mr. Spurgeon'ssermon "The Royal Prerogative" -"Spiritually, too,
   this prerogative is with God. We are by nature under the condemnation
   of the law on account of our sins, and we are like criminals tried,
   convicted, sentenced, and left for death. It is for God, as the great
   Judge, to see the sentence executed, or to issue a free pardon,
   according as He pleases; and He will have us know that it is upon His
   supreme pleasure that this matter depends. Over the head of a universe
   of sinners, I hear this sentence thundering. I will have mercy on whom
   I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
   compassion.' Shut up for death, as men are by reason of their sins, it
   rests with God to pardon whom He may reserve: none have any claim to
   His favour, and it must be exercised upon mere prerogative, because He
   is the Lord God, merciful and gracious, and delighteth to pass by
   transgression and sin." How far away have the present-day admirers of
   Spurgeon departed from the teaching of this prince of preachers: Mark
   carefully the next sentences: "Our text, however, puts the prerogative
   upon the one sole ground of Lordship, and we prefer to come back to
   that. Unto God the Lord belong the issues from death.' It is a doctrine
   which is very unpalatable in these days (it always has been.--A.W.P.),
   but one nevertheless which is to be held and taught, that God is an
   absolute Sovereign, and doeth as He wills. The words of Paul may not be
   suffered to sleep,--Nay, but O man, who art thou that repliest against
   God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it, why hast Thou
   made me thus?' The Lord cannot do amiss, His perfect nature is a law
   unto itself. In his case Rex is Lex, the King is the Law."

   Is God partial? Certainly He is. And has He not the right to be? Shall
   He not dispense His favours as He wills, and bestow His gifts on whom
   He pleases? But it is reasonable to suppose that God who is Love has
   created millions of creatures to be lost? seeing that His elect
   constitute but a "remnant." a "few," in comparison with the great
   multitudes who die unsaved? We reply, it is not a question of reason
   but of revelation. There are many things revealed in Scripture which
   are contrary to reason. Is it reasonable to think that God would give
   His only begotten Son to die for sinners? Ah, reason is ruled out
   entirely here. And so in many other things. If it lay within the power
   of the reader, would you suffer your worst enemy to be eternally
   tormented? And if you are honest, you will promptly answer, No! But God
   will deal thus with His enemies, and the sentence will be a righteous
   one, whether we can now discern its justice or not, for the Judge of
   all the earth will do right. How far asunder then is carnal reasoning
   from the teaching of Holy Writ concerning Eternal Punishment! Once
   more: would the reader "laugh at" and "mock" his worst enemy if that
   enemy was being severely punished before him and was entirely helpless
   to deliver himself from that punishment? Yet Scripture explicitly
   declares that God will "laugh" at the calamity of His enemies and
   "mock" when their fear cometh (see Ps. 2:4; Prov. 1:26). Can your
   reason harmonize this with your knowledge of God? And again we say, If
   you are honest you must reply, No! Then why prate so loudly and
   blatantly about the unreasonableness of Reprobation and of
   God'sabsolute Sovereignty in salvation? Once more: here is Satan, the
   age-long enemy of God and many, the one who has wrought incalculable
   evil, securely imprisoned at last in the bottomless pit. There he
   remains chained for a thousand years. Now would you, my reader, suggest
   for a moment that the Devil be released from that prison after the
   earth had been freed for a thousand years from his vile presence?
   Certainly you would not, and yet this is precisely what Divine
   revelation declares shall come to pass. The Scriptures of Truth make
   known how that God will cause the Serpent to be "loosed" for a little
   season, that God will suffer this even though He knows beforehand that
   the consequences will be the most dreadful revolt on the part of men,
   under Satan, revolt against God, which this earth has ever witnessed.
   Truly God'sways are different, very different from ours. Learn then the
   utter folly of man attempting to pronounce upon the reasonableness or
   unreasonableness of the doings and dealings of the Most High God. And
   now a few words by way of exhortation and we must conclude.

   One of the most flagrant sins of this age is irreverence. By
   irreverence I am not now thinking of open blasphemy, or the taking of
   God'sname in vain. Irreverence is, also, failure to ascribe the glory
   which is due the great and dreadful majesty of the Almighty. It is the
   limiting of His power and actions by our degrading conceptions: it is
   the bringing of the Lord God down to our level. There are multitudes of
   those who do not profess to be Christians who deny that God is the
   omnipotent Creator, and there are multitudes of professing Christians
   who deny that God is absolute Sovereign. Men boast of their free will,
   prate of their power, and are proud of their achievements. They know
   not that their lives are at the sovereign disposal of the Divine
   Despot. They know not that they have no more power to thwart His secret
   counsel than a worm has to resist the tread of an elephant. They know
   not that God is the Potter, and they the clay.

   Ah, my reader, this is the first great lesson we have to learn: that
   God is the Creator, we the creature; that He is the Potter, we the
   clay. This is the harvest of all life'slessons, and when we think we
   have learnt them, we soon discover that we have need to re-learn them.
   God is God and has the right to dispose of me as He sees fit. It is for
   Him to say where I shall live--whether in America or Africa. It is for
   Him to say under what circumstances I shall live--whether amid riches
   or poverty, whether in health or in sickness. It is for Him to say how
   long I shall live--whether I shall be cut down in youth, like the
   flower of the field, or whether I shall live unto old age. Yes, and it
   is for Him to say where I shall spend eternity.

   The first sin of man was the refusal to be clay in the Potter'shand;
   Adam wanted to be something more--"Ye shall be as God's was the bait
   which the Tempter used to hurl him to his destruction.

   One of the profoundest mysteries of the Incarnation is that "the mighty
   God" descended from highest heaven and took upon Him the nature of the
   creature and came down here to show us how to wear it. That which
   differentiated the Life of Christ from all other lives, was His
   absolute and joyous submission to the Father'swill--"My meat is to do
   the will of Him that sent Me" struck the keynote of the thirty-three
   years that He tabernacled among men. Have you profited by the example
   left us by the Beloved of the Father? Has Divine grace shown you how to
   wear your creature nature? Only if you live not in self-assertion, but
   in self-renunciation. Only if in the school of Christ you have been
   taught to say, "Not my will, but Thine be done." O may Divine grace so
   subdue our rebellious hearts that more and more we can say:


   "I bow me to Thy will, O God,

      And all Thy ways adore!

   And every day I live I'd seek

      To please Thee more and more.


   Thy will, the good, the blessed rule

      Of Jesus' toil and tears:

   Thy will the passion of His heart

      Those three and thirty years.


   I love to kiss each print where Christ

      Did set His pilgrim feet:

   Nor can I fear that blessed path,

      Whose traces are so sweet.


   When obstacles and trials seem

      Like prison walls to be,

   I do the little I can do,

      And leave the rest to Thee.


   I know not what it is to doubt,

      My heart is ever gay;

   I run no risk, for, come what will,

      Thou always hast Thy way."
