FOREWORD

   In the chapel of Trinity College, Glasgow, there is a stained glass
   window honoring the life and labors of Dr. James Denney. Beside the
   window on a plaque is inscribed, in part, the following:

   James Denney, D. D. (1856-1917)
   Supreme alike as scholar,
   teacher, administrator,
   and man of God,
   to whom many owed their souls.

   In paying tribute to Dr. Denney, Professor A. M. Hunter of Christ's
   College, Aberdeen, said,

   "To scholarship of the first rank [Denney] brought a burning conviction
   of the truth and adequacy of the Gospel, and he would have no truck
   with those who, desiring to be in tune with the Zeitgeist, would have
   watered it down. In all his writing about the Christian faith he sought
   to be Biblical, real, whole, and clear, and he often declared that he
   had not the faintest interest in a theology which he could not preach."

   Dr. Hunter goes on to point out that James Denney could write on all
   the chief doctrines of the Christian religion (though he evidenced a
   weakness when it came to eschatology) "but it was the Atonement which
   was the center of his thinking." The cross, Dr. Denney believed was
   "the hiding place of God's power and the inspiration of all Christian
   praise."

   Dr. Denney, however, died in 1917 and there are few today who know
   anything about him. A brief resume of his life, therefore, is in order.

   Born in Paisley, Scotland, James Denney was reared a "Cameronian" or
   strict Reformed Presbyterian. His father was a deacon in the church,
   and all the fervor of Presbeterianism's long fight for freedom flowed
   through his veins. It is not surprising that, when further disruptions
   rocked the denomination, John Denney and his family withdrew and, with
   a large group of loyal independents, joined the Free Church of
   Scotland. Such zeal and commitment to what was believed to be the truth
   were passed on to his son James.

   Following his graduation from the local academy, James Denney enrolled
   in the University of Glasgow (1874) where he distinguished himself in
   both classical literature and philosophy. He graduated with honors and
   a Master of Arts degree in 1879 and immediately entered the Free Church
   College, Glasgow, where he had the good fortune to study under Robert
   S. Candlish, A. B. Bruce, and T. M. Lindsay. In 1883 he graduated with
   a Bachelor of Divinity degree.

   Denney's only pastorate was at Broughty Ferry (1886-1897), where he
   took his young bride, the former Mary Brown. Their life together was
   one of happy companionship, and when she died in 1907 without bearing
   any children, James Denney found nothing to replace his keen sense of
   loss.

   Mary Denney contributed much to her husband's ministry. He was inclined
   to be authoritarian, and under her kindly encouragement he became more
   compassionate. In addition, James Denney was disposed by his training
   to be theologically "liberal," and through her tender influence he
   became more evangelical. In fact, it was due to her recommendations
   that he began reading the writings of Charles Haddon Spurgeon, and the
   evangelical fervor of this British Baptist preacher radically changed
   the young Scot's ministry. One biographer records Denney saying,
   "Though it is my business to teach, the one thing I covet is to be able
   to do the work of an evangelist, and that at all events is the work
   that needs to be done."

   With stress upon expository preaching characterizing his ministry at
   Broughty Ferry, Denney was invited to contribute two commentaries to
   The Expositor's Bible: "The Epistle to the Thessalonians" (1892) and
   "The Second Epistle to the Corinthians" (1894).

   In 1894, James Denney was invited to deliver a series of lectures in
   theology at the Chicago Theological Seminary. Two things are
   significant about this invitation. First, Denney was a pastor with a
   pastor's heart, yet his abilities had brought him to the attention of
   those in need of a lecturer in theology; and second, the invitation
   extended to James Denney gives evidence of his influence beyond the
   borders of his native Scotland.

   Before leaving for the United States, the University of Glasgow honored
   Denney with a Doctor of Divinity degree.

   Of Dr. Denney's lectures at Chicago (later published under the title
   Studies in Theology) Dr. Hunter, writing in 1962, had this to say:

   Though forty years have passed since he died, Denney's work has not
   lost its relevance or its force. His writing has dated very little. In
   [him] you will find what you do not always find in our modern
   theologians -- what is in fact one of the first virtues of great
   theological writing -- perfect lucidity of thought and expression.

   In honor of his lectureship, the Chicago Theological Seminary conferred
   on James Denney a further Doctor of Divinity degree.

   On his return to Scotland, Denney was soon called upon to succeed Dr.
   Robert S. Candlish as Professor of Systematic and Practical Theology in
   the Free Church College. Two years later, on the passing of Dr. A. B.
   Bruce, he was appointed to the chair of New Testament Language
   Literature, and Theology. Later, in 1915, he was invited to become
   principal of the college, succeeding Dr. T. M. Lindsay. His premature
   death brought his illustrious career to an untimely end.

   While Professor Denney was at home expounding the text of a given book
   of the Bible, and was also a capable exegete (in 1900 he contributed a
   work on "The Epistle to the Romans" to The Expositor's Greek
   Testament), his greatest contribution was made as a theologian. In this
   respect, his Death of Christ (1902) may be regarded as his magnum opus.

   Dr. Denney laid great stress upon Christ's physical sufferings. He
   emphasized the substitutionary nature of His sacrifice and expounded
   its effects to the believer with evangelical zeal. Such was his
   aversion to the teachings of certain mystics on the subject of the
   Atonement that he avoided all identification with mystical belief. In
   spite of this, his work on the death of Christ remains one of the most
   definitive discussions produced to date.

   When James Denney died, Dr. H. R. Mcintosh of Edinburgh was invited to
   pen a tribute to him. Here is part of what he wrote for The Expository
   Times (1917). His article is entitled "Principal James Denney as a
   Theologian."

   At the time of his death [he] was at the summit of his power [and] in
   his passing evangelical religion throughout English-speaking lands has
   suffered a loss greater, we may say with sober truth, than would have
   been inflicted by the withdrawal of any other mind.

   James Denney deserves to be remembered. His books are his finest
   memorial. It is hoped that pastors as well as seminarians will purchase
   and read this excellent treatise, here produced in its unabridged
   format. Those who do so will find their lives and ministries stimulated
   and enriched by what this great man of God has to impart.

PREFACE

   THE first edition of The Death of Christ appeared in 1902. It contained
   the first six of the nine chapters in this book, and its purpose was to
   explain, in the light of modern historical study, the place held by the
   death of Christ in the New Testament, and the interpretation put upon
   it by the apostolic writers.

   In its motive, the work was as much evangelical as theological.
   Assuming that the New Testament presents us with what must be in some
   sense the norm of Christianity, the writer was convinced that the death
   of Christ has not in the common Christian mind the place to which its
   centrality in the New Testament entitles it. It gets less than its due
   both in ordinary preaching and in ordinary theology. It is not too much
   to say that there are many indications of aversion to the New Testament
   presentation of it, and that there are large numbers of people, and
   even of preachers, whose chief embarrassment in handling the New
   Testament is that they cannot adjust their minds to its pronouncements
   on this subject. They are under a constant temptation to evade or to
   distort what was evidently of critical importance to the first
   witnesses to the gospel. It was with this in mind that the writer
   conducted his study of the subject, and while claiming to be impartial
   and scientific in his treatment of New Testament documents and ideas,
   he nowhere affected an insensibility he did not feel. He was and
   remains convinced that the New Testament presents us with a view of
   Christ's death which is consistent with itself, true to the whole being
   and relations of God and man as these have been affected by sin, and
   vital to Christian religion; and that on the discovery and appreciation
   of this -- or if we prefer it so, on the rediscovery and fresh
   appreciation of it -- the future and the power of Christianity depend.
   Without it we can have no renewal of Christian life and no large or
   deep restoration of Christian thought. It is quite true that there is a
   difference between religion and theology, and it may be argued (as the
   writer himself has argued elsewhere) that it is possible to have the
   same religion as the apostles without having the same theology; but the
   distinction is not absolute. In a religion which has at its heart a
   historical fact, it is impossible that the meaning of the fact should
   be a matter of indifference, and the whole question at issue here is
   the meaning of the fact that Christ died. The chapters in which the New
   Testament interpretation is examined have been carefully revised, but
   not essentially modified. A few sentences and paragraphs have been
   canceled and a few inserted, but in substance the work is what it was
   before.

   The Death of Christ, when published, was reviewed from various
   standpoints, and in particular it led to a considerable correspondence
   both with acquaintances and strangers which made still clearer to the
   writer the mental attitude and atmosphere to which the New Testament
   message has to be addressed. It was with this in view that the last
   three chapters were written. Originally delivered as lectures to a
   Summer School of Theology in Aberdeen, they appeared in The Expositor
   in the course of 1903, and were subsequently published under the title
   of The Atonement and the Modern Mind. No one could be more sensible
   than the writer of the disproportion between this title and what it
   covered; it could only be justified because, such as it was, the book
   was a real attempt, guided mainly by the correspondence referred to, to
   help the mind in which we all have and move to reach a sympathetic
   comprehension of the central truth in the Christian religion. As a
   rule, names are not mentioned in these chapters, but where opinions are
   stated or objections given within inverted commas, they are opinions
   and objections which have really been expressed, and they are given in
   the words of their authors, whether in print or manuscript. There are
   no men of straw among them, constructed by the writer merely to be
   demolished.

   The close connection of The Atonement and the Modern Mind with The
   Death of Christ makes them virtually one work, and it seemed desirable,
   for various reasons, that they should appear together. The present
   volume contains both. The title of the earlier has been retained for
   the two in combination, and the publishers have made it possible, by
   resetting the whole in a slightly different form, to issue the two at
   the original price of the first.

   The character and purpose of the book have not been affected by
   revision. It is not a complete dogmatic study of the subject, but it
   contributes something to the preliminaries of such a study. It is
   governed as much by interest in preaching as by interest in theology,
   and the writer still hopes that it may do something to make evangelists
   theologians and theologians evangelists.

   The full table of contents will enable the reader to dispense with an
   index.

DETAILED CONTENTS

    INTRODUCTION

   Conception of the New Testament, its unity not artificial, Misused
   distinctions, historical and dogmatic, biblical and systematic,
   material and formal, The death of Christ a real subject in the New
   Testament.

    OUTLINE OF STUDY

  Chapter 1

    The Synoptic Gospels

   The mind of Christ and the mind of the evangelists, The idea that Our
   Lord's death must have been foreign to His mind when He entered on His
   work, Relation to this idea of the narratives of His Baptism and
   Temptation, Significance of the Baptism in particular, The first
   suggestions of our Lord's death and allusions to it, The taking away of
   the Bridegroom (Mark 2:19), and the sign of Jonah (Matthew 12:40), The
   express predictions of the Passion: critical questions connected with
   them, (Mark 8:31, Mark 3:81, Mark 10:32, and parallels) -- their
   historicity, Sense in which Christ's death was necessary:

   (a) Inevitable?

   (b) Indispensable?

   Relation of these two conceptions in the mind of Jesus, Bearing of Old
   Testament Scripture on this point, What the unintelligence of the
   disciples meant,

   The Ransom saying:

   Its historical context, Its interpretation -- (a) Hellmann's view
   criticized, (b) Wendt's

   Clue to the meaning --(a) In other words of Jesus, (b) In passages of
   the Old Testament,

   The meaning of Kopher the equivalent of lutron, The Lord's Supper:
   Views of Spitta and Hellmann criticized, The idea of covenant-blood:
   relation of sacrifice in general to propitiation, Exodus 24 and
   Jeremiah 21. In relation to the words of Jesus, The idea that the
   remission of sins' in Matthew 26:28 is put into a relation to Christ's
   death which is inconsistent with His teaching as a whole, Propitiation,
   a mode of mediation.

  Chapter 2

    The Earliest Christian Preaching

   Results of last chapter in relation to our Lord's experience in
   Gethsemane and on the Cross -- not refuted but illustrated, Original
   attitude of the disciples to the words of Jesus, The Resurrection: the
   intercourse of the Risen Christ with the disciples according to the New
   Testament -- critical problems,

   The great commission: Matthew 28: 18 ff., Mark 16: 15 f., Luke 24:47 f.
   and John 20: 21 f.. Refers either

   (a) to Baptism or

   (b) to Forgiveness.

   In the New Testament these are inter-related and related to the death
   of Jesus, Importance of this for the unity of the New Testament.

   The opening chapters of Acts:

   Critical problems again, Primitive character of the Christology,
   Prominence of the Resurrection -- why? Refutation of the idea that the
   death of the Messiah is only an offense which the Resurrection enables
   the disciples to overcome, How the earliest Christian preaching made
   the death of Christ intelligible, Its connection

   (1) with a divine purpose, (2) with the prophecy of the Servant of the
   Lord, (3) with the forgiveness of sins, The Sacraments in Acts, and
   their significance in this connection.

   The First Epistle of St. Peter:

   Its Pauline' features, A witness' to the sufferings of Christ, The
   important passages: (1) The salutation, 1:1 f. -- the sprinkling of the
   blood of Jesus Christ -- relation to Exodus 24, (2) Redeemed from a
   vain conversation,' 1:18 f. -- originality of this idea -- what it
   leaves unexplained, (3) Who Himself bore our sins,' 2:20 ff. --
   mingling of prophecy and testimony -- Christ's sufferings exemplary,
   yet more -- what it is to bear sin -- sin-bearing and substitution --
   the purpose of Christ in bearing our sins, (4) Who died for sins once,
   the just for the unjust' -- aim of this: to conduct us to God Imitation
   of Christ conditioned by the consciousness of redemption, The Second
   Epistle ascribed to Peter.

  Chapter 3

    The Epistles of St. Paul

   Preliminary considerations affecting the estimate of St. Paul's whole
   treatment of this subject:

   (1) The assurance with which he preaches a gospel in which Christ's
   death is fundamental -- his intolerance,'

   (2) The relation of his doctrine to the common Christian tradition,

   (3) Alleged development in his teaching, and inferences from such
   development

   (4) Experimental' and apologetic' elements in it -- testimony' and
   theology' -- fact' and theory': these distinctions criticized,

   (5) Connection in St. Paul's mind of Christ's death and resurrection.

   Relations in which St. Paul defines Christ's death: (1) To the love of
   God (2) To the love of Christ (3) To the sons of men. Connection of sin
   and death as He conceived it -- death must be interpreted through the
   conscience -- Menegoz on an alleged incoherence of the apostle.

   The witness of the epistles on these points:

   1 Thessalonians 5:10, Who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we
   should live together with Him.

   1 Corinthians -- general references -- the word of the Cross' -- bought
   with a price' -- the passages on the Sacraments in ch. 10 and ch. 11.
   -- extreme importance of these -- Christ our Passover.

   2 Corinthians -- the sufferings of Christ' and the dying of Jesus' in
   ch. 1 and ch. 4, The locus classicus in 5:14 ff. -- professedly
   contains a theory: Christ died our death. Meaning of katallage
   (Reconciliation) in St. Paul -- Christ's finished work -- necessity for
   evangelizing that there should be such a work, Christ made sin for us:
   meaning and purpose of this, Religious and ethical theological and
   psychological, expressions of the same idea: how they support each
   other,

   Galatians -- exclusively occupied with this subject -- Christianity
   asserted as the sum of the effects produced by Christ's death, and by
   that alone, Rationale of this as St. Paul's experience: how Christ's
   death is conceived and preached so as to have the power which produces
   such effects, Conception of Christ under the law': what it means, The
   law (a) as expressing God's will for men, (b) as expressing God's
   judgment on men. The last is necessary to explain Galatians 3:13, and
   to make it intelligible that Christ's death is a demonstration of love
   to the sinful,

   Evasions of this argument (1) Only the ceremonial laws in question in
   Galatians, (2) Only the Jews are in question, (3) Curse is only
   equivalent to Cross, The ethical passages in Galatians 5:24 and 6:14.

   Romans -- the Righteousness of God demonstrated at the Cross, 3:21 ff.,
   The Righteousness of God includes: (1) the fact that He is Himself
   righteous, (2) that He justifies (or holds as righteous) him who
   believes in Jesus.

   Jesus Christ set forth in propitiatory power in His blood is the
   demonstration of this righteousness in both its elements

   Attempts to obliterate the distinction: (1) Those which do not see the
   problem with which the apostle is dealing, (2) Those which profess to
   find the key to St. Paul in 2 Isaiah and the Psalms -- Ritschl's idea
   that the righteousness of God always has its correlate in the
   righteousness of His people, (3) Seeberg's view, that God to be
   righteous is bound to provide for fellowship between Himself and men,
   and is pleased to do it in this way,

   To understand St. Paul, we must discern Law and Necessity in the
   relation of Christ's death to sin, Manner in which St. Paul deduces all
   Christianity from Christ set forth in His blood as a propitiation,

   Criticism of the current idea that he has two doctrines of
   reconciliation, a juridical' and an ethico-mystical' one: views of
   Weiss, Ritschl, Holtzmann,

   True relation of Romans 6 to Romans 3, Faith in Christ Who died
   includes in it a death: (1) to sin, (2) to the flesh, (3) to law, Place
   of the Spirit in St. Paul's teaching in this connection, The Epistles
   of the Imprisonment -- reconciliation extended from man to the
   universe, Spiritual beings whose fortunes are bound up with those of
   men: the Scripture support for such an idea, An imaginative expression
   for the absoluteness of the Christian religion, Reconciliation of men
   to each other as a fruit of Christ's death, The Pastoral Epistles.

  Chapter 4

    The Epistle to the Hebrews

   Various affinities of this epistle: primitive Christianity, Paulinism,
   Alexandrian thought,

   The most theological writing of the New Testament: its use of aionios

   Relations of Christ's Person and work in it according as we start from:

   (a) the Incarnation -- Westcott,

   (b) the Priesthood -- Seeberg,

   Christ's death defined by relation to God and His love: (a) directly,
   2:9, (b) indirectly by allusion (1) to His commission, (2) to His
   obedience, Christ's death defined by relation to sin (1:4 and passim):
   it is everywhere a sacrificial death, Sacrifice in this epistle to be
   interpreted in connection with Priesthood, Priesthood represents,
   embodies, and makes possible a fellowship of God and man, A priest is
   necessary in religion to deal with sin by way of sacrifice, Ways of
   interpreting this:

   (1) Nature of the relation between Christ's death and sin deduced from
   the effect on man ascribed to the death -- meaning of hagiazein,
   teleioun and katharizein in Hebrews,

   (2) The effect on man deduced from the conception of Christ's
   sacrificial death as a finished work.

   What gives Christ's death its propitiatory power? Examination of ch.
   9:14: He offered Himself through eternal spirit,' The author held the
   common Christian view of the relation of death and sin, Examination of
   the passage in 10:1-10 to do Thy will, O God,' In what sense obedience
   is the principle of the Atonement, Connection between the work of
   Christ and man's salvation by it: the relation of the ideas expressed
   by Substitute and Representative, Place and meaning of faith in this
   epistle.

  Chapter 5

    The Johannine Writings

   Critical considerations,

   1. The Apocalypse:

   The doxology in 1:5 f.: what inspires the Christian praise of Christ,
   The Lamb as it had been slain (5:6-14), The Blood of the Lamb (7:14,
   12:11) -- connecting links in thought, The Lamb's Book of Life.

   2. The Gospel:

   General representation: redemption through revelation rather than
   revelation through redemption -- current contrasts of St. Paul and St.
   John criticized, Place of Christ's death in the gospel often
   underestimated, Examination of explicit references:

   (1) 1: 29: Behold the Lamb of God, etc., (2) 2:19: Destroy this Temple,
   (3) 3:14, 8:28, 12:32: The lifting up' of the Son of Man death as
   glorifying, (4) 6:51 f.: My flesh for the life of the world,' (5) 10:11
   f. The Good Shepherd, (6) 11:49: The prophecy of Caiaphas, (7) 12:24,
   27: The corn of wheat, etc., (8) 12:38: The quotation of Isaiah 53.,
   (9) 15:13: Greater love hath no man than this,' (10) 17:19: For their
   sakes I sanctify Myself,' (11) 18-19: The story of the Passion, All
   this interpreted in relation to the love of God and the necessity of
   men as sinners liable to die in their sins in comparison with St. Paul.

   3. The Epistle:

   Comparison and contrast with the Gospel,

   (1) It defines Christ's death more explicitly by relation to sin, 1:7;
   2:1 f.; 3:5; 4:10. Criticism of Westcott's interpretation of the blood
   of Christ,'.(2) Conception of Christ as hilasmos -- the correlatives of
   hilasmos are sacrifice, intercession, and law, (3) Propitiation and the
   love of God definable only through each other, Place of the Sacraments
   in the Gospel and First Epistle of St. John -- examination of 1 John
   5:6 f., Relation of the historical and the spiritual in Christianity
   generally, The death of Christ in St. John as a victory over Satan.

  Chapter 6

    The Importance of the Death of Christ in Preaching and in Theology

   No abstract distinction to be drawn between theology and preaching
   Considerations in relation to preaching:

   (1) No gospel without Atonement The sense of debt to Christ in the New
   Testament. The characteristics of the Atonement must be reflected in
   the gospel:

   (a) Perfection -- full salvation now,' (b) Assurance -- Romish and
   Protestant tendencies (c) Finality -- what justification means.

   (2) There may be various ways of approaching this central truth of the
   Christian faith -- our Lord's method with His disciples, Kierkegaard on
   the sense in which the Father comes before the Son, though no man comes
   to the Father but through the Son, Relation in Christ of Example and
   Reconciler -- what is our point of contact with Christ?

   (3) St. Paul's meaning in delivering first of all' that Christ died for
   our sins

   (4) Sense of sin in relation to the Atonement (a) as the condition of
   accepting or understanding it; (b) as its fruit,

   (5) The issues of this gospel -- life or death,

   Theological considerations:

   (1) The Atonement is the key to the unity and therefore to the
   inspiration of Scripture. The inspiration of Scripture and its unity
   are correlative terms,

   (2) The Atonement is the proper evangelical foundation for a doctrine
   of the Person of Christ. Harnack's attempt to dispense with Christology
   -- why it is impracticable,

   (3) The Incarnation not intelligible or credible, except when defined
   by relation to the Atonement -- speculative, ethical, and dogmatic
   reasons alleged against this -- view of Westcott carried to its logical
   issue by Archdeacon Wilson. Grounds for rejecting this view:

   (a) It shifts the center of gravity in the New Testament, (b) It puts
   metaphysical questions in the place of moral ones, (c) It displaces
   passion by sentimentalism,

   (4) The Atonement is the basis for all adequate doctrine of God --
   sense in which the New Testament teaches that God is love -- sin as
   that which is proof against such love,

   (5) The Atonement at the foundation of Christian ethics as of Christian
   life -- Law glorified in the Passion and made an irresistible, ethical
   impulses.

  Chapter 7

    The Atonement and the Modern Mind

   Sense in which the Atonement and the Christian religion are equivalent,
   Sympathy and antipathy of the mind in relation to Christianity, The
   Atonement historically revealed, The modern mind and authority, '
   Simplest expression for the Atonement: its basis in experience, The
   appeal against it to the Prodigal Son, Characteristics of the modern
   mind affecting its attitude to atonement, Those induced by the
   influence of physical and particularly of biological study -- some
   favorable, some the reverse -- Relation to the consciousness of sin,
   Those induced by the idealist movement in philosophy -- disinclination
   or inability to take Christ at His own estimate, Those induced by the
   historical method of study -- relativity of all things-- no revelation
   of the eternal in time -- this temper within the Church -- significance
   of the Johannine books,

   Two just requirements of the modern mind:

   (1) Everything must be based on experience,

   (2) Everything in religion must be ethically construed.

  Chapter 8

    Sin and the Divine Reaction against it

   The situation to which the Atonement is related: that of sinful men,
   The relations of God and men are personal, But they are also ethical,
   i. e., determined by something of universal import -- by law, This does
   not mean that they are forensic' or legal', St. Paul's view on this
   point, The ethical relations of God and man have been disordered by
   sin, No theory of the origin of sin needed evolution and a fall
   universal experiences,

   The reaction against sin:

   (a) in conscience,

   (b) in nature,

   Ultimate unity of the natural and the moral order presupposed in the
   Scripture view of sin and atonement, Many arguments against atonement
   based on unreal separation of the natural and the moral order, Biblical
   Doctrine of Sin and Death: its real meaning, Not refuted by
   insensibility to death, Nor even by the ethical transformation of death

INTRODUCTION

   Two assumptions must be made by any one who writes on the death of
   Christ in the New Testament. The first is, that there is such a thing
   as a New Testament; and the second, that the death of Christ is a
   subject which has a real place and importance in it. The first may be
   said to be the more important of the two, for the denial of it carries
   with it the denial of the other.

   At the present moment there is a strong tendency in certain quarters to
   depreciate the idea of a New Testament in the sense in which it has
   rightly or wrongly been established in the Church. It is pointed out
   that the books which compose our New Testament are in no real sense a
   unity. They were not written with a view to forming the volume in which
   we now find them, nor with any view of being related to each other at
   all. At first, indeed, they had no such relation. They are merely the
   chief fragments that have survived from a primitive Christian
   literature which must have been indefinitely larger, not to say richer.
   The unity which they now possess, and in virtue of which they
   constitute the New Testament, does not belong to them inherently; it is
   factitious; it is the artificial, and to a considerable extent the
   illusive result of the action of the Church in bestowing upon them
   canonical authority. The age to which they historically belong is an
   age at which the Church had no New Testament,' and hence what is called
   New Testament theology is an exhibition of the manner in which
   Christians thought before a New Testament existed. As a
   self-contradictory thing, therefore, it ought to be abolished. The
   dogma' of the New Testament, and the factitious unity which it has
   created, ought to be superseded, and instead of New Testament theology
   we should aim at a history of primitive Christian thought and life. It
   would not be necessary for the purposes of such a history to make any
   assumptions as to the unity of the New Testament' books; but though
   they would not form a holy island in the sea of history, they would
   gain in life and reality in proportion as the dogmatic tie which binds
   them to each other was broken, and their living relations to the
   general phenomena of history revealed. [1]

   There is not only some plausibility in this but some truth: all I am
   concerned to point out here is that it is not the whole truth, and
   possibly not the main truth. The unity which belongs to the books of
   the New Testament, whatever be its value, is certainly not fortuitous.
   The books did not come together by chance. They are not held together
   simply by the art of the bookbinder. It would be truer to say that they
   gravitated toward each other in the course of the first century of the
   Church's life, and imposed their unity on the Christian mind, than that
   the Church imposed on them by statute -- for when dogma' is used in the
   abstract sense which contrasts it with fact or history, this is what it
   means -- a unity to which they were inwardly strange. That they are at
   one in some essential respects is obvious. They have at least unity of
   subject, they are all concerned with Jesus Christ, and with the
   manifestation of God's redeeming love to men in Him. There is even a
   sense in which we may say there is unity of authorship; for all the
   books of the New Testament are works of faith. Whether the unity goes
   further, and if so how far, are questions not to be settled beforehand.
   It may extend to modes of thought, to fundamental beliefs or
   convictions, in regard to Christ and the meaning of His presence and
   work in the world. It is not assumed here that it does, but neither is
   it assumed that it does not. It is not assumed, with regard to the
   particular subject before us, that in the different New Testament
   writings we shall find independent, divergent, or inconsistent
   interpretations of Christ's death. The result of an unprejudiced
   investigation may be to show that on this subject the various writings
   which go to make up our New Testament are profoundly at one, and even
   that their oneness on this subject, a oneness not imposed nor
   artificial, but essential and inherent, justifies against the criticism
   referred to above the common Christian estimate of the New Testament as
   a whole.

   Without entering on abstract or general grounds into a discussion in
   which no abstract or general conclusion can be reached, it may be
   permitted to say, in starting, that in the region with which the New
   Testament deals we should be on our guard against pressing too strongly
   some current distinctions which, within their limits, are real enough,
   but which, if carried beyond their limits, make everything in the New
   Testament unintelligible. The most important of these is the
   distinction of historical and dogmatic, or of historito-religious and
   dogmatico-religious. If the distinction between historical and dogmatic
   is pressed, it runs back into the distinction between thing and
   meaning, or between fact and theory; and this, as we shall have
   occasion to see, is a distinction which it is impossible to press.
   There is a point at which the two sides in such contrast pass into each
   other. He who does not see the meaning does not see the thing; or to
   use the more imposing words, he who refuses to take a dogmatic' view
   proves by doing so that he falls short of a completely historical' one.
   The same kind of consideration has sometimes to be applied to the
   distinction of Biblical, or New Testament' and systematic' theology.
   Biblical or New Testament theology deals with the thoughts, or the mode
   of thinking, of the various New Testament writers; systematic theology
   is the independent construction of Christianity as a whole in the mind
   of a later thinker. Here again there is a broad and valid distinction,
   but not an absolute one. It is the Christian thinking of the first
   century in the one case, and of the twentieth, let us say, in the
   other; but in both cases there is Christianity and there is thinking,
   and if there is truth in either there is bound to be a place at which
   the distinction disappears. It does not follow from the distinction,
   with the inevitable limitations, that nothing in the New Testament can
   be accepted by a modern mind simply as it stands. It does not follow
   that nothing in St. Paul or St. John -- nothing in their interpretation
   of the death of Jesus, for example -- has attained the character of
   finality. There may be something which has. The thing to be dealt with
   is one, and the mind, through the centuries, is one, and even in the
   first century it may have struck to a final truth which the twentieth
   will not transcend. Certainly we cannot deny this beforehand on the
   ground that Biblical theology is one thing and Systematic or
   Philosophical theology another. They may be taught in separate rooms in
   a theological school, but, except to the pedant or the dilettante, the
   distinction between them is a vanishing one. And the same may be said,
   finally, about the distinction of matter and form. There is such a
   distinction it is possible to put the same matter in different forms.
   But it does not follow that the form in which a truth or an experience
   is put by a New Testament writer is always unequal to the matter, or
   that the matter must always be fused again and cast into a new mold
   before it can be appropriated by us. The higher the reality with which
   we deal, the less the distinction of matter and form holds. If
   Christianity brings us into contact with the ultimate truth and
   reality, we may find that the form' into which it was cast at first is
   more essential to the matter than we had supposed. Just as it would be
   a rash act to venture to extract the matter of Lycidas, and to exhibit
   it in a more adequate form, it may be a rash act to venture to tell us
   what St. Paul or St. John meant in a form more equal to the meaning
   than the apostles themselves could supply. It is not necessary to say
   that it would be, but only that it may be. The mind seems to gain
   freedom and lucidity by working with such distinctions, but if we
   forget that they are our own distinctions, and that in the real world,
   in the very nature of things, a point is reached sooner or later at
   which they disappear, we are certain to be led astray. I do not argue
   against drawing them or using them, but against making them so absolute
   that in the long-run one of them must cease to be true, and forfeit all
   its rights in favor of the other. The chief use, for instance, to which
   many writers put them is to appeal to the historical against the
   dogmatic; the historical is employed to drive the dogmatic from the
   field. To do the reverse would of course be as bad, and my object in
   these introductory remarks is to deprecate both mistakes. It does not
   matter, outside the class-room, whether an interpretation is called
   historical or dogmatic, historico-religious or dogmatico-religious; it
   does not matter whether we put it under the head of Biblical or of
   philosophical theology; what we want to know is whether it is true. In
   the truth such distinctions are apt to disappear.

   Without assuming, therefore, the dogmatic unity of the New Testament,
   either in its representation of Christianity as a whole, or of the
   death of Christ in particular, we need not feel precluded from
   approaching it with a presumption that it will exhibit some kind of
   coherence. Granting that the Church canonized the books, consciously or
   unconsciously, it did not canonize them for nothing. It must have felt
   that they really represented and therefore safeguarded the Christian
   faith, and as the Church of the early days was acutely conscious of the
   distinction between what did and what did not belong to Christianity,
   it must have had some sense at least of a consistency in its Christian
   Scriptures. [2] They did not represent for it two gospels or ten, but
   one. The view Christians took of the books they valued was
   instinctively dogmatic without ceasing to be historical; or perhaps we
   may say, with a lively sense of their historical relations the Church
   had an instinctive feeling of the dogmatic import of the books in its
   New Testament. It is in this attitude, which is not blind to either
   side of the distinction, yet does not let either annul the other, that
   we ought to approach the study of New Testament problems.

   It is hardly necessary to prove that in the New Testament the death of
   Christ is a real subject. It is distinctly present to the mind of New
   Testament writers, and they have much to say upon it. It is treated by
   them as a subject of central and permanent importance to the Christian
   faith, and it is incredible that it should have filled the place it
   does fill in the New Testament had it ever been regarded as of trifling
   consequence for the understanding, the acceptance, or the preaching of
   the Gospel. As little is it necessary to say that in using the
   expression the death of Christ,' we are not speaking of a thing, but of
   an experience. Whether we view it as action or as passion, whatever
   enters into personality has the significance and the worth of
   personality. The death of Christ in the New Testament is the death of
   one who is alive for evermore. To every New Testament writer Christ is
   the Lord, the living and exalted Lord, and it is impossible for them to
   think of His death except as an experience the result or virtue of
   which is perpetuated in His risen life. Nevertheless, Christ died. His
   death is in some sense the center and consummation of His work. It is
   because of it that His risen life is the hope which it is to sinful
   men; and it needs no apology, therefore, if one who thinks that it has
   less than its proper place in preaching and in theology endeavors to
   bring out as simply as possible its place and meaning in the New
   Testament. If our religion is to be Christian in any sense of the term
   which history will justify, it can never afford to ignore what, to say
   the least of it, is the primary confession of Christian faith.

   The starting-point in our investigation must be the life and teaching
   of Jesus Himself. For this we shall depend in the first instance on the
   synoptic gospels. Next will come an examination of primitive Christian
   teaching as it bears on our subject. For this we can only make use of
   the early chapters in Acts, and with a reserve, which will be explained
   at the proper place, of the First Epistle of Peter. It will then be
   necessary to go into greater detail, in proportion as we have more
   material at command, in regard to the teaching of St. Paul. Of all New
   Testament writers he is the one who has most deliberately and
   continually reflected on Christ's death; if there is a conscious
   theology of it anywhere it is with him. A study of the epistle to the
   Hebrews and of the Johannine writings -- Apocalypse, Gospel, and
   Epistle -- will bring the subject proper to a close; but I shall
   venture to add, in a concluding chapter, some reflections on the
   importance of the New Testament conception of Christ's death alike to
   the evangelist and the theologian.

   Christianity was shown in its power to assimilate as well as to reject
   extraneous matter.

CHAPTER 1
The Synoptic Gospels

   ALL the gospels describe the sufferings and death of Christ with a
   minuteness which has no parallel in their narratives of other events of
   His life, and they all, to a certain extent, by references to the
   fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy or otherwise, indicate their
   sense of its meaning and importance. This, however, reveals the mind of
   the evangelists rather than that of the Lord. It is in His life, rather
   than in the record of His death itself, that we must look for
   indications of His mind. But here we are at once confronted with
   certain preliminary difficulties. Quite apart from the question whether
   it is possible at all to know what Jesus thought or spoke about His
   death -- a question which it is taken for granted is to be answered in
   the affirmative [3] -- it has been asserted, largely upon general
   grounds, that Jesus cannot have entered on His ministry with the
   thought of His death present to Him; that He must, on the contrary,
   have begun His work with brilliant hopes of success; that only as these
   hopes gradually but irrevocably faded away did first the possibility
   and then the certainty of a tragic issue dawn upon Him; that it thus
   became necessary for Him to reconcile Himself to the idea of a violent
   death, and that in various ways, which can more or less securely be
   traced in the gospels, He did so; although, as the prayer in Gethsemane
   shows, there seemed a possibility to Him, even to the last, that a
   change might come, and the will of the Father be done in some less
   tragic fashion. This is what is meant by an historical as opposed to a
   dogmatic reading of the life of Jesus, a dogmatic reading being one
   which holds that Jesus came into the world in order to die; and it is
   insisted on as necessary to secure for that life the reality of a
   genuine human experience. To question or impeach or displace this
   interpretation is alleged to be docetism; it gives us a phantom as a
   Savior instead of the man Christ Jesus.

   In spite of its plausibility, I venture to urge that this reading of
   the gospels requires serious qualification. It is almost as much an a
   priori interpretation of the history of Jesus as if it were deduced
   from the Nicene creed. It is derived from the word historical,' in the
   sense which that word would bear if it were applied to an ordinary
   human life, just as abstractly as another reading of the facts might be
   derived from the words homoousios to patri.' If any one wrote a life of
   Jesus, in which everything was subordinated to the idea that Jesus was
   of one substance with the Father,' it would no doubt be described as
   dogmatic, but it is quite as possible to be dogmatic' in history as in
   theology. It is a dogma, and an unreasoned dogma besides, that because
   the life of Jesus is historical, it neither admits nor requires for its
   interpretation any idea or formula that cannot be used in the
   interpretation of the common life of man. The Christian religion rests
   on the fact that there is not only an identity but a difference between
   His life and ours; and we cannot allow the difference (and with it the
   Christian religion) to be abolished a priori by a dogmatic' use of the
   term historical. ' We must turn to our historical documents -- the
   gospels -- and when we do, there is much to give us pause.

   All the gospels, we remark in the first place, begin with an account of
   the baptism of Jesus. Whatever may be doubtful about this it cannot be
   doubtful that it was the occasion of a great spiritual experience to
   Jesus. Ideas, as Dr. Johnson says, must be given through something; and
   Jesus, we must believe, gave His disciples an idea of what His
   experience at baptism was in the narratives which we now read in the
   gospels. The sum of that experience is often put by saying that He came
   then to the consciousness of His Sonship. But the manner in which Jesus
   Himself puts it is much more revealing. A voice came from heaven, Thou
   art My Son, the Beloved, in Thee I am well pleased.' A voice from
   heaven does not mean a voice from the clouds, but a voice from God; and
   it is important to notice that the voice from God speaks in familiar
   Old Testament words. It does not come unmediated, but mediated through
   psalm and prophecy. It is through the absorption of Old Testament
   Scripture that Jesus comes; to the consciousness of what He is; and the
   Scriptures which He uses to convey His experience to the disciples are
   the 2nd Psalm, and the forty-second chapter of Isaiah. The first words
   of the heavenly voice are from the Psalm, the next from the prophet.
   Nothing could be more suggestive than this. The Messianic consciousness
   in Jesus from the very beginning was one with the consciousness of the
   Servant of the Lord. The King, to whom Jehovah says, Thou art My Son,
   this day have I begotten Thee (Psalm 2:7), [4] is at the same time (in
   the mind of Jesus) that mysterious Servant of Jehovah -- My beloved, in
   whom I am well pleased' -- whose tragic yet glorious destiny is
   adumbrated in the second Isaiah (42:1 ff.). It is not necessary to
   inquire how Jesus could combine beforehand two lines of anticipation
   which at the first glance seem so inconsistent with each other; the
   point is, that on the evidence before us, which seems to the writer as
   indisputable as anything in the gospels, He did combine them, and
   therefore cannot have started on His ministry with the cloudless hopes
   which are sometimes ascribed to Him. However unhistorical' it might
   seem on general grounds, on the ground of the evidence which is here
   available we must hold that from the very beginning of His public work
   the sense of something tragic in His destiny -- something which in form
   might only become definite with time, but in substance was sure -- was
   present to the mind of Jesus. When it did emerge in definite form it
   brought necessities and appeals along with it which were not there from
   the beginning; it brought demands for definite action, for assuming a
   definite attitude, for giving more or less explicit instruction; but it
   did not bring a monstrous and unanticipated disappointment to which
   Jesus had to reconcile Himself as best He could. It was not a brutal
   dementi to all His hopes. It had a necessary relation to His
   consciousness from the beginning, just as surely as His consciousness
   from the beginning had a necessary relation to the prophetic conception
   of the Servant of the Lord.

   This is confirmed if we look from the baptism to that which in all the
   gospels is closely connected with it, and is of equal importance as
   illustrating our Lord's conception of Himself and His work -- the
   temptation. Nothing can be more gratuitous than to ascribe this
   wonderful narrative to the productive activity' of the Church, and to
   allege that the temptations which it records are those which Jesus
   encountered during His career, and that they are antedated for effect,
   or for catechetical convenience. Psychologically, the connection of the
   temptations with the baptism is strikingly true, and two of the three
   are connected even for many with the divine voice, Thou art My Son
   (Matthew 3:17 and 4:3, 6). The natural supposition is that Jesus spoke
   often to His disciples of a terrible spiritual experience which
   followed the sublime experience of the baptism -- sometimes without
   detail, as in Mark, who mentions only a prolonged conflict with Satan,
   during which Jesus was sustained by the ministry of angels; sometimes,
   as in Matthew and Luke, with details which gave insight into the nature
   of the conflict. It does not matter that the temptations which are here
   described actually assailed Jesus at later stages in His life. Of
   course they did. They are the temptations of the Christ, and they not
   only assailed Him at particular moments, some of which we can still
   identify (Matthew 16:22 f. and John 6: 15), they must in some way have
   haunted Him incessantly. [5] But they were present to His mind from the
   outset of His career; that is the very meaning of the temptation story,
   standing where it stands. The Christ sees the two paths that lie before
   Him, and He chooses at the outset, in spiritual conflict, that which He
   knows will set Him in irreconcilable antagonism to the hopes and
   expectations of those to whom He is to appeal. A soul which sees its
   vocation shadowed out in the Servant of the Lord, which is driven of
   the Spirit into the wilderness to face the dreadful alternatives raised
   by that vocation, and which takes the side which Jesus took in conflict
   with the enemy, does not enter on its life-work with any superficial
   illusions: it has looked Satan and all he can do in the face; it is
   prepared for conflict, it may shrink from death, when death confronts
   it in the path of its vocation, as hideous and unnatural, but it cannot
   be startled by it as by an unthought of, unfamiliar thing. The
   possibility, at least, of a tragic issue to His work -- when we
   remember the Servant of the Lord, far more than the possibility --
   belongs to the consciousness of Jesus from the first. Not that His
   ultimate triumph is compromised, but He knows before He begins that it
   will not be attained by any primrose path. If there was a period in His
   life during which He had other thoughts, it is antecedent to that at
   which we have any knowledge of Him.

   These considerations justify us in emphasizing, in relation to our
   subject, not merely the fact of Jesus' baptism, but its meaning. It was
   a baptism of repentance with a view to remission of sins, and there is
   undoubtedly something paradoxical, at a first glance, in the idea of
   Jesus submitting to such a baptism. Neither here nor elsewhere in the
   gospel does He betray any consciousness of sin. The opinion of a recent
   writer on the life of Jesus, [6] who ascribes to the fragments of the
   gospel according to the Hebrews an authority equal, and at this point
   superior, to that of the canonical gospels, is not likely to find many
   supporters. Jerome tells us that in this gospel, which in his day was
   still used by the Nazarenes, and could be seen in the library at
   Caesarea, the narrative ran, Behold the mother of the Lord and His
   brethren said to Him: John Baptist is baptizing with a view to
   remission of sins' let us go and be baptized by him. But He said to
   them, What sin have I done that I should go and be baptized by him?
   Unless, indeed, this very word I have spoken is ignorantia,' i. e., a
   sin of ignorance or inadvertence (cf. agnoema, Hebrews 9:7, and snnh in
   Old Testament). [7] We should have to suppose in this case that Jesus
   went up to Jordan half reluctantly, His first thought being that a
   baptism like John's could mean nothing to Him, His next that possibly
   this proud thought, or the utterance of it, indicated that He might
   have something to repent of after all, and more perhaps than He knew.
   This mingling of what might not unfairly be called petulance with a
   sudden access of misgiving, as of one who was too sure of himself and
   yet not quite sure, is as unlike as anything could be to the simplicity
   and truth of Jesus; [8] and surely it needs no proof that it is another
   mood than this to which the heavens are opened, and on which divine
   assurance and divine strength are bestowed. We must abide by the
   canonical narratives as consistent in themselves, and consistent with
   the New Testament as a whole. What we see there is Jesus, who,
   according to all apostolic testimony, and according to the suggestion
   of the Baptist himself in Matthew 3:14, knew no sin, submitting to a
   baptism which is defined as a baptism of repentance. It would not have
   been astonishing if Jesus had come from Galilee to baptize along with
   John, if He had taken His stand by John's side confronting the people;
   the astonishing thing is that being what He was He came to be baptized,
   and took His stand side by side with the people. He identified Himself
   with them. As far as the baptism could express it, He made all that was
   theirs His. It is as though He had looked on them under the oppression
   of their sin, and said, On Me let all that burden, all that
   responsibility descend.' The key to the act is to be found in the great
   passage in Isaiah 53. in which the vocation of the Servant of the Lord,
   which, as we have seen, was present to our Lord's mind at the moment,
   is most amply unfolded. The deepest word in that chapter, He was
   numbered with the transgressors, is expressly applied to our Lord by
   Himself at a later period (Luke 22:37); and however mysterious that
   word may be when we try to define it by relation to the providence and
   redemption of God -- however appalling it may seem to render it as St.
   Paul does, Him who knew no sin, God made to be sin for us -- here in
   the baptism we see not the word but the thing: Jesus numbering Himself
   with the transgressors, submitting to be baptized with their baptism,
   identifying Himself with them in their relation to God as sinners,
   making all their responsibilities His own. It was a great act of loving
   communion with our misery,' and in that hour, in the will and act of
   Jesus, the work of atonement was begun. It was no accident that now,
   and not at some other hour, the Father's voice declared Him the beloved
   Son, the chosen One in whom His soul delighted. For in so identifying
   Himself with sinful men, in so making their last and most dreadful
   responsibilities His own, Jesus approved Himself the true Son of the
   Father, the true Servant and Representative of Him whose name from of
   old is Redeemer. [9] It is impossible to have this in mind, and to
   remember the career which the fifty- third chapter of Isaiah sets
   before the Servant of the Lord, without feeling that from the moment He
   entered on His ministry our Lord's thoughts of the future must have
   been more in keeping with the reality than those which are sometimes
   ascribed to Him as alone consistent with a truly human career. His
   career was truly His own as well as truly human, and the shadow of the
   world's sin lay on it from the first. [10]

   Starting from this point, we may now go on to examine the facts as they
   are put before us in the gospels.

   It is only, indeed, after the great day of Caesarea Philippi, on which
   Jesus accepts from the lips of His disciples the confession of
   Messiahship, that He begins expressly to teach the necessity of His
   death. But there are indications earlier than this that it was not
   alien to His thoughts, as indeed there was much to prompt the thought
   of it. There was the experience of ancient prophets, to which He refers
   from the sermon on the mount, at the opening of His ministry (Matthew
   5:10-12), to the great denunciation of the Pharisees at its close
   (Matthew 23:37). There was the fate of John the Baptist, which, though
   the precise date of it is uncertain, was felt by Jesus to be parallel
   to His own (Mark 9:12, 13). There was the sense underlying all His
   early success, to speak of it in such language, of an irreconcilable
   antipathy in His adversaries, of a temper which would incur the guilt
   of eternal sin rather than acknowledge His claims (Mark 3:20-30); there
   was the consciousness, going back, if we can trust the evangelic
   narrative at all, to very early days, that the most opposite parties
   were combining to destroy Him (Mark 3:6). And there is one pathetic
   word in which the sense of the contrast between the present and the
   future comes out with moving power.

   Can the children of the bride- chamber fast while the bridegroom is
   with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot
   fast. But days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from
   them, and then shall they fast in that day' (Mark 2:19 f.).

   The force of this exquisite word has been evaded in two ways.

   (1) Hollmann [11] has argued that 5: 20, in which the taking away of
   the bridegroom is spoken of, is not really a word of Jesus, but due to
   the productive activity of the Church. It is irrelevant in the
   circumstances, and it is only made possible by the parable of Jesus
   being treated as an allegory. All that is apposite to the occasion is
   the first clause, Can the children of the bride-chamber fast while the
   bridegroom is with them?' But the allegory, which is thus used to
   discredit 5:20, must, as Wellhausen has fairly pointed out, be assumed
   if we are to get any pertinent meaning even for 5: 19; and few will
   follow him in expunging both verses alike. [12]

   (2) It has been argued that the words do not necessarily refer to a
   violent or premature or unnatural death, but merely to the parting
   which is inevitable in the case of all human relations, however joyful
   they may be, and which perhaps suggests itself the more readily the
   more joyful they are. [13] But there is nothing elsewhere in the words
   of Jesus so sentimental and otiose as this. He does not aim at cheap
   pathetic effects, like the modern romance writers, who studiously paint
   the brightness and gaiety of life against the omnipresent black
   background of death. The taking away of the bridegroom from the bridal
   party is not the universal experience of man, applied to an individual
   case; it is something startling, tragic, like sudden storm in a summer
   sky; and it is as such that it is present to the mind of Jesus as a
   figure of His own death. Even in the Galilean springtime, when His
   fortune seems to rise like the rising tide, there is this sad
   presentiment at His heart, and once at least He suffers it to break
   through.

   It is not possible, for critical reasons, to insist in the same way on
   the saying about being three days and three nights in the heart of the
   earth, as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly
   (Matthew 12:40); in the parallel passage in Luke 11:29 f. the sign of
   Jonah must be interpreted without any such reference to the fortunes of
   Jesus. But even if Jesus did make an allusion of this sort to the issue
   of His life -- an allusion which none of His hearers could understand
   -- it does not carry us any way into the understanding of His death. It
   only suggests that it is not a final defeat, but has the true victory
   of His cause beyond it. What He came to do will be effectively done,
   not before He dies, but after He has come again through death. And this
   is the only sign which His enemies can have. [14]

   But leaving these allusive references to His death, let us proceed to
   those in which it is the express subject of our Lord's teaching.

   All the synoptics introduce it, in this sense, at the same point (Mark
   8:31, Matthew 16:21 and Luke 9:22). Matthew lays a peculiar emphasis on
   the date, using it to mark the division of his gospel into two great
   parts. From that time Jesus began,' he says in 4:17, to preach and to
   say -- Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.' From that time,'
   he says in 16:21,

   Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go up to Jerusalem
   and be killed.'

   A comparison of the evangelists justifies us in saying broadly that a
   new epoch in our Lord's ministry had now begun. His audience is not so
   much the multitudes as the twelve; His method is not so much preaching
   as teaching; His subject is not so much the Kingdom as Himself, and in
   particular His death. All the evangelists mention three occasions on
   which He made deliberate and earnest efforts to initiate the disciples
   into His thoughts (Mark 8:31, 9:31 and 10:32, with parallels in Matthew
   and Luke). Mark, especially, whose narrative is fundamental, lays
   stress on the continued and repeated attempts He made to familiarize
   them with what was drawing near (notice the imperfects edidasken in
   9:31). There is no reason whatever to doubt this general
   representation. It is mere wantonness to eliminate from the narrative
   one or two of the three passages on the ground that they are but
   duplicates or triplicates of the same thing. In Mark, especially, they
   are distinctly characterized by the varying attitude of the disciples.
   Further, in the first we have the presumptuous protest of Peter, which
   guarantees the historicity of the whole, if anything could. In the
   second the disciples are silent. They could not make him out (hegnooun
   to rhema), and with the remembrance of the overwhelming rebuke which
   Peter had drawn down on himself, they were afraid to put any question
   to Him (9:32). The third is attached to that never-to-be-forgotten
   incident in which, as they were on the way to Jerusalem, Jesus took the
   lead in some startling manner, so that they followed in amazement and
   fear. If anything in the gospels has the stamp of real and live
   recollection upon it, it is this. It is necessary to insist on this
   repeated instruction of the disciples by Jesus as a fact, quite apart
   from what He was able to teach or they to learn. It is often said that
   the death of Christ has a place in the epistles out of all proportion
   to that which it has in the gospels. This is hardly the fact, even if
   the space were to be estimated merely by the number of words devoted to
   it in the gospels and epistles respectively; but it is still less the
   fact when we remember that that which, according to the gospels
   themselves, characterized the last months of our Lord's life was a
   deliberate and thrice-repeated attempt to teach His disciples something
   about His death.

   The critical questions which have been raised as to the contents of
   these passages need not here detain us. It has been suggested that they
   must have become more detailed in the telling -- that unconsciously and
   involuntarily the Church put into the lips of the Lord words which were
   only supplied to its own mind by its knowledge of what actually took
   place -- that the references to mocking, scourging, spitting, in
   particular, could not have been so explicit -- above all, that the
   resurrection on the third day must, if spoken of at all, have been
   veiled in some figurative form which baffled the disciples at the
   moment. It has been suggested, on the other hand, that it may have been
   the idea of a resurrection on the third day, and not on the familiar
   great day at the end of all things, which put them out. It may not be
   possible, and it is certainly not necessary, to say beforehand that
   there is nothing in any of these suggestions. [15] But one may hold
   sincerely, and with good grounds, that there is very little in them,
   and that even that little is persuasive rather for dogmatic than for
   historical reasons. Surely we cannot imagine Jesus iterating and
   reiterating (as we know He did), with the most earnest desire to
   impress and instruct His followers, such vague, elusive, impalpable
   hints of what lay before Him as some critics would put in the place of
   what they regard, for extra-historical reasons, as impossibly definite
   predictions. Jesus must have had something entirely definite and
   sayable to say, when He tried so persistently to get it apprehended. He
   did not live in cloudland; what He spoke of was the sternest of
   realities; and for whatever reason His disciples failed to understand
   Him, it cannot have been that He talked to them incessantly and
   importunately in shadowy riddles, the thing could not be done. As far,
   however, as our present purpose is concerned, it is not affected by any
   reasonable opinion we may come to on the critical questions here in
   view. The one point in which all the narratives agree is that Jesus
   taught that He must go up to Jerusalem and die; and the one question it
   is of importance to answer is, What is meant by this must (dei)?

   There are obviously two meanings which it might have. It might signify
   that His death was inevitable; the must being one of outward
   constraint. No doubt, in this sense it was true that He must die. The
   hostile forces which were arrayed against Him were irreconcilable, and
   were only waiting their time. Sooner or later it would come, and they
   would crush Him without remorse. But it might also signify that His
   death was indispensable, the must being one of inward constraint. It
   might signify that death was something He was bound to accept and
   contemplate if the work He came to do was to be done, if the vocation
   with which he was called was to be fulfilled. These two senses, of
   course, are not incompatible; but there may be a question as to their
   relation to each other. Most frequently the second is made to depend
   upon the first. Jesus, we are told, came to see that His death was
   inevitable, such were the forces arrayed against Him; but being unable,
   as the well-beloved Son of the Father, merely to submit to the
   inevitable, merely to encounter death as a blind fate, He reconciled
   Himself to it by interpreting it as indispensable, as something which
   properly entered into His work and contributed to its success. It
   became not a thing to endure, but a thing to do. The passion was
   converted into the sublimest of actions. We do not need to say that
   this reasoning has nothing in it; but it is too abstract, and the
   relation in which the two necessities are put to one another does not
   answer to the presentation of the facts in the gospels. The inward
   necessity which Jesus recognized for His death was not simply the moral
   solution which He had discovered for the fatal situation in which He
   found Himself. An inward necessity is identical with the will of God,
   and the will of God for Jesus is expressed, not primarily in outward
   conditions, but in that Scripture which is for Him the word of God. We
   have seen already that from the very beginning our Lord's sense of His
   own vocation and destiny was essentially related to that of the Servant
   of the Lord in the Book of Isaiah, and it is there that the ultimate
   source of the dei is to be found. The divine necessity for a career of
   suffering and death is primary; it belongs, in however vague and
   undefined a form, to our Lord's consciousness of what He is and what He
   is called to do; it is not deduced from the malignant necessities by
   which He is encompassed; it rises up within Him, in divine power, to
   encounter these outward necessities and subdue them.

   This connection of ideas is confirmed when we notice that what Jesus
   began to teach His disciples is the doctrine of a suffering Messiah. As
   soon as they have confessed Him to be the Christ, He begins to give
   them this lesson. The necessity of His death, in other words, is not a
   dreary, incomprehensible somewhat that He is compelled to reckon with
   by untoward circumstances; for Him it is given, so to speak, with the
   very conception of His person and His work. When He unfolds Messiahship
   it contains death. This was the first and last thing He taught about
   it, the first and last thing He wished His disciples to learn. In
   Matthew 16:21, Westcott and Hort read, From that time began Jesus
   Christ to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer
   many things,' while Mark and Luke, in the corresponding passage, speak
   of the Son of Man.

   The official expressions, or, to use a less objectionable term, the
   names which denote the vocation of Jesus, the Christ' and the Son of
   Man,' show that in this lesson He is speaking out of the sense of his
   vocation, and not merely out of a view of His historical circumstances.
   The necessity to suffer and die, which was involved in His vocation,
   and the dim sense of which belonged to His very being, so that without
   it He would not have been what He was, was now beginning to take
   definite shape in His mind. As events made plain the forces with which
   He had to deal, He could see more clearly how the necessity would work
   itself out. He could go beyond that early word about the taking away of
   the bridegroom, and speak of Jerusalem, and of rejection by the elders
   and chief priests and scribes. And this consideration justifies us in
   believing that these details in the evangelic narrative are historical.
   But the manner in which the necessity did work itself out, and the
   greater or less detail with which, from a greater or less distance,
   Jesus could anticipate its course, do not affect in the least the
   character of that necessity itself. It is the necessity involved in the
   divine vocation of one in whom the Old Testament prophecy of the
   Servant of the Lord is to be fulfilled.

   It must be admitted that in none of the three summary references which
   the evangelists make to our Lord's teaching on His death do they say
   anything of explicitly theological import. They tell us

   (1) that it was necessary -- in the sense, we now assume, which has
   just been explained;

   (2) that it should be attended by such and such circumstances of pain
   and ignominy; and

   (3) that it should be speedily followed by His resurrection.

   The repeated assurances that His disciples could not understand Him
   must surely refer to the meaning and necessity which He wished them to
   see in His death. They cannot but have understood His words about dying
   and rising, unless, as has been suggested already, the date of the
   rising puzzled them. All that remains is to suppose that the
   incomprehensible element in the new teaching of Jesus was the truths He
   wished to convey to them about the necessity, the meaning, the purpose,
   the power, of His death. But if we observe the unanimity with which
   every part of the early Church taught that Christ died for our sins
   according to the Scriptures -- if, as will be shown below, we see how
   in Acts, in Peter, in Hebrews, in John, in Paul, passages referring to
   the Servant of the Lord, and especially to His bearing sin, and being
   numbered with the transgressors, are applied to Christ -- it becomes
   very difficult to believe that this consent, in what might seem by no
   means obvious, can have any other source than the teaching of Jesus
   Himself. Hollmann, indeed, makes a remarkable attempt to prove that
   Jesus never applied the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah to Himself except
   in Luke 22:37, and that there, when He says (with singular emphasis),
   that which is written must be fulfilled in Me, -- the word' and He was
   numbered with transgressors, He is not thinking of His death at all as
   having expiatory value in relation to sin. He is only thinking of the
   dreary fact that His countrymen are going to treat Him as a criminal
   instead of as the Holy One of God. [16] But there is surely no reason
   why the most superficial sense of profound words, a sense, too, which
   evacuates them of all their original associations, should be the only
   one allowed to Jesus. If there is any truth at all in the connection we
   have asserted between His own consciousness of what He was and the Old
   Testament conception of the Servant of the Lord, it is surely
   improbable that He applied to Himself the most wonderful expression in
   Isaiah 53. in a shallow verbal fashion, and put from Him the great
   meanings of which the chapter is full, and which the New Testament
   writers embrace with one accord. On the strength of that quotation, and
   of the consent of the New Testament as a whole, which has no basis but
   in Jesus, we are entitled to argue from the dei of the evangelists --
   in other words, from the divine necessity Jesus saw in His death --
   that what He sought in those repeated lessons to induce His disciples
   to do was to recognize in the Messiah the person who should fulfill the
   prophecy of Isaiah 53. The ideal in their minds was something far other
   than this, and there is no dead lift so heavy as that which is required
   to change an ideal. We do not wonder that at the moment it was too much
   for Him and for them. We do not wonder that at the moment they could
   not turn, one is tempted to say bodily round, so as to see and
   understand what He was talking about. And just as little do we wonder
   that when the meaning of His words broke on them later, it was with
   that overwhelming power which made the thing that had once baffled them
   the sum and substance of their gospel. The center of gravity in their
   world changed, and their whole being swung round into equilibrium in a
   new position. Their inspiration came from what had once alarmed,
   grieved, discomfited them. The word they preached was the very thing
   which had once made them afraid to speak.

   But we are not limited, in investigating our Lord's teaching on His
   death, to inferences more or less secure. There are at least two great
   words in the gospels which expressly refer to it -- the one contained
   in His answer to James and John when they asked the places at His right
   hand and His left in His kingdom, the other spoken at the Supper. We
   now proceed to consider these.

   Part of the difficulty we always have in interpreting Scripture is the
   want of context; we do not know what were the ideas in the minds of the
   original speakers or hearers to which the words that have been
   preserved for us were immediately related. This difficulty has perhaps
   been needlessly aggravated, especially in the first of the passages
   with which we are concerned. Yet the context here, even as we have it,
   is particularly suggestive. Jesus and His disciples are on the way to
   Jerusalem, when Jesus takes the start of them, apparently under some
   overpowering impulse, and they follow in amazement and fear (Mark
   10:32). He takes them aside once more, and makes the third of those
   deliberate attempts to which reference has already been made, to
   familiarize them with His death.

   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be delivered to
   the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn Him to death,
   and shall deliver Him unto the Gentiles: and they shall mock Him, and
   shall spit upon Him and scourge Him, and shall kill Him; and after
   three days He shall rise again' (Mark 10: 33 f.).

   It was while Jesus was in the grip of such thoughts -- setting His face
   steadfastly, with a rapt and solemn passion, to go to Jerusalem -- that
   James and John came to Him with their ambitious request. How was He to
   speak to them so that they might understand Him? As Bengel finely says,
   He was dwelling in His passion; He was to have others on His right hand
   and on His left before that; and their minds were in another world. How
   was He to bridge the gulf between their thoughts and his own? Are ye
   able,' He asks, to drink the cup which I drink, or to be baptized with
   the baptism with which I am baptized?' The cup and the baptism are
   poetic terms in which the destiny which awaits Him is veiled and
   transfigured. They are religious terms, in which that destiny is
   represented, in all its awfulness, as something involved in the will of
   God, and involving in itself a consecration. The cup is put into His
   hand by the Father, and if the baptism is a flood of suffering in which
   He is overwhelmed, it has through the very name which He uses to
   describe it the character of a religious act assigned to it; He goes to
   be baptized with it, as He takes the cup which the Father gives Him to
   drink. That the reference in both figures is to His death, and to His
   death in that tragic aspect which has just been described in the
   immediately preceding verses, is not open to doubt. And just as little
   is it open to doubt that in the next scene in the gospel -- that in
   which Jesus speaks to the disciples who were indignant with James and
   John for trying to steal a march upon them -- a reference to His death
   is so natural as to be inevitable. True greatness, He tells them, does
   not mean dominance, but service. That is the law for all, even for the
   highest. It is by supremacy in service that the King in the Kingdom of
   God wins his place. Even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto
   but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.'

   It is not inept to insist on the sequence and connection of ideas
   throughout this passage, because when it is really understood it puts
   the last words -- to give His life a ransom for many' -- beyond
   assault. It is often asserted that these words are an indication of
   Pauline influence in the second evangelist. Let us hope that one may be
   forgiven if he says frankly that this is an assertion which he cannot
   understand. The words are perfectly in place. They are in line with
   everything that precedes. They are words in the only key, of the only
   fullness, which answers to our Lord's absorption at the time in the
   thought of His death. A theological aversion to them may be conceived,
   but otherwise there is no reason whatever to call them in question.
   There is no critical evidence against them, and their psychological
   truth is indubitable. So far from saying that Jesus could not have
   uttered anything so definitely theological, we should rather deny that
   the words are theological, in the technical question-begging sense of
   the term, yet maintain that in an hour of intense preoccupation with
   His death no other words would have been adequate to express the whole
   heart and mind of our Lord.

   From this point of view, we must notice a common evasion of their
   import even by some who do not question that Jesus spoke them. It is
   pointed out, for instance, that the death is here set in line with the
   life of our Lord. He came not to be ministered unto but to minister,
   and (in particular, and at last, as His crowning service) to give His
   life a ransom for many. His death is the consummation of His life, and
   the consummation of His ministry; but it has no other end than His
   life, and we must not seek another interpretation for it. An extreme
   example of this is seen in Hollmann, [17] whose exegesis of the passage
   brings out the following result. Jesus came into the world to serve
   men, and especially to serve them by awakening them to that repentance
   which is the condition of entering the Kingdom of God and inheriting
   its blessings. So far, His ministry has not been without success; some
   have already repented, and entered into the Kingdom. But even where He
   has not proved successful, it is not yet necessary to despair: many
   will be won to repentance by His death who resisted all the appeal of
   His life. It is scarcely necessary to point out that the connection of
   ideas here is not in the least that which belongs to the words of
   Jesus. Hollmann actually speaks of a Glaubensurtheil, a conviction
   which Jesus held by faith, that even His death (tragic and
   disconcerting as we must suppose it to be) will, by the grace of the
   Father, nevertheless contribute to the success of His work, and win
   many whom He has yet failed to reach. But this completely leaves out
   the one thing to which the words of Jesus gives prominence -- the fact,
   namely, that the Son of Man came expressly to do a service which
   involved the giving of His life a ransom for many. Hollmann's
   interpretation means that Jesus could by faith in the Father reconcile
   Himself to His death as something which would, though it is not clear
   how, contribute to the carrying out of His vocation -- something which,
   in spite of appearances, would not prove inconsistent with it; but what
   the words in the gospel mean is that the death of Jesus, or the giving
   of His life a ransom for many, is itself the very soul of His vocation.
   He does not say that He can bear to die, because His death will win
   many to repentance who are yet impenitent, but that the object of His
   coming was to give His life a ransom for many.

   The same consideration discredits an interpretation like Wendt's, [18]
   which finds the key to the passage in Matthew 11: 29 f. Wendt lays all
   the stress on the effect to be produced on human character by realizing
   what the death of Jesus is. If men would only put on the yoke of Jesus
   and learn of Him -- if they would drink of His cup and be baptized with
   His baptism -- if, as St. Paul says, they would be conformed to His
   death, their souls would be liberated from the restless passions of
   pride and ambition by which James and John, and the other ten not less
   than they, were tormented, and death itself would cease to be a terror
   to them. However true this may be, one cannot look at the text without
   being impressed by its irrelevance as an interpretation. There is
   nothing in it to explain the introduction of Christ's death at all as
   the very end contemplated in His coming. There is nothing in it to
   explain either lutron, or anti, or pollon, or lutron anti pollon. In
   spite of the attention it has attracted, it is an ingenious vagary
   which has surely merited oblivion.

   In what direction, then, are we to seek the meaning? The only clue is
   that which is furnished by the passages in which our Lord Himself
   speaks of the soul and of the possibility of losing or ransoming it.
   Thus in Mark 8:34 f., immediately after the first announcement of His
   death, He calls the multitude to Him with His disciples, and says: If
   any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross
   and follow Me. For whoso will save his life (psuchen) shall lose it:
   but whoso shall lose his life (psuchen) for My sake and the gospel's,
   shall find it. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world
   and forfeit his life (psuchen)? For what can a man give in exchange for
   his life (antallagma tes psuches autou)?' It is clear from a passage
   like this that Jesus was familiar with the idea that the psuche or life
   of man, in the higher or lower sense of the term, might be lost, and
   that when it was lost there could be no compensation for it, as there
   was no means of buying it back. It is in the circle of such ideas that
   the words about giving His life a ransom for many must find their point
   of attachment, and it is not only for the simplest and most obvious
   interpretation, but for the most profound and the most consonant with
   the New Testament as a whole, that Jesus in this passage conceives the
   lives of the many as being somehow under forfeit, and teaches that the
   very object with which He came into the world was to lay down His own
   life as a ransom price that those to whom these forfeited lives
   belonged might obtain them again. This was the supreme service the Son
   of Man was to render to mankind; it demanded the supreme sacrifice, and
   was the path to supreme greatness, Anything short of this is in the
   circumstances an anticlimax; it falls far beneath the passion with
   which our Lord condenses into a single phrase the last meaning of His
   life and death.

   Nothing has been gained for the understanding of this passage by the
   elaborate investigation of the Hebrew or Aramaic equivalents of lutron.
   In truth it does not matter whether kphr or pdyv, whether g'lh or mchyr
   or purkana is most akin to it in the language which Jesus spoke; if
   dounai ten psuchen autou lutron anti pollon does not convey His idea,
   it will certainly not be conveyed by any of the precarious equivalents
   for this Greek expression which are offered for our acceptance. The
   best fruit of these attempts to get behind the Greek has been Ritschl's
   reference to Psalm 49:7 f. and Job 33:23 f., as passages furnishing a
   real clue to the mind of Christ. In both of these the Hebrew word kphr
   occurs, which Ritschl regards as the equivalent of lutron, and in both
   also the verb pdh is used, with which, rather than with kphr, Hollmann
   would connect the word of Jesus. But the ideas which the words express
   are inseparable: the kphr is in both passages that by means of which,
   or at the cost of which, the action of the verb pdh (to deliver) is
   accomplished. [19] The Psalm makes it particularly plain. What no man
   can do for his brother -- namely, give to God a ransom for him (kprv)
   so that he may still live always and not see corruption; what no man
   can do for his brother, because the redemption (pdyv ) of their soul is
   precious, and must be let alone for ever, this the Son of Man claims to
   do for many, and to do by giving His life a ransom for them. It seems
   hardly open to doubt that the world in which our Lord's mind moved as
   He spoke was that of the writer of the Psalm, and if this be so, it is
   possible to find in it confirmation for the meaning just assigned to
   His words. Dr. Driver [20] defines kphr as properly a covering (viz. of
   an offense), hence a propitiatory gift, but restricted by usage to a
   gift offered to propitiate or satisfy the avenger-of-blood, and so the
   satisfaction offered for a life, i. e., a ransom.' Without going into
   meaningless questions as to how the ransom was fixed, or to whom it was
   paid, it is important to recognize the fact that our Lord speaks of the
   surrender of His life in this way. A ransom is not wanted at all except
   where life has been forfeited, and the meaning of the sentence
   unambiguously is that the forfeited lives of many are liberated by the
   surrender of Christ's life, and that to surrender His life to do them
   this incalculable service was the very soul of His calling. If we find
   the same thought in St. Paul, we shall not say that the evangelist has
   Paulinized, but that St. Paul has sat at the feet of Jesus. And if we
   feel that such a thought carries us suddenly out of our depth -- that
   as the words fall on our minds we seem to hear the plunge of the lead
   into fathomless waters -- we shall not for that imagine that we have
   lost our way. By these things men live, and wholly therein is the life
   of our spirit. We cast ourselves on them, because they outgo us; in
   their very immensity, we are assured that God is in them. [21]

   One almost despairs of saying anything about the Lord's Supper which
   will not seem invalid to some upon critical or more general grounds.
   Our main interest is in the words which Jesus spoke, and in the light
   which these words throw on His own conception of His death. Here we are
   confronted at once by the paradoxical view of Spitta that in what
   actually took place on the occasion there was no reference to the death
   of Christ at all. What Jesus did in the upper room (so we are to
   suppose) was to anticipate with His disciples the Messianic Supper of
   the world to come. In that supper, according to Rabbinical and
   Apocalyptic writers, the good to be enjoyed is the Messiah Himself, and
   it is to this that Jesus refers when He speaks of the bread and wine as
   His own body and blood. He is preoccupied with the completion of His
   work, with the blessed prospect of the time when God shall have brought
   His kingdom to victory, and when from Him, the Messiah sent of God, the
   powers of knowledge and of eternal life shall flow unimpeded into the
   disciples as the gift of the meal which God prepares for those who are
   faithful to Him. The representation of the Supper in the evangelists is
   quite different, Spitta admits; but the form it there assumes; is due
   to the intervening death of Jesus, which compelled the disciples to
   give His words another turn. I do not feel it necessary to contest this
   construction of what took place. A conception of the Supper which sets
   aside the whole testimony of the New Testament to what it meant, which
   ignores its association with the Passover, the explicit references in
   every account of it to the shedding of Jesus' blood, and above all, the
   character expressly stamped upon it in the evangelists as a meal in
   which Jesus knew that He was sitting with the Twelve for the last time
   and was preoccupied with the idea of His parting from them, does not
   demand refutation. Nor is it entitled to forbid our asking -- on the
   basis of the narratives in our hands -- what Jesus said and did, and
   what is the bearing of this on the interpretation of His death? [22]

   There is at least a general consent in this, that Jesus took bread, and
   when He had broken it, or as He broke it, said, This is My body; that
   He took a cup with wine in it, or a cup into which He poured wine,
   saying as He did so, This is My blood, which is poured out for many.
   This is all that is admitted, e. g., by Hollmann, and it enables him to
   give the same interpretation to the supper as he gives to the word
   about the lutron [23] . Christ's death is in question, certainly, but
   it has no reference to those who are sitting at the table, and who are
   members of the Kingdom of God. The many in whose interest it takes
   place -- the many who are to have benefit by it -- are the same as the
   many for whom the ransom is to be given; they are the numbers, as yet
   impenitent, who will be won to penitence by the death of Jesus.
   According to this interpretation, the idea of a supper is a complete
   mistake. The persons at the table had really no interest in the death
   of Christ; they had already all that God could give. Hollmann,
   therefore, expunges from Mark as a liturgical insertion, intended to
   adapt the narrative to ecclesiastical custom, the very first word
   spoken by Jesus, Take (labete). In propriety, the disciples should not
   have taken, as His death meant nothing to them. He quotes, with
   approval, a remark of Schmiedel, The most significant thing is, at
   least in the first instance, the breaking of the bread and the pouring
   out of the wine, The distribution of these foods to be partaken of
   attaches itself to this as a second thing. So far as the main matter is
   concerned, it might have been treated as superfluous; but as they were
   sitting at table any how, it was natural. ' It is difficult to believe
   that this sort of thing is written seriously, if courtesy compels us to
   acknowledge that it is, we can only draw the melancholy conclusion that
   it is possible for the human mind to be serious even when it has
   completely lost contact with reality. The primary narrative of Mark
   begins by saying plainly, He took bread, and when He had given thanks
   He brake it and gave it to them and said, Take, this is My body. Then
   He took a cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, and
   they drank of it every one (pantes last and emphatic). And He said to
   them, This is My blood of the covenant shed for many.' This is not
   qualified by any other of the New Testament authorities, nor by the
   practice of the Church as the New Testament reveals it; and I submit
   that it is not open to any one to go behind it, and to tell us blankly
   out of his own head (for that is; the only authority left) that the
   bearing of what took place was really quite independent of this giving
   and taking, eating and drinking; and that while the death of Jesus was
   the subject of the symbolical actions of breaking the bread and pouring
   out the wine, and was no doubt meant to benefit some persons, it was a
   thing in which those who were present, and who at Jesus' word ate and
   drank the symbols of it, had no interest at all. Jesus made the bread
   and wine symbols of His death, this is not denied. He handed them to
   His disciples, pronouncing as He did so the very words in which He
   conferred on them this symbolical character. this also is not denied.
   But when He did so, it was not that the disciples might take them in
   this character. On the contrary, it was only because they were at their
   supper anyhow, and because bread and wine are naturally eaten and
   drunk. That is how bread and wine are disposed of in this world, but it
   has nothing to do with the story. If there is anybody in the world who
   finds this convincing, presumably it cannot be helped.

   But it is not only necessary to insist on the eating and drinking of
   the bread and wine, which as broken and outpoured symbolized Christ's
   death, and as eaten and drunk symbolized the interest of the disciples
   in that death, and their making it somehow their own; it is necessary
   to insist on what was further said by Jesus. All the evangelists in
   their narratives introduce the word covenant' (diatheke) in some
   construction or other. Mark has, This is My blood of the covenant
   (14:24). Matthew, according to some authorities (including that
   combination of Latin and Syriac versions to which critics seem inclined
   to ascribe a higher value than once seemed probable) has, This is My
   blood of the new covenant (26:28). Luke has what is apparently a
   Pauline form, This cup is the new covenant in My blood (22:20). For
   long it was an admitted point among critics that this was an
   indubitable word of Jesus. Brandt, whose criticism is skeptical enough,
   holds that the only historically certain words in the whole story are,
   This is My covenant blood, drink ye all of it. But even these words
   have lately been assailed in the determined effort to get behind the
   gospels. Three grounds have been assigned for questioning them. [24]
   The first is that the expression to haima mou tes diathekes is awkward
   in Greek; the second, that it is impossible to translate it into Hebrew
   or Aramaic; and the third, that the conception of the covenant owes its
   place in Christianity to St. Paul. Of these reasons the last obviously
   begs the question. It does not follow that because St. Paul makes use
   of an idea he originated it. There are very great ideas, indeed, of
   which St. Paul says, I delivered unto you that which also I received (1
   Corinthians 15:3 f.): why should not this be one of them? Does he not
   himself declare that it is one, when he prefaces his account of the
   supper -- including in it the idea of the new covenant in the blood of
   Jesus -- with the words, I received of the Lord that which also I
   delivered unto you? (1 Corinthians 11:23). The idea of a new covenant,
   and that of covenant blood, are Old Testament ideas; and if Jesus was
   conscious, nay, if it was the very essence of His consciousness, that,
   in relation both to law and prophecy, He came not to destroy but to
   fulfill, why should not He Himself have spoken the creative word? As
   for the other two reasons, that My blood of the covenant' is awkward in
   Greek, and that there are persons who cannot translate it into Hebrew,
   however true or interesting they may be, they are obviously irrelevant.
   It may be awkward in Greek or in any language to combine in one
   proposition the two ideas this is My blood, and this is covenant blood;
   but however awkward it may be, since they really are ideas which the
   mind can grasp, it must be possible to do it, in Greek or in any
   language. It does not, therefore, seem open to question, on any serious
   ground whatever, that Jesus at the last supper spoke of His blood as
   covenant blood. Now, what does this imply? To what set of ideas in the
   minds of His hearers, to what Old Testament associations does it attach
   itself, so as to be not merely a word, but an element in a living mind?
   We get the clue to the answer when we notice the form in which the
   words appear in Matthew, This is My blood of the new covenant, shed for
   many unto remission of sins. The added words here may be no more than
   an interpretative expansion of what Jesus said, but if they are no more
   than this they are also no less. They are an interpretative expansion
   by a mind in a position naturally to know and understand what Jesus
   meant.

   The Old Testament twice speaks of covenant,' in the sense in which God
   makes a covenant with his people. There is the covenant made with
   sacrifice at Sinai, in the account of which we have the phrase,

   Behold the blood of the covenant which the Lord hath made with you upon
   all these conditions' (Exodus 24:8).

   Here, it is sometimes said, is the original of the words found in our
   evangelists; and as nothing is said in Exodus about the forgiveness of
   sins, and as the sacrifices mentioned there are not sin or guilt
   offerings, but burnt offerings and peace offerings, it is argued that
   the insertion in Matthew of the clause for forgiveness of sins' is a
   mistake. [25] The inference is hasty. Covenant blood is sacrificial
   blood, and we have every reason to believe that sacrificial blood
   universally, and not only in special cases, was associated with
   propitiatory power. The atoning function of sacrifice,' as Robertson
   Smith put it, speaking of primitive times, is not confined to a
   particular class of oblation, but belongs to all sacrifices.' [26] Dr.
   Driver has expressed the same opinion with regard to the Levitical
   legislation in which the key to the language of our passage must be
   found. Criticizing Ritschl's explanation of sacrifice and its effect,
   he says, It seems better to suppose that though the burnt-, peace-, and
   meat-offerings were not offered expressly, like the sin- and
   guilt-offerings, for the forgiveness of sin, they nevertheless (in so
   far as Kipper is predicated of them) were regarded as "covering," or
   neutralizing, the offerer's unworthiness to appear before God, and so,
   though in a much less degree than the sin- or guilt-offering, as
   effecting Kappara in the sense ordinarily attached to the word, viz.
   "propitiation." [27] Instead of saying in a much less degree,' I should
   prefer to say with a less specific reference or application,' but the
   point is not material. What it concerns us to note is that the New
   Testament, while it abstains from interpreting Christ's death by any
   special prescriptions of the Levitical law, constantly uses sacrificial
   language to describe that death, and in doing so unequivocally
   recognizes in it, a propitiatory character-- in other words, a
   reference to sin and its forgiveness. But there is something further to
   be said. The passage in Exodus is not the only one in the Old Testament
   to which reference is here made. In the thirty-first chapter of
   Jeremiah we have the sublime prophecy of a new covenant -- a new
   covenant which is indeed but the efficacious renewal of the old, for
   there is but one God, and His grace is one -- a new covenant, the very
   condition and foundation of which is the forgiveness of sins.

   They shall all know Me from the least to the greatest, for I will
   forgive their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more'
   (Jeremiah 31:34).

   It is this which is present to the mind of our Lord as He says of the
   outpoured wine, This is My blood of the covenant. He is establishing,
   at the cost of His life, the new covenant, the new religious relation
   between God and man, which has the forgiveness of sins as its
   fundamental blessing. He speaks as knowing that that blessing can only
   become ours through His death, and as the condition upon which it
   depends His death can be presented as a propitiatory sacrifice. It is
   as though He had pointed to the prophecy in Jeremiah, and said, This
   day is this Scripture fulfilled before your eyes. He had already, we
   might think, attached to Himself all that is greatest in the ideals and
   hopes of the Old Testament -- the Messiah is sovereignty of the 2nd and
   of the 110th Psalm, and the tragic and glorious calling of the Servant
   of the Lord; but there is something which transcends both, and which
   gives the sublimest expression to our Lord's consciousness of Himself
   and His work, when He says, This is My blood of the covenant. It is a
   word which gathers up into it the whole promise of prophecy and the
   whole testimony of the apostles; it is the focus of revelation, in
   which the Old Testament and the New are one. The power that is in it is
   the power of the passion in which the Lamb of God bears the sin of the
   world. It is no misapprehension, therefore, but a true rendering of the
   mind of Christ, when Matthew calls the covenant new, and defines the
   shedding of blood by reference to the remission of sins. There is
   really only one objection which can be made, and it is made
   unceasingly, to this interpretation of the words of Jesus. It is that
   it is inconsistent with what is elsewhere His unmistakable teaching.
   The very burden of His message, we are told, is that God forgives
   unconditionally, out of His pure fatherly love. This love reaches of
   itself deeper far than sin, and bestows pardon freely and joyfully on
   the penitent. It is nothing less than a direct contradiction of this
   gospel of the free love of God when we make forgiveness dependent upon
   a sacrificial, that is a propitiatory, virtue in the death of Christ.
   It misrepresents God's character, and in so doing destroys the gospel.
   We cannot, it is argued, on the strength of one word, and that a
   dubious word, run counter to the sense and spirit of our Lord's
   teaching as a whole. So, in substance, a large school of critics and
   theologians. How can we answer such a contention?

   As for the alleged dubiety of the word, we have said enough already; it
   only remains to deal with its alleged inconsistency with the rest of
   our Lord's teaching. This is usually asserted in the most unqualified
   fashion, but if we look back on what we have already seen to be our
   Lord's conception of Himself and His calling from the beginning we may
   well question it. The love of God, according to Jesus, is no doubt
   unconditionally free, but it is not an abstraction. It does not exist
   in vacuo: so far as the forgiveness of sins is concerned -- and it is
   with the love of God in this relation that we have to do -- it exists
   in and is represented by Jesus' own presence in the world: His presence
   in a definite character, and with a definite work to do, which can only
   be done at a definite cost. The freeness of God's love is not
   contradicted by these facts; on the contrary, it is these facts which
   enable us to have any adequate idea of what that love really is. To say
   that it is inconsistent with God's free love to make the forgiveness of
   sins dependent on the death of Jesus, is exactly the same (in one
   particular relation) a, to say (in general) that it is inconsistent
   with God's free love that entrance into His kingdom and participation
   in its blessings should only be possible through the presence of Jesus
   in the world, His work in it, and the attitude which men assume towards
   Him. Those who accept the latter should not deny the former. If we give
   any place at all to the idea of mediation, there is no reason why we
   should reject the idea of propitiation, for propitiation is merely a
   mode of mediation, a mode of it no doubt which brings home to us
   acutely what we owe to the Mediator, and makes us feel that though
   forgiveness is free to us it does not cost nothing to Him. Of course,
   if we choose to say that the Son has no place in the gospel at all, but
   only the Father, we may reject the great word about covenant-blood, or
   rather we must reject it; if He has no place in the gospel at all, we
   have no obligations to Him; we do not owe Him anything, least of all
   are we indebted to His death for the forgiveness of sins. But there is
   something in such language which when confronted with the gospels can
   only strike once as utterly abstract, unconvincing, and unreal. It does
   not answer to the relation of sinful souls to Jesus, to their devotion,
   their gratitude, their sense of undying obligation. It was not for a
   forgiveness with which He had in the last resort nothing to do that
   they poured their precious ointment on His head and wet His feet with
   tears. No; but in the depths of their being they had the dim sense of
   His passion in their pardon, and were conscious of an obligation for it
   to Him which they could never repay. The love of God, I repeat, free as
   it is to sinful men, unconditionally free, is never conceived in the
   New Testament, either by our Lord Himself or by any of His followers,
   as an abstraction. Where the forgiveness of sin is concerned, it is not
   conceived as having reality or as taking effect apart from Christ. It
   is a real thing to us as it is mediated through Him, through His
   presence in the world, and ultimately through His death. The love of
   God by which we are redeemed from sin is a love which we do not know
   except as it comes in this way and at this cost; consequently, whatever
   we owe as sinners to the love of God, we owe to the death of Jesus. It
   is no more a contradiction of God's free love to the sinful, when we
   say that Christ's death is the ground of forgiveness, than it is a
   contradiction of God's fatherly goods rill to men in general, when we
   admit the word of Jesus, No man cometh unto the Father but by me. In
   both cases equally, Christ stands between God and man; in both cases
   equally it is at cost to Him that God becomes our God. Why should we be
   loathe to become His debtors? The Christian faith is a specific form of
   dependence on God, and to cavil at the atonement is to begin the
   process of giving it away in bits. It is to refuse to allow it to be
   conditioned by Christ at the central and vital point, the point at
   which the sinner is reconciled to God; and if we can do without Christ
   there, we can do without Him altogether. The process which begins with
   denying that we owe to Him and to His death the forgiveness of sins,
   ends by denying that He has any proper place in the gospel at all. It
   is not either from His own lips, or from the lips of any of the
   apostles, that we so learn Christ.

   [4] In Luke 3:22, Codex Bezae gives the heavenly voice in this form.
   Probably Jesus told the stories of His baptism and temptation often,
   giving more or less fully, with brief allusions to Old Testament words
   or fuller citation of them, such hints of His experience as His hearers
   could appreciate. Certainly there could be no truer index to His life
   than a combination of Psalm 2:7 with Isaiah 42:1 ff. -- the Son of God
   as King, and the Servant of the Lord; and this combination, if we go
   upon the evidence and not upon any dogmatic conception of what is or is
   not historical, dates from the high hour in which Jesus entered on His
   public work, and is not an afterbirth of disappointing experiences.

   [5] Wellhausen asserts that the temptation in Mark 1:12 f. is not
   Messianic; the Messianic temptation in Mark does not follow the
   baptism, but the Messianic confession of Peter at ch. 8:29; and it is
   Peter, not der leibhaftige Satan,' to whom the severe rebuke of Jesus
   is historically addressed. This is one of his main arguments for
   regarding Mark as older than Q, the source to which the temptation
   narratives of Matthew and Luke are traced. But it surely needs no proof
   that however summarily he may refer to it, the temptation associated by
   Mark with the baptism must have had its character determined by the
   baptism; and on Wellhausen's own showing the whole significance of the
   baptism for Mark is that it indicates the birth of the Messianic
   consciousness in Jesus. He entered the water an ordinary Israelite, and
   emerged the Messiah. A temptation in this context can have been nothing
   but a Messianic temptation. -- Einleitung in die drei ersten Evangelien

   (Hosea 6 and Ezekiel 37) and that it is thus highly fitting that the
   allegory of the death and resurrection of the nation should be also the
   allegory of the death and resurrection of the nation's true

   [15] It is undoubtedly disappointing that in spite of the reiterated

   He argues that the two express words of our Lord about His death
   (Matthew 20:28 and 26:28) have no connection with that chapter, and he
   discredits Luke 22:37 (which Hollmann accepts) as part of a passage

   permutations and combinations of the words in the text, and deciding
   whether anti pollon is to be construed with lutron or with dounai, or
   with the two in combination, or in some other ingenious or perverse
   way. It is a sentence which leaves meaning on the mind, not the bits
   into which it can be broken. Ritschl sums up his interpretation thus:
   Der Sinn des Ausdrucks Jesu ist also: Ich bin gekommen anstatt derer,
   welche eine Werthgabe als Schutzmittel gegen das Sterben fur sich oder
   far Andere an Gott zu leisten vergeblich erstreben wurden, dasselbe
   durch die Hingebung meines Lebens im Tode an Gott zu verwirklichen,
   aber eben nur anstatt derer, welche dutch Glauben und
   selbstverleugnende Nachfolge meiner Person die Bedingung erfullen,

   on kphr and kpr see in the last paragraph of Driver's article on
   Propitiation referred to above. Feine, in his Theologie des Neuen
   Testaments, 127 f., mentions four points of attachment for this ransom
   saying in Isaiah 53, which show in combination that we are justified in
   using the ideas of that prophecy as a key to it. (1) The words dounai
   ten psuchen autou recall theparedothe eis thanaton he psuche autou of
   Isaiah 53:12. (2) The general idea of service pervades both. The
   subject of Isaiah 53 is the humiliation and exaltation of the Servant
   of the Lord -- His humiliation (as here that of Jesus) as the way to
   exaltation. (3) The peculiar use of many' in both: My righteous Servant
   shall justify many,' He bare the sin of many'; to give His life a
   ransom for many.' (4) The correspondence in meaning between the lutron
   as that by which a forfeited life is redeemed, and the giving of the
   life or soul as an 'sm or guilt-offering by which legal satisfaction
   was rendered for an injury or wrong (Isaiah 53:10). There is a worth or
   goodness in Jesus' surrender of his life which outweighs the whole
   wrong which the world's sin inflicts upon God; and He came that at this
   cost the sin of the world might be outweighed.

CHAPTER 2
The Earliest Christian Preaching

   1. THUS far we have confined ourselves to the words of Jesus. The
   divine necessity of His death, indicated in the Old Testament and
   forming the basis of all His teaching regarding it, is the primary
   truth; the nature of that necessity begins to be revealed as the death
   is set in relation to the ransoming of many, and to the institution of
   a new covenant -- that is, a new religion, having as its fundamental
   blessing the forgiveness of sins. I do not think this view of our
   Lord's mind as to His own death can be shaken by appealing to His
   experience in the garden, as though that proved that to the last day of
   His life the inevitableness of death remained for Him an open question.

   The divine necessity to lay down His life for men, which we have been
   led to regard as a fixed point in His mind, did not preclude such
   conflicts as are described in the last pages of the gospel; rather was
   it the condition of our Lord's victory in them. At a distance, it was
   possible to think of death in its heroic and ideal aspects only, as the
   fulfillment of a divine calling, an infinite service rendered in love
   to man; but as the fatal hour approached, its realistic and repellent
   aspects predominated over everything; it stood out before the mind and
   imagination of Jesus -- we might almost say it obtruded itself upon His
   senses -- as a scene and an experience of treachery, desertion, hate,
   mockery, injustice, anguish, shame. It is not hard to conceive that in
   these circumstances Jesus should have prayed as He did in the garden, O
   My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me, even though
   the unmoved conviction of His soul was that He had come to give His
   life a ransom for many. It is one thing to have the consciousness of so
   high a calling, another to maintain and give effect to it under
   conditions from which all that is ideal and divine seems to have
   withdrawn. It is one thing not to count one's life dear, or to make
   much of it, in comparison with great ends which are to be attained by
   laying it down; it is another to lay it down, encompassed not by the
   gratitude and adoration of those for whom the sacrifice is made, but by
   mocking and spitting and scorn. This was what Jesus did, and He
   attained to it through the agony in the garden. The agony does not
   represent a doubt as to His calling, but the victorious assertion of
   His calling against the dreadful temptation to renounce it which came
   in the hour and with the power of darkness. Not that I should venture
   to say, as is sometimes said, that the realization, as they approached,
   of the sensible and moral horrors of the death He was to die was all
   that wrung from Jesus that last appeal to the Father, all that made His
   soul exceeding sorrowful even unto death, and put Him in agonia -- that
   is, in deadly fear: [28] this does not answer to what we know of the
   courage of martyrs. Though one shrinks from analyzing the cry of the
   heart to God in its anguish, it is difficult to avoid the impression
   that both here and in the experience of forsaking on the cross, we are
   in contact with something out of proportion to all that men could do to
   Jesus, something that seems to call for connection, if we would
   understand it, with realities more mysterious and profound. Language
   like Calvin's, [29] who says plainly that Jesus endured in His soul the
   dreadful torments of a condemned and lost man, may well be repellent to
   us; there is something unrealizable and even impious in such words. But
   it does not follow that there was nothing true, nothing in contact with
   reality, in the state of mind which inspired them. [30] Not with any
   logical hardness, not as carrying out aggressively to its issue any
   theological theory, but sensible of the thick darkness in which,
   nevertheless (we are sure), God is, may we not urge that these
   experiences of deadly fear and of desertion are of one piece with the
   fact that in His death and in the agony in the garden through which He
   accepted that death as the cup which the Father gave Him to drink,
   Jesus was taking upon Him the burden of the world's sin, consenting to
   be, and actually being, numbered with the transgressors? They cannot
   but have some meaning, and it must be part of the great meaning which
   makes the Cross of Christ the gospel for sinful men. No doubt there are
   those who reject this meaning altogether; it is dogmatico-religious,
   not historico-religious, and no more is needed to? condemn it. But a
   dogmatico-religious interpretation of Christ's death -- that is, an
   interpretation which finds in it an eternal and divine meaning, laden
   with gospel -- is so far from being self evidently wrong, that it is
   imperatively required by the influence which that death has had in the
   history of the Christian religion. Such an interpretation carries out,
   through the experiences of His death, thoughts as to its significance
   which we owe to Jesus Himself, and connects these thoughts and
   experiences with the subsequent testimony of the apostles. In other
   words, to read the accounts of Gethsemane and Calvary in this sense is
   to read them in line at once with the words of Jesus and with the words
   of those who were first taught by His spirit; it is to secure at once
   the unity of the gospels with themselves, and their unity, in the main
   truth which it teaches, with the rest of the New Testament. To call
   such an interpretation dogmatico-religious as opposed to
   historico-religious either has no meaning, or has a meaning which would
   deny to the Person and Work of Jesus any essential place in the
   Christian religion. But if the death of Jesus has eternal significance
   -- if it has a meaning which has salvation in it for all men and for
   all times; a meaning which we discover in Scripture as we look back
   from it and look forward; a meaning which is the key to all that goes
   before and to all that comes after (and such a meaning I take it to
   have, indisputably) -- then Gethsemane and Calvary cannot be invoked to
   refute, but only to illustrate, the dogmatic' interpretation. They are
   too great to be satisfied by anything else. [31]

   It does not follow, of course, that they were understood at once, even
   in the light of our Lord's words, by those whom He left as His
   witnesses. The mind can easily retain words the meaning of which it
   only imperfectly apprehends. It can retain words by which it is in the
   first instance moved and impressed, rather than enlightened. It can
   retain words which are sure, when reflection awakens, to raise many
   questions, to ask for definition in a great variety of relations; and
   it can retain them without at first having any consciousness of these
   questions whatever. It is in the highest degree probable that it was so
   with the disciples of Jesus. We can easily believe that they had right
   impressions from our Lord's words, before they had clear ideas about
   them. We can understand even that it might be natural enough for them
   to ascribe to Jesus directly what was only indirectly due to Him,
   because in the absence of philosophical reflection they were not
   conscious of the difference. Not that one would include under this head
   the creative words of Jesus already referred to about the ransom and
   the covenant blood; these bear the stamp of originality, not of
   reflection, upon them; it is their greatness to explain all things and
   to be explained by none. But before proceeding to examine the ideas of
   the primitive Christian Church on this subject, it is necessary to give
   an explicit utterance on the Resurrection, and the gospel presentation
   of it.

   The Resurrection of Jesus from the dead is here assumed to have taken
   place, and, moreover, to have had the character which is ascribed to it
   in the New Testament. It is not sufficient to say that there were
   appearances of the Jesus who had died to certain persons -- appearances
   the significance of which is exhausted when we say that they left on
   the minds of those who were favored with them the conviction that Jesus
   had somehow broken the banels of death. It is quite true that St. Paul,
   in setting before the Corinthians the historical evidence for the
   Resurrection, enumerates various occasions on which the Risen Lord was
   seen, and says nothing about Him except that on these occasions He
   appeared to Peter, to James, to the Twelve, to more than five hundred
   at once, and so on: this was quite sufficient for his purpose. But
   there is no such thing in the New Testament as an appearance of the
   Risen Savior in which He merely appears. He is always represented as
   entering into relation to those who see Him in other ways than by a
   flash upon the inner or the outer eye. He establishes other
   communications between Himself and His own besides those which can be
   characterized in this way. It may be that a tendency to materialize the
   supernatural has affected the evangelical narrative here or there --
   that Luke, for instance, who makes the Holy Spirit descend upon Jesus
   in bodily form as a dove went involuntarily beyond the apostolic
   tradition in making the Risen One speak of His flesh and bones, and eat
   a bit of roast fish before the disciples, to convince them that He was
   no mere ghost; it may be so, though the mode of Christ's being, in the
   days before His final withdrawal, is so entirely beyond our
   comprehension, that it is rash to be too peremptory about it; but even
   if it were so, it would not affect the representation as a whole which
   the gospels give of the Resurrection, and of the relation of the Risen
   One to His disciples. It would not affect the fact that He not only
   appeared to them, but spoke to them. It would not affect the fact that
   He not only appeared to them, but taught them, and in particular gave
   them a commission in which the meaning of His own life and work, and
   their calling as connected with it, are finally declared.

   Without going in detail into the critical questions here involved, yet
   claiming to speak with adequate knowledge of them, I feel it quite
   impossible to believe that this representation of the gospels has
   nothing in it. How much the form of it may owe to the conditions of
   transmission, repetition, condensation, and even interpretation, we may
   not be able precisely to say, since these conditions must have varied
   indefinitely and in ways we cannot calculate; but the fact of a great
   charge, the general import of which was thoroughly understood, seems
   indisputable. All the gospels give it in one form or another; and even
   if we concede that the language in which it is expressed owes something
   to the Church's consciousness of what it had come to possess through
   its risen Lord, this does not affect in the least the fact that every
   known form of the evangelic tradition puts such a charge, or
   instruction, or commission, into the lips of Jesus after His
   Resurrection. [32]

   What, then, is the content of this teaching or commission of the Risen
   Savior, which all the evangelists give in one form or another? Luke has
   some peculiar matter in which he tells how Jesus opened the minds of
   His disciples to understand the Scriptures, recalling the words He had
   spoken while He was yet with them, how that all things must be
   fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets
   and in the Psalms concerning Him. If Jesus spoke to His disciples at
   all about what had befallen Him, all that we have already seen as to
   His teaching prepares us to believe that it was on this line. Alike for
   Him and for the disciples the divine necessity for His death could only
   be made out by connecting it with intimations in the Word of God. But
   apart from this instruction, which is referred to by Luke alone, there
   is the common testimony with which mainly concerned. In Matthew it runs
   thus:

   Jesus came and spoke to them saying, All power has been given to Me in
   heaven and on earth. Go and make disciples of all the nations,
   baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
   Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded
   you. And lo, I am with you all the days until the end of the world'
   (Matthew 28:18 ff.).

   Here we notice as the essential things in our Lord's words

   (1) the universal mission;

   (2) baptism;

   (3) the promise of a spiritual presence.

   In Mark, as is well known, the original ending has been lost. The last
   chapter, however, was in all probability the model on which the last in
   Matthew was shaped, and what we have at present instead of it
   reproduces the same ideas.

   Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that
   believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth
   shall be condemned' (Mark 16:15 f.).

   What follows, as to the signs which should attend on those who believe
   -- in My name they shall cast out demons, they shall speak with new
   tongues, they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly
   thing it shall not hurt them, they shall lay hands on the sick, and
   they shall recover' -- shows how easy it was to expand the words of
   Jesus on the basis of experience, just as a modern preacher sometimes
   introduces Jesus speaking in His own person, and promising what the
   preacher knows by experience He can and will do; but it does not follow
   from this that the commission to preach and its connection with baptism
   are unhistorical. In Luke the commission is connected with the teaching
   above referred to. He said to them, Thus it is written that the Christ
   should suffer, and should rise from the dead on the third day, and that
   repentance for remission of sins should be preached in His name to all
   the nations, beginning from Jerusalem' (Luke 24:46 f.). Here again we
   have

   (1) the universal commission;

   (2) repentance and remission of sins. In John what corresponds to this
   runs as follows:

   Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace be unto you. As the Father
   hath sent Me, even so send I you. And when He had said this, He
   breathed on them and saith to them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit; whose
   soever sins ye forgive they are forgiven unto them; whose soever sins
   ye retain they are retained' (John 20:21 f.).

   Here once more we have

   (1) a mission, though its range is not defined;

   (2) a message, the sum and substance of which has to do with
   forgiveness of sins; and

   (3) a gift of the Holy Ghost

   But what,' it may be asked,' has all this to do with the death of
   Jesus? The death of Jesus is not expressly referred to here, except in
   what Luke tells about His opening the minds of the disciples to
   understand the Scriptures, and that simply repeats what we have already
   had before us.'

   The answer is apparent if we consider the context in which the ideas
   found in this commission are elsewhere found in the New Testament. In
   all its forms the commission has to do either with baptism (so in
   Matthew and Mark) or with the remission of sins (so in Luke and John).
   These are but two forms of the same thing, for in the world of New
   Testament ideas baptism and the remission of sins are inseparably
   associated. But the remission of sins has already been connected with
   the death of Jesus by the words spoken at the supper, or if not by the
   very words spoken, at least by the significance ascribed to His blood
   as covenant-blood; and if the Risen Savior, in giving His disciples
   their final commission, makes the forgiveness of sins the burden of the
   gospel they are to preach, which seems to me indubitable, He at the
   same time puts at the very heart of the gospel His own
   covenant-founding, sin-annulling death. This inference from the
   evangelic passages which record the intercourse of the Risen Lord with
   His disciples may strike some, at the first glance, as artificial; but
   the air of artificiality will pass away, provided we admit the reality
   of that intercourse, and its relation both to the past teaching of
   Jesus and to the future work of the apostles. There is a link wanted to
   unite what we have seen in the gospels with what we find when we pass
   from them to the other books of the New Testament, and that link is
   exactly supplied by a charge of Jesus to His disciples to make the
   forgiveness of sins the center of their gospel, and to attach it to the
   rite by which men were admitted to the Christian society. In an age
   when baptism and remission of sins were inseparable ideas -- when, so
   to speak, they interpenetrated each other -- it is no wonder that the
   sense of our Lord's charge is given in some of the gospels in one form,
   in some in the other' that here He bids them baptize, and there preach
   the forgiveness of sins. It is not the form on which we can lay stress,
   but only the import. The import, however, is secure. Its historicity
   can only be questioned by those who reduce the resurrection to mere
   appearances of Jesus to the disciples -- appearances which, as
   containing nothing but themselves, and as unchecked by any other
   relation to reality, are essentially visionary. And its significance is
   this' it is the very thing which is wanted to evince the unity of the
   New Testament, and the unity and consistency of the Christian religion,
   as they have been presented to us in the historical tradition of the
   Church. Here, where the final revelation is made by our Lord of all
   that His presence in the world means and involves, we find Him dealing
   with ideas -- baptism and forgiveness -- which alike in His own earlier
   teaching, and in the subsequent teaching of the apostles, can only be
   defined by relation to His death.

   When we pass from the gospels to the earliest period of the Church's
   life we are again immersed in critical difficulties. It is not easy to
   use the book of Acts in a way which will command universal agreement.
   Renan's remark that the closing chapters are the most purely historical
   of anything in the New Testament, while the opening ones are the least
   historical, is at least plausible enough to make one cautious. But
   while this is so, there is a general consent that in the early chapters
   there is a very primitive type of doctrine. The Christian imagination
   may have transfigured the day of Pentecost, and turned the ecstatic
   praise of the first disciples into a speaking in foreign languages,
   [33] but some source or sources of the highest value underlie the
   speeches of Peter. They do not represent the nascent catholicism of the
   beginning of the second century, but the very earliest type of
   preaching Jesus by men who had kept company with Him. It would be out
   of place here to dwell on the primitive character of the Christology,
   but it is necessary to refer to it as a guarantee for the historical
   character of the speeches in which it occurs. Consider, then, passages
   like these:

   Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and
   wonders and signs which God did by Him in the midst of you, even as ye
   yourselves know' (2:22);

   God hath made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified'
   (2:36);

   Jesus of Nazareth, how that God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost and
   with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were
   oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him' (10:38).

   It is impossible to deny that in words like these we have a true echo
   of the earliest Christian preaching. And it is equally impossible to
   deny that the sotetiology which accompanies this Christology is as
   truly primitive. What then is it, and what, in particular, is the place
   taken in it by the death of Jesus?

   It is sometimes asserted broadly that the real subject of these early
   speeches in Acts is not the death of Jesus but; the resurrection; the
   death, it is said, has no significance, assigned to it; it is only a
   difficulty to be got over. But there is a great deal of confusion in
   this. No doubt the apostles were witnesses of the resurrection, and the
   discourses in these chapters are specimens of their testimony. The
   resurrection is emphasized in them with various motives. Sometimes the
   motive may be called apologetic, the idea is that in spite of the death
   it is still possible to believe in Jesus as the Messiah; God by raising
   Him from the dead has exalted Him to this dignity. Sometimes it may be
   called evangelistic. You killed Him, the preacher says again and again
   (2:23 f., 3:14 f. and 5:30 f., and God exalted Him to His right hand.
   In these two appreciations of Jesus lies the motive for a great
   spiritual change in sinful men. Sometimes, again, the resurrection is
   referred to in connection with the gift of the Spirit; the new life in
   the Church, with its wonderful manifestations, attests the exaltation
   of Jesus (2:33). Sometimes, once more, it is connected with His return,
   either to bring times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord (3:20
   f.), or as Judge of the quick and the dead (&gt;10:42). But this
   preoccupation with the resurrection in various aspects and relations
   does not mean that for the first preachers of the gospel the death of
   Jesus had no significance, or no fundamental significance. Still less
   does it mean that the death of Jesus was nothing to them but a
   difficulty in the way of retaining their faith in His Messiahship, a
   difficulty which the resurrection enabled them to surmount -- its
   sinister significance being discounted, so to speak, by the splendor of
   this supreme miracle. This last idea, that the cross in itself is
   nothing but a scandal, and that all the New Testament interpretations
   of it are but ways of getting over the scandal, cannot be too
   emphatically rejected.

   1. It ignores, in the first place, all that has been already
   established as to our Lord's own teaching about the necessity and the
   meaning of His death -- which has nothing to do with its being a
   skandalon. And it ignores, in the second place, the spiritual power of
   Christ's death in those who believe in Him, alike as the New Testament
   exhibits it, and as it is seen in all subsequent ages of the Church.
   The gospel would never have been known as the word of the cross' if the
   interpretation of the cross had merely been an apologetic device for
   surmounting the theoretical difficulties involved in the conception of
   a crucified Messiah. Yet nothing is commoner than to represent the
   matter thus. The apostles, it is argued, had to find some way of
   getting over the difficulty of the crucified Messiah theoretically, as
   well as practically; the resurrection enabled them to get over it
   practically, for it annulled the death; and the various theories of a
   saving significance ascribed to the death enabled them to get over it
   theoretically -- that; is all. Nothing, I venture to say, could be more
   hopelessly out of touch alike with New Testament teaching and with all
   Christian experience than such a reading of the facts. A doctrine of
   the death of Jesus, which was merely the solution of an abstract
   difficulty -- the answer to a conundrum -- could never have become what
   the doctrine of the death of Jesus is in the New Testament -- the
   center of gravity in the Christian world. It could never have had
   stored up in it the redeeming virtue of the gospel. It could never have
   been the hiding-place of God's power, the inspiration of all Christian
   praise. Whatever the doctrine of Jesus' death may be, it is the
   feeblest of all misconceptions to trace, it to the necessity of saying
   something about the death which should as far as possible remove the
   scandal of it. I delivered unto you first of all,' says St. Paul to the
   Corinthians,' that which I also received, that Christ died for our
   sins, according to the Scriptures' (1 Corinthians 15:3). St. Paul must
   have received this doctrine from members of the primitive Church. He
   must have received it in the place which he gave it in his own
   preaching -- that is, as the first and fundamental thing in the gospel.
   He must have received it within seven years -- if we follow some recent
   chronologies, within a very much shorter period -- of the death of
   Jesus. Even if the book of Acts were so preoccupied with the
   resurrection that it paid no attention to the independent significance
   of the death, it would be perfectly fair, on the ground of this
   explicit reference of St. Paul, to supplement its outline of primitive
   Christian doctrine with some definite teaching of atonement; but when
   we look closely at the speeches in Acts, we find that our situation is
   much more favorable. They contain a great deal which enables us to see
   how the primitive Church was taught to think and feel on this important
   subject.

   Here we have to consider such points as these.

   (1) The death of Christ is repeatedly presented, as in our Lord's own
   teaching, in the light of a divine necessity. It took place by the
   determined counsel and foreknowledge of God' (2:23). That His Christ
   should suffer, was what God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets
   (3:18). In His death, Jesus was the stone which the builders rejected,
   but which God made the head of the corner (4:1). All the enemies of
   Jesus, both Jew and Gentile, could only do to Him what God's hand and
   counsel had determined before should be done (4:28). A divine
   necessity, we must remember, is not a blind but a seeing one. To find
   the necessity for the death of Jesus in the word of God means to find
   that His death is not only inevitable but indispensable, an essential
   part of the work He had to do. Not blank but intelligible and moral
   necessity is meant here.

   Hence (2) we notice further the frequent identification, in these early
   discourses, of the suffering Messiah with the Servant of the Lord in
   the Book of Isaiah. The God of our Fathers hath glorified His Servant
   Jesus' (3:13).

   Of a truth, in this city, both Herod and Pontius Pilate were gathered
   together against Thy Holy Servant Jesus' (4:27).

   The same identification is involved in the account of Philip and the
   Ethiopian eunuch. The place of the Scripture which the eunuch had was
   the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, and beginning from that Scripture
   Philip preached to him Jesus (8:35). We cannot forget that the impulse
   to this connection was given by our Lord Himself, and that it runs
   through His whole ministry, from His baptism, in which the heavenly
   voice spoke to Him words applied to the Servant of the Lord in Isaiah
   43:1, to the last night of His life when He applied to Himself the
   mysterious saying, He was numbered with transgressors (Luke 22:37). The
   divine necessity to suffer is here elevated into a specific divine
   necessity, namely, to fulfill through suffering the vocation of one who
   bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

   This connection of ideas in the primitive Church is made clearer still,
   when we notice

   (3) that the great blessing of the gospel, offered in the name of
   Jesus, is the forgiveness of sins.

   This is the refrain of every apostolic sermon. Thus in 3:38: Repent and
   be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto remission
   of your sins. ' In 3:19, immediately after the words, the things that
   God declared before through the mouth of all the prophets, that Jesus
   Christ should suffer, He thus fulfilled, we read: Repent therefore and
   turn that your sins may be blotted out.' In 5:31 Jesus is exalted a
   Prince and a Savior to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
   sins. In 10:43, after rehearsing in outline the life, death, and
   resurrection of Jesus, Peter concludes his sermon in the house of
   Cornelius. To Him bear all the prophets witness, that every one who
   believes in Him shall receive forgiveness of sins through His name. '
   This prominence given to the remission of sins is not accidental, and
   must not be separated from the context essential to it in Christianity.
   It is part of a whole or system of ideas, and other parts which belong
   to the same whole with it in the New Testament are baptism and the
   death of Christ. The book of Acts, like all other books in the New
   Testament, was written inside of the Christian society, and for those
   who were at home inside; it was not written for those who had no more
   power of interpreting what stood on the page than the letter itself
   supplied. It does not seem to me in the least illegitimate, but on the
   contrary both natural and necessary, to take all these references to
   the forgiveness of sins and to baptism as references at the same time
   to the saving significance (in relation to sin) of the death of Jesus.
   This is what is suggested when Jesus is identified with the Servant of
   the Lord. This is what we are prepared for by the teaching of Jesus,
   and by the great commission; and we are confirmed in it by what we find
   in the rest of the New Testament. It is not a sufficient answer to this
   to say that the connection of ideas asserted here between the
   forgiveness of sins or baptism, on the one hand, and the death of Jesus
   on the other, is not explicit; it is self-evident to any one who
   believes that there is such a thing as Christianity as a whole, and
   that it is coherent and consistent with itself, and who reads with a
   Christian mind. The assumption of such a connection at once articulates
   all the ideas of the book into a system, and shows it to be at one with
   the gospels and epistles; and such an assumption, for that very reason,
   vindicates itself.

   Besides the references to baptism and the forgiveness of sins, we ought
   to notice also

   (4) the reference in 2:42 to the Lord's Supper. They continued
   steadfastly . . . in the breaking of the bread.'

   It may seem to some excessively venturous to base anything on the
   Sacraments when everything connected with them is being brought into
   dispute, and their very connection with Jesus is denied. But without
   going into the infinite and mostly irrelevant discussions which have
   been raised on the subject, I venture to say that the New Testament
   nowhere gives us the idea of an unbaptized Christian -- by one Spirit
   we were all baptized into one body (1 Corinthians 12:13) -- and that
   Paul, in regulating the observance of the Supper at Corinth, regulates
   it as part of the Christian tradition which goes back for its
   authority, through the primitive Church, to Christ Himself. I received
   of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you' (1 Corinthians
   11:23). In other words, there was no such thing known to Paul as a
   Christian society without baptism as its rite of initiation, and the
   Supper as its rite of communion. And if there was no such thing known
   to Paul, there was no such thing in the world. There is nothing in
   Christianity more primitive than the Sacraments, and the Sacraments,
   wherever they exist, are witnesses to the connection between the death
   of Christ and the forgiveness of sins. It is explicitly so in the case
   of the Supper, and the expression of St. Paul about being baptized into
   Christ's death (Romans 6:3) shows that it is so in the case of the
   other Sacrament too. The apostle was not saying anything of startling
   originality, when he wrote the beginning of Romans 6 -- Know ye not
   that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His
   death?' Every Christian knew that in baptism what his mind was directed
   to, in connection with the blessing of forgiveness, was the death of
   Christ. Both Sacraments, therefore, are memorials of the death, and it
   is not due to any sacramentarian tendency in Luke, but only brings out
   the place which the death of Christ had at the basis of the Christian
   religion, as the condition of the forgiveness of sins, when he gives
   the sacramental side of Christianity the prominence it has in the early
   chapters of Acts. From the New Testament point of view, the Sacraments
   contain the gospel in brief; they contain it in inseparable connection
   with the death of Jesus; and as long as they hold their place in the
   Church the saving significance of that death has a witness which it
   will not be easy to dispute.

   It is customary to connect with the Petrine discourses in Acts an
   examination of the First Epistle of Peter. It is not, indeed, open to
   dispute that the First Epistle of Peter shows traces of dependence upon
   one or perhaps more than one epistle of Paul. There are different ways
   in which this may be explained. Peter and Paul were not at variance
   about the essentials of Christianity, as even the second chapter of the
   Epistle to the Galatians proves; if they had any intimate relations at
   all, it is a priori probable that the creative mind of Paul would leave
   its mark on the more receptive intelligence of Peter; something also
   may be due to an amanuensis, Silvanus (1 Peter 5:12) or another, who
   had seen (as was possible enough in Peter's lifetime) letters of Paul
   like those to the Romans or Ephesians. But we must take care not to
   exaggerate either the originality of Paul, or the secondary character
   of Peter. Paul's originality is sometimes an affair rather of dialectic
   than invention; he is original rather in his demonstration of
   Christianity than in his statement of it. The thing about which he
   thinks and speaks with such independent and creative power is not his
   own discovery; it is the common tradition of the Christian faith; that
   which he delivers to others, and on which he expends the resources of
   his original and irrepressible mind, he has himself in the first
   instance received (1 Corinthians 15:3). And Peter may often be
   explained, where explanation is necessary, not by reference to Paul,
   but by reference to the memory of Jesus in the first instance, and to
   the suggestions of the Old Testament in the next. His antecedents,
   properly speaking, are not Pauline, but prophetic and evangelic. And if
   there are formal characteristics of his epistle which have to be
   explained by reference to his great colleague, the substance of it, so
   far as our subject is concerned, points not so much to Paul as to Jesus
   and the ancient Scriptures. What ideas, then, we may ask, does the
   First Epistle of Peter connect with the death of Jesus?

   To begin with, the death of Jesus has the central place in the writer's
   mind which it everywhere has in the New Testament. He describes himself
   as a witness of the sufferings of the Christ' (5:1). Martus is to be
   taken here in its full compass; it means not only a spectator of, but
   one who bears testimony to. The writer's testimony to the sufferings of
   the Christ is one in which their significance is brought out in various
   aspects; but though this sense of witness' is emphasized, it by no
   means excludes the other; rather does it presuppose it. Peter seems to
   prefer sufferings' to death' in speaking of the Christ, perhaps because
   he had been an eye-witness, and because sufferings' served better than
   death' to recall all that his Lord had endured. Death might be regarded
   merely as the end of life, not so much a moral reality, as a limit or
   termination to reality; but sufferings are a part of life, with moral
   content and meaning, which may make an inspiring or pathetic appeal to
   men. In point of fact it is the moral quality of the sufferings of the
   Christ, and their exemplary character, which first appeal to the
   apostle. As he recalls what he had seen as he stood by the great
   sufferer, what impresses him most is His innocence and patience. He had
   done no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth. When He was reviled,
   He reviled not again; when He suffered He did not threaten, but
   committed himself to Him who judges righteously (2:22 f.). In this
   character of the patient and innocent sufferer Peter commends Jesus to
   Christians, especially to slaves, who were having their first
   experience of persecution, and finding how hard it was not only to
   suffer without cause, but actually to suffer for doing well, for loving
   fidelity to God and righteousness. It is not necessary to press the
   parallel unduly, or to argue (as Seeberg has done [34] ) that the
   suffering of Christians in imitation of the Christ will have in all
   respects the same kind of result, or the same kind of influence, as
   His. Yet Peter identifies the two to some extent when he says, in 4:13,
   Ye are partakers in the sufferings of the Christ. This is a genuinely
   evangelical point of view. Jesus calls on all His followers to take up
   their cross, and walk in His steps. The whole mass of suffering for
   righteousness' sake, which has been since the world began and will be
   to its close, is the sufferings of the Christ'; all who have any part
   in it are partners with Him in the pain, and will be partners also in
   the glory which is to be revealed. So far, it may be said, there is no
   theological reflection in the epistle; it occupies the standpoint of
   our Lord's first lesson on the Cross: I must suffer for righteousness'
   sake, and so must all who follow Me (Matthew 16:2l-24) -- with the
   admonition annexed, Let it be in the same spirit and temper, not with
   amazement, irritation, or bitterness.

   But the epistle has other suggestions which it is necessary to examine.
   The first is found in the salutation. This is addressed to the elect
   who are sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
   Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
   in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
   blood of Jesus Christ (1:1 f.). In this comprehensive address, a whole
   world of theological ideas is involved. Christians are what they are as
   elect according to the foreknowledge of God. Their position does not
   rest on assumptions of their own, or on any movable basis, but on the
   eternal goodwill of God which has taken hold of them. This goodwill,
   which they know to be eternal -- that is, to be the last reality in the
   world -- has come out in their consecration by the Spirit. The Spirit,
   standing as it does here between God the Father and Christ, must be the
   Holy Spirit, not the spirit of the Christian, the consecration is
   wrought not upon it but by it. The readers of the epistle would no
   doubt connect the words, and be intended by the writer to connect them,
   with their baptism; it was in baptism that the Spirit was received, and
   that the eternal goodwill of God became a thing which the individual
   (of course through faith) grasped in time. But what is in view in this
   eternal goodwill and its manifestation in time? It has in view
   obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.' We cannot
   miss the reference here to the institution of the covenant in Exodus
   24. There we find the same ideas in the same relation to each other.
   Moses took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the
   people; and they said, All that the Lord hath spoken will we do, and be
   obedient. And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people and
   said, Behold the blood of the covenant which the Lord hath made with
   you upon all these conditions.' Such a sprinkling with covenant blood,
   after a vow of obedience, is evidently in Peter's mind here. We have
   already seen, in connection with the institution of the Lord's Supper,
   what covenant blood means. As sacrificial, it is sin-covering; it is
   that which annuls sin as the obstacle to union with God. Within the
   covenant, God and man have, so to speak, a common life. God is not
   excluded from human life; He enters into it and achieves His ends in
   the world through it. Man is not excluded from the divine life; God
   admits him to His friendship and shows him what He is doing; he becomes
   a partaker in the divine nature, and a fellow-worker with God. But the
   covenant is made by sacrifice; its basis and being are in the blood. In
   this passage, therefore, election and consecration have in view a life
   of obedience, in union and communion with God; and such a life, it is
   assumed, is only possible for those who are sprinkled with the blood of
   Jesus Christ. In other words, it is this only which has abiding power
   in it to annul sin as that which comes between God and man. It is
   sometimes said that the position of the blood in this passage -- after
   obedience -- points to its sanctifying virtue, its power to cleanse the
   Christian progressively, or ever afresh, from all sin; but if we use
   technical language at all, we should rather say that its character as
   covenant-blood obviously suggests that on its virtue the Christian is
   perpetually dependent for his justification before God. With this blood
   on us we have peace with Him, and the calling to live in that peace.

   The second express reference to the saving significance of our Lord's
   death occurs in ch. 1:18 ff. Peter is exhorting those to whom he writes
   to a life of holiness, and he uses various arguments in support of his
   plea for sanctification. [35] First, it answers to the essential
   relations between man and God. As He who called you is holy show
   yourselves also holy in all your behavior' (1:15). Second, it is
   required in view of the account they must render. (If ye invoke as
   Father Him who without respect of persons judges according to every
   man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear' (1:17). And,
   third, they have been put in a position to live a holy life by the
   death of Christ.

   Knowing that you were ransomed, not with corruptible things, silver and
   gold, from your vain manner of life, handed down from your fathers; but
   with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,
   even the blood of Christ' (1:18 f.).

   A lamb without blemish and without spot is a sacrificial lamb, and the
   virtue here ascribed to the blood of Christ is some sort of sacrificial
   virtue. The preciousness of the blood cannot be otherwise explained
   than by saying that it was Christ's blood. But what is the virtue here
   ascribed to it? By it Christians were ransomed from a vain manner of
   life handed down from their fathers. The elutrothete of this passage is
   no doubt an echo of the lutron anti pollon Mark 10:45. The effect of
   Christ's death was that for Christians a peculiar kind of servitude
   ended; when it told on them their life was no longer in bondage to
   vanity and to custom. The expression ek tes mataias humon anastrophes
   patroparadotou is a very striking one. Life before the death of Christ
   has touched it is mataia i. e. it is futile, it is a groping or
   fumbling after something it can never find; it gets into no effective
   contact with reality; it has no abiding fruit:. From this subjection to
   vanity it is redeemed by the blood of Christ. When the power of
   Christ's Passion enters into any life it is not futile any more: there
   is no more the need or the inclination to cry mataiotes mataioteton,
   all is vanity. Nothing can be more real or satisfying than the life to
   which we are introduced by the death of Christ; it is a life in which
   we can have fruit, much fruit, and fruit that abides; hence the
   introduction to it, as elotrothete suggests, is a kind of emancipation.
   Similarly, life before the death of Christ has touched it is
   patroparadotos; it is a kind of tradition or custom, destitute of moral
   originality or initiative. A man may think he is himself, and that he
   is acting freely and spontaneously, when he is only indulging
   self-will, or yielding to impulses of nature in him through which a
   genuine moral personality has never been able to emerge; but it is the
   power of Christ's passion descending into the heart which really begets
   the new creature, to whom moral responsibility -- his own -- is an
   original thing, a kind of genius, in virtue of which he does what
   nobody in the world ever did before, and feels both free and bound to
   do so. The moral originality of the New Testament life is a miracle
   that never grows old; and whatever in the form of this epistle may be
   due to a mind more creative than that of the writer, at this point, at
   any rate, we catch the note of an independent experience. Now this new
   life of the Christian, with its satisfying reality, and its wonderful
   freedom, was bought with the blood of Christ.

   It is possible to argue that the new life is called forth immediately
   by the death of Christ -- that is, that the impression produced by the
   spectacle of the cross, if we may so speak, quite apart from its
   interpretation, emancipates the soul. But there is something unreal in
   all such arguments. The death of Christ was never presented to the
   world merely as a spectacle. It was never presented by any apostle or
   evangelist apart from an interpretation. It was the death of Christ so
   interpreted as to appeal irresistibly to the heart, the conscience, the
   imagination, perhaps we should sometimes include the very senses of
   men, which exercised the emancipating power. And the only hint which is
   here given of the line of interpretation is that which is involved in
   the reference to the sacrificial lamb. It was the death of Christ not
   uninterpreted (which is really equivalent to non-significant) but
   interpreted in some way as a death for our sins which exercised this
   beneficent power to liberate and to recreate the soul.

   A clearer light is east on the nature of the connection between
   Christ's death and the moral emancipation of believers by the third
   passage in which the apostle makes a detailed reference to the subject.
   It is that in which the example of Christ in His sufferings is set
   before Christian slaves who are called to suffer unjustly. Peter pleads
   with them to be patient. What glory is it if what you do wrong and are
   beaten you take it patiently? But if when, you do good and suffer for
   it you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For this is what
   you were called for -- for Christ also suffered for you (huper humon
   epathen), leaving you an example that ye should follow in His steps.'
   So 2:20 f. It is the exemplary character of the sufferings of Christ
   that is in view when the writer goes on: Who did no sin, neither was
   guile found in His mouth -- who when He was reviled not again, under
   suffering did not threaten, but committed His cause to Him who judges
   righteously.' In all this (2:22 f.) the appeal of the example is clear.
   It is equally clear that in what follows the exemplary character of
   Christ's sufferings is left behind, or transcended, and that they are
   put in another aspect. It is as though the apostle could not turn his
   eyes to the Cross for a moment without being fascinated and held by it;
   he saw far more in it habitually, and he saw far more in it now, than
   was needed to point his exhortation to the wronged slaves; it is not
   their interest in it, as the supreme example of suffering innocence and
   patience, but the interest of all sinners in it as the only source of
   redemption, by which he is ultimately inspired: Who His own self bare
   our sins in His body upon the tree, that we having died unto (the) sins
   might live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. ' The
   enlargement of view is shown by the change to the first person (He bore
   our sins, that we might live, etc.), the writer including himself and
   all Christians with those whom he addresses in the benefits of Christ's
   death; it is only in the last clause -- by whose wound you were healed'
   -- that he returns to his immediate subject, the slaves who were
   buffeted for doing well. What, then, precisely is it which is here
   affirmed of Christ in His death?

   Literally, it is that He Himself bore our sins in His body on to the
   tree. The use of anapherein oite hamartian is not common, it occurs
   only in Isaiah 53:12 and Numbers 14:33, the more usual expression being
   laubanein. But it seems absurd for this reason, and for the reason that
   anapherein ti epi to thusiasterion is a common expression, to argue
   that here the tree or cross is regarded as an altar, to which sin was
   literally carried up to be slain. [36] That which is slain at the altar
   is always regarded as a gift acceptable to God, the slaying is only the
   method in which it is irrevocably made His; and nothing is more
   perverse than the attempt to present sin in this light. The words of
   the apostle must be interpreted as the simple sense of Christians
   always has interpreted them, that Christ bore our sins in His body as
   He ascended the Cross, or ascended to it. There is something in the
   words en to somati and epi to xulon which leaves a singular and even
   poignant impression of reality on the mind. To us the Passion is
   idealized and transfigured; the tree' is a poetic name for the Cross,
   under which the hard truth is hidden. But soma means flesh and blood,
   and xulon means timber. We may have wondered that an apostle and
   eye-witness should describe the sinlessness and the suffering of Jesus,
   as the writer of this epistle does, almost entirely in words quoted
   from the Old Testament; but even as we wonder, and are perhaps visited
   with misgivings, we are startled by these words in which the Passion is
   set before us as a spectacle of human pain which the writer had watched
   with his own eyes as it moved to its goal at the Cross. But this
   reminiscent pictorial turn which he has given to his expression does
   not alter the meaning of the principal words -- Who His own self bore
   our sins.' [37] This is the interpretation of the Passion' it was a
   bearing of sin. Now, to bear sin is not an expression for which we have
   to invent or excogitate a meaning, it is a familiar expression, of
   which the meaning is fixed. Thus, to take the instance referred to
   above (Numbers 14:34): After the number of the days in which ye spied
   out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your
   iniquities' -- the meaning clearly is, bear the consequences of them,
   take to yourselves the punishment which they involve. Or again, in
   Leviticus 5:17,

   If any one sin, and do any of the things which the Lord hath commanded
   not to be done, though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear
   his iniquity'

   -- the meaning is as clearly, he shall underlie the consequences
   attached by the law to his act. Or again, in Exodus 28:43, where the
   sons of Aaron are to observe punctually the laws about their official
   dress, that they bear not iniquity and die': to die and to bear
   iniquity are the same thing, death being the penalty here denounced
   against impiety. Expressions like these indicate the line on which we
   are to fill out the meaning of the words,

   Who His own self bare our sins.' They are meant to suggest that Christ
   took on Him the consequences of our sins -- that He made our
   responsibilities, as sin had fixed them, His own. He did so when He
   went to the Cross -- i.e. in His death. His death, and His bearing of
   our sins, are not two things, but one. It may be true enough that He
   bore them on His spirit, that He saw and felt their exceeding
   sinfulness, that He mourned over them before God; but however true and
   moving such considerations may be, they are not what the apostle means
   in the passage before us. He means that all the responsibilities in
   which sin has involved us -- responsibilities which are summed up in
   that death which is the wages of sin -- have been taken by Christ upon
   Himself. His interpretation of the Passion is that it is a bearing of
   sin -- more precisely, that it is the bearing of others' sin by one who
   is Himself sinless. (Numbers 30:15 and Hebrews 16.) The apostle does
   not raise the question whether it is possible for one to assume the
   responsibilities of others in this way; he assumes (and the assumption,
   as we shall see, is common to all the New Testament writers) that the
   responsibilities of sinful men have been taken on Himself by the
   sinless Lamb of God. This is not a theorem he is prepared to defend; it
   is the gospel he has to preach. It is not a precarious or a felicitous
   solution of an embarrassing difficulty -- the death of the Messiah; it
   is the foundation of the Christian religion, the one hope of sinful
   men. It may involve a conception of what Christ is, which would show
   the irrelevance of the objection just referred to, that one man cannot
   take on him the responsibilities of others; but leaving that apart for
   the moment, the idea of such an assumption is unquestionably that of
   this passage. It is emphasized by the very order of the words -- hos
   tas hamartias hemon autos anegenken; it was not His own but our sins
   that were borne at Calvary.

   To that which was so done Peter annexes the aim of it. He bore our
   sins, that having died to the sins, we might live to righteousness. It
   is not possible to argue from apogenomenoi that our death was involved
   in His -- that we actually or ideally died when He did, and so have no
   more relation to sins. It is quite fair to render, that we might die to
   our sins and live to righteousness.' A new life involves death to old
   relations, and such a new life, involving such death, is the aim of
   Christ's bearing of our sins. How this effect is mediated the apostle
   does not say. Once we understand what Christ's death means -- once we
   receive the apostolic testimony that in that death He was taking all
   our responsibilities upon Him -- no explanation may be needed. The love
   which is the motive of it acts immediately upon the sinful; gratitude
   exerts an irresistible constraint; His responsibility means our
   emancipation; His death our life; His bleeding wound our healing.
   Whoever says He bore our sins' says substitution; and to say
   substitution is to say something which involves an immeasurable
   obligation to Christ, and has therefore in it an incalculable motive
   power. This is the answer to some of the objections which are commonly
   made to the idea of substitution on moral grounds. They fail to take
   account of the sinner's sense of debt to Christ for what He has done, a
   sense of debt which it is not too much to designate as the most
   intimate, intense, and uniform characteristic of New Testament life. It
   is this which bars out all ideas of being saved from the consequences
   of sin, while living on in sin itself. It is so profound that the whole
   being of the Christian is changed by it; it is so strong as to
   extinguish and to create at once; under apostle's words here, the aim
   fulfilled in us -- we die to the sins and live to righteousness.

   This interpretation of the passage in the second chapter is confirmed
   when we proceed to the one in the third. The subject is still the same,
   the suffering of Christians for righteousness' sake. It is better,'
   says the apostle in 3:17, if the will of God should have it so, to
   suffer doing well than doing ill. For Christ also died once for sins,
   the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might conduct us to God. '
   Here, as in the previous passage, an exemplary significance in Christ's
   sufferings is assumed, and to it apparently the writer reverts in 4:1
   (as Christ therefore suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise
   with the same mind'), but it is not this exemplary significance on
   which he enlarges. On the contrary, it is a connection which the death
   of Christ, or His Passion, has with sins. Christ, he says, died in
   connection with sins once for all (hapax); His death has a unique
   significance in this relation. What the special connection was is
   indicated in the words dikaios huper adikon. It is the obvious
   implication of these words that the death on which such stress is laid
   was something to which the unrighteous were liable because of their
   sins, and that in their interest the Righteous One took it on Himself.
   When He died for them, it was their death which He died. His death has
   to be defined by relation to sin, but it is the sin of others, not His
   own. The writer no more asks here than he asked in the previous case,
   How can such filings be? He does not limit the will of love -- he does
   not, in a world made and ruled by God, limit beforehand the power of
   love -- to take on it to any extent the responsibility of others. This
   is his gospel, that a Righteous One has once for all faced and taken up
   and in death exhausted the responsibilities of the unrighteous, so that
   they no more stand between them and God; his business is not to prove
   this, but to preach it. The only difference is that whereas in the
   second chapter, if we can draw such a distinction in the New Testament,
   the aim is a moral one (that we may die to sin and live to
   righteousness), in the present case it is religious (that He might
   conduct us to God). The word prosagein has always a touch of formality
   in it; it is a great occasion when the Son who has assumed our
   responsibilities for us takes us by the hand to bring us to the Father.
   We find the same idea of the prosagoge as the great Christian privilege
   in Romans 5:2 and Ephesians 2:18. Sin, it is implied, keeps man at a
   distance from God; but Christ has so dealt with sin on man's behalf
   that its separative force is annulled; for those who commit themselves
   to Christ, and to the work which He has done for them in His Passion,
   it is possible to draw near to God and to live in His peace. This is
   the end contemplated in His dying for sins once, the righteous for the
   unrighteous. We can only repeat here what has just been said in
   connection with the previous passage. If Christ died the death in which
   sin had involved us -- if in His death He took the responsibility of
   our sins upon Himself -- no word is equal to this which falls short of
   what is meant by calling Him our substitute. Here also, as in the
   second chapter, the substitution of Christ in His death is not an end
   in itself: it has an ulterior end in view. And this end is not attained
   except for those who, trusting in what Christ has done, find access to
   God through Him. Such access, we must understand, is not a thing which
   can be taken for granted. It is not for the sinful to presume on
   acceptance with God whenever they want it. Access to God is to the
   Apostle the most sublime of privileges, purchased with an unspeakable
   price; for such as we are, it is only possible because for our sins
   Christ died. And just as in the ancient tabernacle every object used in
   worship had to be sprinkled with atoning blood, so all the parts of
   Christian worship, all our approaches to God, should consciously rest
   on the atonement. They should be felt to be a privilege beyond price;
   they should be penetrated with the sense of Christ's Passion, and of
   the love with which He loved us when He suffered for sins once for all,
   the just for the unjust, that He might conduct us to God.

   There is no other passage in the First Epistle of Peter which speaks
   with equal explicitness of the saving significance of Christ's death.
   But the passages which have just been reviewed are all the more
   impressive from the apparently incidental manner in which they present
   themselves to us. The apostle is not avowedly discussing the theology
   of the Passion. There is nothing in his epistle like that deliberate
   grappling with the problem of the justification of the ungodly which we
   find, for example, in the third and fourth chapters of the Epistle to
   the Romans. His general purpose, indeed, is quite different. It is to
   exhort to patience and constancy Christians who are suffering for the
   first time severe persecution, and who are disposed to count it a
   strange thing that has befallen them; the suffering Christ is held up
   to them as an example. He is the first of martyrs, and all who suffer
   for righteousness' sake, as they share the suffering which He endured,
   should confront it in the same spirit which He displayed. But the
   imitation of Jesus is not an independent thing for the apostle; at
   least he never speaks of it by itself. It is the sense of obligation to
   Christ which enables us to lift our eyes to so high an example; and
   Peter glides insensibly, on every occasion, from Christ the pattern of
   innocence and patience in suffering to Christ the sacrificial lamb,
   Christ the bearer of sin, Christ who died, righteous for unrighteous
   men. It is here the inspiration is found for every genuine imitatio
   Christi, and the unforced, inevitable way in which the apostle falls
   regularly back on the profounder interpretation of the death of Christ,
   shows how central and essential it was in his mind. He does not dwell
   anywhere of set purpose on the attitude of the soul to this death, so
   as to make clear the conditions on which it becomes effective for the
   Christian's emancipation from a vain and custom-ridden life, for his
   death to sin, or for his introduction to God. As has been already
   remarked, the sense of obligation to Christ, the sense of the love
   involved in what he has done for men, may produce all these effects
   immediately. But there are two particulars in which the First Epistle
   of Peter makes a near approach to other New Testament books, especially
   to Pauline ones, in their conception of the conditions on which the
   blessings of the gospel are enjoyed, and it may not be out of place to
   refer to them here. The first is the emphasis it lays on faith. The
   testing of the Christian life is spoken of as the trying of your faith'
   (1:7); the salvation of the soul is the end of your faith' (1:9);
   Christians are those who through Him' -- that is, through Christ --
   have faith in God' (1:21). The other is the formula in Christ,' which
   has sometimes been treated almost as if it were the signature of St.
   Paul. It occurs in the last verse of the epistle, Peace be to you all
   that are in Christ.' Probably it is not too bold to suggest that in
   these two ideas -- that of faith, and that of being, in Christ -- we
   have here, as elsewhere in the New Testament, a clue to the terms on
   which all the Christian facts, and most signally the death of Christ,
   as the apostle interprets it, have their place and efficacy in the life
   of men.

   It is not possible to base anything on the Second Epistle ascribed to
   Peter. The one expression to be found in it, bearing on our subject, is
   the description of certain false teachers in ch. 2:1, as denying the
   Master who bought them' (ton agorasanta autous despoten arnoumenoi).
   The idea of agorazein is akin to that of lutrousthai, and the New
   Testament in other places emphasizes the fact that we are bought with a
   price (1 Corinthians 6:20 and 7:23), and that the price is the blood of
   Christ (Revelation 5:9.); but though these ideas no doubt underlie the
   words just quoted, there is no expansion or application of them in the
   context. The passage takes for granted the common faith of Christians
   in this connection, but does not directly contribute to its
   elucidation.

   the sins of men, then men have their sins no more: the bearing up to is
   a taking away. In view of the other references in the epistle and of
   the Old Testament parallels, this is rather a refusal to think out the
   apostle's thoughts than a stricter interpretation of his words.

CHAPTER 3
The Epistles of St. Paul

   WHEN we pass from primitive Christian preaching to the epistles of St.
   Paul, we are embarrassed not by the scantiness but by the abundance of
   our materials. It is not possible to argue that the death of Christ has
   less than a central, or rather than the central and fundamental place,
   in the apostle's gospel. But before proceeding to investigate more
   closely the significance he assigns to it, there are some preliminary
   considerations to which it is necessary to attend. Attempts have often
   been made, while admitting that St. Paul teaches what he does teach, to
   evade it -- either because it is a purely individual interpretation of
   the death of Jesus, which has no authority for others; or because it is
   a theologoumenon, and not a part of the apostolic testimony; or because
   it is not a fixed thing, but a stage in the development of apostolic
   thought, which St. Paul was on the way to transcend, and would
   eventually have transcended, and which we (by his help) can quite well
   leave behind us; or because it is really inconsistent with itself, a
   bit of patchwork, pieced out here and there with incongruous elements,
   to meet the exigencies of controversy; or because it unites, in a way
   inevitable for one born a Pharisee, but simply false for those who have
   been born Christian, conceptions belonging to the imperfect as well as
   to the perfect religion -- conceptions which it is our duty to allow to
   lapse. I do not propose to consider such criticisms of St. Paul's
   teaching on the death of Christ directly. For one thing, abstract
   discussion of such statements, apart from their application to given
   eases, never leads to any conclusive results; for another, when we do
   come to the actual matters in question, it often happens that the
   distinctions just suggested disappear; the apostolic words have a
   virtue in them which enables them to combine in a kind of higher unity
   what might otherwise be distinguished as testimony and theology. But
   while this is so it is relevant, and one may think important, to point
   out certain characteristics of St. Paul's presentation of his teaching
   which constitute a formidable difficulty in the way of those who would
   evade it.

   The first is, the assurance with which he expresses himself. The
   doctrine of the death of Christ and its significance was not St. Paul's
   theology, it was his gospel. It was all he had to preach. It is with it
   in his mind -- immediately after the mention of our Lord Jesus Christ,

   who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this
   present world with all its evils
   -- that he says to the Galatians:

   Though we or an angel from heaven preach a gospel to you contravening
   the gospel which we preached, let him be anathema. As we have said
   before, so say I now again, if any man is preaching a gospel to you
   contravening what you received, let him be anathema' (Galatians 1: 4, 8
   f.).

   I cannot agree with those who disparage this, or affect to forgive it,
   as the unhappy beginning of religious intolerance. Neither the Old
   Testament nor the New Testament has any conception of a religion
   without this intolerance. The first commandment is, Thou shalt have
   none other gods beside Me,' and that is the foundation of the true
   religion. As there is only one God, so there can be only one gospel. If
   God has really done something in Christ on which the salvation of the
   world depends, and if He has made it known, then it is a Christian duty
   to be intolerant of everything which ignores, denies, or explains it
   away. The man who perverts it is the worst enemy of God and men; and it
   is not bad temper or narrow mindedness in St. Paul which explains this
   vehement language, it is the jealousy of God which has kindled in a
   soul redeemed by the death of Christ a corresponding jealousy for the
   Savior. It is intolerant only as Peter is intolerant when he says,
   Neither is there salvation in any other' (Acts 4:12), or John, when he
   says,

   He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God
   hath not the life' (1 John 5:12);

   or Jesus Himself when He says,

   No man knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son
   willeth to reveal him' (Matthew 11:27).

   Intolerance like this is an essential element in the true religion; it
   is the instinct of self-preservation in it; the unforced and
   uncompromising defense of that on which the glory of God and the
   salvation of the world depends. If the evangelist has not something to
   preach of which he can say, If any man makes it his business to subvert
   this, let him be anathema, he has no gospel at all. Intolerance in this
   sense has its counterpart in comprehension; it is when we have the only
   gospel, and not until then, that we have the gospel for all. It is a
   great argument, therefore, for the essential as opposed to the casual
   or accidental character of St. Paul's teaching on Christ's death -- for
   it is with this that the Epistle to the Galatians is concerned -- that
   he displays his intolerance in connection with it. To touch his
   teaching here is not to do something which leaves his gospel
   unaffected; as he understands it, it is to wound his gospel mortally.

   Another consideration of importance in this connection is St. Paul's
   relation to the common Christian tradition. No doubt the apostle was an
   original thinker, and in the Epistle to the Galatians he is concerned
   to vindicate his originality, or at least his independence; but his
   originality is sometimes exaggerated. He did not invent Christianity;
   there were apostles and preachers and men in Christ before him. And he
   tells us expressly that in the fundamentals of Christianity he not only
   agreed with them, but was indebted to them.

   I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, that
   Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was
   buried, and that He hath been raised the third day, according to the
   Scriptures' (1 Corinthians 15:3).

   It is impossible to leave out of the tradition which St. Paul had
   himself received, and which he transmitted to the Corinthians, the
   reference to the meaning of Christ's death -- He died for our sins
   according to the Scriptures' -- and to limit it to the fact: the fact
   needed no such authentication. It is the fact in its meaning for
   sinners which constitutes a gospel, and this, he wishes to assert, is
   the only gospel known.

   Whether it be I or they -- whether it be I or the twelve apostles at
   Jerusalem -- this is the way we preach, and it was thus that you became
   believers' (1 Corinthians 15:11).

   And the doctrinal tradition of Christianity, if we may call it so, was
   supplemented and guaranteed by the ritual one. In the same Epistle to
   the Corinthians St. Paul says again, speaking of the Supper, I received
   of the Lord this, which also I delivered unto you' (1 Corinthians
   11:23). An immediate supernatural revelation of what took place on the
   last night of our Lord's life has no affinity to anything we know of
   revelations, we must understand St. Paul to say that what he had handed
   on to the Corinthians had before been handed on to him, and went back
   originally to the Lord Himself. The Lord was the point from which it
   started. But Paul could not receive this ritual tradition, and we know
   he did not, without receiving at the same time the great interpretative
   words about the new covenant in Christ's blood, which put the death of
   Christ, once for all, at the foundation of the Gospel. [38] It is not
   Paulinism which does this, it is the Christianity of Christ. The point
   at issue between the apostle and his Jewish-Christian adversaries was
   not whether Christ had died for sins; every Christian believed that. It
   was rather how far this death of Christ reached in the way of producing
   or explaining the Christian life. To St. Paul it reached the whole way;
   it explained everything; it supplanted everything he could call a
   righteousness of his own; it inspired everything he could call
   righteousness at all. To his opponents, it did not so much supplant as
   supplement, but for the atoning death, indeed, the sinner is hopeless;
   but even when he has believed in it, he has much to do on his own
   account, much which is not generated in him by the sense of obligation
   to Christ, but must be explained on other principles -- e.g., that of
   the authority of the Jewish law. It is not necessary to enter into this
   controversy here, but what may fairly be insisted upon is the fact,
   which is evident in all the epistles, that underneath the controversy
   St. Paul and his opponents agreed in the common Christian
   interpretation of Christ's death as a death in which sin had been so
   dealt with that it no longer barred fellowship between God and those
   who believed in Jesus. This, again, should make us slow to reject
   anything on this subject in St. Paul as being merely Pauline -- an
   idiosyncrasy of the individual. We must remember that his great
   argument against Judaising Christians is that they are acting
   inconsistently: they are unwittingly doing something which contravenes,
   not Paulinism, but the gospel they have already received of redemption
   through the death of Christ.

   Again, the perception of St. Paul's place in Christian tradition, and
   of his debt to it, should make us slow to lay stress on the development
   which has been discovered in his writings. Leaving out the Pastorals,
   Paul wrote his other epistles within the space of ten years. But he had
   been preaching the gospel, in which the death of Christ had from the
   beginning the place and significance which we have just seen, at least
   fifteen years before any of the extant epistles were written. Is it
   credible that he had no intellectual life at all for those fifteen
   years, and that then, all of a sudden, his brain began to work at high
   pressure, and continued to work so till the end of his life? It is true
   that in the epistles of the imprisonment, as they may be conveniently
   called -- Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians -- we see the whole gospel
   in other relations than those in which it is exhibited in the epistles
   of the great missionary period -- Thessalonians, Corinthians,
   Galatians, Romans. But this is something quite different from a
   development in the gospel itself; and in point of fact we cannot
   discover in St. Paul's interpretation of Christ's death anything which
   essentially distinguishes his earliest epistles from his latest. To
   suppose that a great expansion of his thoughts took place between the
   letters to the Thessalonians and those to the Corinthians is to ignore
   at once the chronology, the nature of letters, and the nature of the
   human mind. St. Paul tells us himself that he came to Corinth
   determined to know nothing among the Corinthians but Jesus Christ and
   Him crucified. But he came in that mood straight from Thessalonica, and
   in that mood he wrote from Corinth the letters to Thessalonica, in
   which, nevertheless, there is, as we shall see, only a passing allusion
   to Christ's death. Nothing could demonstrate more clearly how entirely
   a matter of accident it is -- that is, how entirely it depends upon
   conditions which we may or may not have the means of discovering --
   whether any particular part of the apostle's whole conception of
   Christianity shall appear in any given epistle. If development might be
   asserted anywhere, on general grounds, it would be in this case and on
   this subject; there is far more about Christ's death, and far more that
   is explicit, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians than in the First
   to the Thessalonians. Yet precisely at this point our knowledge of St.
   Paul's mind when he reached Corinth (1 Corinthians 2:1 f.), and of the
   brief interval which lay between this and his visit to Thessalonica,
   puts the idea of development utterly out of the question. As far as the
   evidence goes -- the evidence including St. Paul's epistles on the one
   hand, and St. Paul's admitted relation to the doctrinal and ritual
   tradition of Christianity on the other -- the apostle had one message
   on Christ's death from first to last of his Christian career. His
   gospel, and it was the only gospel he knew, was always the Word of the
   Cross' (1 Corinthians 1:18), or the Word of reconciliation' (2
   Corinthians 5:19). The applications might be infinitely varied, for, as
   has been already pointed out, everything was involved in it, and the
   whole of Christianity was deduced from it; but this is not to say that
   it was in process of evolution itself.

   There are two other sets of questions which might be raised here,
   either independently or in relation to each other -- the questions
   involved in the experimental, and in the controversial or apologetic,
   aspects of St. Paul's theology. How much of what he tells us of the
   death of Christ is the interpretation of experience, and has value as
   such? How much is mere fencing with opponents, or squaring of accounts
   with his own old ways of thinking about God and the soul, but has no
   value now, because the conditions to which it is relative no longer
   exist? These questions, as has been already remarked, are not to be
   discussed abstractly, because taken abstractly the antitheses they
   present are inevitably tainted with falsehood. They assume an
   opposition which does not exist, and they ignore the capacity of the
   truth to serve a variety of intellectual and spiritual purposes. St.
   Paul could use his gospel, no doubt, in controversy and in apology, but
   it was not devised for controversial or apologetic ends. The truth
   always has it in itself to be its own vindication and defense. It can
   define itself in all relations, against all adversaries; but it is not
   constituted truth, it is only exhibited as truth, when it does so. The
   fact that Christ died for our sins -- that His death is an atoning
   death -- is a magnificent apology for the Cross, turning its shame into
   glory; but it is not philosophy or criticism, it is here
   unintelligence, to maintain that it was invented or believed just in
   order to remove the offense of the Cross. In St. Paul it is not an
   apologetic or a controversial truth, or a truth relative to the
   exigencies of Jewish prejudice; it is an independent, eternal, divine
   truth, the profoundest truth of revelation, which for that very reason
   contains in it the answer to all religious questions whether of ancient
   or of modern times. It is so far from being a truth which only a mind
   of peculiar antecedents or training could apprehend, that it is of all
   truths the most universal. It was the sense of it, in its truth, that
   made St. Paul a missionary to all men. When he thought of what it
   meant, it made him exclaim, Is God a God of Jews only? (Romans 3:29).
   Is the God who is revealed in the death of Christ for sin a God who
   speaks a language that only one race can understand? Incredible. The
   atoning death of Christ, as a revelation of God, is a thing in itself
   so intelligible, so correspondent to a universal need, so direct and
   universal in its appeal, that it must be the basis of a universal
   religion. It is so far from being a truth (if we can speak of truth on
   such terms) relative only to one race, or one upbringing, or one age,
   or one set of prejudices, that it is the one truth which for all races
   and in all ages can never admit of any qualification. In itself true,
   it can be used as a weapon, but it was no necessity of conflict which
   fashioned it. It is the very heart of revelation itself.

   The same attitude of mind to the Pauline teaching which would discount
   some of it as controversial or apologetic, as opposed to experimental
   or absolute, is seen in the disposition to distinguish in that
   teaching, as the expression is, fact from theory. In all probability
   this also is a distinction which it will not repay us to discuss in
   vacuo: everything depends on the kind of fact which we are supposed to
   be theorizing. The higher we rise in the scale of reality the more
   evanescent becomes the distinction between the thing itself' and the
   theory of it. A fact like the one with which we are here concerned, a
   fact in which the character of God is revealed, and in which an appeal
   is to be made to the reason, the conscience, the heart, the whole moral
   being of man, is a fact which must be, and must be seen to be, full of
   rational, ethical, and emotional content. If instead of theory' we use
   an equivalent word, say meaning,' we discover that the absolute
   distinction disappears. The fact is not known to us at all unless it is
   known in its meaning, in that which constitutes it a revelation of God
   and an appeal to man; and to say that we know it in its meaning is to
   say that we know it theoretically, or in or through a theory of it. A
   fact of which there is no theory is a fact in which we can see no
   meaning; and though we can apply this distinction so far when we are
   speaking of physical facts, and argue that it is fire which burns and
   not the theory of heat, we cannot apply it at all when we are speaking
   of a fact which has to tell on us in other than physical ways: through
   conscience, through the heart, through the intelligence, and therefore
   in a manner to which the mind can really respond. St. Paul's own words
   in Romans 5:11 enable us to illustrate this. We have received, he says,
   or taken, the reconciliation. If we could take it physically, as we
   take a doctor's prescription, which would tell on us all the same
   whatever our spiritual attitude to it might be, then we might
   distinguish clearly between the fact and the theory of it, and argue
   that as long as we accepted the fact, the theory was neither here nor
   there; but if the fact with which we are dealing cannot be physically
   accepted at all -- if it addresses itself to a nature which is higher
   than physical, a nature of which reason, imagination, emotion,
   conscience, are the elements, then the fact itself must be seen to be
   one in which there is that which appeals to all these elements; that
   is, to repeat the truth, it must be an interpreted fact, something in
   which fact and theory are indissolubly one. The Cross must be exhibited
   in ho logos tou staurou the Reconciliation in ho logos tes katallages;
   and logos is always a rational, a theoretical word. It is much easier
   to say there is a distinction of fact and theory, a distinction between
   the testimony and the theology of St. Paul, than to prove it; it is
   much easier to imagine that one can preach the gospel without any
   theory of the death of Christ than, knowing what these words mean, to
   do so. The simplest preacher, and the most effective, is always the
   most absolutely theoretical. It is a theory, a tremendous theory, that
   Christ's death is a death for sin. But unless a preacher can put some
   interpretation on the death -- unless he can find a meaning in it which
   is full of appeal -- why should he speak of it at all? Is it the want
   of a theory that deprives it of its place in preaching?

   There is one other subject to which also it is necessary to refer
   before going into detail on St. Paul's teaching -- the connection
   between Christ's death and His resurrection. The tradition of
   Protestant theology undoubtedly tends to isolate the death, and to
   think of it as a thing by itself, apart from the resurrection;
   sometimes, one is tempted to say, apart even from any distinct
   conception of Him who died. But we know that St. Paul himself puts an
   extraordinary emphasis on the resurrection. Sometimes it is coordinated
   with the death. If we believe that Jesus died and rose again,' he
   writes to the Thessalonians, including in this the whole of the
   Christian faith (1 Thessalonians 4:14). He was delivered for our
   offenses, and raised again for our justification,' he says to the
   Romans, making the resurrection as essential as the death (Romans
   4:25). It is the same with the summary of fundamental truths, which
   constituted the gospel as he preached it at Corinth, and which has been
   repeatedly referred to already:

   first of all that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
   and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according
   to the Scriptures' (1 Corinthians 15:3 f.).

   But there are passages in which he gives a more exclusive emphasis to
   the resurrection. Thus in Romans 10:9 he writes: If thou shalt confess
   with thy mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in thy heart that God
   raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved'; and in 1 Corinthians
   15:17: If Christ is not risen, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
   sins.' It is possible, however, to do full justice to all such
   expressions without qualifying in the slightest the prominence given in
   St. Paul to Jesus Christ as crucified. It was the appearance of the
   Risen One to St. Paul which made him a Christian. What was revealed to
   him on the way to Damascus was that the Crucified One was Son of God,
   and the gospel that He preached afterwards was that of the Son of God
   crucified. There can be no salvation from sin unless there is a living
   Savior: this explains the emphasis laid by the apostle on the
   resurrection. But the Living One can only be a Savior because He has
   died: this explains the emphasis laid on the Cross. The Christian
   believes in a living Lord, or he could not believe at all; but he
   believes in a living Lord who died an atoning death, for no other can
   hold the faith of a soul under the doom of sin.

   The importance of St. Paul's teaching, and the fact that dissent from
   any specifically New Testament interpretation of Christ's death usually
   begins with it, may justify these preliminary observations; we now go
   on to notice more precisely what the apostle does teach. What then, let
   us ask, are the relations in which St. Paul defines the death of
   Christ? What are the realities with which he connects it, so that in
   these connections it becomes an intelligible thing -- not a brute fact,
   like the facts of physics, while their laws are as yet unknown, but a
   significant, rational, ethical, appealing fact, which has a meaning,
   and can act not as a cause but as a motive? In other words, what is the
   doctrinal construction of this fact in virtue of which St. Paul can
   preach it to man as a gospel?

   (1) To begin with, he defines it by relation to the love of God. The
   death of Christ is an illustration or rather a demonstration of that
   love. It is a demonstration of it which can never be surpassed. There
   are great, though rare examples of love among men, but nothing which
   could give any suggestion of this.

   Scarcely for a righteous man will one die; for the good man possibly
   one might dare even death, but God commends His love to us in that
   while we were yet sinners Christ died for us' (Romans 5:7 f.).

   We shall return to this, and to St. Paul's inferences from it, when the
   passage in Romans comes before us; but meanwhile we should notice that
   the interpretation of Christ's death through the love of God is
   fundamental in St. Paul. In whatever other relations he may define it,
   we must assume, unless the contrary can be proved, that they are
   consistent with this. It is the commonest of all objections to the
   propitiatory doctrine of the death of Christ that it is inconsistent
   with the love of God; and not only amateur, but professional
   theologians of all grades have rejected St. Paul's doctrine of
   propitiation as inconsistent with Jesus' teaching on the love of the
   Father; but if a mind like St. Paul teaches both things -- if he makes
   the death of Christ in its propitiatory character the supreme
   demonstration of the Father's love -- is there not an immense
   probability that there is misunderstanding somewhere? It may be a
   modern, it is certainly not a Pauline idea, that a death for sins, with
   a view to their forgiveness, is inconsistent with God's love. Whatever
   the process, St. Paul related that death to God's love as the supreme
   proof of it.

   (2) Further, the apostle defines Christ's death by relation to the love
   of Christ.

   The Son of God loved me,' he says, and gave Himself for me' (Galatians
   2:20).

   The love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that one
   died for all' (2 Corinthians 5:14).

   Walk in love, as Christ also loved us, and gave Himself for us an
   offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor' (Ephesians
   5:2).

   Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it, that He might
   sanctify it to Himself' (Ephesians 5:25).

   Christ is not an instrument, but the agent, of the Father in all that
   He does. The motive in which God acts is the motive in which He acts.
   The Father and the Son are at one in the work of man's salvation. It is
   this which is expressed when the work of Christ is described, as it is
   in Philippians 2:8 and Romans 5:19, as obedience -- obedience unto
   death, and that the death of the Cross. The obedience is conceived as
   obedience to the loving will of the Father to save men -- that is, it
   is obedience in the vocation of Redeemer, which involves death for sin.
   It is not obedience merely in the sense of doing the will of God as
   other men are called to do it, keeping God's commandments; it is
   obedience in this unique and incommunicable yet moral calling, to be at
   the cost of life the Savior of the world from sin. Hence it is in the
   obedience of Christ to the Father that the great demonstration of His
   love to men is given -- He loved me,' as the apostle says, and gave
   Himself for me.' In His obedience, in which He makes His great
   sacrifice, Christ is fulfilling the will of God; and the response which
   He evokes by His death is a response toward God. It is at this point,
   in the last resort, that we become convinced of the deity of Christ. It
   is a work of God which He is working, and the soul that is won for it
   is won for God in Him.

   (3) The relation of Christ's death to the love of God and of Christ is
   its fundamental relation on one side; on the other side, St. Paul
   relates it essentially to sin. It is a death for sin, whatever else may
   be said of it. First of all, Christ died for our sins.' It was sin
   which made death, and not something else, necessary as a demonstration
   of God's love and Christ's. Why was this so? The answer of the apostle
   is that it was so because sin had involved us in death, and there was
   no possibility of Christ's dealing with sin effectually except by
   taking our responsibility in it on Himself -- that is, except by dying
   for it. Of course it is assumed in this that there is an ethical
   connection of some kind between death and sin, and that such a
   connection of words as, The wages of sin is death,' (Romans 6:23)
   really has meaning. No doubt this has been denied. Death, it is argued,
   is the debt of nature, not the wages of sin; it has no moral character
   at all. The idea of moral liability to death, when you look at the
   universality of death quite apart from moral considerations, is a piece
   of pure mythology. In spite of the assurance with which this argument
   is put forward it is not difficult to dissent from it. What it really
   does is to treat man abstractly, as if he were no more than a physical
   being; whereas, if we are to have either religion or morality preserved
   in the world, it is essential to maintain that he is more. The argument
   is one of the numberless class which proves nothing, because it proves
   too much. It is part of a vaster argument which would deny at the same
   time the spiritual nature and the immortality of man. But while it is
   right to say that death comes physically, that through disease, or
   accident, or violence, or mere physical exhaustion, it subdues to
   itself everything that lives, this does not touch the profounder truth
   with which St. Paul is dealing, that death comes from God, and that it
   comes in man to a being who is under law to Him. Man is not like a
   plant or an animal, nor is death to him what it is at the lower levels
   of life. Man has a moral nature in which there is a reflection of the
   holy law of God, and everything that befalls him, in eluding death
   itself, must be interpreted in relation to that nature. Conscience,
   quickened by the law of God, has to look at death, and to become alive,
   not to its physical antecedents, but to its divine meaning. What is
   God's voice in death to a spiritual being? It is what the apostle
   represents it -- death is the wages of sin. [39] It is that in which
   the divine judgment on sin comes home to the conscience. The connection
   between the two things is real, though it is not physical; and because
   it is what it is -- because death by God's ordinance has in the
   conscience of sinful men the tremendous significance which it does have
   -- because it is a power by which they are all their lifetime held in
   bondage -- because it is the expression of God's implacable and final
   opposition to evil -- He who came to bear our sin must also die our
   death. Death is the word which sums up the whole liability of man in
   relation to sin, and therefore when Christ came to give Himself for our
   sins He did it by dying. It does not occur to St. Paul to ask how
   Christ could die the death which is the wages of sin, any more than it
   occurred to St. Peter to ask how He could bear the sins of others. If
   any one had argued that the death which Jesus died, since it had not
   the shadow of a bad conscience cast upon it, was not the death which is
   the wages of sin, can we not conceive him asking, What death, then, was
   it? Is there any other? The death He died was the only death we know;
   it was death in all that tragic reality that we see at Calvary; and the
   sinlessness of Jesus -- when we take His love along with it -- may have
   been so far from making it impossible for Him to know and feel it as
   all that it was, that it actually enabled him to realize its awful
   character as no sinful soul had ever done or could do. Instead of
   saying, He could not die the death which is the wages of sin, it may be
   far truer to say, None but He could. [40]

   It may not be amiss here to point out that analysis of the term death'
   as it is used by St. Paul almost invariably misleads. According to M.
   Menegoz, [41] the apostle's doctrine of the expiation of sin by death
   is fatally vitiated by the ambiguity of the term. Paul confounds in it
   two distinct things:

   (1) death as l'aneantissement complet et definitif;

   (2) death as la peine de mort, le deces.

   If we take the word in the first sense, Christ did not die, for He was
   raised again, and therefore there is no expiation. If we take it in the
   second sense, there was no need that He should die, for we can all
   expiate our own sins by dying ourselves. This kind of penetration is
   hardly to be taken seriously. When Paul spoke of Christ's death as a
   death for sin, he had not a definition in his mind, whether
   l'aneantissement complet et definitif, or la peine de mort; but neither
   had he a vague or blurred idea which confused both; he had the awful
   fact of the crucifixion, with everything, physical and spiritual, which
   made it real; that was the bearing of sin and expiation of it, whether
   it answered to any one's abstract definition or not. The apostle would
   not have abandoned his gospel because some one demonstrated a priori,
   by means of definitions, that expiation of sin by death was either

   (1) impossible, or

   (2) unnecessary.

   He lived in another region. With these general remarks on the different
   relations in which St. Paul defines the death of Christ, we may now
   proceed to consider the teaching of the epistles in detail, keeping as
   far as possible to chronological order.

   (1.) The Epistles to the Thessalonians do not yield us much. The only
   indisputable passage is in the first epistle, ch. 5:10:

   God did not appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation
   through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or
   sleep we should live together with Him.'

   If the question is raised, What did Christ do for us with a view to our
   salvation, St. Paul has only one answer, He died for us. There is
   nothing in the epistles like the language of the hymn:--


     For us despised, for us He bore

     His holy fast, and hungered sore;

     For us temptations sharp He knew,

     For us the Tempter overthrew.'

   The only thing He is said to have done for us is to die, and this He
   did, because it was determined for Him by sin. The relation of sin and
   death in the nature of things made it binding on Him to die if He was
   to annul sin. The purpose here assigned to Christ's death, that whether
   we wake or sleep we should live together with Him, suggests that His
   power to redeem is dependent on His making all our experiences His own.
   If we are to be His in death and life, then He must take our death and
   life to Himself. If what is His is to become ours, it is only on the
   condition that what is ours He first makes His. There is the same
   suggestion in Romans 14:9: To this end Christ died and lived, that He
   might be Lord both of dead and living.' Not as though death made Him
   Lord of the dead, and rising again, of the living; but as One to whom
   no human experience is alien, He is qualified to be Lord of men through
   all. The particular character elsewhere assigned to death as the doom
   of sin is not here mentioned, but it does not follow that it was not
   felt. On the contrary, we should rather hold that St. Paul could never
   allude to the death of Christ without becoming conscious of its
   propitiatory character and of what gave it that character. The word
   would fill of its own accord with the meaning which it bears when he
   says, First of all, Christ died for our sins.

   (2.) When we pass to the First Epistle to the Corinthians, we have much
   fuller references to the subject. For one thing, its supreme importance
   is insisted on when we find the gospel described as the word of the
   cross' (1:18), and the apostle's endeavors directed to this, that the
   cross of Christ may not be made void' (1:17). It is in the same spirit
   that he contrasts the true gospel with the miracles claimed by the
   Jews, and the wisdom sought by the Greeks: We preach Christ crucified,
   the power of God and the wisdom of God.' So again in the second chapter
   he reminds the Corinthians how he came to Achaia determined to know
   nothing among them but. Jesus Christ and Him crucified: his whole
   gospel, the testimony of God, as he calls it, was in this (2:1 f.). In
   other passages he refers to the death of Christ in general terms which
   suggest the cost at which man's redemption was achieved. Twice over, in
   chapters 6:20, and 7:23, he writes, Ye were bought with a price;'
   making it in the first instance the basis of an exhortation to glorify
   God in the nature He had made His own at so dear a rate; and in the
   other, of an exhortation to assume all the responsibilities of that
   freedom for which they had been so dearly ransomed, and not to become
   servants of men, i.e., not to let the conventions, or judgments, or
   consciences of others invade a responsibility which had obligations to
   the Redeemer alone. It may not be possible to work out the figure of a
   price, which is found in these passages, in detail; we may not be able
   to say what it answered to, who got it, how it was fixed, and so on.
   But what we may legitimately insist upon is the idea that the work of
   man's salvation was a costly work, and that the cost, however we are to
   construe it, is represented by the death of Christ. Ye were bought with
   a price, means, Ye were not bought for nothing. Salvation is not a
   thing which can be assumed, or taken for granted; it is not an easy
   thing, about which no difficulty can possibly be raised by any one who
   has any idea of the goodness of God. The point of view of the New
   Testament is the very opposite. Salvation is a difficult thing, an
   incredible thing, an impossible thing; it is the miracle of miracles
   that such a thing should be; the wonder of it never ceases, and it
   nowhere finds a more thrilling expression than in St. Paul's words, Ye
   were bought with a price. St. Paul will show us in other ways why cost
   was necessary, and the cost of Christ's death in particular; but it is
   a great step in initiation into the gospel he preached to see that
   cost, as Bushnell puts it in his book on Forgiveness and Law, had to be
   made, and actually was made, that men might be redeemed for God.

   There is another passage in the First Epistle to the Corinthians on
   which I should lay greater stress than is usually done in connection
   with the apostle's teaching on Christ's death: it is that in the tenth
   and eleventh chapters in which St. Paul speaks of the Sacraments. He is
   concerned about the recrudescence of immorality among the saints, about
   the presumptuous carelessness with which they go into temptation,
   relying apparently on their sacramental privileges to ensure them
   against peril. He points out that God's ancient people had had similar
   privileges, indeed identical ones, yet had fallen in the wilderness
   owing to their sins. You are baptized into Christ? Yes, and all our
   fathers were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; they
   formed one body with him, and were as sure of God's favor. You have
   supernatural meat and supernatural drink in the Holy Supper, meat and
   drink which have the assurance of a divine and immortal life in them?
   So had they in the manna and the water from the rock. They all ate the
   same supernatural meat as you do, they all drank the same supernatural
   drink; they drank of a supernatural rock which followed them, and the
   rock was Christ. [42] It is obvious from this passage (1 Corinthians
   10:1-4) as well as from the references to baptism in 1:13 f.; 12:13,
   and from the full explanation of the Supper in 11:23 ff., that the
   Sacraments had a large place in the church at Corinth, and not only a
   large place, but one of a significance which can hardly be exaggerated.
   And, as has been pointed out already, there is no interpretation of the
   Sacraments except by reference to the death of Christ. Baptism has
   always in view, as part at least of its significance, the forgiveness
   of sins; and as the rite which marks the believer's initiation into the
   new covenant, it is essentially related to the act on which the
   covenant is based, namely, that which Paul delivered first of all to
   this Church, that Christ died for our sins. When, in another epistle,
   Paul argues that baptism into Christ means baptism into His death, he
   is not striking out a new thought, of a somewhat venturesome
   originality, to ward off a shrewd blow suddenly aimed at his gospel; he
   is only bringing out what was all along to him the essential meaning of
   this ordinance. The Supper, again, of which he speaks at length in 1
   Corinthians 10 and 11, bears an unmistakable reference to Christ's
   death. The cup is specially defined as the new covenant in His blood,
   and the apostle sums up the meaning of the Sacrament in the words, As
   often as ye eat this bread and drink the cup, ye publish the Lord's
   death until He come (1 Corinthians 11:26). In all probability
   katangellete (publish) implies that the Sacrament was accompanied by
   words in which its significance was expressed; it was not only a
   picture in which the death of Christ was represented and its worth to
   the Church declared; there was an articulate confession of what it was,
   and of what the Church owed to it. If we compare the sixth chapter of
   Romans with the tenth and eleventh of 1st Corinthians, it seems obvious
   that modern Christians try to draw a broader line of distinction
   between the Sacraments than really exists. Partly, no doubt, this is
   owing to the fact that in our times baptism is usually that of infants,
   while the Supper is partaken of only by adults, whereas, in New
   Testament times, the significance of both was defined in relation to
   conscious faith. But it would not be easy to show, from St. Paul's
   epistles, that in contents and meaning, in the blessings which they
   represented and which were conveyed through them, there is any very
   great distinction. The truth seems rather to be that both the
   Sacraments are forms into which we may put as much of the gospel as
   they will carry; and St. Paul, for his part, practically puts the whole
   of his gospel into each. If Baptism is relative to the forgiveness of
   sins, so is the Supper. If Baptism is relative to the unity of the
   Church, so is the Supper. We are not only baptized into one body (1
   Corinthians 12:13), but because there is one bread, we, many as we are
   who partake of it, are one body (1 Corinthians 10:17). If Baptism is
   relative to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4 f.), in the Supper Christ
   Himself is the meat and drink by which the new life is sustained (1
   Corinthians 10:3 f.). And in both the Sacraments, the Christ to whom we
   enter into relation is Christ who died; we are baptized into His death
   in the one, we proclaim His death until the end of time in the other. I
   repeat, it is hardly possible to exaggerate the significance of these
   facts, though it is possible enough to ignore them altogether. The
   superstition that has gathered round the Sacraments, and that has
   tempted even good Christians to speak of abolishing them, probably
   showed itself at a very early date; there are unmistakable traces of it
   in the First Epistle to the Corinthians itself, especially in the tenth
   chapter; but instead of lessening, it increases our assurance of the
   place which these ordinances had in Christianity from the beginning.
   And although the rationale of the connection between the death of
   Christ and the blessings of the gospel is not elucidated by them, it is
   presupposed in them. In ordinances with which every Christian was
   familiar, and without which a place in the Christian community could
   neither be acquired nor retained, the death of Christ was perpetually
   kept before all as a death essentially related in some way to the
   forgiveness of sins.

   Not much light falls on our subject from the one sacrificial allusion
   to Christ's death in 1 Corinthians 5:7: For our Passover also has been
   sacrificed -- Christ.' No doubt to pascha here, as in Mark 14:12, means
   the paschal lamb, and the apostle is thinking of Christ as the Lamb of
   God, by whose sacrifice the Church is called and bound to a life of
   holiness. It is because of this sacrifice that he says, Let us
   therefore keep festival, not in old leaven, nor in leaven of malice and
   wickedness, but in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.' It is
   implied here certainly that there is an entire incongruity between a
   life of sin, and a life determined by a relation to the sacrificial
   death of Christ; but we could not, from this passage alone, make out
   what, according to St. Paul, was the ground of this incongruity. It
   would be wrong, in a passage with this simply allusive reference to the
   passover, to urge the significance of the lamb in the twelfth and
   thirteenth chapters of Exodus, and to apply this to interpret the death
   of Christ. There is no indication that the apostle himself carried out
   his thought on these lines.

   We now come to the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, which is here of
   supreme importance. In one point of view, it is a defense of St. Paul's
   apostleship, and of his work in the apostolic office. The defense rests
   mainly on two pillars; first, his comprehension of the gospel; and
   second, his success in preaching it. There are one or two references in
   the earlier chapters to the sufferings and even the death of Jesus in
   an aspect with which we are not here specially concerned. Thus in 1:5,
   Paul says, The sufferings of Christ abound toward us'; meaning by this
   that in his apostolic work he suffered abundantly just as Christ had
   suffered; the weariness and peril from which Jesus could not escape
   haunted him too; the Lord's experience was continued in him. Similarly,
   in 4:10, when he speaks of always bearing about in the body ten
   nekrosin tou Iesou -- the dying of Jesus -- he means that his work and
   its attendant sufferings are killing him as they killed his Master;
   every day he feels his strength lessen, and the outer man perish. But
   it is not in these passages that the great revelation is made of what
   Christ's death is in relation to sin. It is in chapter 5, in which he
   is defending his conduct in the apostolic office against the assaults
   of his enemies. Extravagant or controlled, the motive of his conduct
   was always the same. The love of Christ constrains us,' he writes,
   because we thus judge, that one died for all (so then all died), and
   died for all that they who live should no longer live for themselves,
   but for Him who died for them, and rose again.' The importance of this
   passage is that it connects the two relations in which St. Paul is in
   the habit of defining Christ's death -- its relation to the love in
   which it originated, and to the sin with which it dealt; and it shows
   us how to construe these two things in relation to each other. Christ's
   death, we are enabled to see, was a loving death, so far as men are
   concerned, only because in that death He took the responsibilities of
   men upon Himself. Deny that, and it will be impossible to show any
   ground on which the death can be construed as a loving death at all. It
   is necessary to examine the passage in detail.

   The love of Christ, the apostle argues, constrains us, because we thus
   judge -- i.e., because we put a certain interpretation on His death.
   Apart from this interpretation, the death of Christ has no constraining
   power. Here we find in St. Paul himself a confirmation of what has been
   said above about the distinction of fact and theory. It is in virtue of
   a certain theory of Christ's death that the fact has its power to
   constrain the apostle. If it were not susceptible of such an
   interpretation, if this theory were inapplicable to it, it would cease
   to constrain. What, then, is the theory? It is that one died for all;
   huper panton means that the interest of all was aimed at and involved
   in the death of the one. How it was involved in it these words alone do
   not enable us to say. They do not by themselves show the connection
   between Christ's death and the world's good. But St. Paul draws an
   immediate inference from them: so then all died.' In one sense, it is
   irrelevant and interrupts his argument. He puts it into a hurried
   parenthesis, and then eagerly resumes what it had suspended. One died
   for all (so then all died), and died for all that they who live should
   no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose
   again.' Yet it is in this immediate inference, that the death of Christ
   for all involved the death of all -- that the missing link is found. It
   is because Christ's death has this inclusive character -- because, as
   Athanasius puts it, the death of all was fulfilled in the Lord's body'
   -- that His death has in it a power which puts constraint on men to
   live for Him. [43] I cannot agree with Mr. Lidgett when he says that
   the words can only be understood in connection with the apostle's
   declaration elsewhere, that he has been crucified with Christ.' [44]
   That declaration is a declaration of Christian experience, the fruit of
   faith; but what the apostle is dealing with here is something
   antecedent to Christian experience, something by which all such
   experience is to be generated, and which, therefore, is in no sense
   identical with it. The problem before us is to discover what it is in
   the death of Christ which gives it its power to generate such
   experience, to exercise on human hearts the constraining influence of
   which the apostle speaks; and this is precisely what we discover in the
   inferential clause: so then all died. ' This clause puts as plainly as
   it can be put the idea that His death was equivalent to the death of
   all; in other words, it was the death of all men which was died by Him.
   Were this not so, His death would be nothing to them. It is beside the
   mark to say, as Mr. Lidgett does, that His death is died by them rather
   than theirs by Him; the very point of the apostle's argument may be
   said to be that in order that they may die His death He must first die
   theirs. Our dying His death is not, in the New Testament, a thing which
   we achieve on our own initiative, or out of our own resources; it is
   the fruit of His dying ours. If it is our death that Christ died on the
   Cross, there is in the Cross the constraint of an infinite love; but if
   it is not our death at all if it is not our burden and doom that He has
   taken to Himself there -- then what is it to us? His death can put the
   constraint of love upon all men, only when it is thus judged that the
   death of all was died by Him. When the apostle proceeds to state the
   purpose of Christ's death for any, that they which live should not
   henceforth live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose
   again' -- he does it at the psychological and moral level suggested by
   the words: The love of Christ constrains us'. He who has done so
   tremendous a thing as to take our death to Himself has established a
   claim upon our life. We are not in the sphere of mystical union, of
   dying with Christ and living with Him; but in that of love
   transcendently shown, and of gratitude profoundly felt. [45] But it
   will not be easy for any one to be grateful for Christ's death,
   especially with a gratitude which will acknowledge that his very life
   is Christ's, unless he reads the Cross in the sense that Christ there
   made the death of all men His own.

   It is in this same passage that St. Paul gives the fullest explanation
   of what he means by reconciliation (katallage), and an examination of
   this idea will also illustrate his teaching on the death of Christ.
   Where reconciliation is spoken of in St. Paul, the subject is always
   God, and the object is always man. The work of reconciling is one in
   which the initiative is taken by God, and the cost borne by Him; men
   are reconciled in the passive, or allow themselves to be reconciled, or
   receive the reconciliation. We never read that God has been reconciled.
   God does the work of reconciliation in or through Christ, and
   especially through His death. He was engaged, in Christ, in reconciling
   the world -- or rather, nothing less than a world -- to Himself (2
   Corinthians 5:19). He reconciled us to Himself through Christ (5:20).
   When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son
   (Romans 5:10). Men who once were alienated, and enemies in mind through
   wicked works, yet now He has reconciled in the body of His flesh
   through death (Colossians 1:21 f.). It is very unfortunate that the
   English word reconcile (and also the German versohnen, which is usually
   taken as its equivalent) diverge seriously, though in a way of which it
   is easy to be unconscious, from the Greek katallassein. We cannot say
   in English, God reconciled us to Himself, without conceiving the
   persons referred to as being actually at peace with God, as having laid
   aside all fear, distrust, and love of evil, and entered, in point of
   fact, into relations of peace and friendship with God. But
   katallassein, as describing the work of God, or katallage, as
   describing its immediate result, do not necessarily carry us so far.
   The work of reconciliation, in the sense of the New Testament, is a
   work which is finished, and which we must conceive to be finished,
   before the gospel is preached. It is the good tidings of the Gospel,
   with which the evangelists go forth, that God has wrought in Christ a
   work of reconciliation which avails for no less than the world, and of
   which the whole world may have the benefit. The summons of the
   evangelist is -- Receive the reconciliation; consent that it become
   effective in your case.' The work of reconciliation is not a work
   wrought upon the souls of men, though it is a work wrought in their
   interests, and bearing so directly upon them that we can say God has
   reconciled the world to Himself; it is a work -- as Cromwell said of
   the covenant -- outside of us, in which God so deals in Christ with the
   sin of the world, that it shall no longer be a barrier between Himself
   and men.

   From this point of view we can understand how many modern theologians,
   in their use of the word reconciliation, come to argue as it were at
   cross purposes with the apostle. Writers like Kaftan, [46] for example,
   who do not think of the work of Christ as anything else than the work
   which Christ is perpetually doing in winning the souls of men for God,
   and who describe this as the work of reconciliation, though they may
   seem to the practical modern intelligence to be keeping close to
   reality, are doing all that can be done to make the Pauline, or rather
   the New Testament point of view, bewildering by a modern reader.
   Reconciliation, in the New Testament sense, is not something which is
   doing; it is something which is done. No doubt there is a work of
   Christ which is in process, but it has as its basis a finished work of
   Christ; it is in virtue of something already consummated on His cross
   that Christ is able to make the appeal to us which He does, and to win
   the response in which we receive the reconciliation. A finished work of
   Christ and an objective atonement -- a katallage in the New Testament
   sense -- are synonymous terms: the one means exactly the same as the
   other; and it seems to me self-evident, as I think it did to St. Paul,
   that unless we can preach a finished work of Christ in relation to sin,
   a katallage or reconciliation or peace which has been achieved
   independently of us, at an infinite cost, and to which we are called in
   a word or ministry of reconciliation, we have no real gospel for sinful
   men at all. It is not in something Christ would fain do that we see His
   love, it is in something He has already done; nay, it is only through
   what He has already done that we can form any idea, or come to any
   conviction, of what He would fain do. He has died for us all, and by
   that death -- not His own, properly speaking, but the death of the
   sinful race taken to Himself -- He has so demonstrated the reality and
   infinity of the love of God to the sinful, as to make it possible for
   apostles and evangelists to preach peace to all men through Him.

   In the passage with which we are dealing, St. Paul appends to the
   apostolic message, abruptly and without any conjunction, the statement
   of the great truth of Christ's finished work which underlies it.

   On Christ's behalf, then, we are ambassadors, as though God were
   entreating you through us, we beg of you on Christ's behalf, Be
   reconciled to God. Him that knew no sin He made to be sin for us, that
   we might become God's righteousness in Him' (2 Corinthians 5:20 f.).

   The want of a conjunction here does not destroy the connection; it only
   makes the appeal of the writer more solemn and thrilling. There need
   not be any misunderstanding as to what is meant by the words, Him that
   knew no sin He made to be sin for us. To every one who has noticed that
   St. Paul constantly defines Christ's death, and nothing but His death,
   by relation to sin, and who can recall similar passages in the Epistle
   to the Galatians or to the Romans, to which we shall presently come, it
   is obvious that these tremendous words cover precisely the same meaning
   as He died for our sins.' When the sinless one, in obedience to the
   will of the Father, died on the Cross the death of all, the death in
   which sin had involved all, then, and in that sense, God made Him to be
   sin for all. But what is meant by saying, in that sense.'? It means, in
   the sense of His death.' And what that means is not to be answered a
   priori, or on dogmatic grounds. It is to be answered out of the Gospel
   history, out of the experience of our Lord in the Garden and on the
   Cross. It is there we see what death meant for Him; what it meant for
   Him to make our sin, and the death in which God's judgment comes upon
   sin, His own; and it is the love which, in obedience to the Father, did
   not shrink from that for us which gives power and urgency to the appeal
   of the Gospel. We ought to feel that moralizing objections here are
   beside the mark, and that it is not for sinful men, who do not know
   what love is, to tell beforehand whether, or how far, the love of God
   can take upon itself the burden and responsibility of the world's sin;
   or if it does so, in what way its reality shall be made good. The
   premise of the Gospel is that we cannot bear that responsibility
   ourselves; if we are left alone with it, it will crush us to perdition.
   The message of the gospel, as it is here presented, is that Christ has
   borne it for us; if we deny that He can do so, is it not tantamount to
   denying the very possibility of a gospel? Mysterious and awful as the
   thought is, it is the key to the whole of the New Testament, that
   Christ bore our sins. Of this, God made Him to be sin for us is merely
   another equivalent; it means neither more nor less. The end
   contemplated -- that we might become the righteousness of God in Him --
   is here stated religiously or theologically. Christ takes our place in
   death, and in so doing is identified with the world's sin; the end in
   view in this is that we should take His place in life, and in so doing
   stand justified in God's sight. By what psychological process this
   change in our position is mediated St. Paul does not here tell. What he
   does is to give a religious equivalent for the ethical and
   psychological representation of ver. 14:

   He died for all, that they which live should not live unto themselves,
   but to Him who died for them and rose again.'

   It took no less than His death for them to bring into their life a
   motive of such creative and recreative power; and it takes no less than
   this being made sin for them to open for them the possibility of
   becoming God's righteousness in Him. To say so is not to bring
   different things into an artificial correspondence. The two statements
   are but the ethical and the theological representation of one and the
   same reality; and it confirms our interpretation of the passage, and
   our conviction of the coherence of the apostolic gospel, that under
   various and independent aspects we are continually coming on the same
   facts in the same relation to each other.

   (3.) The closing verses of the fifth chapter of 2nd Corinthians may
   fairly be called the locus classicus on the death of Christ in St.
   Paul's writings. Yet in proceeding to the Epistle to the Galatians we
   are introduced to a document which, more exclusively than any other in
   the New Testament, deals with this subject, and its significance. Even
   in the salutation, in which the apostle wishes his readers grace and
   peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, he expands the
   Savior's name by adding, in a way unexampled in such a connection
   elsewhere,

   who gave Himself for our sins that He might redeem us from the present
   world with all its ills, according, to the will of our God and Father'
   (1:4)

   Reference has already been made to the vehement words in which he
   anathematizes man or angel who shall preach a different gospel. At the
   end of the second chapter he puts again, in the strongest possible
   form, his conviction that Christianity, the new and true religion, is a
   thing complete in itself, exclusive of everything else, incapable of
   compromise or of supplement, and that it owes this completeness, and if
   we choose to call it so, this intolerance, to the supreme significance
   and power which belong in it to the death of Christ.

   I have been crucified with Christ my life is no longer mine, it is
   Christ who lives in me; the life I now live in flesh I live in faith,
   faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself up for me'
   (2:20).

   The whole of the Christian religion lies in that. The whole of
   Christian life is a response to the love exhibited in the death of the
   Son of God for men. No one can become right with God except by making
   the response of faith to this love -- that is, except by abandoning
   himself unreservedly to it as the only hope for sinful men. To trust it
   wholly and solely is the only right thing a man can do in presence of
   it; and when he does so trust it he is completely, finally, and
   divinely right. To supplement it is, according to Paul, to frustrate
   the grace of God; it is to compromise the Christian religion in its
   very principle; and to such a sin St. Paul will be no party. If
   righteousness is by law, as he sums it up in one of his passionate and
   decisive words, then Christ died for nothing (2:21). St. Paul knew by
   experience that all he was, or could ever become as a Christian, came
   out of the Cross. This is why he could say to the Corinthians,

   I determined to know nothing among you save Jesus Christ and Him
   crucified' (1 Corinthians 2:2);

   and why he repeats it in other words to the Galatians,

   God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, through which the world is crucified to me and I to the world'
   (Galatians 6:14).

   Put positively, then, we may say that the aim of the Epistle to the
   Galatians is to show that all Christianity is contained in the Cross;
   the Cross is the generative principle of everything Christian in the
   life of man. Put negatively, we may say its aim is to show that law,
   and especially, as it happened, the ritual side of the Jewish law,
   contributes nothing to that life. Now St. Paul, it might be argued, had
   come to know this experimentally, and independently of any theory. When
   it had dawned on his mind what the Cross of Christ was, when he saw
   what it signified as a revelation of God and His love, everything else
   in the universe faded from his view. Newman speaks, in a familiar
   passage of the Apologia, of resting in the thought of two, and two
   only, absolute and luminously self-evident beings, myself and my
   Creator'; in the relations and interaction of these two his religion
   consisted. A religion so generated, though it may be very real and
   powerful, is, of course, something far poorer than Christianity; yet in
   a somewhat similar way we might say of St. Paul that for him the
   universe of religion consisted of the soul and the Son of God giving
   Himself up for it; all that God meant for him, all that he could
   describe as revelation, all that begot within him what was at once
   religion, life, and salvation, was included in this act of Christ. No
   law, however venerable; no customs, however dear to a patriotic heart;
   no traditions of men, however respectable in effect or intention, could
   enter into competition with this. It was dishonoring to Christ, it was
   an annulling of the grace of God, to mention them alongside of it. To
   do so was to betray a radical misapprehension of Christ's death, such
   as made it for those who so misapprehended it entirely ineffective. Ye
   are severed from Christ,' St. Paul cries, ye who would be justified by
   law; ye are banished from grace' (5:4).

   But though St. Paul had learned this by experience, he does not, in
   point of fact, treat this subject of law empirically. He does not
   content himself with saying, I tried the law until I was worn out, and
   it did nothing for me; I made an exhaustive series of experiments with
   it, resultless experiments, and so I am done with it; through the law I
   have died to the law (2:19); it has itself taught me, by experience
   under it, that it is not the way to life, and so it is to me now as
   though it were not.' He does not content himself with giving this as
   his experience of the law; nor does he, on the other hand, content
   himself with giving us simply and empirically his experience of Christ.
   He does not say, Christ has done everything for me and in me. The
   constraint of His love is the whole explanation of my whole being as a
   Christian. By the grace of God, and by nothing else, I am what I am,
   and therefore the law is nothing to me: I am so far from finding myself
   obliged to acknowledge its claims still, that it is my deepest
   conviction that to acknowledge its claims at all is to frustrate the
   grace of God, to make void the Cross of Christ.' Probably if he had
   written thus -- and he might truly have written thus -- it would have
   seemed attractive and convincing to many who have misgivings about what
   he actually has written. But St. Paul could not, and did not remain at
   this empirical standpoint. He has a theory again -- or let us say an
   understanding -- of the relations of Christ and law, which enables him
   to justify and comprehend his experience. But for the truths of which
   this theory is the vehicle, the death of Christ would not be what it
   is, or exercise over the soul the power which it does. It is some dim
   sense of these truths, truths which the theory does not import but only
   unfolds, which in every case gives the death of Christ its constraining
   influence upon sinful men. What, then, is the theory?

   Briefly, it is summed up in the words, Christ under the law. This is
   the expression used in Galatians 4:4, and its indefiniteness, in this
   form, makes it seem unobjectionable enough. It signifies that when He
   came into the world Christ came under the same conditions as other men:
   all that a Jew meant when he said Law' had significance for him; the
   divine institutions of Israel had a divine authority which existed for
   him as well as for others. To say that the Son of God was made under
   the law would thus mean that He had the same moral problem in His life
   as other men; that He identified Himself with them in the spiritual
   conditions under which they lived; that the incarnation was a moral
   reality and not a mere show. But it is certain that this is not all
   that St. Paul meant; and to the writer, at least, it is not certain
   that St. Paul ever had this as a distinct and separate object of
   thought present to his mind at all. What he really means by Christ
   under the law' comes out in its full meaning in chapter 3 13: Christ
   redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming curse for us. Under
   the law,' in short, is an ambiguous expression, and it is necessary to
   be clear as to which of two possible interpretations it bears in this
   case. In relation to man in general, the law expresses the will of God.
   It tells him what he must do to please God. It is imperative, and
   nothing more. We may say, of course, that Christ was under the law in
   this sense it is self-evident. But as has just been hinted, it is
   doubtful whether St. Paul ever thought of this by itself. To be under
   the law in this sense did not to him at least yield the explanation of
   Christ's redeeming power. In the mere fact that Christ came to keep the
   law which was binding on all, there was no such demonstration of love
   to sinners as was sufficient, of itself, to make them new creatures.
   But this is not the only sense which can be assigned to the words,
   under the law.' The law has not only a relation to man as such, in
   which it expresses the will of God; it has a relation to men as
   sinners, in which it expresses the condemnation of God. Now Christ is
   our Redeemer, according to the apostle, because He was made under the
   law in this sense. He not only became man, bound to obedience -- it is
   not easy to say where the omnipotent loving constraint is to be
   discovered in this; but He became curse for us. He made our doom His
   own. He took on Him not only the calling of a man, but our
   responsibility as sinful men; it is in this that His work as Redeemer
   lies, for it is in this that the measure, or rather the immensity, of
   His love is seen. To say, He became a curse for us,' is exactly the
   same as to say, He was made sin for us,' or He died for us' but it is
   infinitely more than to say, He was made man for us' -- or even man
   bound to obedience to the law -- a proposition to which there is
   nothing analogous in the New Testament. The conception of obedience, as
   applicable to the work of Christ, will recur in other connections; here
   it is enough to say that if we wish to put the whole work of Christ
   under that heading, we must remember that what we have to do with is
   not the ordinary obedience of men, but the obedience of a Redeemer.
   Christ had an ethical vocation, as St. Paul reminds us in the very
   first reference to His death in this epistle, He gave Himself for our
   sins, to deliver us from the present evil world, according to the will
   of our God and Father'; but His vocation, in carrying out that
   redeeming will, was a unique one; and, according to St. Paul, its
   uniqueness consisted in this, that one who knew no sin had, in
   obedience to the Father, to take on Him the responsibility, the doom,
   the curse, the death of the sinful. And if any one says that this was
   morally impossible, may we not ask again, What is the alternative? Is
   it not that the sinful should be left alone with their responsibility,
   doom, curse, and death? And is not that to say that redemption is
   impossible? The obedience of the Redeemer transcends morality, if we
   will; it is something to which morality is unequal; from the point of
   view of ordinary ethics, it is a miracle. [47] But it is the very
   function of the Redeemer to do the thing which it is impossible for
   sinful men to do for themselves or for each other; and St. Paul's
   justification of the miracle is that it creates all the genuine and
   victorious morality -- all the keeping of God's commandments in love --
   which the world can show.

   There have been many attempts, if not to evade this line of argument,
   and this connection of ideas, then to find something quite different in
   Galatians, which shall dispense with the necessity of considering it.
   Thus it is argued that St. Paul in the whole epistle is dealing with
   Jews, or with people who wanted to be Jews, and with their relation to
   the ceremonial law -- a situation which no longer has reality for us.
   But this is hardly the case. St. Paul nowhere draws any distinction in
   the law between ceremonial and moral; the law for him is one, and it is
   the law of God. It is owing to accidental circumstances that the
   ceremonial aspect of it is more prominent in this epistle, as the
   ethical aspect is in Romans. But we shall find the same line of
   argument repeated in Romans, where it is the moral law which is at
   stake; and when the apostle tells us that through the law he has died
   to the law (Galatians 2:16), or that we have died to the law through
   the body of Christ (Romans 7:4), or that we are not under law but under
   grace (Romans 6:14), he has not the moral law any less in view than the
   ceremonial. He means that nothing in the Christian life is; explained
   by anything statutory, and that everything in it is explained by the
   inspiring power of that death in which Christ made all our
   responsibilities to the law His own. There is a sense, of course, in
   which the law is Jewish, but St. Paul had generalized it in order to be
   able to preach the Gospel to the gentiles; [48] he had found analogues
   of it in every society and in every conscience; in his evangelistic
   preaching he defined all sin by relation to it; in the utmost extent of
   meaning that could be given to the term, law' had significance for all
   men; and it was a gospel for all men that St. Paul preached when he
   declared that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming
   curse for us. No doubt when he wrote the words, Christ redeemed us from
   the curse of the law by becoming curse for us,' he was thinking, as his
   antecedents and circumstances compelled him to think, of himself and
   his fellow-countrymen, who had known so well the yoke of bondage; that
   is, it is an exegetical result that hemas means us Jews; but that does
   not alter the fact that the universal gospel underlies the expression,
   and is conveyed by it; it only means that here a definite application
   is made of that gospel in a relevant case.

   The same considerations dispose of the attempts that are made to
   evacuate the curse' of meaning by identifying it with the Cross.' No
   doubt Paul appeals in support of his idea that Christ became a curse
   for us to the text in Deuteronomy 21:23, which he quotes in the form
   Cursed is everyone who hangs upon a tree.' No doubt he avoids applying
   to Christ the precise words of the text, Accursed of God (kekateramenos
   hupo tou theou (LXX.) qllt 'lhym). So do we, because the words would be
   false and misleading. Christ hung on the tree in obedience to the
   Father's will, fulfilling the purpose of the Father's love, doing a
   work with which the Father was well pleased, and on account of which
   the Father highly exalted Him; hence to describe Him as accursed of God
   would be absurd. It is not because St. Paul shrinks from his own logic
   that he says He became a curse for us, instead of saying He became a
   curse of God, or accursed of God, for us; it is because he is speaking
   in truth and soberness. Death is the curse of the law. It is the
   experience in which the final repulsion of evil by God is decisively
   expressed; and Christ died. In His death everything was made His that
   sin had made ours -- everything in sin except its sinfulness. There is
   no essential significance in the crucifixion, as if it would have been
   impossible to say that Christ became a curse for us, if He had died in
   any other way. The curse, in truth, is only one of St. Paul's synonyms
   for the death of Christ -- one which is relative, no doubt, to the
   conception of Christ as under the law,' but which for its meaning is
   entirely independent of the passage in Deuteronomy. The New Testament
   has many analogies to this use of the Old. Christ rode into Jerusalem
   on an ass, and declared Himself a King in doing so, but no one supposes
   that His sovereignty is constituted or exhausted in this; it is
   entirely independent of it, though in connection with a certain
   prophecy (Zechariah 9:9) it can be identified with it. So again He was
   crucified between two thieves, and an evangelist says that there the
   Scripture was fulfilled -- He was numbered with transgressors; but we
   know that the Scripture was fulfilled in another and profounder sense,
   and would have been fulfilled all the same though Jesus had been
   crucified alone (Mark 15:28 Rec., Luke 22:37). And so also with the
   Deuteronomic quotation in Galatians 3:13. The Old Testament here gave
   Paul an expression -- an argumentum, if we will; it did not give him
   his gospel. He had said already, e.g. in 2 Corinthians 5:21, and will
   say again in other forms, all he has to say here, that in His death
   Christ was made under the law, not merely as that which laid its
   imperative, but as that which laid its sentence, upon man; that He took
   to Himself in His death our responsibility, our doom, our curse, as
   sinful men, and not merely our obligation to be good men. And though it
   is Christian, it is not illogical, to avoid such an expression as
   accursed of God. For in so making the doom of men His own in death
   Christ was doing God's will.

   The other passages in Galatians which deal with our subject bring to
   view the ethical rather than the theological import of the death of
   Christ. One occurs at chapter 5:24: They that are of Christ Jesus
   crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. ' Ideally, we must
   understand, this crucifixion of the flesh is involved in Christ's
   crucifixion; really, it is effected by it. Whoever sees into the secret
   of Calvary -- whoever is initiated into the mystery of that great death
   -- is conscious that the doom of sin is in it; to take it as real, and
   to stand in any real relation to it, is death to the flesh with its
   passions and desires. So with the last passage in the epistle at which
   the subject recurs (6:14): Never be it mine to boast but in the cross
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to
   me, and I to the world.' Here the apostle reiterates with new emphasis
   at the end of his letter what he has enforced from the beginning, that
   the Cross is the explanation of everything Christian. Of course it is
   the Cross interpreted as he has interpreted it; apart from this
   interpretation, which shows it to be full of a meaning that appeals
   irresistibly to man, it can have no rational or moral influence at all.
   But with this interpretation it is the annihilative and the creative
   power in Christianity; the first commandment of the new religion is
   that we shall have no God but Him, who is fully and finally revealed
   there.

   (4.) The Epistle to the Romans is not so directly controversial as that
   to the Galatians; there are no personal references in it and no temper.
   But the Gospel is defined in it in relation to law, in very much the
   same sense as in Galatians; the completeness of the Christian religion,
   its self-containedness, its self-sufficiency, the impossibility of
   combining it with or supplementing it from anything else, are assumed
   or proved in much the same way. The question of religion for St. Paul
   is, How shall a man, a sinful man, be righteous with God? The Gospel
   brings the answer to that question. It is because it does so that it is
   a Gospel. It tells sinful men of a righteousness which is exactly what
   they need. It preaches something on the ground of which, sinners as
   they are, God the Judge of all can receive them -- a righteousness of
   God, St. Paul calls it, naming it after Him who is its source, and at
   the same time characterizing it as divinely perfect and adequate -- a
   righteousness of God which is somehow identified with Jesus Christ (3
   22; cf. 1 Corinthians 1:30). In particular it is identified somehow
   with Jesus Christ in His death (3:25), and therefore in Romans as in
   Galatians this death of Christ is the source of all that is Christian.
   All Christian inferences about God are deduced from it. Once we are
   sure of it and of its meaning, we can afford a great deal of ignorance
   in detail. We know that it covers everything and guarantees everything
   in which we are vitally interested; that it disposes of the past,
   creates the future, is a security for immortal life and glory (5:9 ff.
   and 8:31 ff.). What, then, does St. Paul say of the righteousness of
   God, and of the death of Christ in relation to it?

   The critical passage is that in ch. 3 21 ff. To give a detailed
   exegesis of it would be to do what has been perhaps too often done
   already, and would raise questions to distract; as well as to aid
   intelligence. As is well known, there are two principal difficulties in
   the passage. The one is the meaning of hilasterion (propitiation) in
   5:25. The other is that which is raised by the question whether the
   righteousness of God has the same meaning throughout, or whether it may
   not have in one place -- say in 5:22 -- the half-technical sense which
   belongs to it as a summary of St. Paul's gospel; and in another -- say
   in 5:26 -- the larger and more general sense which might belong to it
   elsewhere in Scripture as a synonym for God's character, or at least
   for one of His essential attributes. Not that these two principal
   difficulties are unrelated to each other, on the contrary, they are
   inextricably intertwined, and cannot be discussed apart. It is an
   argument for distinguishing two senses of dikaiosune theou (the
   righteousness of God) that when we do so we are enabled to see more
   clearly the meaning of hilasterios. It is the very function of Jesus
   Christ, set forth by God as a propitiation in His blood, to exhibit
   these two senses (which are equally indispensable, if there is to be a
   religion for sinful men), in their unity and consistency with each
   other. And, on the other hand, the term hilasterios, to say the least,
   is relative to some problem created by sin for a God who would justify
   sinners; and the distinction of two senses in which dikaiosune theou is
   used enables us to state this problem in a definite form.

   Assuming, then, that both difficulties will come up for consideration,
   there is a certain convenience in starting with the second -- that
   which is involved in the use of the expression the righteousness of
   God.' It is used in vv. 21, 22, 25, and 26; and the use of it is
   implied in 3:24: being justified freely by His grace.' It seems to me a
   strong argument for the double sense of this expression that when the
   apostle brings his argument to a climax the two senses have sifted
   themselves out, so to speak, and stand distinctly, side by side, the
   end of all God's action in His redeeming revelation of Himself to men
   is that He may be just Himself, and justify him who believes in Jesus'
   (eis to einai auto dikaion kai dikaiounta ton ek pisteos Iesou., 3:26).
   The first part of this end -- God's being righteous Himself -- might
   quite fairly be spoken of as dikaiosune (God's righteousness); it is,
   indeed, what under ordinary circumstances is meant by the words.
   Compare, for example, the use of them in ch. 3: 5. But God's appearance
   in the character of ho dikaion (he who justifies) is also the
   manifestation of a righteousness of God, and indeed of the
   righteousness of God in the sense in which it constitutes St. Paul's
   gospel -- a righteousness of God which stands or turns to the good of
   the believing sinner. Both things are there: a righteousness which
   comes from God and is the hope of the sinful, and God's own
   righteousness, or His character in its self-consistency and
   inviolability. In virtue of the first, God is ho dikaion, the
   Justifier; in virtue of the second, He is dikaios, Just. What St. Paul
   is concerned to bring out, and what by means of the conception of
   Christ in His blood as hilasterios(endued with propitiatory power) he
   does bring out, is precisely the fact that both things are there, and
   there in harmony with each other. There can be no gospel unless there
   is such a thing as a righteousness of God for the ungodly. But just as
   little can there be any gospel unless the integrity of God's character
   be maintained. The problem of the sinful world, the problem of all
   religion, the problem of God in dealing with a sinful race, is how to
   unite these two things. The Christian answer to the problem is given by
   St. Paul in the words: Jesus Christ whom God set forth a propitiation
   (or, in propitiatory power) in His blood.' In Jesus Christ so set forth
   there is the manifestation of God's righteousness in the two senses,
   or, if we prefer it, in the complex sense, just referred to. Something
   is done which enables God to justify the ungodly who believe in Jesus,
   and at the same time to appear signally and conspicuously a righteous
   God. What this something is we have still to consider; but meanwhile it
   should be noted that this interpretation of the passage agrees with
   what we have already seen -- that justification of the ungodly, or
   forgiveness of sins, or redemption, or whatever we are to call it, is a
   real problem for St. Paul. Gospel is the last thing in the world to be
   taken for granted: before there can be any such thing a problem of
   tremendous difficulty has to be solved, and according to the apostle of
   the Gentiles it has received at God's hands a tremendous solution.

   Before entering into this, it is only fair to refer to the
   interpretations of the passage which aim at giving the righteousness of
   God precisely the same force all through. In this case, of course, it
   is the technical, specifically Pauline sense which is preferred; the
   dikaiosune theou is to be read always as that by which sinful man is
   justified. This is done by different interpreters with very various
   degrees of insight.

   (1) There are those who seem unconscious that there is any problem, any
   moral problem, in the situation at all. The righteousness of God, they
   argue, is essentially self-imparting; it goes out' and energizes in the
   world; it takes hold of human lives and fills them with itself; it acts
   on the analogy of a physical force, like light or heat, diffusing
   itself and radiating in every direction, indiscriminately and without
   limit. Legal religion, no doubt, conceives of it otherwise; to
   legalism, God's righteousness is a negative attribute, something in
   which God, as it were, stands on the defensive, maintaining His
   integrity against the sin of the world; but that is only a mistake.
   God's righteousness is effluent, overflowing, the source of all the
   goodness in the world; and we see in Jesus Christ that this is so. The
   truth in all this is as obvious as the irrelevance. Of course all
   goodness is of God; no man would less have wished to question this than
   St. Paul. But St. Paul felt that the sin of the world made a difference
   to God; it was a sin against His righteousness, and His righteousness
   had to be vindicated against it; it could not ignore it, and go on
   simpliciter justifying' men as if nothing had happened. Such an
   interpretation of the passage ignores altogether the problem which the
   sin of the world (as St. Paul looked at it) presented to God. It makes
   no attempt whatever to define the relation, on which everything in the
   passage turns, between the divine righteousness and the death of Christ
   as a hilasterion; and in missing altogether the problem, it misses as
   completely the solution -- that is, it misses the Gospel. We cannot
   keep Christianity, or any specifically Christian truth, if we deny its
   premises, nor can we either state or solve a moral problem if we
   confine ourselves to physical categories.

   (2) There are those who assimilate the righteousness of God in this
   passage to the dikaiosune theou of the Psalms and later Isaiah, those
   familiar passages in which it is so often found as a parallel to
   soteria (salvation). It is in these, they argue, that the real
   antecedents are found both of St. Paul's thoughts and of his language.
   What, for instance, could be closer to his mind than Psalm 96:2: The
   Lord hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He openly
   showed in the sight of the heathen'? In the Gospel we have the
   manifestation of the righteousness of God in this sense, a
   righteousness which is indistinguishable from His grace, and in which
   He shows Himself righteous by acting in accordance with His covenant
   obligations -- receiving His people graciously, and loving them freely.
   [49] There is something attractive in this, and something true; but it
   is as completely irrelevant to St. Paul's thought in the passage before
   us as the more superficial view already referred to. For one thing, St.
   Paul never refers to any of these passages in connecting his gospel
   with the Old Testament. He must have been perfectly aware that they
   were written on another plane than that on which he stood as a sinful
   man and a preacher to sinners. They were written for God's covenant
   people, to assure them that God would be true to the obligations of the
   covenant, and would demonstrate His righteousness in doing so; God's
   righteousness, in all these passages, is that attribute to which His
   people appeal when they are wronged. The situation which St. Paul has
   before him, however, is not that of God's people, wronged by their
   enemies, and entitled to appeal to His righteousness to plead their
   cause and put them in the right; it is that of people who have no
   cause, who are all in the wrong with God, whose sins impeach them
   without ceasing, to whom God as Righteous Judge is not, as to a wronged
   covenant people, a tower of hope, but a name which sums up all their
   fears. The people for whom Isaiah and the Psalms were written were
   people who, being put in the wrong by their adversaries on earth, had a
   supreme appeal to God, before whom they were confident they should be
   in the right; the people to whom St. Paul preaches are people who
   before God have no case, so that the assurances of the prophet and the
   psalmists are nothing to them. Of course there is such a thing as a New
   Covenant, and it is possible for those who are within it to appropriate
   these Old Testament texts; there is, for example, a clear instance of
   such appropriation in the First Epistle of John 1:9:

   If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our
   sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.'

   In other words, He is true to the obligations of His covenant with us
   in Christ. These glorious Old Testament Scriptures, therefore, are not
   without their meaning for the New, or their influence in it; but it is
   a complete mistake, and it has been the source of the most far-reaching
   and disastrous confusion, to try to deduce from them the Pauline
   conception of the righteousness of God. And it must be repeated that in
   such interpretations, as in those already referred to, there is again
   wanting any sense of a problem such as St. Paul is undoubtedly
   grappling with, and any attempt to define explicitly and intelligibly
   the relation between the righteousness of God, conceived as it is here
   conceived, and the propitiation in the blood of Christ. Indeed, it is
   not too much to say that for St. Paul there is no such thing as a
   dikaiosune theou except through the propitiation; whereas here the
   dikaiosune theou is fully explained, with no reference to the
   propitiation whatever.

   (3) It is worth while to refer to one particular construction of the
   passage, in which an attempt is made to keep the same sense of
   dikaiosune theou throughout, and at the same time to do justice to the
   problem which is obviously involved. It is that which is given by Dr.
   Seeberg of Dorpat in his book, Der Tod Christi. Seeberg as a writer is
   not distinguished either by lucidity or conciseness, but, put briefly,
   his interpretation is as follows: Righteousness means acting according
   to one's proper norm, doing what one ought to do. God's proper norm,
   the true rule of action for Him, is that He should institute and
   maintain fellowship with men. He would not be righteous if He did not
   do so; He would fail of acting in His proper character. Now, in setting
   forth Christ as a propitiation, God does what the circumstances require
   if fellowship is to be instituted and maintained between Himself and
   sinful men; and it is in this sense that the propitiation manifests or
   demonstrates His righteousness. It shows God not unrighteous, not false
   to Himself and to the true norm of His action, as He would have been if
   in the face of sin He had simply let the idea of fellowship with man
   go; but manifesting Himself as a righteous God, who is true to Himself
   and to His norm most signally and conspicuously in this, that over sin
   and in spite of it He takes means to secure that fellowship between
   Himself and men shall not finally lapse. This is ingenious and
   attractive, though whether the conception of the righteousness of God
   from which it starts would have been recognized by St. Paul or by any
   Scripture writer is another matter; but apart from this, it obviously
   leaves a question unanswered, on the answer to which a great deal
   depends. That question is, What is the means which God takes to secure
   fellowship with sinful men, i.e., to act toward them in a way which
   does justice to Himself? It is implied in Seeberg's whole argument that
   sin does create a problem for God; something has to be done, where
   sinful men are concerned, before fellowship with God can be taken for
   granted; and that something God actually does when He sets forth Christ
   a propitiation, through faith in His blood. The question, therefore, is
   -- if we are going to think seriously at all -- What is the
   propitiation, or more precisely, How is the propitiation to be defined
   in relation to the sin of the world, in view of which God provided it,
   that He might be able still to maintain fellowship with man?

   This is a question which, so far as I am able to follow him, Seeberg
   never distinctly answers. He says that God set forth Christ in His
   blood as ein solches . . . welches durch den Glauben ein suhnhaft
   wirkendes ist' (a thing or power of such a sort that through faith it
   comes to have an atoning efficacy). [50] He refuses to explain the
   propitiatory character of Christ's death by regarding it as
   sacrificial; he refuses to explain it as in any sense vicarious;
   neither of these ideas, according to him, is supported by St. Paul.
   What St. Paul taught was rather this. Christ comprehended in Himself
   the whole human race, as Adam did (this idea St. Paul is supposed to
   have borrowed from the Jewish doctrine of original sin); and through
   the death of Christ humanity has suffered that which the holy God in
   grace claimed from it as the condition of its entering again into
   fellowship with Him. As the Holy One, He has made this re-entrance
   dependent upon death, and as the Gracious One He has consented to be
   satisfied with that suffering of death which He has made possible for
   humanity in Christ. [51] It is not easy to regard this as real
   thinking. It does not set the death of Christ in any real relation to
   the problem with which the apostle is dealing. The suffering of death
   is that which God in His grace is pleased to claim from the sinful race
   as the condition of restored fellowship, and He has been further
   pleased to accept as satisfying this condition that particular
   suffering of death which Christ endured, and which can be reproduced in
   individuals through faith; but everything is of mere good pleasure,
   there is no rational necessity at any point. One can only repeat it,
   this is a medium in which thinking is impossible, and it is not the
   medium in which St. Paul's mind moved. It was not an arbitrary
   appointment of God that made the death of Christ hilasterion; it was
   the essential relation, in all human experience, of death and sin.
   Christ died for our sins, because it is in death that the divine
   judgment on sin is finally expressed. Once we put law and necessity out
   of the relations between Christ's death and our sin, we dismiss the
   very possibility of thinking on the subject; we may use words about it,
   but they are words without meaning. It is a significant feature of all
   such explanations, to call them so, of Christ's death, that they do not
   bring it into any real relation to the Christian's freedom from the
   law, or to the controversies which raged round this in the Pauline
   churches; and this is only one of the ways in which it, appears that
   though using certain Pauline words they have gone off the rails of
   Pauline thought. The passage in Romans becomes simple as soon as we
   read it in the light of those we have already examined in 2 Corinthians
   and in Galatians. It is Christ set forth in His blood who is a
   propitiation; that is, it is Christ who died. In dying, as St. Paul
   conceived it, He made our sin His own; He took it on Himself as the
   reality which it is in God's sight and to God's law: He became sin,
   became a curse for us. It is this which gives His death a propitiatory
   character and power; in other words, which makes it possible for God to
   be at once righteous and a God who accepts as righteous those who
   believe in Jesus. He is righteous, for in the death of Christ His law
   is honored by the Son who takes the sin of the world to Himself as all
   that it is to God; and He can accept as righteous those who believe in
   Jesus, for in so believing sin becomes to them what it is to Him. I do
   not know any word which conveys the truth of this if vicarious' or
   substitutionary' does not, nor do I know any interpretation of Christ's
   death which enables us to regard it as a demonstration of love to
   sinners, if this vicarious or substitutionary character is denied.

   There is much preaching about Christ's death which fails to be a
   preaching of Christ's death, and therefore to be in the full sense of
   the term gospel preaching, because it ignores this. The simplest hearer
   feels that there is something irrational in saying that the death of
   Christ is a great proof of love to the sinful, unless there is shown at
   the same time a rational connection between that death and the
   responsibilities which sin involves, and from which that death
   delivers. Perhaps one should beg pardon for using so simple an
   illustration, but the point is a vital one, and it is necessary to be
   clear. If I were sitting on the end of the pier, on a summer day,
   enjoying the sunshine and the air, and some one came along and jumped
   into the water and got drowned to prove his love for me,' I should find
   it quite unintelligible. I might be much in need of love, but an act in
   no rational relation to any of my necessities could not prove it. But
   if I had fallen over the pier and were drowning, and some one sprang
   into the water, and at the cost of making my peril, or what but for him
   would be my fate, his own, saved me from death, then I should say,
   Greater love hath no man than this.' I should say it intelligibly,
   because there would be an intelligible relation between the sacrifice
   which love made and the necessity from which it redeemed. Is it making
   any rash assumption to say that there must be such an intelligible
   relation between the death of Christ -- the great act in which His love
   to sinners is demonstrated -- and the sin of the world for which in His
   blood He is the propitiation? I do not think so. Nor have I yet seen
   any intelligible relation established between them except that which is
   the key to the whole of New Testament teaching, and which bids us say,
   as we look at the Cross, He bore our sins, He died our death. It is so
   His love constrains us. Accepting this interpretation, we see that the
   whole secret of Christianity is contained in Christ's death, and in the
   believing abandonment of the soul to that death in faith. It is from
   Christ's death, and the love which it demonstrates, that all Christian
   inferences are drawn. Once this is accepted, everything else is easy
   and is secure.

   When we were yet sinners, Christ died for us; much more then being
   justified now in His blood shall we be saved through Him from the
   wrath. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through
   the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved in
   His life' (Romans 5: 8 ff.).

   The much more implies that in comparison with this primary, this
   incredibly great proof of God's love, everything else may be taken for
   granted. It is the same argument which is employed again in chap. 8:32:

   He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how
   shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?'

   And as it includes everything else on the part of God, so does it also
   on the part of man. The propitiatory death of Christ, as an
   all-transcending demonstration of love, evokes in sinful souls a
   response which is the whole of Christianity. The love of Christ
   constraineth us: whoever can say that can say all that is to be said
   about the Christian life.

   This is not the way in which St. Paul's gospel is usually represented
   now. Since Pfleiderer's first book on Paulinism was translated, some
   thirty years ago, it has become almost an axiom with many writers on
   this subject, that the apostle has two doctrines of reconciliation -- a
   juridical and an ethico-mystical one. There is, on the one hand, the
   doctrine that Christ died for us, in a sense like that which has just
   been explained; and on the other, the doctrine that in a mystical union
   with Christ effected by faith we ethically die with Him and live with
   Him -- this dying with Christ and living with Him, or in Him, being the
   thing we call salvation.

   What the relation of the two doctrines is to each other is variously
   represented. Sometimes they are added together, as by Weiss, as though
   in spite of their independence justice had to be done to both in the
   work of man's salvation a doctrine of justification by faith alone in
   Christ who died for us finding its indispensable supplement in a
   doctrine of spiritual regeneration through baptism, in which we are
   vitally united to Christ in His death and resurrection. Weiss holds
   that it is not Pauline to say that the fellowship of life with Christ
   is established by faith; it is only established, according to his view,
   by baptism. [52] But Paul, it is safe to say, was incapable of
   divorcing his thoughts so completely from reality as to represent the
   matter thus. He was not pedantically interpreting a text, he was
   expounding an experience; and there is nothing in any Christian
   experience answering to this dead or inert justification by faith,
   which has no relation to the new life, nor again is there anything in
   Christian experience like this new life which is added by baptism to
   the experience of justification by faith, but does not spring out of
   it. It is a moral wrong to any serious-minded person to construe his
   words in this way. Ritschl does not add the two sides of the Pauline
   gospel together as Weiss does. For him they stand side by side in the
   apostle, and though salvation is made equally dependent on the one and
   the other they are never combined. Romans sixth has nothing to do with
   Romans third. The conception of the new life, derived from union to
   Christ in His death and resurrection, is just as indifferent to
   justification by faith, as the representation of Christ's death in the
   sixth chapter of Romans is to the sacrificial representation of the
   same thing in the third. The new life or active righteousness of the
   sixth chapter bears the same name as the divine righteousness of the
   third, but materially they have nothing in common, and the diversity of
   their contents stands in no relation to the origination of the one from
   the other. [53] Ritschl says it is for dogmatic, not biblical, theology
   to define the problem created by these two ways of salvation and the
   apparent contradiction between them -- and to attempt its solution; and
   Holtzmann is disposed to censure Weiss for overlooking this, and
   attempting an adjustment in his Biblical Theology of the New Testament.
   [54] But this is manifestly unfair to St. Paul. The apostle knew
   nothing about the distinctions which Theological Encyclopaedia draws
   between biblical and dogmatic; he was a man of intellectual force and
   originality engaged in thinking out a redeeming and regenerative
   experience, and the presumption surely is that his thought will
   represent somehow the consistency and unity of his experience. If it
   does so, it is for his interpreters to make the fact clear without
   troubling themselves whether the result is to be labeled biblical or
   dogmatic. There are too many people who refuse to take biblical
   theology seriously, because it is incoherent, and who refuse to take
   dogmatic seriously, because its consistency is artificially produced by
   suppressing the exuberant variety of the New Testament. Perhaps if New
   Testament experience had justice done to it, the incoherence of New
   Testament thinking would not be so obvious. Holtzmann himself attempts
   to find points of contact, or lines of connection, or to borrow from
   another field an expression of Dr. Fairbairn's, developmental
   coincidences' between the two gospels, though in a haphazard way; ideas
   like pistis pneuma, and apolutrosis, it is pointed out, find a place in
   the unfolding of both. [55]

   In spite of such high authorities, I venture to put in a plea for the
   coherence of St. Paul. If we found the one theory, as it is called, at
   one period of his life, and the other at another, there might be a
   prima facie case for inconsistency; but when both are set out in full
   detail, in a definite sequence, in the same letter, and that the most
   systematic of all the apostle's writings, and one which aims
   unambiguously at exhibiting his gospel as a whole, the presumption is
   all the other way. There are cases in which it is fallacious to say
   post hoc, ergo propter hoc, but this is not one. There could not be a
   greater mistake than to assume that in the sixth chapter of Romans St.
   Paul makes a new beginning, forgetting all that he has said, and
   meeting objections to that gospel which we have been expounding by
   introducing ideas which have no relation to it, and which may indeed be
   described as a correction of it, or a supplement to it, or a substitute
   for it, but which are in no sense whatever a vindication of it. A
   vindication of it is clearly what St. Paul means to give, and we are
   bound to assume that he saw what he was doing. He had preached that
   sinful men are justified freely through faith in Jesus set forth by God
   as a propitiation in His blood, and his adversaries had brought against
   this gospel the accusation that it tempted to and even justified
   continuance in sin. What is his answer? To begin with, it is an
   expression of moral horror at the suggestion. me genoito! But, in the
   next place, it is a demonstration of the inconsistency of such a line
   of action with what is involved in justification. Men who like us died
   to sin, how shall we still live in it?' (Romans 6:2).

   Why should it be taken for granted that dying to sin' is a new idea
   here, on a new plane, an idea which startles one who has been following
   only that interpretation of justification which we find in Romans chs.
   3-5? It may be a new idea to a man who takes the point of view of St.
   Paul's opponents, and who does not know what it is to be justified
   through faith in the propitiation which is in Christ's death; but it is
   not a new idea to the apostle, nor to any one who has received the
   reconciliation he preaches; nor would he be offering any logical
   defense of his gospel if it were a new idea. But it is no new idea at
   all; it is Christ dying for sin -- St. Paul reminds the objectors to
   his doctrine -- it is Christ dying our death on the tree, who evokes
   the faith by which we become right with God; and the faith which He
   evokes answers to what He is and to what He does: it is faith which has
   a death to sin in it. Of course, if Christ's death were not what it has
   been described to be, it would be nothing to us; it would evoke no
   faith at all; but being what it has been described to be, the faith
   which is the response to it is a faith which inevitably takes moral
   contents and quality from it. The very same experience in which a man
   becomes right with God -- that is, the experience of faith in Christ
   who died for sins -- is an experience in which he becomes a dead man,
   so far as sin is concerned, a living man (though this is but the same
   thing in other words), so far as God is concerned. As long as faith is
   at its normal tension the life of sin is inconceivable. For faith is an
   attitude and act of the soul in which the whole being is involved, and
   it is determined through and through by its object. This, I repeat, is
   what is given in experience to the man who believes in Christ as St.
   Paul preaches Him in Romans 3:25 f., and this is the ethical
   justification of his gospel. What is fundamental here is Christ in the
   character of propitiation, Christ bearing our sin in His death, it is
   this Christ and no other who draws us in faith to Himself, so that in
   and through faith His death and life become ours. The forensic theory
   of atonement, as it is called, is not unrelated to the ethico-mystical;
   it is not parallel to it; it is not a mistaken ad hominem or rather ad
   Pharisaeum mode of thought which ought to be displaced by the other; it
   has the essential eternal truth in it by which and by which alone the
   experiences are generated in which the strength of the other is
   supposed to lie. I do not much care for the expression mystical union'
   with Christ, for it has been much abused, and in St. Paul especially
   has led to much hasty misconstruction of the New Testament; but if we
   are to use it at all, we must say that it is something which is not a
   substitute for, but the fruit of, the vicarious death of Christ. It
   owes its very being to that atonement outside of us, that finished work
   of Christ, which some would use it to discredit. And it is because this
   is so, that St. Paul can use it, so far as he does so, not to replace,
   or to supplement, or to correct, but to vindicate and show the moral
   adequacy of his doctrine of justification. Of course, in the last
   resort, the objection brought against St. Paul's gospel can only be
   practically refuted. It must be lived down, not argued down; hence the
   hortatory tone of Romans 6. But the new life is involved in the faith
   evoked by the sin-bearing death of Christ, and in nothing else; it is
   involved in this, and this is pictorially presented in baptism. Hence
   the use which St. Paul makes of this sacrament in the same chapter. He
   is able to use it in his argument in the way he does because baptism
   and faith are but the outside and the inside of the same thing. If
   baptism, then, is symbolically inconsistent with continuance in sin, as
   is apparent to every one, faith is really inconsistent with it. But
   faith is relative to the dikaiosune theou, the divine justification
   which is St. Paul's gospel, and therefore that gospel in turn is beyond
   moral reproach. [56] The true connection of the apostle's ideas is
   perfectly put in the glorious lines of that great mystic, St. Bernard
   --


   Propter mortem quam tulisti

   Quando pro me defecisti;

   Cordis mei cor dilectum

   In te meum fer affectum!

   As a comment on the connection between Romans 3-5 and Romans 6-8 -- on
   the relation of the substitution of Christ to ethical identification
   with Him -- of Christ for us to Christ in us or we in Him -- this for
   truth and power will never be surpassed. But blot out the first two
   lines, and the inspiration of the third and fourth is gone. Precisely
   so, if we blot out the forensic' gospel of St. Paul we shall find that
   the ethico-mystical' one has the breath of its life withdrawn.

   It is possible to go more into detail here on lines suggested by St.
   Paul himself. Christ died our death on the cross, and the faith which
   that death evokes has a death in it also. But how are we to interpret
   this? By relation to what are we to define the death which is involved
   in faith? We may define it by relation to anything by relation to which
   Christ's death has been defined. Thus, following the apostle, we can
   say that the death involved in faith is

   (1) a death to sin. Christ's death on the cross was a death to sin, the
   apostle tells us, in the sense that it introduced Him to a condition in
   which He had no longer any responsibility in relation to it (Romans
   6:10). He had assumed the responsibility of it in love, but He had also
   discharged it, and sin had no claim on Him further. For us, dying to
   sin may seem to have a different meaning; it is not only a discharge
   from its responsibilities that is wanted, but a deliverance from its
   power. But this can only come on the foundation of the other; it is the
   discharge from the responsibilities of sin involved in Christ's death
   and appropriated in faith, which is the motive power in the daily
   ethical dying to sin. It really is such a motive power, and the only
   one in the world, when we realize what it is. But just as death to the
   law -- to anticipate for a moment another experience involved in faith
   in the death of Christ -- needs to be realized by ceaseless vigilance
   against all that would enslave the conscience, and against everything
   in our nature that makes us seek external supports, and authorities to
   relieve us of the responsibility of becoming a law to ourselves under
   the constraint of the cross, so must death to sin also be realized by
   moral effort. It is involved in faith, so far as the principle and the
   motive power are concerned; the man who plants his whole hope in the
   revelation of God made in Christ the propitiation is a man who in the
   act and for the time is taking sin, death, the law, and the judgment of
   God, as all that they are to Christ; that is, he is owning sin, and
   disowning it utterly; acknowledging it as unreservedly in all its
   responsibility, and separating himself as entirely from it, as Christ
   did when He died. Such faith, involving such a relation to sin as can
   be called a death to it, covers the whole life, and is a moral
   guarantee for it; yet the death to sin which is lodged in it has to be
   carried out in a daily mortification of evil, the initial crucifixion
   with Christ in a daily crucifixion of the passions and lusts.

   (2) It may even be said more specifically that the death involved in
   faith is a death to the flesh. This is the point of the difficult
   passage in Romans 8:3 f. St. Paul is there describing the way of
   salvation from sin, and says that the law was impotent in the matter
   owing to the flesh. The flesh virtually means sin in its constitutional
   and instinctive character -- sin as the nature or the second nature of
   man, it does not here matter which.

   What the law could not do God took another way of doing. He sent His
   Son in the likeness of flesh of sin, and as a sin-offering, and in so
   doing condemned sin in the flesh. homoioma here no doubt emphasizes
   Christ's likeness to us: it is not meant to suggest difference or
   unreality in His nature. He was all that we are, short of sin. Yet He
   came in connection with sin, or as a sin-offering, and it is through
   this that we must interpret the expression, condemned sin in the
   flesh.' It does not mean that Christ showed sin to be inexcusable, by
   Himself leading a sinless life; there is no salvation, no emancipation
   from sin in that. The condemnation is the act of God, and in sending
   His own Son in connection with sin -- which must mean in the one
   connection with it which St. Paul ever refers to, i.e. as a
   propitiation for it -- God condemned it in the flesh. His judgment came
   on it in the death which Christ died in our nature, and with that
   judgment its right and its power in our nature came to an end. I say
   its right and its power, for the things are related. Until the
   responsibilities involved in sin have been fully acknowledged and met,
   as they are acknowledged and met in the death of Christ, its power
   remains; to express the truth psychologically, until sin is expiated,
   the sinner has a bad conscience, and as long as a man has a bad
   conscience, he cannot begin to be a good man. It is because Christ's
   death deals effectually with the responsibility of sin, and puts right
   with God the man who believes in Him, that it can do for our nature
   what law could never do -- break sin's power. Weiss and others have
   argued that it is a mistake to find here the idea of expiation: the
   context is interested only in the moral deliverance from evil. But from
   the point of view of St. Paul, this is not a reasonable objection -- it
   is setting the end against the means. He knew by experience that sin
   could only have its power broken by being expiated, and that is
   precisely what he teaches here. Only, he gives it a peculiar turn. The
   fact that expiation has been made through Christ's death for sin in the
   very nature which we wear, is used to bring out the idea that in that
   nature, at all events, sin can have no indefeasible right and no
   impregnable seat. The death involved in faith in Christ is a death not
   only to sin generally, but to sin in the constitutional and virulent
   character suggested by the flesh. But like the other deaths,' this one
   too needs to be morally realized. Mortify therefore your members which
   are upon the earth.'

   (3) Further, the death involved in faith is repeatedly defined by St.
   Paul as a death to the law, or to law in general (Galatians 2:19;
   Romans 6:14 and 7:4). There is undoubtedly something paradoxical in
   this, and it is the point at which St. Paul's gospel, from the
   beginning, was most misunderstood and most assailed. On the one hand,
   when Christ died, justice was done to the law of God, both as an
   imperative and as a condemning law, as it had never been done before.
   The will of God had been honored by a life of perfect obedience, and
   the awful experience of death in which God's inexorable judgment on sin
   comes home to the conscience had been borne in the same obedience and
   love by His sinless Son. On the other hand, when this death evokes the
   faith for which it appeals, the righteous requirement of the law is
   fulfilled in the believer; the law gets its clue in his life also, or,
   as the apostle puts it, it is established by faith. How is it, then,
   that faith involves a death to the law? It is through the assurance,
   given to faith at the cross, that so far as doing the will of God is
   concerned, a new and living way has been found. It is not the law in
   its old legal form -- the law of statutory injunctions and prohibitions
   -- which is to generate goodness in sinful man; it is the law glorified
   in the atonement. The whole inspiration of the Christian life lies
   here, and it is an inspiration, not a statutory requirement. Nothing is
   to count in the life of a Christian which does not come with perfect
   freedom from this source. This explains the extraordinary emphasis
   which St. Paul everywhere lays on liberty. Liberty is the correlative
   of responsibility; man must be perfectly free that the whole weight of
   his responsibilities may come upon him. But this weight of
   responsibility cannot be faced, and would not sanctify even if it could
   be faced, in vacuo; it can be faced only when we know God in Christ
   crucified; and it does sanctify, when the constraint of the atonement,
   with its awful homage, to the holiness of God, descends upon the heart.
   But this is all that is required, for this is too great to be
   compromised by alliance with anything else. Perfect freedom, with
   entire responsibility to the Redeemer -- the obligation to be a law to
   oneself, with the power of Christ's passion resting upon the spirit --
   that is the death to law which St. Paul contemplates. No statutes, no
   traditions of men, no dogmata, intellectual or moral, no scruples in
   the consciences of others, are to have legal obligations for us any
   longer. Not even the letters written by the finger of God on the tables
   of stone constitute a legal obligation for the Christian. All that he
   is to be must come freely out of the atoning death of Christ. He is
   dead to the law -- in the widest sense of the word, he is dead to law
   -- through the body of Christ. From this freedom we are always being
   tempted to relapse. We are always establishing for ourselves, or
   letting others impose upon us, customs -- whether intellectual, as
   creeds; or ethical, as the conventional ways of being charitable or of
   worshipping God -- which though good in themselves, tend to corrupt the
   world just because they are customs -- in other words, we are always
   tacitly denying that the death of Christ does full justice to law in
   every sense of the term, and that for those who believe in it law
   exists henceforth only in the divine glory of the atonement, and in the
   life which it inspires.

   It may seem astonishing that in all this no reference has been made to
   the Spirit, but the omission, I think, can be justified. [57] For one
   thing, St. Paul himself discusses the whole subject of the Christian's
   death with Christ, as involved in Christ's death and the Christian's
   faith in it, without reference to the Spirit. The Spirit is not
   mentioned in the sixth chapter of Romans. I do not say it is not
   implied -- for instance, in the allusions to baptism; but it is implied
   in all that the apostle says; it is not implied as something to be
   added to it. Theologically, the Spirit is the divine correlative of
   faith, and of the dying with Christ and living with Christ, of which we
   have been speaking; it is the power of God which is manifested in every
   Christian experience whatever. It is not something specifically divine
   which comes in through baptism and has no relation to faith and
   justification; it is related in the same way to all; it is the divine
   factor in all that restores man to, and maintains him in, the life of
   God. But the Spirit does not work in vacuo. He glorifies Christ. He
   works through the propitiation, interpreting, revealing, applying it;
   and when we talk of the Spirit as an abstractly supernatural power, a
   power of God not working through the gospel and its appeal to the
   reason, conscience, and will of man, we are not on Christian ground.
   Without the Spirit -- that is, without God -- all that has been said
   about the meaning of Christ's death could not win upon men; but just
   because the action of the Spirit is implied as the correlative of faith
   at every point, it is illegitimate to call it in to explain one
   Christian experience more than another -- for instance, to derive
   regeneration from it, or the new life, but not justification. Either
   Spirit or Faith may truly be said to be co-extensive with Christianity,
   and therefore they are co-extensive with each other. But if we are
   speaking of the new moral life of the Christian, and ask what we mean
   by the Spirit psychologically -- that is, what form it takes as an
   experience -- I should say it is indistinguishable from that infinite
   assurance of God's love, given in Christ's death, through which the
   Christian is made more than conqueror in all the difficulties of life,
   inward or external. It is with this assurance the Spirit is connected
   when St. Paul opens his discussion of the subject in Romans 5:5:

   The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit
   given to us.'

   It is with this same assurance he concludes his discussion, ch. 8:35:
   Who shall separate us from the love of God?' The triumphant certainty
   of this love, a certainty always recurring to and resting on that
   miracle of miracles, the sin-bearing death of Christ, is the same thing
   as joy in the Holy Spirit, and it is this joy which is the Christian's
   strength. From the Spirit, then, or from the love of God as an assured
   possession, the Christian life may equally be explained. And it is not
   another, but the same explanation, when we say that it is begotten and
   sustained from beginning to end by the virtue which dwells in the
   propitiatory death of Jesus.

   (4) When we come to the epistles of the Imprisonment a new range seems
   to be given to Christ's death, and to the work of reconciliation which
   is accomplished in it. This holds, at least, of the Epistles to the
   Colossians and Ephesians; so far as Philippians is concerned, we find
   ourselves in the same circle of ideas as in Galatians and Romans. The
   close parallel, indeed, of Philippians 3:9 f. with the exposition of
   the apostolic gospel in these earlier letters is a striking proof of
   the tenacity and consistency of St. Paul's thought. But in Colossians
   we are confronted with a new situation. The world' which is the object
   of reconciliation is no longer as in 2 Corinthians 5:19, or Romans 319,
   the world of sinful men; it is a world on a grander scale.

   God has been pleased through Him to reconcile all things to Himself,
   having made peace through the blood of His cross, through Him, whether
   they be things on earth or things in heaven' (Colossians 1:20).

   The reconciliation of sinful men is represented as though it were only
   a part of this vaster work.

   And you,' it is added, who were once estranged, and enemies in mind by
   wicked works, He has now reconciled in the body of His flesh through
   death' (1:21 f.).

   The same ideas are found in the Epistle to the Ephesians (1:7 ff.).
   Here we start with the historical Christ, in whom we have our
   redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of our trespasses';
   but when the mystery of Christ's work is revealed to the Christian
   intelligence, it is seen to have as its end the gathering together in
   one of all things in Him, both things in (or above) the heavens and
   things on the earth' (1:10). This enlargement of the scope of Christ's
   death, or, if we prefer to call it so, this extension of its virtue
   into regions where we cannot speak of it from experience, has sometimes
   had a disconcerting effect, and the bearings of it are not quite clear.
   It is argued by some, who naturally wish to be as precise as possible
   in interpreting their author, that the things in heaven and the things
   on earth,' which are referred to in the passages just quoted, must be
   spiritual beings; only such can be the objects of reconciliation, for
   only such can have estranged themselves from God by sin. But where do
   we find the idea of any such estrangement in Scripture, except in the
   case of disobedient angels to whom the idea of reconciliation is never
   applied? For answer we are pointed to various passages in the Old and
   the New Testament, not to mention Jewish literature outside, in which
   there is the conception of spiritual beings whose fortunes are somehow
   bound up with those of men. Thus in Isaiah 24:21, a late passage in
   which apocalypse begins to displace prophecy, we read,

   It shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall punish the host
   of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.'

   The two sets of persons here referred to somehow correspond to each
   other; there is a counter-part in the unseen world of the characters
   and fortunes visible on earth. Again, in the book of Daniel we hear of
   the prince of the kingdom of Persia' (ch. 10: 13), the prince of
   Grecia' (10: 20), and your prince' (10: 21), meaning the prince of the
   children of Israel, the princes, as the name Michael in 10:21 shows,
   being in all cases angelic beings, who in some way or other were
   identified with the nations, representing them in the unseen world,
   pleading their cause, fighting their battles, and mysteriously involved
   in their fortunes. It is something quite analogous to this that we find
   in the early chapters of Revelation, where the epistles of the risen
   Lord are addressed to the angels of the churches. The angel is not a
   bishop; he is, so to speak, the personification of the church in the
   world unseen; the spiritual counterpart of it, conceived as a person on
   whom its character and responsibilities will be visited somehow. It is
   the same idea, with an individual application, that we find in our
   Lord's word about the angels of the little ones, who in heaven do
   always behold the face of His heavenly Father (Matthew 18:10), and
   again in the book of Acts (12:15), where the people who would not
   believe that Peter had been released from prison said, It is his
   angel.' On such a background of Jewish belief the interpretation of
   these passages has been essayed. It is not man only, we are asked to
   believe, who has been involved in sin, and in the alienation from God
   which is its consequence; the sin of man has consequences which reach
   far beyond man himself. It stretches downward through nature, which has
   been made subject to vanity because of it, and it stretches upward into
   a spiritual world which we may not be able to realize, but which, like
   nature, is compromised somehow by our sin, and entangled in our
   responsibility to God. For these higher beings, then, as well as for
   man, Christ has done His reconciling work, and when it is finished they
   as well as we will be gathered together in one in Him.

   It would perhaps be going too far to say that there is nothing in this,
   and that no such ideas ever floated vaguely before the apostle's
   imagination. The people to whom he wrote believed in thrones and
   dominions and principalities and powers'; and although there is a touch
   of indifference, not to say scorn, in some of his own allusions to the
   high-sounding names -- for instance, in Ephesians 1:22 f. -- they had
   some sort of reality for the too. There are passages like Colossians
   2:15, or those in which he refers to ta stoicheia tou kosmou (Galatians
   4:3 and Colossians 2:8), where he seems to connect the spiritual beings
   in question with the angels through whom the law was given (Galatians
   3:19, Acts 7:53 and Galatians 2:2), and to represent the superseding of
   Judaism by Christianity as a victory of Jesus over these inferior but
   refractory powers to whom for a while the administration of human
   affairs, and especially of the immature, materialistic and legal stages
   of religion had been committed. But if he had definitely held such a
   view as has just been expounded, the probabilities are that it would
   have told more decidedly on his thinking, and found less ambiguous
   expression in his writings. He could not, for example, have given that
   complete account of his gospel -- of the need for a righteousness of
   God, of the provision of it, and of the vindication of it -- which he
   does give in Romans 1-8, without so much as alluding to these vaguely
   conceived beings. [58] At best they could belong only to the
   quasi-poetical representation of his faith, not to the gospel which he
   preached on the basis of experience, nor to the theology or philosophy
   which was its intellectual expression. And when we look at the epistles
   of the Captivity generally, our minds are rather drawn in another
   direction. The enlarged scope of the work of reconciliation is part of
   that expansion, so to speak, of Christ's person from a historical to a
   cosmical significance which is characteristic of these epistles as a
   whole. Christ is no longer a second Adam, the head of a new humanity,
   as in the earlier letters (Romans 5:12 ff. and 1 Corinthians 15:45
   ff.); He is the center of the universe. He is a person so great that
   St. Paul is obliged to reconstruct His whole world around Him. He is
   the primary source of all creation, its principle of unity, its goal
   (Colossians 1:15 ff.). In consistency with this, the meaning and
   efficacy of what He has done extends through it all. His Person and
   work have absolute significance; wherever we have to speak of
   revelation or of reconciliation, in whatever world, in whatever
   relations, it is of Him we have to speak. Whether St. Paul would have
   presented this genuinely Christian truth to his imagination in the
   somewhat fantastic fashion just explained may be more or less doubtful;
   in any case it is of little consequence. What is of consequence is his
   conviction that in Jesus Christ dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead
   -- all that makes God in the full sense of the term God -- bodily, that
   is, in organic unity and completeness; and that the same completeness
   and finality belong to His reconciling work, The blood of His cross':
   It is in this we find the resolution of all discords, not only in the
   life of man, but in the universe at large. It is in this we see a
   divine love which does not shrink from taking on itself to the
   uttermost the moral responsibility for the world it has made, and for
   all the orders of being in it, and all their failures and fortunes. The
   eternal truth of this different ages and circumstances will picture to
   themselves in different ways; all we need to care for is that ways of
   picturing it which are uncongenial to our imaginations do not deprive
   us of the truth itself.

   It is a smaller but not a less attractive application of the idea of
   reconciliation, as accomplished in Christ's death, when we find it in
   the second chapter of Ephesians as the reconciliation of Jew and
   Gentile in the one body of Christ (vv. 11-22). The application may to
   us seem casual, but this is one of the great thoughts of St. Paul. Is
   God a God of Jews only?' he asks in Romans 3:29 as he contemplates
   Christ set forth as a propitiation in His blood. Is the great appeal of
   the Cross one which is intelligible only to men of a single race, or to
   which only those who have had a particular training can respond? On the
   contrary, there is nothing in the world so universally intelligible as
   the Cross; and hence it is the meeting-place not only of God and man,
   but of all races and conditions of men with each other. There is
   neither Greek nor Jew, male nor female, bond nor free, there. The Cross
   is the basis of a universal religion, and has in it the hope of a
   universal peace. But of all Christian truths which are confessed in
   words, this is that which is most outrageously denied in deed. There is
   not a Christian church nor a Christian nation in the world which
   believes heartily in the Atonement as the extinction of privilege, and
   the leveling up of all men to the same possibility of life in Christ,
   to the same calling to be saints. The spirit of privilege, in spite of
   the Cross, is obstinately rooted everywhere even among Christian men.

   An examination of the pastoral epistles, quite apart from the critical
   questions that have been raised as to their authorship, does not
   introduce us to any new ideas on our subject. It is at all events
   genuinely Pauline when we read in 1 Timothy 2:5,

   There is one God, one Mediator also between God and men, Himself man,
   Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all (antilutron huper
   panton).'

   It is the ransoming death in virtue of which Jesus does mediate between
   God and sinners; but for it, He would not be a mediator in any sense
   relevant to man's situation. This, as Holtzmann has noticed, is in
   harmony with the use of mediator in the Epistle to the Hebrews. There
   also Jesus is Mediator, but it is of a covenant which is characterized
   as kreitton, kaine, and nea; He is the means through which, at the cost
   of His death, sinners enter into the perfect religious relation to God.
   But though this idea is found in Hebrews, it does not follow that it is
   unpauline in itself, nor even (though antilutron found here only in the
   New Testament) that it is unpauline in expression. The dying with
   Christ, referred to in 2 Timothy 2:6, is akin rather to what we have
   found in 2 Corinthians chs. 1 and 4 than to Romans 6: it is a share in
   martyr sufferings which is meant, not for many the mortification of the
   old man. In Titus there are two passages which require to be mentioned.
   The first is in ch. 2:14, where we read of our Savior Jesus Christ, who
   gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all unrighteousness
   (anomias) and purify for Himself a people of His own, zealous of good
   works.' It is somewhat peddling to suggest, as Holtzmann does, [59]
   that Paul would rather have said we were redeemed from nomos than from
   anomia, and that even in touching on a Pauline thought an unpauline
   expression is used (lutrosetai for redeem'). The whole expression,
   lutrousthai as well as anomia, comes from Psalm 130:8, and St. Paul
   might have liberty to quote the Old Testament as well as anybody else.
   Nevertheless, the general impression one gets from the pastoral
   epistles is, that as a doctrine Christianity was now complete and could
   be taken for granted; it is not in process of being hammered out, as in
   the Epistle to the Galatians; there is nothing creative in the
   statement of it; and it is the combination of fullness and of something
   not unlike formalism that raises doubts as to the authorship. St. Paul
   was inspired, but the writer of these epistles is sometimes only
   orthodox. One feels this with reference to the second passage in Titus
   (3:4 ff.):

   When the kindness of God our Savior, and His love toward man, appeared,
   not by works done in righteousness which we did ourselves, but
   according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration
   and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He poured out upon us richly
   through Jesus Christ our Savior that, being justified by His grace, we
   might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.'

   St. Paul could no doubt have said all this, but probably he would have
   said it otherwise, and not all at a time. In any case, it adds nothing
   to the New Testament teaching on the death of Christ as we have already
   examined it.

   [38] Cf. Soltau, Unsere Evangelien, S. 85: The apostles and evangelists
   who went about two by two from church to church preaching everywhere
   the Word of God, must have had a fixed basis for the instruction they
   gave. And when Paul (1 Corinthians 11:23) declares of his account of
   the Supper, I have received it from the Lord,' he points in doing so to
   a formulation of Christian teaching once for all fixed and definite.'
   In a note he adds that St. Paul's words, the Lord Jesus on the night on
   which He was betrayed,' even show an affinity to the synoptic
   narrative.

   [42] I have rendered pneumatikon because it suggests better the element
   of mystery, or rather of divineness, which all through this passage is
   connected with the Sacraments. Baptism is not a common washing, nor is
   the Supper common meat and drink; it is a divine cleansing, a divine
   nourishment, with which we have to do in these rites; there is a
   mysterious power of God in them, which the Corinthians were inclined to
   conceive as operating like a charm for their protection in situations
   of moral ambiguity or peril. This is so far suggested to the Greek
   reader by pneumatikon for pneuma and its derivatives always involve a
   reference to God; but as it is not necessarily suggested to the English
   reader by spiritual,' I have ventured on the other rendering. The
   indefiniteness of supernatural' is rather an advantage in the context
   than a drawback.

   [45] The way in which theologians in love with the mystical union'
   depreciate gratitude must be very astonishing to psychologists. See
   Juncker, Die Ethik des Ap. Paulus, 161, and Rothe, Dogmatik 2. 1. 223
   (a remark on this passage in 2 Corinthians 5.): ohne Ihn und seinen Tod

   ganzlich Ihm, und mussen es deshalb ganz und gar Ihm widmen.

   [46] Kaftan holds that nothing is to be called Erlosung or Versohnung
   (redemption or reconciliation) unless as men are actually liberated and
   reconciled; Erlosung and Versohnung are to be understood, as the
   Reformers rightly saw (?), as Wirkungen Gottes in und an den Glaubigen.
   But he overlooks the fact that whatever is to liberate or reconcile men
   must have qualities or virtues in it which, in view of their normal
   effect, whether that effect be in any given case achieved or not, can
   be called reconciling or liberative; and that the determination of
   these qualities or virtues -- that is, as he calls it, an objective
   Heilslehre' -- is not only legitimate but essential in the
   interpretation of the work of Christ. See his Dogmatik, Sections 52 ff.

   [49] This is the view of Ritschl, who decides that everywhere in Paul
   the righteousness of God means the mode of procedure which is
   consistent with God's having the salvation of believers as His end
   (Rechtf. u. Vers. 2 footnote 1, 117). In the same sense he argues that
   the correlative idea to the righteousness of God is always that of the
   righteousness of His people (ibid. 108, 110). He seems to forget here
   that the God of the Gospel is defined by St. Paul in terms which
   expressly contradict this view, as He who justifies the ungodly'
   (Romans 5:5); and that a reference to sin rather than to righteousness
   in the people is the true correlative of the Pauline dikaiosune theou.
   Ritschl's treatment of the passage in Romans 3:3 ff., where God's
   righteousness is spoken of in connection with the judgment of the
   world, and with the infliction of the final wrath upon it, and where it
   evidently includes something other than the gracious consistency to
   which Ritschl would limit it, is an amusing combination of sophistry
   and paradox.

   [58] Romans 8:38 f. does not refute this, for the apostle's exposition
   of his thoughts is already complete, and this is an emotional utterance
   in which there is no more need or possibility of defining Christ's
   death by relation to angels and principalities and powers, than by
   relation to abstractions like height and depth. The only thought in the
   passage is that God's love in Christ is the final reality from which
   nothing can separate the believer.

CHAPTER 4
The Epistle to the Hebrews

   THE Epistle to the Hebrews is in many ways one of the most perplexing
   books of the New Testament. It stands quite alone and is peculiarly
   independent, yet it has affinities with almost every strain of thought
   to be found elsewhere in primitive Christianity, and points of
   historical attachment for it have been sought all round the compass.
   [60] Thus there are those who think its true line of descent is to be
   traced to James, Cephas, and John -- the three apostles who seemed to
   be pillars in the mother church of Jerusalem. It is the last and finest
   product of that type of Christian mind which we see at work in the
   fifteenth chapter of Acts. Perhaps this was the feeling of the person
   to whom the address -- pros Hebraious -- is due. When we examine the
   epistle closely, however, we discover that there is very little to be
   found in this direction to explain its peculiarities. Others, again,
   would trace it to the school of St. Paul. This, no doubt, has a greater
   plausibility. Discounting altogether the alleged Pauline authorship,
   the epistle has many points of contact with St. Paul in language, and
   some in thought. But we cannot fail to be struck with the fact that
   where the language coincides with St. Paul's, the thought does not; and
   that where the minds of the authors meet, their language is
   independent. Thus both St. Paul and the writer to the Hebrews speak of
   the law, of what the law cannot do (Romans 8:3 and Hebrews 10:1), of
   the superseding of the law (Romans 10:4 and Hebrews 7:12), of faith
   (Romans 4 and Hebrews 11), of a righteousness according to faith
   (Romans 1:17 and Hebrews 11:7), and so on; but when they use the same
   words they do not mean the same thing. The law to St. Paul is mainly
   the moral law, embodying God's requirements from man; in this epistle,
   it is the religious constitution under which Israel lived, and which
   gave it a certain though an imperfect access to God. In St. Paul and in
   this epistle alike the law is superseded in the Christian religion, but
   the relation between them is differently defined in the two cases. St.
   Paul defines law and gospel mainly by contrast; in Hebrews they are set
   in a more positive relation to one another. It used to be life under
   external statutory authority, now it is life under inspiration, and the
   two are mutually exclusive -- such is St. Paul's conception: see Romans
   6 and 2 Corinthians 3. It used to be life under the shadowy, the
   unreal, that which could bring nothing to perfection; now it is life
   under the real, the eternal, that which makes perfect for ever; the
   shadow is abandoned, because the coming good which cast it is here: see
   Hebrews 7-10. No doubt such contrasts as; this (between St. Paul and
   the Epistle to the Hebrews) require qualification, but broadly they are
   true, and they could be illustrated at many other points. At the
   present moment the favorite tendency among critics is to explain the
   peculiarities of the epistle by attaching it neither to the primitive
   Christianity of Jerusalem, nor in the first instance to the
   characteristic thoughts of St. Paul (thought both of course are
   implied), but to the quasi-philosophical mind of Alexandrian Judaism.
   It is there we find the contrast of seen and unseen, of sensible and
   intelligible, of this world and the world to come, of the transitory
   and the abiding, of earth and heaven, of which this epistle makes so
   much; and there also the logos, which mediates between God and the
   world, is presented in many of the aspects (e.g. as Intercessor, as
   Mediator, as High Priest) in which Jesus figures here. But here again
   the differences outweigh the resemblances. The Son of God does exercise
   in this epistle many of the functions which in Philo are assigned to
   the Logos; but in order to exercise them He must assume human nature
   and pass through all human experience -- conceptions which are a direct
   contradiction of all that Logos in Philo means. Evidently the author of
   this epistle, whatever his intellectual affinities, combined with an
   extraordinary sensitiveness to all that was being thought and said in
   the world in which he lived an extraordinary power of holding fast his
   own thoughts, of living in his own mind, and letting it work along its
   own lines.

   Of all New Testament writers he is the most theological -- that is, he
   is most exclusively occupied with presenting Christianity as the final
   and absolute religion; not a religion, in the sense in which it might
   concede a legitimate place to others, but religion simpliciter, because
   it does perfectly what all religion aims to do. This is what is
   expressed in his favorite word aionios (eternal). St. John in his
   gospel and epistles uses this word twenty-three times, but invariably
   to qualify life, and with him it is rather the combination than the
   adjective which is characteristic. But in Hebrews aionios is used far
   more significantly, though less frequently. Jesus is author of eternal'
   salvation (5:9), i.e., of final salvation, which has no peril beyond;
   all that salvation can mean is secured by Him. The elements of
   Christianity include preaching on eternal' judgment (6:2), i. e., a
   judgment which has the character of finality, from which there is no
   appeal, beyond which there is no fear or no hope. Christ has obtained
   eternal' redemption for us (9:12): not a redemption like that which was
   annually achieved for Israel, and which had to be annually repeated, as
   though its virtue faded away, but a redemption the validity of which
   abides for ever. Christ has offered Himself through eternal' spirit
   (9:14), i.e., in Christ's sacrifice we see the final revelation of what
   God is, that behind which there is nothing in God; so that the religion
   which rests on that sacrifice rests on the ultimate truth of the divine
   nature, and can never be shaken. Those who are called receive the
   promise of the eternal' inheritance (9:15), not an earthly Canaan, in
   which they are strangers and pilgrims, and from which they may be
   exiled, but the city which has the foundations, from which God's people
   go no more out. And finally, the blood of Christ is the blood of an
   eternal' covenant (13:20), i.e., in the death of Christ a religious
   relation is constituted between God and men which has the character of
   finality. God, if it may be so expressed, has spoken His last word; He
   has nothing in reserve; the foundation has been laid of the kingdom
   which can never be removed. It is this conception of absoluteness or
   finality in everything Christian which dominates the book. The
   conception, of course, is involved in all Christian experience, but to
   make it as explicit as it is in this epistle does not come naturally to
   every one. There are minds to which a less reactive religion seems
   warmer and more congenial, they miss in a writing like this the
   intimacy and glow which pervade the epistles of St. Paul. Those in whom
   theological interest preponderates over religious may call the Epistle
   to the Hebrews the high water-mark of inspiration; those whose religion
   makes them averse to theology can call it the high watermark of
   uninspired writing.

   Speaking generally, the epistle may be said to give a description of
   the Person and Work of Christ as constituting the perfect religion for
   men, and to define this religion in relation to the ancient religion of
   the Jews as embodied in the Tabernacle or Temple service. Curiously
   enough, the Person and Work of Christ thus interpreted have been looked
   at, so to speak, from both ends. Some theologians, of whom Westcott may
   be taken as a type, begin at the beginning, or rather at chap. 1:3.
   They start with the pre-existent, the eternal Son of God. They point to
   what He essentially is -- the brightness of the Father's glory and the
   express image of His substance. They point to His providential action
   -- He bears or guides all things by the word of His power. They point
   to the work He did as incarnate -- He made purgation of sins. They
   point to the exaltation which followed -- He sat down on the right hand
   of the Majesty in the Heavens. And then they draw the general
   conclusion that what Christ did, according to the epistle, was to
   fulfill man's destiny under the conditions of the fall. That destiny,
   it is assumed, He would have fulfilled in any case. The incarnation is
   part of the original plan of the world; only, in the peculiar
   circumstances of the case in hand -- that is, under the conditions of
   the fall -- the incarnation had to be modified into an atonement. This
   is one way of construing the writer's ideas. Another is represented by
   writers like Seeberg, who begins, if one may say so, at the end. The
   Christ of the author is essentially Christ the High Priest, in the
   heavenly sanctuary, mediating between God and men, securing for sinful
   men access to God and fellowship with Him. Christ exercises His High
   Priestly function in heaven, but it rests upon the death which He died
   on earth. Though Seeberg does not include Christ's death in His
   priestly ministry, he frankly admits that His priestly ministry is
   based on His death, and that but for His death He could not be a priest
   at all. Hence his argument runs in exactly the opposite direction from
   Westcott's. Christ is essentially a priest, the work of bringing
   sinners into fellowship with God is essentially the work He has to do,
   and the work He does. It is in that work alone that we know Him. But to
   do it He had to die, and in order to die He had to have a body prepared
   for Him, i.e., He had to become incarnate (ch. 10:5). It is not the
   incarnation which is taken for granted, and the atonement which in the
   peculiar circumstances of man's case is wrought into it or wrought out
   of it to meet an emergency; it is the actual fact of an atonement and a
   reconciling priestly ministry which is made the foundation of
   everything; the incarnation is defined solely by relation to it. The
   atonement, and the priestly or reconciling ministry of Christ, are the
   end, to which the incarnation is relative as the meal is. That this
   last is the view of the epistle and of the New Testament in general I
   do not doubt: it is the only view which has an experimental, as opposed
   to a speculative, basis; and I venture to say that the other shifts the
   center of gravity in the New Testament so disastrously as to make great
   parts of it, and these most vital parts, unintelligible. One could not
   go to the New Testament with a more misleading schematism in his mind
   than that which is provided by the conception of the incarnation, and
   its relation to the atonement, to which Westcott's influence has given
   currency in many circles. But leaving this larger question on one side,
   we may start with the fact that both schools of interpreters meet in
   the middle, and find the real content of the epistle, religious and
   theological, in what it has to say of the historical Christ. And that,
   beyond a doubt, is concentrated in what it has to say of His death. It
   was with the suffering of death' in view that He became incarnate; it
   is because of the suffering of death' that He is crowned with that
   glory and honor in which He appears in the presence of God on our
   behalf. Here then we come to our proper subject again, and may ask, as
   in the case of St. Paul, in what relations the death of Christ is
   defined by the writer so as to bring out its meaning.

   In the first place, it is defined by relation to God, and especially,
   as in St. Paul, by relation to His love. It is by the grace of God that
   Jesus tastes death for every man (2:9). God is not conceived in this
   epistle, or in any part of the New Testament, as a malignant or hostile
   being who has to be won by gifts to show His goodwill to man: whatever
   the death of Christ is or does, it is and does in the carrying out of
   His purpose. It is the grace of God to sinners which is demonstrated in
   it. This is involved also in two other ideas emphasized in the epistle.
   One is the idea that no man takes the honor of priesthood to himself of
   his own motion, he must be called of God, as Aaron was (5:4). Christ
   has had this call; we hear it in the 110th Psalm, which He Himself
   applied to Himself (Mark 12:35 ff.). Thou art a priest for ever, after
   the order of Melchisedec.' It is true that the priest represents the
   people toward God, but he can only do so by God's appointment, and
   consequently it is a work of God which he does, a gracious work, in
   which he is not persuading God, as it were, against His will, but on
   the contrary carrying out His will for the good of men. The other idea
   used in the interpretation of Christ's work, and especially of His
   death, which connects them in a similar way with God, is the idea of
   obedience. Jesus, though He were Son, yet learned obedience through the
   things which He suffered (5:8). When He appeared in the body which God
   had prepared for Him, it was with the words on His lips, Lo, I come to
   do Thy will, O God' 10:7). There is nothing in Christ's life and death
   of irresponsibility or adventure. It is all obedience, and therefore it
   is all revelation. We see God in it because it is not His own will but
   the will of the Father which it accomplished. Even when we come to
   consider its relation to sin, this must be borne in mind. Atonement is
   not something contrived, as it were, behind the Father's back; it is
   the Father's way of making it possible for the sinful to have
   fellowship with Him. The author introduces one idea, not very easy to
   define, in this connection. In speaking of the actual course of Christ
   in life and death, he says,

   It became Him (eprepen gar auto) for whom are all things and through
   whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
   Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings' (2:10).

   What eprepen suggests is not so much the kind of necessity we have
   found in other places in the New Testament's moral congruity or
   decorum. Suffering and death are our lot; it is congruous with God's
   nature -- we can feel, so to speak, the moral propriety of it -- when
   He makes suffering and death the lot of Him who is to be our Savior. He
   would not be perfect in the character or part of Savior if He did not
   have this experience. What this suggests is the interpretation of
   Christ's death by moral aesthetics rather than by moral law, by a rule
   to be apprehended in feeling rather than in conscience. It is moving
   and impressive, this action in congruity with God's nature and our
   state, whether we see a more inevitable necessity for it or not. In all
   these ways, at all events, the writer attaches Christ's death to the
   grace, the will, and the character of God; and in all these ways,
   therefore, he warns us against setting that death and God in any
   antagonism to each other.

   But besides defining it by relation to God, the writer defines Christ's
   death also by relation to sin. At the very beginning, in the sublime
   sentence in which He introduces the Son, His earthly work is summed up
   in the phrase, having made purgation of sins' (1:3). How this is done,
   he does not tell at this point, but the sequel makes it indubitable. It
   was done by His sacrificial death. So, again, he speaks of Christ as
   being once offered to bear the sins of many (9:28); as having been once
   manifested at the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of
   Himself (9:26); as being a merciful and faithful high priest in our
   relations to God to make propitiation for the sins of the people
   (2:17); as having offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, and having
   perfected for ever by that sacrifice those who are being sanctified
   (10:12-14). There is the same sacrificial conception in all the
   references in the epistle to the blood of Christ. He entered into the
   most holy place with (dia) His own blood (9:12). The blood of Christ
   shall purge your conscience from dead works (9:14). We have boldness to
   enter into the holiest in the blood of Jesus (10:19). His blood is the
   blood of the covenant with which we are sanctified, and to lapse from
   the Christian religion is to be guilty of the inconceivable, the
   unpardonable sin, of counting that blood a profane thing (10:29). In
   all these ways the death of Christ is defined as a sacrificial death,
   or as a death having relation to sin, the two things are one. It is
   quite possible to lose ourselves here by trying to give to details in
   the sacrificial language of the epistle an importance which they will
   not bear. The writer refers to sacrifices of different kinds in his
   interpretation of the death of Christ. Sometimes he speaks of it in
   connection with the Old Testament sin offerings; at others in
   connection with the covenant sacrifices at Sinai, on which the ancient
   relation of God to His people was based; more than all, in connection
   with the annual sacrifices on the great day of atonement, when the
   earthly sanctuary was purged of its defilement, and the high priest
   entered into the most holy place, representing and embodying Israel's
   access to God and fellowship with Him. But no emphasis is laid on the
   distinguishing features of these various sacrifices, they are looked at
   simply in the expiatory or atoning significance which is common to them
   all. They represent a divinely appointed way of dealing with sin, in
   order that it may not bar fellowship with God; and the writer thinks of
   them broadly in this light. I do not feel at liberty to belittle this,
   as is sometimes done, and to say with Holtzmann that the convincing
   power of the writer's arguments reaches precisely as far as our
   conviction of the divine origin of the Mosaic cultus, of the atoning
   power of sacrificial blood, and of the typical significance of the
   sacrificial ritual; the tacit assumption being that in regard to all
   these things rational conviction can reach but a very little way. As we
   have seen already, the death of Christ is defined by relation to sin in
   many places in the New Testament where no use, at least no explicit
   use, is made of sacrificial phraseology. Such phraseology is not
   essential either to reach or to express the truth held by Christian
   faith as to the relation of Christ's death to sin. Neither is it forced
   by the author of the epistle: he only expresses by means of it, and
   that, as we have seen, with the greatest freedom, the conviction of all
   New Testament Christians, that in the death of Christ God has dealt
   effectually with the world's sin for its removal. It is easy to
   disparage too lightly what Wellhausen has called the pagan element in
   the religion of Israel; but it is probably truer to hold with this
   writer that the sacrificial system had something in it which trained
   the conscience and helped man to feel and to express spiritual truths
   for which he had no adequate articulate language.

   Important, however, as his reference to sacrifice may be, it is not so
   much through the idea of sacrifice that we are initiated into the
   writer's mind as through the idea of priesthood. Now in relation to the
   priest the various conceptions of sacrifice are unified; the
   distinctions of sin offerings, burnt offerings, peace offerings, and so
   forth, disappear; sacrifice is reduced to this -- it is the
   characteristic function of the priest, the indispensable means to the
   fulfillment of his calling. A priest is the essential figure in
   religion as it is conceived in the Epistle to the Hebrews; when the
   priesthood is changed there is necessarily also a change of law -- the
   whole religious constitution is altered (7:12); in other words, the
   priest determines what the religion is. Hence if we wish to know what
   Christianity is, in which Christ is priest, we must investigate the
   priesthood as it is discharged by Him.

   The priest's function, speaking generally, is to establish and to
   represent the fellowship of God and man. That fellowship must exist, it
   must be incorporated and made visible, in the priest's own person; and
   through his ministry it must be put within reach of the people for whom
   he acts as priest. Through his ministry they must be put in a position
   to draw near to God themselves, to worship, to have fellowship with
   God; in a word, to become God's people. If we ask why a priest and a
   priestly work of mediation are necessary, why men cannot immediately
   and in their own right, as it were, draw near to God, the answer is
   self-evident. It is because their sin stands in the way, and cannot be
   ignored. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, as everywhere in the New
   Testament, sin is a problem, and the burden of the book is that God has
   dealt with the problem in a way answering to its magnitude. He has
   instituted a priesthood to deal with it. He has appointed His Son a
   priest with this very end in view, that He should make propitiation for
   the sins of the people (2:17). If we ask how this priest deals with sin
   in order to make propitiation for it, the answer, as has already been
   observed, is given in Old Testament terms. He deals with it by the way
   of sacrifice. This is the only method of propitiation, known to the Old
   Testament, which is of a piece with the idea of priesthood. It is
   irrelevant to argue, as is sometimes done by persons who are anxious
   that the grace of the gospel should not be abused, that the Old
   Testament only provides propitiation for certain kinds of sin, and
   these not the more serious; such thoughts are not present to the
   writer's mind. Propitiation must be made for sin, if sinful men are to
   have fellowship with God at all; the only propitiation known to
   scripture, as made by a priest, is that which is made through sacrifice
   (apart from shedding of blood there is no remission, 9:22); and the
   writer has no conception beforehand of sins with which the priest and
   the sacrifice present to his mind are unable to deal. He does recognize
   the possibility that men may condemn the gospel altogether, and even
   after they have known its power may trample under foot the blood of the
   covenant with which they were sanctified, and so commit a sin for which
   in the nature of the case there can be no further propitiation -- as he
   puts it, for which there is no more a sacrifice in reserve (10: 26);
   but that is another matter. His position, speaking generally, is that
   in Christ and His death we have a priest and a sacrifice capable of
   dealing effectively with sin as the barrier between God and man, and
   actually dealing with it in such a way that in despite of it God has a
   worshipping people among sinful men.

   Can we, now, get any way under the surface here? Sacrifice is not a
   familiar nor a self-interpreting idea to us, whatever it may have been
   to the author and to those whom he addressed; can we penetrate or
   explain it at all, so as to make intelligible to ourselves any relation
   which the death of Christ had to sin, or to the will of God in regard
   to sin?

   Sometimes the attempt is made to do this by looking immediately at the
   effect of Christ's work in the souls of men, and deducing its relation
   to sin, as a secondary thing, from this. The epistle, of course, does
   not ignore the effect of Christ and His sacrifice upon men: it has,
   indeed, a variety of words to describe it. Sometimes the word employed
   is hagiazein (to sanctify). The priestly Christ and His people are He
   who sanctifies, and they who are sanctified (2:11). Christians have
   been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once
   for all (10:10). By one offering He has perfected forever those who are
   being sanctified (10:14). It was Christ's object in dying to sanctify
   the people through His own blood (13:12). There has been much
   discussion as to what sanctification in such passages means, and
   especially as to whether the word is to be taken in a religious or an
   ethical sense. Probably the distinction would not have been clear to
   the writer; but one thing is certain, it is not to be taken in the
   sense of Protestant theology. The people were sanctified, not when they
   were raised to moral perfection -- a conception utterly strange to the
   New Testament as to the Old -- but when, through the annulling of their
   sin by sacrifice, they had been constituted into a people of God, and
   in the person of their representative had access to His presence. The
   word hagiazein in short, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, corresponds as
   nearly as possible to the Pauline dikaioun; the sanctification of the
   one writer is the justification of the other; and the prosagoge or
   access to God, which St. Paul emphasizes as the primary blessing of
   justification (Romans 5:2 and Ephesians 2:18, 3:12), appears everywhere
   in Hebrews as the primary religious act of drawing near, to God through
   the great High Priest (4:16, 7:19-25 and 10:22). It seems fair then to
   argue that the immediate effect of Christ's death upon men is religious
   rather than ethical; in technical language, it alters their relation to
   God, or is conceived as doing so, rather than their character. Their
   character, too, alters eventually, but it is on the basis of that
   initial and primary religious change; the religious change is not a
   result of the moral one, nor an unreal abstraction from it.

   A similar result follows if we consider another of the words used to
   explain the effect of Christ's priestly and sacrificial work upon men
   -- the word teleioun, rendered to make perfect.' It is widely used in
   the epistle in other connections. Christ Himself was made perfect
   through sufferings (2:10); that is, He was made all that a high priest,
   or a captain of salvation, ought to be. It does not mean that suffering
   cured Him of moral faults; but that apart from suffering and what He
   learned in it He would not have been completely fitted for His
   character of representing, and succoring, mortal men. So again when we
   read, the law made nothing perfect (7:19); the meaning is, that under
   the ancient religion of Israel nothing reached the ideal. The sanctuary
   was a worldly or material sanctuary (9:1); the priests were sinful
   mortal men, ever passing on their unsatisfactory functions to their
   successors (7:23); the sacrifices were of irrational creatures -- the
   blood of bulls and goats, which could never make the worshipper perfect
   as touching the conscience (9:9); that is, they could never completely
   lift the load from within, and give him parrhesia and joy in the
   presence of God; the access to the holiest of all was not abiding; as
   represented in the High Priestly ministry of the day of atonement, the
   way to God was open only for a moment, and then shut again (9: 7f.).
   There was nothing perfect there, nothing in that religious constitution
   which could be described as teleion or aionion. But with Christ, all
   this is changed. By one offering He has perfected for ever those who
   are being sanctified (10:14). The word cannot mean that He has made
   them sinless, in the sense of having freed them completely from all the
   power of sin, from every trace of its presence; it means obviously that
   He has put them into the ideal religious relation to God. Because of
   His one offering, their sin no longer comes between them and God in the
   very least; it does not exclude them from His presence or intimidate
   them; they come with boldness to the throne of grace; they draw near
   with a true heart and in full assurance of faith; they have an ideal,
   an unimpeachable standing before God as His people (4:16 and 10:22). In
   Pauline language, there is now no condemnation; instead of standing
   afar off, in fear and trembling, they have access to the Father; they
   joy in God through the Lord Jesus Christ, through whom they have
   received the atonement (Romans 8:1, 5:2-11).

   Once more, if we examine the passage in which the verb katharizein is
   used to express the result of Christ's work in relation to man, we
   shall be led to the same conclusion. It is in 9:14, and occurs in the
   sentence contrasting the efficacy of the ancient sacrifices with that
   of the sacrifice of Christ. For if the blood of goats and bulls and
   ashes of a heifer sprinkling the defiled sanctifies to the purification
   of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
   eternal spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purify your
   conscience from dead works to serve the living God.' The Old Testament
   sacrifices had an outward efficacy; they removed such defilements as
   excluded a man from the communion of Israel with God in its national
   worship. The New Testament sacrifice has an inward efficacy; it really
   reaches to the conscience, and it puts the man in a position to offer
   religious service (latreuein) to a living God. In some way it
   neutralizes or annuls sin so that religious approach to God is possible
   in spite of it.

   The examination of these words justifies us in drawing one conclusion.
   The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews does not conceive of a
   regenerating, or, in the modern sense of the term, sanctifying, effect
   of Christ's death upon the soul as immediate or primary. He does not
   conceive it as directly emancipating the soul from sin, as an immoral
   power operative in it; nor does he regard this experience of
   emancipation as the only reality with which we have to deal. It is a
   reality, but it is an effect, and an effect to be traced to a cause.
   That cause is not simply Christ's death; it is Christ's death as a
   reality capable of being so interpreted as to yield the rational
   explanation of such an effect. It is often argued that the idea of an
   antecedent relation of Christ's death to sin -- antecedent, that is, to
   the emancipation of the soul from sin's power -- is essentially unreal,
   nothing more than the caput mortuum of this great experience. This is
   certainly not the view of the writer to the Hebrews. On the contrary,
   he has, like St. Paul and others to whom reference has been, and will
   yet be made, the conception of a finished work of Christ, a work
   finished in His death, something done in regard to sin once for all,
   whether any given soul responds to it or not. As he puts it at the
   beginning of the epistle, He made purgation of sins -- the thing was
   done -- before He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in the
   Heavens. As he puts it later, He has offered one sacrifice for sins for
   ever, and by the one offering He has brought for ever into the perfect
   relation to God those who are being sanctified. And though the epistle
   does not use the once familiar language about the risen Savior pleading
   the merits of His sacrifice, it does undoubtedly represent this
   sacrifice, offered through eternal spirit, as the basis on which the
   eternal priesthood of Christ is exercised, and the sinner's access to
   God assured. Now, a finished work of Christ and an objective atonement
   are the same thing, and the question once more presents itself, What is
   it, in Christ's death, which gives it its atoning power? Why is it
   that, on the ground of this death, God, with whom evil cannot dwell,
   allows sinners unimpeded, joyful, assured access to Himself, and
   constitutes them a people of His own?

   It is possible to answer this question too vaguely. It is too vague an
   answer when we look away from Christ's death, and its specific relation
   to sin, and emphasize broadly Christ's identification of Himself with
   us as laying the basis for our identification of ourselves with Him, in
   which acceptance with God is secured. No doubt the epistle does give
   prominence to Christ's identification of Himself with those whose
   priest He is to become. He who sanctifies and they who are being
   sanctified -- He who constitutes others into a people of God, and they
   who are so constituted -- are all of one (2:11). He is not ashamed to
   call them brothers. He takes their nature on Him, becoming with them a
   partaker of flesh and blood (2:14). He takes their experience to
   Himself, being tempted in all things like as they are (4:15). Even in
   death He does not stand aloof from them; He dies because they have to
   die; He dies that through death He may destroy him who has the power of
   death, and free them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
   subject to bondage (2: 14). But all this, not excepting the death
   itself in this aspect, belongs, from the point of view of the epistle,
   rather to the preparation for priesthood than to the discharge of
   priestly functions. The priest must undoubtedly be kindred to the
   people for whom he acts; he must know their nature and life; he must be
   taught by experience like theirs to have compassion on the ignorant and
   erring; nay, he must have sounded the tragic depths of mortal fear if
   he is to bring weak, sinful, dying men to God. All this Christ has
   done. He has qualified Himself by the immeasurable condescension of the
   Incarnation and the life in the flesh to be all that a priest should
   be. But when we come to the supreme act of His priesthood, the offering
   of Himself to God in death, the entering into the holiest of all
   through His own blood, the question recurs: What is it which gives this
   in particular its efficacy in regard to sin?

   The one hint of an answer to this question offered by the epistle
   itself is that which we find in the words of 9:14: Christ who through
   eternal spirit offered Himself without spot to God.' The sinlessness of
   Jesus entered into the Atonement: only one who knew no sin could take
   any responsibility in regard to it which would create a new situation
   for sinners. But more important even than this is the suggestion
   contained in the words through eternal spirit.' This is not the same as
   through indissoluble life' (7:16), as though the idea were that the
   life offered to God on the Cross was one which death could not hold,
   but was rather by death liberated' and made available' for others.
   Neither is it the same as through His divine nature,' as though the
   idea were that the divine nature or the divine personality through
   which Christ surrendered His human life to God gave the sacrifice an
   immeasurable value. These are forms of words rather than forms of
   thought, and it is difficult to attach to them any intelligible or
   realizable meaning. If we follow the line of thought suggested by the
   use of aijw&gt;niov (eternal) in other passages of the epistle, we
   shall rather say that what is meant here is that Christ's offering of
   Himself without spot to God had an absolute or ideal character; it was
   something beyond which nothing could be, or could be conceived to be,
   as a response to God's mind and requirements in relation to sin. It was
   the final response, a spiritual response, to the divine necessities of
   the situation. Something of what is included in this may be suggested
   by the contrast which is here drawn in the epistle between Christ's
   offering of Himself through eternal spirit and the sacrifices of the
   Old Testament. As opposed to these, His sacrifice was rational and
   voluntary, an intelligent and loving response to the holy and gracious
   will of God, and to the terrible situation of man. But what we wish to
   understand is why the holy and gracious will of God, and the terrible
   situation of man, demanded and were satisfied by this particular
   response of Christ's death, and not by anything else.

   So far as I can see, there is no explanation of this whatever, unless
   we can assume that the author shared the view of St. Paul and of
   primitive Christianity generally, that sin and death were so related to
   one another -- were in some sense, indeed, so completely one -- that no
   one could undertake the responsibility of sin who did not at the same
   time submit to death. As has been already said, it is not necessary to
   suppose that this relation of sin and death was established
   arbitrarily; if it existed for the human conscience, as part of the
   actual order of the world, the situation would be before us which
   required Christ to die in order to take really upon Him our
   responsibility in this relation. That it does thus exist, the New
   Testament elsewhere, and something in human experience as well, combine
   to prove; and that the writer to the Hebrews was conscious of this is
   shown by the fact that he, like other New Testament writers, makes the
   death of Christ the very thing by which sin is annulled as a power
   barring man's approach to God. His idea is not that Christ by His
   death, or in virtue of it, acts immediately upon the sinful soul,
   turning it into a righteous one, and in that sense annulling sin; it is
   rather that sin is annulled and, in its character as that which shuts
   man out from God's presence and makes worship impossible, ceases to be,
   through the once for all accomplished sacrifice of Christ. And though
   his dominant thought may be said to be that Christ by His death removes
   sin, as an obstacle standing in our path bears it away, so that it
   blocks our road to God no longer -- still He does not do this except by
   dying; in other words, He bears sin away because He bears it; He
   removes the responsibility of it from us because He takes it upon
   Himself.

   The connection of ideas which is here suggested is often controverted
   by appeal to the passage at the beginning of the tenth chapter. There
   the writer is contrasting the sacrifices of the old covenant with that
   of the new. The law,' he says, having a shadow of the good things to
   come, not the very image of the things, could never with the same
   sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make perfect those
   who draw near. Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered,
   owing to the worshippers, having been once purged, having no longer
   conscience of sins? So far from this being the case, sins are brought
   to mind in them year by year. It is impossible for blood of bulls and
   goats to remove them. Accordingly, at His entrance into the world, He
   says, "Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire, but a body didst
   Thou prepare for me. In whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin
   Thou hadst no pleasure." Then I said, "Behold I come; in the volume of
   the Book it is written concerning Me; to do Thy will, O God." Above, in
   saying "sacrifices and offerings, and whole burnt offerings, and
   offerings for sin Thou didst not desire nor take pleasure in" -- that
   is, God had no delight in such sacrifices as are offered according to
   the law -- then His Word stands, "Lo, I come to do Thy will." He
   removes the first to establish the second.' This passage is often read
   as if it signified that sacrifice was abolished in favor of obedience,
   and the inference is drawn that no use can be made of the conception of
   sacrifice in the interpretation of Christ's death, or as it is
   sometimes put, that no significance can be assigned to His death which
   does not belong equally to every part of His life. His obedience is
   what atones, and His obedience is the same from first to last. But to
   argue thus is to ignore the very words with which the writer proceeds:
   in which will-- that is, the will of God which Christ came to do -- we
   have been sanctified, i.e. constituted a worshipping people of God,
   through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.' We
   cannot here, any more than in other passages of the New Testament, make
   the original sense of Old Testament words a key to their meaning when
   they are quoted in the New. What is contrasted in this passage is not
   sacrifice and obedience, but sacrifice of dumb creatures, of bulls and
   goats and such like, with sacrifice into which obedience enters, the
   sacrifice of a rational and spiritual being, which is not passive in
   death, but in dying makes the will of God its own. The will of God,
   with which we are here concerned, is not satisfied by an obedience
   which comes short of death. For it is not merely the preceptive will of
   God, His will that men should do right and live according to His holy
   law, which Christ came to fulfill; it is His gracious will, a will
   which has it in view that sinful men should be constituted into a
   people to Himself, a will which has resolved that their sin should be
   so dealt with as no longer to keep them at a distance from Him; a will,
   in short, that sinners should find a standing in His sight. And in that
   will we are sanctified, not merely by Christ's fulfillment of the law
   of God as it is binding on man in general, but by His fulfillment of
   the law as it is binding on sinful men, by His obedient suffering of
   death as that in which God's mind in relation to sin finds its final
   expression, to use the words of the writer himself, through the
   offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.' There is an
   ambiguity in saying that obedience is the principle of the atonement,
   or its spiritual principle, or that which gives the work of Christ its
   value. [61] It is no doubt true to say so, but after we have said so
   the essential question remains -- that question the answer to which
   must show whether, when we say obedience, ' we have seen any way into
   the secret of the Atonement: viz. obedience to what? It is not enough
   to say, Obedience to the will of God; for the will of God is one thing
   when we think of man abstractly, another when we think of man under the
   definite conditions produced by sin. It is one thing when we conceive
   of it as an imperative will, having relation only to man as God's
   creature; it is another when we conceive it as a redeeming,
   restorative, gracious will, of which the human race is in reality the
   object, not the subject, the subject by whom the will is carried out
   being Christ. In both cases, of course, obedience, the free fulfillment
   of the divine will, is that which has moral value. But just because, in
   both cases, the attitude of the human will is for many the same -- just
   because we can say obedience,' whether we are thinking of God's will
   generally, or thinking of it as a will specially directed to the
   redemption of the sinful -- just for this reason it is inadequate,
   ambiguous, and misleading to speak of obedience as the principle of the
   Atonement. Christ's obedience is not merely that which is required of
   all men, it is that which is required of a Redeemer; and it is its
   peculiar content, not the mere fact that it is obedience, which
   constitutes it an atonement. He had a moral vocation, of course; but it
   was not this -- and this is all that obedience means -- which made Him
   a Redeemer: it was something unique in His vocation, something that
   pertained to Him alone. Christ did not come into the world to be a good
   man: it was not for this that a body was prepared for Him. He came to
   be a great High Priest, and the body was prepared for Him that by the
   offering of it He might put sinful men for ever into the perfect
   religious relation to God.

   In determining the meaning of obedience, and of the will of God, in
   this passage, we touch the quick of the great question about the
   relations of Incarnation and Atonement. If we have read it correctly,
   it confirms what has been already said about the ideal priority of the
   latter. It is the Atonement which explains the Incarnation: the
   Incarnation takes place in order that the sin of the world may be put
   away by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ. The obedience of the
   Incarnate One, like all obedience, has moral value -- that is, it has a
   value for Himself; but its redemptive value, i.e. its value for us,
   belongs to it not simply as obedience, but as obedience to a will of
   God which requires the Redeemer to take upon Himself in death the
   responsibility of the sin of the world. That this is done obediently
   implies that in dying the Son of God acknowledges the justice of God in
   connecting death and sin, as they are connected for the human
   conscience; He does right, as it has been put, by the divine law which
   is expressed in that connection. And in doing so He does perfectly, and
   therefore finally and once for all, something through which sinful men
   can enter into fellowship with God. He lays the basis of the new
   covenant; He does what sinners can look to as a finished work; He makes
   an objective atonement for sin -- exactly what St. Paul describes as
   katallage or reconciliation. There is peace now between God and man; we
   can draw near to the Holy One.

   The Epistle to the Hebrews does not make as clear to us as the Pauline
   epistles how it is that Christ's death becomes effective for men. The
   author was not an evangelist so much as a pastor, and it is not the
   initiation of Christianity but its conservation with which he deals
   throughout. But the answer to the question is involved in the
   conception of Christ as Priest. The priest is a person who acts as the
   representative of a people: he does something which it properly falls
   to them to do, but which they cannot do for themselves; by God's grace
   he does it, and on the strength of it they draw near to God. The
   epistle lays great stress on the fact that Christ has identified
   Himself with man; in substance, therefore, it may be said, His work
   must be appropriated by men's identifying themselves with Him. The
   writer never uses the Pauline expression in Christ' to express this
   identification or its result; he has the vaguer conception of being
   partakers of Christ,' metochoi tou Christou, which so far answers to it
   (3:14, cf. 3:1, 4:4 and 12:8). Christ is not represented, as He is by
   St. Paul, as the object of faith; He is rather the great exemplar of
   faith. Yet He is the object of the Christian confession, both as
   apostle and High Priest (3:1); it is to those who obey Him that He is
   the author of eternal salvation (5:9); and He is the center to which
   the eyes and hearts of Christians are steadily directed. It does not,
   therefore, exhaust the meaning of the writer to say that He is our
   representative, and that He does nothing for us which it is not for us
   to do over again. It is true that He is our representative; but He not
   only acts in our name, and in our interest; in His action He does
   something for us which we could never have done for ourselves, and
   which does not need to be done over again; He achieves something which
   we can look to as a finished work, and in which we can find the basis
   of a sure confidence toward God. He achieves, in short, purgation of
   sins' (1:3). This is the evangelical truth which is covered by the word
   substitute,' and which is not covered by the word representative'; and
   it is the consciousness of this truth that makes the Evangelical Church
   sensitive and even jealous of a too free and easy use of the ideas that
   Christ becomes one with us in all things, and we in all things one with
   Him. There is an immense qualification to be made in this oneness on
   both sides -- Christ does not commit sin, and we do not make atonement.
   The working in us of the mind of Christ toward sin, which presumably is
   what is meant by our identification with Him in His death, is not the
   making of atonement, nor the basis of our reconciliation to God; it is
   the fruit of the Atonement, which is Christ's finished work. Seeberg's
   elaborate essay on the death of Christ in Hebrews is an admirable
   illustration of the confusion which results from the hazy use of words
   like identification,' Zusammenschluss, etc., or the idea (to call it an
   idea) that Christ and the Christian are one person, and that this is
   what makes access to God and forgiveness of sins possible. It leads to
   expressions like this: Forgiveness of sins therefore presupposes that
   the life of him who has experience of it comes to have the standing of
   a life which has passed sinless through death.' [62] The forgiveness of
   sins may come to this in the end; it may beget a life which shares in
   Christ's victory over sin and death; but it is surely a subversion of
   the very idea of forgiveness to say that it presupposes it. A life that
   has passed sinless through death, whatever else it may know, knows
   nothing of forgiveness; and therefore forgiven, whatever it may be, is
   not a participation in any part of such a life's experience, whether by
   the method of identification' or by any other. Or again, from another
   side, the hazy use of such language leads to utterances like this: The
   thing Christ has done (die Leistung Christi), though it has not been
   done by the sinner, is yet a thing which he might or would fain have
   done, and is therefore in principle his doing.' [63] This is not
   wrestling with mysteries, or sounding great deeps; it is trifling with
   words, or trying to say Yes and No' in the same breath. Let the passion
   of Christ draw us to the utmost to share in His mind toward God and
   toward sin, and the fact remains that its power to do so is dependent
   on the clear recognition of the truth that Christ did something for us
   in His death which we could not do for ourselves, and which we do not
   need to do after Him. By His one offering He put us for ever in the
   perfect relation to God. This is the vital point in Christianity, and
   to deny the debt to Christ at this point is eventually to deny it
   altogether. The process which starts with rejecting the objective
   Atonement -- in other words, the finished work: of Christ and the
   eternal dependence on Him and obligation to Him which this involves --
   has its inevitable and natural issue in the denial that Christ has any
   essential place in the Gospel. We can only assent to such a view by
   renouncing the New Testament as a whole.

   Although faith is not defined in the epistle directly by relation to
   Christ, it is nevertheless faith which saves (10:22, 38 f.., 13:7), and
   the well-known description or definition in the eleventh chapter can
   easily be applied in the Christian religion. Faith is there said to be
   the assurance of things hoped for, the proof of things not seen (11:1).
   It is to the invisible world what sight is to the visible; it is the
   means of realizing it, so that its powers and motives enter into the
   life of men, and enable them after patient endurance and fulfillment of
   God's will to inherit the promises. What, then, is the unseen world
   which is realized by Christian faith? It is a world in which Christ
   holds the central place, and in which, in the virtue of that death in
   which He made purgation of sins, He appears perpetually in the presence
   of God on our behalf. It is a world in which everything is dominated by
   the figure of the great High Priest, at the right hand of the Majesty
   in the Heavens, clothed in our nature, compassionate to our
   infirmities, able to save to the uttermost, sending timely succor to
   those who are in peril, pleading our cause. It is this which faith
   sees, this to which it clings as the divine reality behind and beyond
   all that passes, all that tries, daunts, or discourages the soul; it is
   this in which it finds the ens realissimum, the very truth of things,
   all that we mean when we speak of God. It is holding fast to the
   eternal realities revealed in Christ, and not some indefinable
   identification' with Him, on which all that is Christian depends. And
   it is this, more than anything, which, in spite of differences of form,
   makes the writer akin to St. Paul. For he too builds everything on
   Jesus Christ, crucified and exalted.

CHAPTER 5
The Johannine Writings

   BY the Johannine writings are meant the Apocalypse and the fourth
   gospel, as well as the three catholic epistles to which the name of
   John is traditionally attached. It is not possible to enter here into a
   review of the critical questions connected with them, and especially
   into the question of their authorship. The most recent criticism, while
   it seems to bring the traditional authorship into greater uncertainty,
   approaches more nearly than was once common to the position of
   tradition in another respect: it ascribes all these writings to the
   same locality, to pretty much the same period, and to the same circle
   of ideas and sympathies. This is a nearer approach than would once have
   been thought probable to ascribing them all to the same hand. When a
   writer like Weizsacker concludes that the Apocalypse and the fourth
   gospel have so many points of contact that they must have come from one
   school, while they are nevertheless so distinct that they must have
   come from different hands, [64] it is probably quite legitimate to
   treat the two in connection, if not to regard them as at one. Thirty
   years ago it would have been uncritical to speak of them except as the
   extremist opposites to each other. As for the connection between the
   gospel and the epistles, or at least the first epistle, with which
   alone we shall be concerned, that seems to me indubitable. No doubt
   there are differences between them, and a difference touching closely
   on our subject -- the epistle, like all epistles in contrast with all
   gospels, having more of what may be called reflection upon Christ's
   death, or interpretation of it, than the kindred gospel. But that does
   not prove, as J. Reville argues, [65] that they were due to different
   hands; it only proves that the gospel, however much it may be subdued
   in form to the style of the writer's own thoughts, is true to its
   character as a gospel, and the epistle to its character as an epistle.
   If these two books cannot be ascribed to the same pen, literary
   criticism is bankrupt. The whole of the Johannine writings, it may be
   safely assumed, belongs to the region of Asia Minor, to a school, let
   us say, which had its headquarters in Ephesus, and to the last quarter,
   or perhaps the last decade, of the first century of our era.

   The opening words of the Apocalypse carry us at once to the heart of
   our subject. John interweaves with the address of his book to the seven
   churches a sudden doxology:

   To Him that loveth us, and loosed us from our sins in His blood, and He
   made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory
   and the dominion for ever and ever' (1:5 f.).

   What is before his mind as he speaks is Christ in His exaltation -- the
   faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, the prince of the kings of
   the earth; but he cannot contemplate Him, nor think of the grace and
   peace which he invokes on the churches from Him, without recurring to
   the great deed of Christ on which they ultimately depend. Christ's love
   is permanent and unchanging, and John thinks of it as such (to agaponti
   hemas, to Him that loveth us); but the great demonstration of it
   belongs to the past (kai lusanti hemas ek ton hamartion hemon en to
   haimati autou). He does not say, who liberates us from our sins,' as
   though a progressive purification were in view; but who liberated us,'
   pointing to a finished work. It seems to me far the most probable
   interpretation of en to haimati to make en represent the Hebrew bof
   price: Christ's blood was the cost of our liberation, the ransom price
   which He paid. This agrees with the word of our Lord Himself in the
   Gospel about giving His life a ransom for many (Matthew 20:28), and
   with other passages in the Apocalypse in which the notion of buying' a
   people for God finds expression (5:9 and 14:3 f.). Sin, or rather sins,
   held men in bondage; and from this degrading servitude Christ purchased
   their freedom at no less a cost than that of His own life. It is not
   any undefined goodwill, it is the love revealed in this dear-bought
   emancipation of the sinful, which inspires the doxology, to Him that
   loveth us.' Redemption, it may be said, springs from love, yet love is
   only a word of which we do not know the meaning until it is interpreted
   for us by redemption. [66]

   The result of the liberty, bought by Christ's blood, is that those who
   were once held by sin are made a kingdom, even priests, to His God and
   Father. These words are borrowed from the fundamental promise of the
   Old Covenant in Exodus 19:6. He made us a kingdom' does not mean He
   made us kings' (so some MSS. and AV.). It means, He constituted us a
   people over whom God reigns', the dignity conferred on us is not that
   of sovereignty, but of citizenship. He made us priests' means that in
   virtue of His action we are constituted a worshipping people of God; on
   the ground of it we have access to the Father. Both words together
   imply that it is the action of Christ, who died for our redemption, to
   which we owe our standing in God's sight, and our whole relation to Him
   so far as it is anything in which we can rejoice. All dignity and all
   privilege rest on the fact that He set us free from our sins at the
   cost of His blood. A doxology is not the place at which to seek for the
   rationale of anything, and we do not find the rationale of these things
   here. It is the fact only which is brought into view. The vision of
   Christ calls out the whole contents of the Christian consciousness; the
   Christian heart is sensible of all it owes to Him, and sensible that it
   owes it all in some way to His death.

   Next in significance to this striking passage come the frequent
   references in the Apocalypse to the Lamb, and especially to the Lamb as
   it had been slain. In all, this name occurs twenty-nine times. The most
   important passages are the following:

   (1) ch. 5:6-14. Here the Lamb is represented as sovereign -- the object
   of all praise; as a Lamb which had been sacrificed -- esphagmenon means
   with the throat cut'; as living and victorious -- hestekos (standing).
   It has the character which sacrifice confers, but it is alive; it is
   not dead, but it has the virtue of its death in it. It is on the ground
   of this; death, and of the redemption (or purchase of men for God)
   effected by it, that all praise is ascribed to the Lamb, and the
   knowledge and control of all providence put into His hands, Worthy art
   Thou to take the book and to open the seals of it, for Thou wast slain
   and didst purchase to God by Thy blood (en to haimati sou) out of every
   tribe and tongue and people and nation, and didst make them to our God
   a kingdom and priests, and they shall reign upon the earth.' Here we
   have the ideas of 1:5 repeated, with the further thought that love like
   that displayed in Christ's death for man's redemption is worthy not
   only of all praise, but of having all the future committed to its care.
   It is really a pictorial way of saying that redeeming love is the last
   reality in the universe, which all praise must exalt, and to which
   everything else must be subordinate.

   (2) The next passage is that in 7:14, about the martyrs in the Neronic
   (or Domitianic?) persecution. One of the elders answered me, saying,
   These that are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and whence did
   they come? and I said to Him, My Lord, Thou knowest. And He said to me,
   These are they that come out of the great tribulation, and they washed
   their robes and made them white en to haimati tou arniou (in the blood
   of the Lamb).' Here what is referred to is evidently the power of
   Christ's death to sanctify men, though how it is exercised we are not
   told. The people seen in this vision, the endless procession coming out
   of the great tribulation, were martyrs and confessors. They had taken
   up their cross and followed Jesus to the end. They had drunk of His
   cup, and been baptized with His baptism. They had resisted unto blood,
   striving against sins, and now they were pure even as He was pure. But
   the inspiration to all this, and the strength for it, was not their
   own, they owed it to Him. They washed their robes and made them white
   in the blood of the Lamb; it was the power of His Passion, descending
   into their hearts, which enabled them to do what they did. Once more,
   the rationale is wanting. Some may feel that none is needed -- that the
   Cross acts immediately in this way on those who are of the truth: none,
   at all events, is given. We can only feel that the Cross must have some
   divine meaning in it when it exercises so overwhelming a constraint.

   (3) The third passage has also a relation to martyrdom, or at least to
   fidelity in a time of terrible persecution.

   And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of
   the word of their testimony, and they loved not their life unto death'
   (12:11).

   It is implied in this that but for the blood of the Lamb they would not
   have been able to overcome; the pressure put on them would have been
   too great, and they would inevitably have succumbed to it. [67] But
   with a motive behind them like the blood of the Lamb they were
   invincible. Now nothing can be a motive unless it has a meaning;
   nothing can be a motive in the line and in the sense implied here
   unless it has a gracious meaning. To say that they overcame, because of
   the blood of the Lamb, is the same as to say that the love of Christ
   constrained them. They dared not, with the Cross on which He died for
   them before their eyes, betray this cause by cowardice, and love their
   own lives more than He had loved His. They must be His, as He had been
   theirs. It is taken for granted here that in the blood of the Lamb
   there had been a great demonstration of love to them; in other words,
   that the death of Christ was capable of being defined in such a way, in
   relation to their necessities, as to bear this interpretation. It is
   because it is an incomparable demonstration of love that it is an
   irresistible motive. And though the relation is not thought out nor
   defined here -- where it would have been utterly out of place -- it is
   not forcing the language in the least to assume that it must have
   existed in fact for the author.

   There are two other passages which might be brought into connection
   with our subject -- 13:8, and 21:27 -- in which reference is made to
   the Lamb's book of life.' In this book the names are written of those
   who are to inherit life everlasting: those whose names are not found
   there die the second death. Nothing could express more strongly the
   writer's conviction that there is no salvation in any other than the
   Lamb: that in Jesus Christ and Him crucified is the whole hope of a
   sinful world. It is very common to take the first of the two passages
   just quoted as though it spoke of the Lamb slain from the foundation of
   the world,' and to argue from it that atonement is no afterthought,
   that redemption belongs to the very being of God and the nature of
   things; but though these are expressions upon which a Christian meaning
   can be put, they find no support in this passage. The words from the
   foundation of the world' are not to be construed with slain,' but with
   written,' as the parallel passage proves; it is the names of the
   redeemed that stand from eternity in the Lamb's book of life, not the
   death or sacrifice of the Lamb which is carried back from Calvary and
   is vested with an eternal, as distinct from its historical, reality. An
   apostle would probably have felt that the historical reality was
   compromised by such a conception, or that something was taken away from
   its absolute significance. But even discounting this, it has no
   exegetic support. [68]

   If we try to put together the various lights which the Apocalypse casts
   on the death of Jesus, we may say:

   (1) That death is regarded as a great demonstration of love (1:5).

   (2) It is a death which once for all has achieved something -- the
   aorists lusanti (1:5), esphages kai hegorasas en to haimati (5:9),
   prove this. There is a finished work in it.

   (3) It is a death which has an abiding power -- arnion hos esphagmenon
   (5:6), not sphagen. [69]

   (4) This abiding power is exercised in this, that it enables men to be
   faithful to Christ under persecution, to suffer with Him rather than
   sin, finally, rather to die than sin (12:11). Christ Himself was a
   martyr, and the typical Christian is a martyr too. To be a martyr is to
   furnish the decisive proof that the abiding power of Christ's blood is
   being exercised over one's life.

   (5) Hence the blood of Christ both does something once for all -- in
   breaking the bond which sin holds us by, and bringing us into such a
   relation to God that we are a people of priests -- and does something
   progressively, in assuring our gradual assimilation to Jesus Christ the
   faithful witness. In both respects the Christian life is absolutely
   indebted to it; without it, it could neither begin nor go on. There is
   the same experience, it may be said, of Christ's death, the same
   practical appreciation of it, and the same exultant and devout
   utterance of that appreciation in the language of worship, which we
   find in St. Paul; but, as we might expect, when the nature of the
   composition is taken into account, we do not find any such dialectic
   treatment of this Christian experience, and of the ideas it involves,
   as in the writings of the apostle of the Gentiles.

   We may now proceed to the examination of the gospel. The general
   conception of the fourth gospel is that what we owe to Christ is life,
   eternal life; and this life, it may further be said, we owe to the
   Person rather than to anything He does. This is true without any
   qualification of the prologue (ch. 1:1-18), and it is true of the
   gospel so far as the influence of the prologue can be traced through
   it. If we use the word redemption at all -- and it occurs naturally to
   us as we come from the Apocalypse -- we must say that redemption is
   conceived in the gospel as taking place through revelation. Jesus
   redeems men, or gives them life, by revealing to them the truth about
   God. The revelation is made in His own Person -- by His words and
   deeds, no doubt, but supremely by what He is.

   This is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the only true God,
   and Him whom Thou didst send, Jesus Christ' (17:3).

   The work of redemption, to borrow the dogmatic category, is interpreted
   through the prophetic office of Christ almost exclusively. It is on
   this basis that the ordinary contrasts are drawn between the theology
   of St. Paul and that of the four gospels and if we do not look too
   closely they can be drawn in very broad lines; to change the figure,
   they can be put in epigrammatic and striking forms. Thus it may be said
   that in St. John the great and fundamental idea is revelation; God
   makes Himself known to men, and in making Himself known He redeems
   them; to see Him in His true nature is to be withdrawn from the world
   of sin. In St. Paul, on the other hand, revelation is through
   redemption. It is because God in Jesus Christ takes the
   responsibilities of the sinful world upon Himself, so reconciling the
   world to Himself, that we know what He is the relation of revelation
   and redemption is reversed. It agrees with this, again, that as Schultz
   has put it, [70] in St. John the death of Jesus only comes, though it
   comes inevitably, because of the flesh; the Word was made flesh, and
   therefore must share the fate of all flesh, fulfill the destiny of man
   by a perfect death as by a perfect life. In St. Paul, on the contrary,
   it is the death which is the primary thing; except for the purpose of
   dying for man's redemption Christ would never have been here in the
   flesh at all. It agrees with this further, so it is said, that whereas
   in St. Paul (as in the synoptic gospels) the people in whom Jesus is
   most interested, and who are most interested in Him, are the sinners
   who need redemption and whom He died to redeem, in St. John the sinners
   have practically disappeared, and the persons who have an interest in
   Jesus are the relatively good people who are prepared to appreciate the
   revelation He has brought. He that doeth the truth cometh to the light'
   (3:21). Every one that is of the truth heareth My voice' (18:37). A
   sentence like 10:26, Ye do not believe, because ye are not of My
   sheep,' would, according to Holtzmann, have been exactly reversed in
   the synoptics; it would have been, You are not of My sheep, because you
   do not believe.' [71] The trick of such contrasts is easily learned,
   but does not strike one as very valuable. It depends for its
   plausibility on those generalities in which there is always some
   delusion hidden. It depends in this case, for example, on taking the
   somewhat abstract and speculative standpoint of the prologue, and
   allowing that to dominate the historical parts of the gospel. But if we
   turn from the prologue to the gospel itself, in which Jesus actually
   figures, and in which His words and deeds are before us, we receive a
   different impression. There is a great deal which resists the
   speculative solvent supposed to be contained in the Logos theory. There
   is, in particular, a great deal bearing upon the death of Christ and
   its significance, which goes to discredit those abstract contrasts
   which have just been illustrated. When we do take such a closer look at
   the gospel, what do we find?

   We find that the death of Christ in a great variety of ways comes to
   the front, as something which is of peculiar significance for the
   evangelist.

   (1) The first allusion to it is that which is put into the lips of John
   the Baptist in 1:29: Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin
   of the world.' If these are not the words of the Baptist, they are all
   the more the words of the evangelist, and define his standpoint from
   the outset. That they refer to the death of Jesus does not seem to me
   open to question. Granting that ho airon ten hamartian tou kosmou is
   rightly rendered qui tollit or qui aufert peccatum mundi -- who takes
   away, not who takes on him, the sin of the world -- we have to take the
   subject of the sentence into consideration, the Lamb. When sin is taken
   away by a lamb, it is taken away sacrificially; it is borne off by
   being in some sense -- in the case of an unintelligent sacrifice, only
   a figurative sense -- borne. It is not too much to say that the
   conception of Christ's death as a sacrifice for sin, put thus, at the
   very beginning of the gospel, into the lips of the great witness to
   Jesus, is meant to convey decisively the evangelist's own conception of
   Jesus and His work. He is here to put away sin -- that sums up His
   vocation; and He does not put it away by the method of denunciation,
   like the Baptist, but by the sacrificial method, in which it has to be
   borne. On this passage, see Garvie, Studies in the inner Life of Jesus,
   p. 125.

   (2) There is a further allusion to the death of Jesus in 2:19: Destroy
   this temple, and in three days I will build it up.' This, according to
   the evangelist, He spoke concerning the temple of His body. The
   evangelist's interpretation has been treated with very little respect
   by critics of all schools. It is not necessary to defend it; but I
   repeat, that if this is not what Jesus meant, all the more must we
   recognize the preoccupation of the evangelist himself with the idea. He
   drags it in, we must believe, where it is out of place, only because it
   is the center of all his thoughts about Jesus; it is in it he
   instinctively seeks the key to anything mysterious in the Master's
   words.

   (3) The third reference is indisputable, though the terms in which it
   is expressed may not be free from ambiguity. It is that in ch. 3:14 in
   which Jesus is represented as comparing Himself to the brazen serpent,
   Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.' The expression lifted up'
   occurs in one or two other places, and the same happy or unhappy
   ambiguity attaches to it in all. Thus in ch. 8:28 Jesus says to the
   Jews, When ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall ye know that I
   am He,' etc. In 12:32 we have: And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
   will draw all men to Myself. ' Here the evangelist again has a note
   which has excited the contempt of critics. This He said, indicating by
   what kind of death He was to die' (12:33). All that the Jews seem to
   have taken out of the word was the idea of removal'; for they contrast
   the inevitable uplifting' of the Son of Man with the abiding of the
   Christ for ever.' Here it is by no means necessary to join in the
   common censure of the evangelist. Where the uplifting' is spoken of
   indefinitely, it may be conceived, properly enough, to include the
   exaltation; but where it is spoken of as the act of the Jews (8:28),
   and compared to the elevation of the brazen serpent on a pole (3:14
   f.), the allusion to the Cross is unmistakable. There is, indeed, an
   exact parallel to it in Ezra 6:11 (RV.), though the word hupsoun is not
   used: Also I have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word,
   let timber be pulled down from his house, and let him be lifted up and
   fastened thereon. ' That was the death which Jesus died, and to such a
   death the evangelist understood Him to refer when he used the word
   which he represents by hupsoun. The word had the advantage -- for no
   doubt it was counted an advantage -- of carrying a double meaning, of
   raising the mind at once to the cross and to the heavenly throne. But
   nothing is more characteristic of the writer, or of Jesus as He is set
   before us in this gospel, than the unification of these two things.
   They are inseparable parts of the same whole. Hence the peculiar use of
   the term glorify' (e.g., Now is the Son of Man glorified,' 13:31) to
   express what happens to Christ in His death. There is no conception of
   a humiliation in death followed and rewarded by an exaltation; on the
   contrary, Christ is lifted up and ascends through His death, His glory
   is revealed in that whole experience which death initiates, and into
   which it enters, more than in all His miracles. The mere fact that
   words like hupsothenai and doxasthenai are the evangelist's chosen
   words to describe Christ's death shows how thought had been preoccupied
   with it, and how, the prologue notwithstanding, the Christian soul felt
   itself here at the heart of the revelation and of the redeeming power
   of God.

   (4) The death of Christ is again alluded to, in all probability, in
   chap. 6, and that in close connection with the life which is His
   supreme gift to men; He speaks there of His flesh, which He will give
   for the life of the world, and of eating the flesh and drinking the
   blood of the Son of Man (6:51-53). If it were possible, as I do not
   think it is, to deny that there is any reference in this chapter to the
   sacrament of the Lord's Supper, it might be possible also to deny that
   it contained any reference to Christ's death. Verses like those just
   quoted would merely be an enigmatic and defiant manner (such as we
   frequently find at the close of a discussion in the fourth gospel) of
   putting the general truth of 5:57: He that eateth Me, he it is who
   shall live because of Me.' My flesh' and My blood' would in this case
   only be a more concrete and pictorial Me'; there would not of necessity
   be any reference to the death. But when we remember the period at which
   the gospel came into use, the sacramental allusion (see below), both
   here and in the third chapter, seems to me quite indisputable; and this
   carries with it the allusion to Christ's death as in some way or other
   the life of the world.

   (5) In the tenth chapter we again come upon passages in which there is
   nothing equivocal.

   I am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd layeth down His life for the
   sheep' (10:11).

   This, it might be said, is only an ideal way of putting it; it is what
   the Good Shepherd would do if the situation emerged which required it.
   But it is not put so by the evangelist. The need has emerged, and the
   laying down of His life with a view to its resumption is made the sum
   and substance of the vocation of Jesus.

   Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life that I may
   take it again. No one taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I
   have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again.
   This commandment have I received from My Father' (10:17 f.).

   Christ's death is not an incident of His life, it is the aim of it. The
   laying down of His life is not an accident in His career, it is His
   vocation; it is that in which the divine purpose of His life is
   revealed.

   (6) A peculiar solemnity attaches in the gospel to a sixth allusion to
   Christ's death, that which is made in the unconscious prophecy of
   Caiaphas. A prophecy is that which a man speaks under the impulse of
   the Holy Spirit, and the evangelist means us to understand that a
   divine authority attaches for once to the words of this bad man. Being
   high priest that fateful year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for
   the nation, and not for the nation only, but also to gather together in
   one the children of God who were scattered abroad.' Some interest of
   the nation, and this great interest of the family of God, were
   conditioned by the death of Jesus, however that death may be related to
   the ends it was to achieve.

   (7) In the twelfth chapter there are several significant allusions.
   There is the corn of wheat which, unless it fall into the ground and
   die, abides alone, but if it die, bears much fruit (12:24) -- a
   similitude in which the influence of Jesus is made to depend directly
   on His death; and in close connection with this there is the
   anticipation of the near and awful future, the shadow of which struck
   dark and cold upon the Savior's soul.

   Now is My soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from
   this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour' (12:27).

   This hour' is the great crisis in the life of Jesus, the hour which no
   one could anticipate (7:30 and 8:20), but from which, now that it has
   come, He will not shrink. It has come, in the sense already explained,
   as the hour in which the Son of Man is to be glorified: the hour in
   which He is to drink the cup which the Father gives Him to drink, and
   to crown the work the Father has given Him to do. The way in which He
   is moved by it, shrinks from it, accepts it, reveals the place it holds
   in His mind, and in that of the evangelist also.

   (8) Just as the Lamb of God at the beginning of the gospel (1:29)
   connected it with Isaiah 53, so does the quotation in chap. 12:38 give
   us the same key to its interpretation at the end. Though He had done so
   many signs before them, they did not believe on Him, that the word of
   Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he said: Lord, who hath
   believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?'
   Taken alone, this passage could not be made to bear any special
   reference to the death of Christ or to its interpretation; but
   occurring as it does after the triple and unmistakable references of
   the corn, of wheat, the dreaded hour, and the lifting up from the earth
   (vv. 24, 27, 32), it seems to me rather probable than otherwise that it
   is meant to bring before the reader's mind, by a sufficient hint, the
   fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, as the Old Testament, and therefore the
   divine, solution of the mysteriously disappointing career of Jesus.

   (9) If this instance is reckoned doubtful, there can be no doubt about
   the one in the fifteenth chapter:

   Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
   his friends' (15:13).

   It is characteristic of St. John, we are told, as opposed to St. Paul,
   that in St. John Jesus died for His friends; St. Paul thinks of Him as
   dying for His enemies (Romans 5:10). It is an inept remark. Jesus at
   the moment is speaking to His friends, and about the supreme pledge of
   love He is going to give them. In other places, St. John, like St.
   Paul, represents Him as giving His flesh for the life of the world'
   (6:51), and lays stress on the fact that it is God's love for the
   world, in its all-inclusive yet individualizing intensity, which
   explains His lifting up' (3:14). This is the great thing on which they
   agree: the highest revelation of love is made in the death of Jesus.

   (10) A singular and striking allusion to His death has been found in
   our Lord's intercessory prayer: For their sakes I sanctify Myself that
   they also may be sanctified in truth' (17:19). The meaning of this will
   be considered presently (see below).

   And finally

   (11) there is the story of the Passion itself. A peculiar significance
   attaching to the death of Jesus is implied

   (a) by the fullness with which the story is told;

   (b) by the references in it to the fulfillment of prophecy, which mean
   that a divine purpose was being carried out by it (19:24 = Psalm 22:18;
   19:28 f. = Psalm 69:21; 19:36 f. = Exodus 12:46, Zechariah 12:10); and

   (c) by the peculiarly emphatic attestation given to some mysterious
   circumstances attendant on it, the sense of which might have remained
   hidden from us but for the interpretation of them provided in the first
   epistle. One of the soldiers with a spear pierced His side, and there
   came out immediately blood and water. And he that hath seen hath borne
   witness, and his witness is true, and he knoweth that he saith true,
   that ye also may believe. For these things took place that the
   Scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of Him shall not be broken. And
   again, another Scripture says: They shall look on Him whom they
   pierced' (19:36 f., cf. 1st epistle, 5:6).

   This series of passages has not been cited at random, but to dissipate
   the impression which many people have, and which some writers on New
   Testament theology propagate, that the death of Christ has no place in
   the fourth gospel corresponding to that which it has elsewhere in the
   New Testament. I think they are sufficient to dissipate such an
   impression. No doubt there is much in the fourth gospel which makes it
   plausible to say, St. Paul deals with the work of Christ, St. John with
   His person; for St. Paul, Christ only lives to die; for St. John, He
   dies because death is the only issue from life; but such contrasts do
   as much to mislead as to illumine. As soon as we are past the prologue,
   into the scenery of what Jesus actually said, did, thought, feared, and
   suffered, we see that His death really fills the place it does
   everywhere in the New Testament, and has the same decisive importance.
   Indeed, the constant complaint of commentators is that the evangelist
   drags it in at inappropriate places, a complaint which, so far as it is
   justified, only shows how completely his mind was absorbed and
   dominated by the Cross.

   But does this prominence of the death of Jesus in the gospel throw any
   light upon its meaning? Is it defined by St. John (or by Jesus in the
   fourth gospel) in any such relations as by St. Paul? Allowing for the
   fact that the writer's mind is not of a dialectical turn like that of
   St. Paul, but given rather to intuition than to reflection -- in other
   words, to the contemplation of results rather than of processes, of
   ends rather than of means or conditions -- we must answer these
   questions in the affirmative.

   In St. John, as in St. Paul, Christ's death is set in relation to the
   love and saving will of God.

   God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life'
   (3:16).

   Again, in St. John as in St. Paul, Christ's death is related to His own
   love: Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
   for his friends' (15:13). This is the favorite text of Abaelard, quoted
   again and again as having the whole secret of the atonement in it:
   everything, according to Abaelard, lies in this, that there is love in
   Christ's death, with power in it to evoke love, the response of love
   being the whole experience of salvation. The more fully Christ's love
   wins from us the answer of love, the more fully are we justified and
   saved; that is all. [72] Without raising the question whether the act
   of Christ in laying down His life must not be related in some real way
   to our real necessities before it can either be or be conceived to be
   an act of love at all, we may notice that its character as connected
   with His love is again emphasized in the allegory of the Good Shepherd.
   The perfect freedom with which Christ acts the shepherd's part, on to
   the final sacrifice which it demands, is apparently the characteristic
   of His work to which He attaches the greatest importance. And it is so
   because it is through the freshness with which the surrender of life is
   made that the love which is its motive is revealed. I lay down My life
   of Myself. No one taketh it from Me. I have authority to lay it down,
   and I have authority to take it again' (10:17 f.). This spontaneity on
   the part of Jesus, when it is put in relation to the love of the Father
   in giving the Son, appears as obedience. The authority or liberty He
   has to lay down His life and to take it again is a commandment He has
   received from the Father. Equally with St. Paul or with the writer to
   the Hebrews, St. John could use the term obedience' to describe the
   whole work of Christ; but just as with them, with him too it is loving
   obedience to a will of love, an attitude at once to God's purpose and
   to man's need which makes the Passion the sublimest of actions, and
   justifies the paradox of the gospel that the Cross is a lifting up' or
   a glorifying of Jesus.

   It is possible, however, to go further in defining the death of Christ
   in the fourth gospel. Proceeding as it does from the love of the Father
   and the Son, it is nevertheless not conceived as arbitrary. It is free,
   but there is a rational necessity for it. The Son of Man must be lifted
   up if He is to save those who believe. The corn of wheat must fall into
   the ground and die if it is not to abide alone. Not much, indeed, is
   said to explain this. The various ends secured by Christ's death -- the
   advantage of the flock for which as the Good Shepherd He lays down His
   life (10:11), the eternal life of those who believe in Him (3:14 f.),
   the rallying round Him as a center of the scattered children of God, so
   that He becomes the head of a new humanity (11:52): these, no doubt,
   are all dependent upon it somehow; but how, the evangelist is at no
   pains to tell. But we do no violence to his thought when we put this
   and that in the gospel together in order to discern what he does not
   explicitly say. Everything, we have seen, comes from the love of God;
   the death of Christ is to be construed in harmony with this, not in any
   antagonism to it. But the love of God to the world is never conceived
   in Scripture abstractly. It is not manifested in some evolutionary
   process which is necessarily determined a priori, as might be hastily
   inferred from the prologue to the fourth gospel; to conceive it so
   would be to deny its grace. It is conceived, practically, in relation
   to definite needs of man which it meets; it is manifested not on the
   analogy of natural forces, which simply are what they are, but on the
   analogy of the free actions of men, which are determined by specific
   motives. To deny this is to lose the living and gracious God of
   revelation, and to take in His place a metaphysical phantom. God so
   loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. The giving of the
   Son at least includes the giving of Him to that death which, as we have
   seen, pervades the gospel from beginning to end; indeed, the death is
   emphasized in the immediate context (3:14 f.). Nor are we left without
   sufficiently clear hints as to the necessity which determined the gift.
   In the passage just referred to (3:16), we see that apart from it men
   are lost; they perish, instead of having eternal life. St. John's mind
   revolves round these ultimate ideas, death and life, rather than their
   moral equivalents or presuppositions, sin and righteousness; but we
   cannot suppose that he did not include in death' and life' all that we
   mean by these latter words.

   That he did include all this we see when the consequence of refusing
   the gift of God is presented in the terrible word of Jesus, If ye
   believe not that I am He, ye shall die in your sins' (8:24); or when
   the evangelist himself writes,

   He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; he that disobeyeth the
   Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him' (3:36).

   The love of God, then, represented in the gift of Christ, has in view,
   according to the fourth gospel, the sin of the world, its exposure to
   the divine wrath, its perishing if left to itself; and the gift in
   which that love is embodied, if it is to be intelligently apprehended
   at all, must also have a definite relation to this concrete case. If it
   delivers men from perishing under the wrath of God, and from the sin by
   which that wrath is evoked, then an intelligible relation to sin and to
   the divine wrath is implicit in the writer's consciousness of it,
   whether he has given articulate expression to such a relation or not.
   It is quite legitimate here to emphasize such passages as 1:29, where,
   as has been already shown, a sacrificial deliverance from sin is
   represented as the sum and substance of the gospel; and 20:23, where
   the power which the Risen Lord confers on His disciples in virtue of
   all that He has achieved is a power connected with the forgiveness of
   sins. It may seem to some a less obvious instance, but the striking
   word of Jesus in 17:19 points in the same direction. For their sakes I
   sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.' What men
   needed was to be sanctified, that is, to be consecrated to God. It was
   not in their power -- surely no reason can be conceived for this but
   that which lies in their sin -- to consecrate themselves, and what they
   were not able to do for themselves Christ did for them in His own
   Person. He consecrated Himself to God in His death. That the reference
   is to His death does not seem open to question; the present tense,
   hagiazo, which suggests something going on at the moment, and the
   circumstances of the Speaker, whose mind is full of what is at hand,
   put out of court the idea that the word is intended to describe His
   life as a whole. His life was past, and now, in His own Person, through
   death, He is about to establish between God and man a relation which
   men could never have established for themselves, but into which they
   can truly enter, and into which they will be drawn once it is
   established by Him. This seems to me the exact equivalent of the
   Pauline doctrine that Christ dies our death that we may be drawn into
   the fellowship of His death, and so put right with God. He acts -- I
   sanctify Myself'; men are acted on -- that they also may be
   sanctified.' He establishes the reconciliation; they, to use Pauline
   language, receive it (Romans 5:11).

   I have spoken of the gospel throughout as if it expressed the mind of
   the writer rather than that of the subject. The necessity of such a
   concession to the current criticism is shaken when we pass to the
   epistle, for there we find the death of Christ and its significance put
   in a light which more imperatively recalls the other New Testament
   epistles, and which differentiates this one to a considerable extent
   from the gospel. The contrast with the epistle on this very point is
   one of the evidences that the gospel is truer to its assumed historical
   position than many would admit; it is not his own mind the writer
   wishes to impart, but the mind of Christ; and though it is certainly by
   the same hand as the epistle, he does not feel at liberty to say
   everything in it that the epistle allows him to say.

   For example, we frequently find in the epistle explicitly stated, what
   we have as a rule to infer in the gospel, the connection between the
   death of Christ and sin. Thus in 1:7: The blood of Jesus His Son
   cleanseth us from all sin.' In 2:1 f.:

   These things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any one sin, we
   have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And He
   Himself is a propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also
   for the whole world.'

   In 2:12: I write unto you, little children, because your sins are
   forgiven you for His name's sake.' In 3:5: Ye know that He was
   manifested to take away sins.' In 4:10: Not that we loved God, but that
   He loved us, and sent His Son a propitiation for our sins.' The whole
   Person and Work of Christ, we see here, His whole manifestation in the
   world, but in some signal way His death, are set in relation to sin. It
   is characteristic of the writer, here as in the gospel, that his
   interest is in the end or result, the actual cleansing of the soul from
   sin, its sanctification not in the sense of 1 Corinthians 6:11, or of
   Hebrews 10:29, but in the sense of modern Protestant theology. This
   sanctification is dependent on the death of Christ. If we walk in the
   light as God is in the light, the blood of Jesus His Son continuously
   and progressively cleanses us from all sin: our sanctification is
   gradually achieved under its influence (1:7). It is the removal of sin
   in this sense which is referred to also in 3:5: He was manifested, that
   He might put sins away.' It is by no means necessary, for the
   understanding of the evangelist here, that we should adopt the strange
   caprice which fascinated Westcott, and distinguish with him in the
   blood of Christ

   (1) His death, and

   (2) His life; or

   (1) His blood shed, and

   (2) His blood offered; or

   (1) His life laid down, and

   (2) His life liberated and made available for men. [73]

   No doubt these distinctions were meant to safeguard a real religious
   interest, they were meant to secure the truth that it is a living
   Savior who saves, and that He actually does save, from sin, and that He
   does so in the last resort by the communication of His own life; but I
   venture to say that a more groundless fancy never haunted and troubled
   the interpretation of any part of Scripture than that which is
   introduced by this distinction into the Epistle to the Hebrews and the
   First Epistle of John. The New Testament writers, though they speak
   often of Christ's death, never think of a dead Christ: their Christ is
   One who became dead and is alive for evermore, and in His immortal life
   the virtue of His death is present. He did something when He died, and
   that something He continues to make effective for men in His Risen
   Life; but there is no meaning in saying that by His death His life --
   as something other than His death -- is liberated' and made available'
   for men: on the contrary, what makes His risen life significant and a
   saving power for sinners is neither more nor less than this, that His
   death is in it; it is the life of one who by dying has dealt with the
   fatal necessities of man's situation, and in doing so has given a
   supreme demonstration of His love.

   This connection of ideas becomes apparent when we notice that St. John
   uses a word akin to St. Paul's hilasterion in describing the relation
   of Christ to sin. Jesus Christ the righteous, he says, is the hilasmos
   for our sins (2:2); and again, he says, God of his own accord loved us,
   and sent His Son a propitiation for our sins (4:10). It is impossible
   to suppose that St. John used this word in any other relations than
   those in which it is found (or in which the cognate terms are found) in
   Hebrews or in St. Paul. The characteristic words of religion cannot be
   applied in new ways at will. Now the idea of hilasmos or propitiation
   is not an insulated idea -- indeed there cannot be any such thing. It
   is part of a system of ideas, which we have to reconstruct with the
   means at our disposal. It is related, for one thing, to the idea of
   sin. It is sin, according to the uniform teaching of the New Testament,
   which creates the necessity for it, and which is in some sense the
   object of it. In other words, sin is the problem with which hilasmos
   deals. St. John agrees with all New Testament writers in regarding sin
   as a problem. It cannot simply be ignored or suppressed; something has
   to be done with it, and the effective something (when its removal is in
   view) has been done by Christ the hilasmos. Again, the idea of hilasmos
   is related to the ideas of sacrifice and intercession. When St. John
   says that Jesus Christ the righteous is the propitiation for our sins,
   this is implied. He has spoken almost immediately before about the
   blood of Jesus cleansing from all sin; he speaks further on with
   significant emphasis about His coming in blood as well as in water
   (5:6); and he no doubt conceived Jesus as set forth, as St. Paul has it
   (Romans 3:25), in His blood in this propitiatory character. Further,
   the idea of hilasmos by being related to sin is related also to some
   divine law or order which sin has violated, and which is acknowledged
   in its inviolable rights by the hilasmos. This is what is meant when
   the propitiation is described as Jesus Christ the Righteous. All that
   is divine, all the moral order of the world, all that we mean by the
   Law of God, has right done by it in the death of Christ. Sin, in that
   sense, is neutralized by the propitiation, and if men could enter into
   it, or if the benefit of it could come to them, sin would no more be a
   barrier to their fellowship with God. The propitiation would draw them
   to God and put them right with Him, and as it held their hearts more
   closely it would more effectually and thoroughly cleanse them from
   every taint of sin. The power of sanctification is lodged in it as well
   as the condition of the sinner's primary acceptance with God. The first
   of these -- the power of sanctification -- preponderates in the
   epistle; but it would be as complete a negation of its teaching, as of
   that of every New Testament writing, to say that the second -- the
   sinner's acceptance with God -- is dependent upon it. The very reverse
   is the case. The sin of the whole world has been atoned for, as the
   apostle expressly asserts (2:2); and it is on the basis of this work
   finished for all, and assumed to underlie everything, that the
   progressive purification of the Christian proceeds. It is the virtue of
   the hilasmos, in which all sin has been dealt with for its removal, and
   dealt with according to the realities of the divine law involved in the
   case, which eventually effects sanctification.

   Perhaps the most striking thing in the first Epistle of St. John is the
   manner in which the propitiation of Christ is related to the love of
   God. The connection of the two things is, as we have seen, universal in
   the New Testament. No one could teach more emphatically than St. Paul,
   for example, that it is to the love of God we owe the presence of Jesus
   in the world and His work for men. No one could contrast what the love
   of God has done for us in Christ more emphatically than St. Paul does
   with the utmost which men will do from love for each other. But St.
   John rises above all comparisons to an absolute point of view at which
   propitiation and love become ideas which explain each other, and which
   have no adequate illustration apart from each other. He not only
   defines the propitiation by relation to love -- God Himself loved us
   and sent His Son a propitiation for our sins (4:10); He defines love by
   relation to the propitiation -- in this have we come to know what love
   is, that He laid down His life for us (3:16). The emphasis in this last
   sentence is on the expressly contrasted words ekeinos huper hemon. It
   is the contrast of what He is and of what we are, of the sinless Son of
   God and the sinful sons of men, in which the nerve of the proposition
   lies. So far from finding any kind of contrast between love and
   propitiation, the apostle can convey no idea of love to any one except
   by pointing to the propitiation -- love is what is manifested there;
   and he can give no account of the propitiation but by saying, Behold
   what manner of love. For him, to say God is love' is exactly the same
   as to say God has in His Son made atonement for the sin of the world.'
   If the propitiatory death of Jesus is eliminated from the love of God,
   it might be unfair to say that the love of God is robbed of all
   meaning, but it is certainly robbed of its apostolic meaning. It has no
   longer that meaning which goes deeper than sin, sorrow, and death, and
   which recreates life in the adoring joy, wonder, and purity of the
   first Epistle of St. John.

   In speaking of the death of Christ, it would not be just either to the
   gospel or to the Epistle of St. John to ignore the place held in both
   by the sacraments. That place has been ignored by some and disputed by
   others; but if we realize the date at which both documents were
   written, the place which the sacraments had in Christian worship at the
   time, and the inevitableness with which ordinary Christians must have
   thought, and as we know did think, of the sacraments when they read, it
   seems to me indisputable. Baptism and the Lord's Supper, it is no
   exaggeration to say, were full in the writer's view at many points. He
   must have thought of baptism when he wrote in the third chapter of the
   gospel the words about being born of water and spirit; he must have
   thought of the Supper as he wrote in the sixth about eating the flesh
   of the Son of Man and drinking His blood. I cannot doubt that he
   thought of both when he told in 19:34 of the blood and water that
   issued from the pierced side of Jesus, and again in the epistle (5:6
   f.) urged that Jesus Christ came through water and blood, adding, with
   unambiguous emphasis, not in the water only, but in the water and in
   the blood. The water and the blood were always present in the church in
   the form of the sacraments, and the evangelist uses the sacraments here
   as witnesses to the historical reality of the life and experiences of
   Jesus. Christian baptism answers to His baptism; the Christian feast in
   which faith partakes of His body and blood is a perpetual testimony to
   His passion. It is in this last that St. John is peculiarly interested
   as he writes the epistle. There were teachers abroad, of whom Cerinthus
   is a type, who preached a Christ that had come in the water only, not
   in the blood. The redeeming love and power of God, they held, had
   descended on Jesus at His baptism, and been with Him in His ministry of
   teaching and healing: there is a divine reality in this, therefore, on
   which we can depend. But they had withdrawn from Him before the
   Passion,: there is therefore no corresponding divine reality there. It
   is against such a view that the apostle makes the elaborate and
   emphatic protest of 5:6 f., not in the water only, but in the water and
   in the blood.' To deny the divine reality and saving significance of
   the Passion was to rob the most sacred rite of the Christian religion
   at once of its basis and its import; it was to abolish the Lord's
   Supper. The apostle appeals to the Lord's Supper against such a view. A
   Christ who did not come by blood -- a Christ whose flesh was not the
   true meat and His blood the true drink, as the celebration of the
   Supper and the liturgical language used at it implied -- a Christ who
   did not by His death bring life to men -- was not the Christ known to
   the faith and acknowledged in the worship of the church. The
   sacraments, but especially the sacrament of the Supper, are the
   stronghold of the New Testament doctrine concerning the death of
   Christ.

   But there is another side to this. While the apostle sees in the
   sacraments a testimony to the historicity of the baptism and death of
   Christ, and to the perpetual presence in the church of the saving power
   of the Lord's Passion, and while he insists upon their historicity as
   against those who denied that Jesus Christ had come in flesh, and who
   made the life on earth, and especially the death, phantasmal, so far as
   a revelation of God was concerned, he protests on the other hand
   against those who would materialize the history. He checks them at
   every point by introducing and emphasizing the Spirit. Thus in the
   gospel, chap. 3, he speaks once of being born of water and spirit, but
   from that point onward the water is ignored, we hear of the Spirit
   alone; of its breathing where it will, of being born of the Spirit, of
   every one who is so born. So also in the sixth chapter, after using the
   strongest language about eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the
   Son of Man -- language in which enigmatic defiance to antipathetic
   minds is carried to the furthest point -- he precludes all possibility
   of religious materialism by the words.

   It is the Spirit which gives life; the flesh is of no use for this; the
   words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life' (6:63).

   Words and speech address man on the spiritual side of his nature, and
   it is on this side that everything included in Christ -- he that eateth
   Me,' He says -- finds access to us. And finally, in the epistle, after
   laying the stress we have seen on the water and the blood, he
   concludes: And the Spirit is that which beareth witness, for the Spirit
   is the truth. For three are they that bear witness, the Spirit and the
   water and the blood, and the three agree in one. ' In every case the
   historical is asserted, but care is taken that it shall not be
   materialized, a primacy is given to the spiritual. On the other hand,
   there is no such spiritualizing as would leave to the historical merely
   a position of vanishing or relative importance. There is no sublimation
   of Christianity into ethical' or spiritual principles,' or into eternal
   facts,' which absolve us from all obligation to a Savior who came in
   blood. Except through the historical, there is no Christianity at all,
   but neither is there any Christianity until the historical has been
   spiritually comprehended.

   This is closely connected with our subject. Christianity is as real as
   the blood of Christ: it is as real as the agony in the garden and the
   death on the Cross. It is not less real than this, nor more real; it
   has no reality whatever which is separable from these historical
   things. Yet it is not in their mere externality, as events in past
   time, that they establish Christianity or save men from their sins. It
   is as their spiritual meaning is recognized, and makes a spiritual
   appeal to men, and awakes a spiritual response. It, is when that awful
   experience of Jesus is revealed as a propitiation for sins, an
   assumption of our responsibilities by One who does right by the eternal
   law which we have wronged, and does it for us at this tremendous cost;
   it, is then that the soul of man is reached by the divine love, and
   through penitence and faith drawn away from evil, and born again of
   God. It is then that the blood of Jesus, God's Son, cleanses from all
   sin. It is then that in His death the Son of Man is glorified, and God
   is glorified in Him.

   A friendly critic of this book pointed out what he regarded as a
   serious omission in it -- the want of any reference to the death of
   Christ as a victory over Satan. This is a point of view which is
   principally found in the fourth gospel. Thus it is with His death and
   its consequences in view that Jesus says,

   Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world
   be east out; and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
   unto Myself' (ch. 12:31 f.).

   As his hour comes nearer He says again,

   I shall no longer speak much with you, for the prince of the world
   cometh, and in Me he hath nothing' (ch. 14:30).&gt;

   And finally, in the description of the work and power of the Spirit,
   who is to take His place in the hearts of the disciples after His
   departure, the same conception recurs.

   He when He is come will convict the world . . . of judgment, because
   the prince of this world has been judged' (16:11).

   A mind which does not naturally personalize the principle of evil --
   turning the principle into a prince -- has the same embarrassment in
   dealing with these passages as with the Pauline ones referred to
   earlier in this work. Possibly we get out too easily with our abstract
   nouns. The evil in the world may be represented as a principle, or an
   atmosphere, or an abstraction of some kind, by a spectator who is not
   engaged in conflict with it; but for One whose life is spent in
   conflict, for One who resists unto blood in the strife against it and
   finds it impossible not to do so, evil may assume a more malignant, and
   therefore a more personal aspect. It is not an unconscious but a
   willful and wicked force. It is not a vis inertiae in the moral world,
   but an awful Enemy of God. It reveals the intensity of the conflict,
   the stress of the battle which Jesus fought, that the power which He
   vanquished is represented thus. There is no suggestion in the fourth
   gospel that the Prince of this World had any rights in it -- even
   relative and temporary rights, such as might be supposed to belong to
   the angels who gave the law, and who were superseded in their authority
   by Christ; the Prince of this World has no rights at all, and that is
   what Jesus demonstrates by His death. He has nothing in Christ; he is
   judged, he is cast out; through the death on the Cross the kingdom of
   this world is taken from him, and becomes the kingdom of God and of His
   Christ.

   to the frequent mention of white robes without any particular reference
   to the blood of Christ. The sacrament of baptism made the figure of
   washing an obvious one to Christians, quite apart from such suggestions
   as are given by Psalm 1:4 and Isaiah 1:16, 18, and its influence is
   apparent in 1 Corinthians 6:11 and Titus 2:14. On the whole, lusanti is
   much the better-supported reading: for the meaning which would go with
   lousanti see below on 7:14

   [67] Compare Moffatt ad loc. in Expositor's Greek Testament: In
   opposition to the contemporary Jewish tradition (Ap. Bar. 2. 2, 14. 12;
   4 Esd. 7. 77 etc.), it is not reliance on works but the consciousness
   of redemption which enables them to bear witness and to bear the
   consequences of their witness.'

   [68] The use of this text which is here rejected is found e. g. in
   Contentio Veritatis, p. 298, where Mr. Inge writes: These [the death
   and resurrection of Christ] are eternal acts, even as the generation of
   the Son of God is an eternal act. They belong to the unchangeable and
   everoperating counsels of God. So it is possible for the New Testament
   writers to say that the Lamb was slain for us from the foundation of
   the world, and that the rock which followed the Israelites through the
   wilderness was Christ. The passion of Christ was itself (as the Greek
   Fathers called it) a sacrament of mystery of an eternal truth: it was
   the supreme sacrament of human history; the outward and visible sign of
   a great supra-temporal fact.' This point of view, whatever its
   legitimacy or illegitimacy, is certainly much more characteristic of
   the Greek Fathers than of the New Testament writers. To the latter
   Christ is the equivalent of absolute spiritual reality. They never
   raise the abstract question of the relation of time to eternity; and
   though the eternal import of the historical, in the life and death of
   Jesus, is the foundation of all their thinking, they never describe the
   Passion as the sacrament or symbol of any reality beyond itself.

CHAPTER 6
The Importance of the Death of Christ in Preaching and in Theology

   IF the series of studies which we have now completed has reproduced
   with any adequacy or accuracy the mind of the New Testament writers,
   certain conclusions of importance may fairly be deduced from it. One is
   that there really is such a thing as the New Testament. There is, as we
   were disposed to assume, a real and substantial unity of thought in the
   books which we call by that name. They were not written with a view to
   incorporation in a canon; to repeat the paradox referred to in the
   introduction, New Testament theology is the theology of the Church at a
   time when as yet it had no New Testament. But the New Testament books
   have a unity, nevertheless, which is not external or imposed, nor due
   to the accident of their being approximately contemporary, but which is
   inward, essential, and spiritual, and which qualifies them to be
   canonical. Another conclusion to which we are led is that the death of
   Christ is the central thing in the New Testament, and in the Christian
   religion as the New Testament understands it. And when we say the death
   of Christ, we include, of course, the significance which the New
   Testament ascribes to it. Apart from that significance the death of
   Christ has no more right to a place in religion than the death of the
   penitent or the impenitent thief. The Cross and the word of the Cross
   -- the Cross and the rationale of it in relation to the love of God and
   the sin of Man -- are for religion one thing. This being so, it is
   apparent that both for the propagation and for the scientific
   construction of the Christian religion the death of Christ is of
   supreme importance. Not that I should draw too abstract a distinction.
   The propagation of Christianity and its interpretation by intelligence
   -- in other words, preaching and theology -- should never be divorced.
   At the vital point they coincide. The simplest truth of the gospel and
   the profoundest truth of theology must be put in the same words -- He
   bore our sins. If our gospel does not inspire thought, and if our
   theology does not inspire preaching, there is no Christianity in
   either. Yet vitally related as they are, there is a sufficiently clear
   distinction between them, and in considering some consequences, for
   preaching and theology, of New Testament teaching on Christ's death, it
   will be convenient to take preaching first.

   It is an immediate inference, then, from all that we have seen in the
   New Testament, that where there is no Atonement there is no gospel. To
   preach the love of God out of relation to the death of Christ -- or to
   preach the love of God in the death of Christ, but without being able
   to relate it to sin -- or to preach the forgiveness of sins as the free
   gift of God's love, while the death of Christ has no special
   significance assigned to it -- is not, if the New Testament is the rule
   and standard of Christianity, to preach the gospel at all. Many
   ministers have suffered from the charge of not preaching the gospel,
   and have resented it as an injustice. In any given case it may quite
   well have been so. There are those who are unable to separate form from
   substance in thinking, and who are only too ready to believe that if
   the familiar form in which the truth has been expressed is varied, the
   substance is being injured or dissipated. But it is not saying a hard
   or unjust thing to say that in some cases the charge may not be
   groundless. It may be made not merely by the unintelligent, who fail to
   distinguish form from substance, but by the simple Christian spirit
   which has the anointing from the Holy One, and knows instinctively
   whether that by which it lives is present in the message it hears or
   not. There is such a thing as preaching in which the death of Christ
   has no place corresponding to that which it has in the New Testament.
   There is preaching in which the New Testament interpretation of
   Christ's death is ignored, or carped at, or exploded. We do not need to
   argue that no man can preach the gospel until he has absorbed into his
   mind and heart the whole significance of Christ's death as the New
   Testament reveals it; in that case, who could preach at all? But it is
   not unjust to say that no man will so preach as to leave the impression
   that he has the Word of God behind him if he is inwardly at war with
   the idea of atonement, constantly engaged in minimizing it, maintaining
   an attitude of reserve, or even of self-defense, in relation to it. We
   may take it or leave it, but it is idle to attempt to propagate the
   Christian religion on the basis and with the authority of the New
   Testament, unless we have welcomed it with our whole heart.

   It is proper to remember in this connection that very often it is the
   simplest expressions, and those most open to abstract criticism, in
   which the profoundest truth is most tellingly expressed and most really
   apprehended; and that when this is the ease, if we are compelled to
   criticize, we should be careful that we do not discredit the essential
   truth as well as the inadequate form. It is easy, for instance, to
   criticize the insufficiency of any commercial figure, like that of
   debt,' to exhibit the personal and spiritual relations subsisting
   between man and God; yet Christ used this figure habitually, and the
   whole impression which it makes upon the conscience is sound. The words
   of the revival hymn, Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe,' have the
   root of the matter in them; and, however inadequate they may be to the
   interpretation of Christ's work and of Christian experience as a whole,
   they are infinitely truer than the most balanced, considerate, or
   subtle statement which denies them. Hence, whatever the motive which
   prompts criticism of such forms, we should be sensitive to the meaning
   they bear. Even if we think they are morally inadequate, and leave the
   new life unprovided for, we should remember that in the New Testament
   the new life is the immediate response to the very truth which such
   forms convey. The new life springs out of the sense of debt to Christ.
   The regenerating power of forgiveness depends upon its cost: it is the
   knowledge that we have been bought with a price which makes us cease to
   be our own, and live for Him who so dearly bought us. And we should
   remember also that it is not always intellectual sensitiveness, nor
   care for the moral interests involved, which sets the mind to criticize
   statements of the Atonement. There is such a thing as pride, the last
   form of which is unwillingness to become debtor even to Christ for
   forgiveness of sins; and it is conceivable that in any given case it
   may be this which makes the words of the hymn stick in our throats. In
   any case, I do not hesitate to say that the sense of debt to Christ is
   the most profound and pervasive of all emotions in the New Testament,
   and that only a gospel which evokes this, as the gospel of Atonement
   does, is true to the primitive and normal Christian type.

   Not only must Atonement by the death of Christ be preached if we would
   preach the New Testament gospel, but the characteristics of the
   Atonement must be clearly reflected in the preaching if justice is to
   be done to the gospel. As the finished work of Christ the Atonement is
   complete, and the perfection which belongs to it belongs also to the
   new relation to God into which we enter when the Atonement is
   appropriated by faith. There is no condemnation to them that are in
   Christ Jesus. Their relation to God is not determined now in the very
   least by sin or law, it is determined by Christ the propitiation and by
   faith. The position of the believer is not that of one trembling at the
   judgment seat, or of one for whom everything remains somehow in a
   condition of suspense; it is that of one who has the assurance of a
   divine love which has gone deeper than all his sins, and has taken on
   itself the responsibility of them, and the responsibility of delivering
   him from them. A relation to God in which sin has nothing to say, but
   which is summed up in Christ and His perfect Atonement for sin -- in
   John Wesley's words, full salvation now -- is the burden of the gospel.
   If it is not easy to believe this or to preach it, it is because, as
   the heavens are higher than the earth, so are God's thoughts higher
   than our thoughts, and His ways than our ways. In the New Testament
   itself there is always something startling, something almost
   incredible, which breaks again and again on the soul with a sense of
   wonder, in the experience of reconciliation through the death of
   Christ. But it is this great gospel which is the gospel to win souls --
   this message of a sin-bearing, sin-expiating love, which pleads for
   acceptance, which takes the whole responsibility of the sinner
   unconditionally, with no preliminaries, if only he abandon himself to
   it. Only the preaching of full salvation now, as Wesley tells us -- and
   who knew better from experience than he? -- has any promise in it of
   revival.

   Further, preaching which would do justice to the Atonement must hold
   out in the gospel an assurance corresponding to the certainty of
   Christ's death and to the sin-bearing love demonstrated in it. Nothing
   is more characteristic of churches than their attitude to assurance,
   and the place they give it in their preaching and in their systems of
   doctrine. Speaking broadly, we may say that in the Romish church it is
   regarded as essentially akin to presumption; in the Protestant churches
   it is a privilege or a duty; but in the New Testament religion it is
   simply a fact. This explains the joy which, side by side with the sense
   of infinite obligation, is the characteristic note of apostolic
   Christianity. The great invincible certainty of the reconciling love of
   God, which even when we were enemies made peace for us, this underlies
   all things, embraces all things, makes all things work together for
   good to those who love God, makes us more than conquerors in all
   things; take away the certainty of it, and the New Testament temper
   expires. Joy in this certainty is not presumption; on the contrary, it
   is joy in the Lord, and such joy is the Christian's strength. It is the
   impulse and the hope of sanctification; and to deprecate it, and the
   assurance from which it springs, is no true evangelical humility, but a
   failure to believe in the infinite goodness of God, who in Christ
   removes our sins from us as far as the east is from the west, and
   plants our life in this eternal reconciling love. The New Testament
   spirit is not meant for our despair, but for our inspiration; that
   assurance of sin-bearing love, that sanctifying strength and gladness,
   are the type of genuine Christian life.

   We can understand and appreciate the motive which, both in the Romish
   and in the Protestant churches, has fostered in relation to assurance a
   temper which is not that of the New Testament, and which does not
   answer to the completeness and certainty of Christ's finished work. The
   motive is in both cases a desire to safeguard moral interests and to
   put a check upon self-deception. The Romish church safeguards moral
   interests by making justification and the new life identical: men are
   justified as, and only in proportion as, they are actually and morally
   renewed. The objection to this method is that the security is too good.
   An absolute justification is needed to give the sinner a start. He must
   have the certainty of no condemnation of being, without reserve or
   drawback right with God through God's gracious act in Christ, before he
   can begin to live the new life. As Chalmers put it with magnificent
   simplicity, What could I do if God did not justify the ungodly?' It is
   not by denying the gospel outright, from the very beginning, that we
   are to guard against the possible abuse of it. In the Protestant
   churches, on the other hand, the attempt to check presumption and to
   safeguard moral interests was usually made by laying stress on the
   proper kind of faith. The German Pietists, in opposition to a dead
   orthodoxy, in which faith had come to mean no more than the formal
   recognition of sound doctrine, spoke with emphasis of penitent faith,
   living faith, true faith, obedient faith, and so on. It is somewhat
   against qualifications like these that they are foreign to the New
   Testament. What they come to in practice is this: Before the mercy of
   God in Christ the propitiation can be available for you, O sinful man,
   you must have a sufficient depth of penitence, a sufficiently earnest
   desire for reconciliation and holiness, a sufficient moral sincerity;
   otherwise grace would only minister to sin. But such qualifications do
   infringe upon the graciousness of the gospel -- I mean on its absolute
   freeness -- as something to be explained out of the love of God and the
   necessity, not the merits, of men. Christ did not die for those who
   were sufficiently penitent. He is the propitiation for the whole world,
   and He bore the sins of all that all might believe and receive through
   Him repentance and remission. To try to take some preliminary security
   for the sinner's future morality before you make the gospel available
   for him is not only to strike at the root of assurance, it is to pay a
   very poor tribute to the power of the gospel. The truth is, morality is
   best guaranteed by Christ, and not by any precautions we can take
   before Christ gets a chance, or by any virtue that is in faith except
   as it unites the soul to Him. Now the Christ who is the object of faith
   is the Christ whose death is the Atonement, and the faith which takes
   hold of Christ as He is held out in the gospel conducts, if we may use
   such a figure, the virtue of the Atonement into the heart. The mercy of
   God which we welcome in it, and welcome as the first and last of
   spiritual realities with invincible assurance, is a mercy which has
   deep in the heart of it God's judgment upon sin; and such a mercy,
   absolutely free as it is, and able to evoke in sinful men a joy
   unspeakable and full of glory, can never foster either immorality or
   presumption. But when its certainty, completeness, and freeness are so
   qualified or disguised that assurance becomes suspect and joy is
   quenched, the Christian religion has ceased to be. [74]

   There is one other characteristic of the Atonement which ought to be
   reflected in gospel preaching as determined by it, and which may for
   want of a better word be described as its finality. Christ died for
   sins once for all, and the man who believes in Christ and in His death
   has his relation to God once for all determined not by sin but by the
   Atonement. The sin for which a Christian has daily to seek forgiveness
   is not sin which annuls his acceptance with God, and casts him back
   into the position of one who has never had the assurance of the
   pardoning mercy of God in Christ; on the contrary, that assurance ought
   to be the permanent element in his life. The forgiveness of sins has to
   be received again and again as sin emerges into act; but when the soul
   closes with Christ the propitiation, the assurance of God's love is
   laid at the foundation of its being once for all. It is not to isolated
   acts it refers, but to the personality; not to sins, but to the sinner;
   not to the past only, in which wrong has been done, but to time and
   eternity. There will inevitably be in the Christian life experiences of
   sinning and being forgiven, of falling and being restored. But the
   grace which forgives and restores is not some new thing, nor is it
   conditioned in some new way. It is not dependent upon penitence, or
   works, or merit of ours; it is the same absolutely free grace which
   meets us at the Cross. From first to last, it is the blood of Jesus,
   God's Son, which cleanses from sin. The daily pardon, the daily
   cleansing, are but the daily virtue of that one all-embracing act of
   mercy in which, while we were yet sinners, we were reconciled to God by
   the death of His Son.

   To say that there is no gospel without Atonement, and that the
   characteristics of the Atonement must be impressed upon Christian
   preaching and reflected in the completeness, assurance, and joy of the
   Christian life which is the response to it, does not mean that the
   preacher is always to be expressly and formally engaged with the death
   of Christ, nor does it determine in what way that death in its
   redeeming significance is to be presented to men. It is impossible to
   forget the example of our Lord, though we are bound to remember that
   what was natural and inevitable before the Passion and the Resurrection
   may not be either wise or natural now. But looking to the gospels, we
   cannot but see that our Lord allowed His disciples every opportunity to
   become acquainted with Him, and to grow into confidence in Him, before
   He began to teach them about His death. He allowed them to catch the
   impression of His Personality before He initiated them into the mystery
   of His Passion. As for outsiders, He seems not to have spoken to them
   on the subject at all. Yet it would be a mistake, as we have seen, to
   suppose that the death of Jesus was not present -- in His mind and in
   His life -- even where nothing was said of it. The more we study the
   gospels, and the more thoroughly we appreciate such incidents as the
   Baptism, the Temptation, and the Transfiguration, with the heavenly
   voices attendant on them -- not to mention the occasions on which His
   death rises even in early days to the surface of our Lord's mind -- the
   more we shall be convinced that the sense and the power of it pervade
   everything we know of Him. He lived in the same spirit in which He
   died, and in a true sense we are in contact with the Passion and the
   Atonement whenever we are in contact with the soul of Jesus. To preach
   the gospels, therefore, it may be said, is to preach the gospel. On the
   other hand we must; remember, and allow the remembrance its full weight
   as a directory for teaching and preaching, that a time came when Jesus
   set Himself deliberately, systematically, and with unwearied
   reiteration to bring home to His disciples the meaning of His death.
   Everything conspires to make us see how deeply it moved Him, and how
   deeply He was concerned to have it apprehended by the disciples as what
   it was. The very names by which He names it -- My baptism, My cup; the
   profound virtue He ascribes to it as a ransom, and as the basis of a
   new covenant between God and man; the striking ordinances of baptism
   and the Supper which He associated with it, and which in spite of
   intelligible yet misconceived protests will guard its meaning while the
   world stands; all these separately, and still more in combination, warn
   us that whatever method may be prescribed in any given case by
   pedagogic considerations, it must not be one which leaves it optional
   to us to give the death of Christ a place in our gospel or not, as we
   please. It is as certain as anything can be that He meant us to be His
   debtors and to feel that we are so. He meant to represent Himself as
   the mediator between God and sinners, and to evoke in sinners an
   infinite sense of obligation to Himself as they realized that they had
   peace with God. And it always comes to this in the long-run. Men may
   come into contact with Christ at different places; they may approach
   Him from all quarters of the compass, under various impulses, yielding
   to a charm and constraint in Him as manifold as the beatitudes or as
   the gracious words and deeds of the gospel. But if they are in dead
   earnest as He is, they will come sooner or later to the strait gate;
   and the ultimate form the strait gate assumes -- for it is a gate that
   goes on straitening until the demand for death is made as the price of
   life -- is that to which Jesus leads up His disciples in His last
   lessons: are you willing to humble yourselves so as to owe to Me, and
   to My death for you, the forgiveness of sins and the life which is life
   indeed? There is a straight line from every point in the circumference
   of a circle to the center, and when we get to the quick of almost
   anything in the relations of men to Jesus, it leads with wonderful
   directness to this decisive point.

   A striking passage from Kierkegaard's diary may help to reconcile in
   our minds what seem to be conflicting assertions: the one, that there
   is no preaching of the gospel unless the Atonement is preached; the
   other, which, as we have seen, has a superficial support in the life
   and practice of Jesus, that the Atonement is the last thing in Christ
   to which the mind can be opened or reconciled. In general, Kierkegaard
   says, [75] the relation between God and man is represented thus: Christ
   leads us to God; man requires a mediator in order to have access to the
   Father.' But this, he argues, is not how the New Testament puts it. Nor
   can this by any possibility be the true way of putting it if, as he
   further argues, our relation to God is to become continually higher and
   more real; for it can only become such through a continual experience
   on our part of being more deeply humbled in God's presence. But there
   is no sense of being deeply humbled in the first stages of our
   religion. We begin, in short, with the Father, quite easily and
   naturally, and without any mediator. This and nothing else is the
   childlike way of beginning. For the child nothing is too high; he says
   Du to the Kaiser just as he does to his nurse, and finds it perfectly
   intelligible and proper that God should be his Father. It would have no
   meaning to him if he heard a voice which said, No man cometh unto the
   Father but by Me. ' But as soon as man has attained to a certain degree
   of maturity, God's greatness or sublimity, moral as well as
   metaphysical, becomes so overwhelming to him that it is no longer
   natural or easy to call Him Father. There is something presumptuous in
   it, or something quite unreal. Now this sense of the relation between
   himself and God, which grows upon man as his moral consciousness
   matures, is true, and there is that which answers to it in the mind of
   God Himself. Hence at this stage God points us to His Son, the
   Mediator. It is written in the prophets,' says Jesus (John 6:45),

   And they shall all be taught of God. Every one who has heard from the
   Father and has learned comes to Me.'

   This is the remedy for the presumption and unreality just referred to.
   It is as though God said: You must not assert or claim sonship in your
   own right; you must not take Fatherhood for granted; but through the
   Mediator I can be your Father. This, however, is not all. The Mediator
   also, like the Father at first, is apt to be taken for granted with the
   assurance of youth, if not of childhood. For the Mediator is at first
   conceived as example; it is in imitation of Him, in likeness to Him --
   to use the phrase which is most popular in our own day, and is charged
   to the full with this unreflecting youthful assurance, it is in self
   identification with Him -- that we must realize the Fatherhood of God.
   There is an amiable youthfulness, says Kierkegaard, the token of which
   is that it finds nothing too high for it. It seems to it quite natural
   and becoming that it should have such an infinitely lofty example as
   Jesus, the Son of God; among its amiable illusions is to be counted a
   pious conviction that it is within its power to attain to this example;
   it takes for granted that the example and he who is striving to follow
   it are in such a sense of one kind that nothing can really come between
   them. But once more, as the moral consciousness matures, a change
   comes. The example towers to such a height before man's eyes -- the
   sinless Son of God is so remote and inaccessible in His sinlessness and
   sonship -- that man can no longer think of imitating it, or of trying
   to do so, in the independent style of good comradeship. He cannot take
   it for granted that he can make himself what Christ is: that he can
   identify' himself with Christ offhand, simply because he wants to do
   so. And Christ, too, is of this opinion; it is another and a more
   dependent relation, with a deeper sense of obligation in it, which He
   requires from His followers. The example has another side, of which
   amiable and aspiring youth is at first ignorant: He is also the
   Reconciler. This it is which brings us to the point. Partly,
   Kierkegaard argues, there is a stage in life -- the stage of amiable
   and aspiring youth -- which is without the moral categories necessary
   for appreciating the example; it does not see, feel, nor understand how
   Christ transcends all that it is, and how He must in some profound way
   be of another as well as of the same nature; partly, he thinks, it has
   an illusory conception of its own powers, and of what it is in it to
   be. But whatever the reason, the fact remains; experience reveals to
   one who is trying to imitate Jesus, or to identify himself with Him,
   that he needs reconciliation first: he must become debtor to Jesus for
   this one thing needful before he can have a sound start in the final
   life. He must owe it to Christ as Reconciler, and owe it from the very
   beginning, if he is ever to stand in the relation of a son to the
   Father. He may think at first that he can identify himself with the Son
   of God at any point over the whole area of his life, but he discovers
   experimentally that this is not so. He finds out in a way surer than
   any logical demonstration that Christ is in the last resort as
   inaccessible to him as the God to whom he would draw near by imitating
   Christ, and that the only hope he has of getting to God in this way
   depends upon Christ's making Himself one with him in that
   responsibility for sin which separates him from the Father. His one
   point of contact with Christ, when his whole situation is seriously
   taken, is Christ's character as a propitiation for sin; and sooner or
   later he is driven in upon that.

   The type of experience here described may be common enough in Christian
   lands, but what, it may be asked, is its relation to such a practice as
   St. Paul describes in 1 Corinthians 15:3: I delivered unto you first of
   all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according
   to the Scriptures?' Is this consistent with what has just been said, or
   with what we have seen of our Lord's method of teaching? Is there a
   rule in it for all evangelistic preaching?

   St. Paul's expression, en protois, is not quite so pointed as first of
   all.' It is certainly to be taken, however, in a temporal sense: among
   the first things the apostle transmitted to the Corinthians were the
   fundamental facts of the Christian religion, the death and resurrection
   of Jesus in the significance which belonged to them according to the
   Scriptures, ' that is, in the light of the earlier revelation. And
   among these first things the death of Christ in its relation to sin had
   a foremost place. It is, I think, a fair inference from this that in
   preaching the gospel the main appeal is to be made to the conscience,
   and that it cannot be made too soon, too urgently, too desperately, or
   too hopefully. It is because the Atonement is at once the revelation of
   sin and the redemption from sin, that it must inspire everything in
   preaching which is to bring home to the conscience either conviction of
   sin or the hope and assurance of deliverance from it. Eternity,'
   Halyburton said, is wrapt up in every truth of religion'; the
   Atonement, it is not too much to say, is wrapt up in every truth of the
   Christian religion, and should be sensible through every word of the
   Christian preacher. In this sense at least it must be delivered en
   protois.

   We may begin as wisely as we please with those who have a prejudice
   against it, or whose conscience is asleep, or who have much to learn
   both about Christ and about themselves before they will consent to look
   at such a gospel, to say nothing of abandoning themselves to it; but if
   we do not begin with something which is essentially related to the
   Atonement, presupposing it or presupposed by it or involved in it,
   something which leads inevitably, though it may be by an indirect and
   unsuspected route, to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the
   world, we have not begun to the gospel at all. This may seem a hard
   saying to those who have listened to weariness to the repetition of
   orthodox formulae on this subject, and have realized that even under
   the New Covenant there are conditions which compel us to say, The
   letter killeth. But it is not because the formulae are orthodox that
   they weary, it is because they are formal; the vital interest of the
   great realities which they enshrine has slipped from an unbelieving
   grasp, and left the preacher with nothing to deliver but words. A fresh
   realization of the truth which they embody would bring new words or put
   new life into the old; and in any case the fact remains that there is
   nothing which is so urgently and immediately wanted by sinful men,
   nothing which strikes so deep into the heart, which answers so
   completely to its need, and binds it so irrevocably and with such a
   sense of obligation to God, as the atoning death of Jesus. Implicit or
   explicit, it is the Alpha and Omega of Christian preaching.

   Most preachers in any sympathy with this line of thought have deplored
   in the present or the last generation the decay of the sense of sin.
   [76] Now, the Atonement is addressed to the sense of sin. It
   presupposes the bad conscience. Where there is no such thing, it is
   like a lever without a fulcrum; great as its power might be, it is
   actually powerless, and often provokes resentment. The phenomenon is a
   curious one, and though it cannot be permanent, it calls for
   explanation. Possibly the explanation is partly to be found in the
   circumstance that the Atonement itself was once preached too much as
   though it had relation only to the past, and had no assurance or
   guarantee in it for man's future. It contained the forgiveness of sins,
   but not the new life. Where this was the case we can understand that it
   ceased to be interesting to those whose hearts were set on holiness. We
   can understand how Bushnell could speak of the forgiveness of sins as
   only a kind of formality, or verbal discharge, that carries practically
   no discharge at all. ' But it is not easy to understand how this could
   be brought into any kind of relation to the New Testament. There, as we
   have seen, the forgiveness of sins, and the Atonement which is its
   ground, are no formality. They are the supreme miracle of revelation,
   the hardest, most incredible, most wonderful work of the God who alone
   does wondrous things; the whole promise and potency of the new life are
   to be found in them alone. The Atonement, or God's justification of the
   ungodly, which takes effect with the acceptance of the Atonement,
   regenerates, and there is no regeneration besides. But while a
   defective appreciation of the New Testament may have done something to
   discredit the Atonement, and to make men think of forgiveness, and of
   the sense of sin which demands it, as alike formalities' in contrast
   with actual sanctification, the deadening of conscience is probably to
   be traced on the whole to other causes. It is due in great part to the
   dominance in the mind for the last forty or fifty years of the
   categories of natural science, and especially of a naturalistic theory
   of evolution. All things have been naturalized,' if we may so speak;
   the spiritual being no longer retains, in the common consciousness, his
   irreducible individuality; he has lapsed to some extent into the vast
   continuity of the universe. Even to speak of the individual is to use
   language which is largely unreal, and with individuality individual
   responsibility has lost credit. It is the race which lives, and it is
   the qualities and defects of the race which are exhibited in what we
   call the virtues and vices of men. When we look at the lives of others,
   the last thing we now think of is the responsibility which attaches to
   each of them for being what he is; and it is apt to be the last thing
   also which we think of when we look at ourselves. Heredity and
   environment -- these are the dominant realities in our minds; and so
   inevitable, so importunate is their pressure, that what was once known
   as freedom passes out of view. We are afraid to speak as the Bible
   speaks about personal responsibility -- we are afraid to say the
   tremendous things it says about sin and sinful men -- both because we
   would not be unjust to others, and because we wish to be considerate to
   ourselves. For the same reason we are afraid to give that decisive
   importance to the atoning death of Christ which it carries in the New
   Testament. But of one thing we may be certain: sooner or later there
   will be a reaction against this mental condition. When our sense of the
   unity of the race in itself, and of its unity with the nature' which is
   the theater of its history, has done its work -- when the social
   conscience has been quickened -- when the feeling of corporate
   responsibility has attained adequate intensity, so that the duties of
   society to the individual shall be no longer overlooked, the
   responsibility of the individual will come back in new strength. The
   naturalistic view of the world cannot permanently suppress the moral
   one. Even while it has seemed to threaten it, it has been preparing for
   its revival in a more profound and adequate form. The sense of personal
   responsibility, when it does come back, will be less confined, more
   far-reaching and mysterious; it will be more than ever such a sense of
   responsibility as will make the doctrine of a divine atonement for sin
   necessary, credible, and welcome.

   Meanwhile, surely, the preaching of the atonement has something to do
   with producing the very state of mind on which its reception depends.
   It is the highest truth of revelation; and the highest truth is like
   the highest poetry -- it has to generate the intellectual and moral
   atmosphere in which alone it can be appreciated and taken to the heart.
   To say that there is no sense of sin, or that the sense of sin is
   defective, is only to say in other words that there is no repentance,
   or no adequate repentance; no returning of the mind upon itself deeply
   enough, humbly enough, tenderly and hopefully enough, to have any
   healing or restoring effect. But how is this spiritual condition to be
   altered? What is the cure for it? There are those who cannot be
   convinced that any cure is necessary. In spite of all Christian
   confession to the contrary, they cling to the idea that such a
   returning of the mind upon itself as would constitute repentance unto
   life and be the proper condition of pardon and acceptance with God, is
   an experience which the sinful soul can produce out of its own
   resources, and clothed in which it can come hopefully to meet God. But
   true repentance -- that is, repentance which is not self-centered, but
   which realizes that sin is something in which God has an interest as
   well as we; repentance which is not merely a remorseful or apathetic or
   despairing regret, but a hopeful, healing, sanctifying sorrow -- such
   repentance is born of the knowledge of God, and of what God has done
   for us in our sins. It is not a preliminary to the Atonement, nor a
   substitute for it, nor a way in which we can be reconciled to God
   without being indebted to it; it is its fruit. It is born at the Cross
   where we see sin put away, not by our own regret, however sincere and
   profound, but by the love of God in the Passion of His dear Son. Hence
   we lose the only chance of seeing it, and of seeing in its true
   intensity the sense of individual responsibility which is part and
   parcel of it, if we give the Atonement anything less than the central
   place in our preaching. No one is really saved from sin until he has in
   relation to it that mind which Christ had when He bore our sins in His
   own body on the tree. And no motive is potent enough to generate that
   mind in sinful men but the love with which Christ loved us when He so
   gave Himself for us. It is true to say that the Atonement presupposes
   conscience and appeals to it, but it is truer still to say that of all
   powers in the world it is the supreme power for creating and deepening
   conscience. One remembers again and again the story of the first
   Moravian missionaries to Greenland, who, after twenty years of
   fruitless toil in indirect approaches to the savage mind, found it
   suddenly responsive to the appeal of the Cross. Probably St. Paul made
   no mistake when he delivered to the Corinthians en protois the message
   of the Atonement. No one can tell how near conscience is to the
   surface, or how quickly in any man it may respond to the appeal. We
   might have thought that in Corinth much preliminary sapping and mining
   would have been requisite before the appeal could be made with any
   prospect of success; but St. Paul judged otherwise, and preached from
   the very outset the great hope of the gospel, by which conscience is at
   once evoked and redeemed. We might think that in a Christian country
   conscience would be nearer the surface, more susceptible, more
   conscious of its needs, more quickly responsive to the appeal of the
   atonement; and if we do not always find it so, it is only, as St. Paul
   himself puts it, because all men have not faith. We cannot get behind
   this melancholy fact, and give the rationale of what is in itself
   irrational. Yet all experience shows that the gospel wins by its
   magnitude, and that the true method for the evangelist is to put the
   great things in the forefront. If this is not the way to the
   conscience, this sublime demonstration of the love of God in Christ, in
   which our responsibility as sinful men is taken by Him in all its
   dreadful reality and made His own, what is? In what, if not in this,
   can we find the means of appealing to all men, and to that which is
   deepest in all?

   One other characteristic ought to distinguish evangelical preaching, as
   preaching determined by the Atonement, it ought to have a deep
   impression of the absoluteness of the issues in faith and unbelief, or
   let us say in the acceptance or rejection of the reconciliation. In one
   way, it may be said, this is always the note of religion. It is a form
   of the absolute consciousness, and deals not with a sliding scale but
   with the blank, unqualified antithesis of life or death, weal or woe,
   salvation or perdition, heaven or hell. This is true, yet of no
   religion is it more emphatically true than of that which is exhibited
   in the New Testament. It is a life and death matter we are concerned
   with when we come face to face with Christ and with what He has done
   for us. It is quite possible to preach with earnestness, and even with
   persuasiveness, from another standpoint. It is quite possible to have a
   very sincere admiration for goodness, and a very sincere desire to be
   better men than we are and to see others better; it is quite possible
   even to see the charm and beauty of Christ's goodness, and to commend
   it in the most winning way to men, and yet to want in preaching the
   very note which is characteristic both of Christ and the apostles.
   Christ knew that He was to give His life a ransom; the apostles knew
   that He had done it, and had made peace through the blood of His Cross;
   and their preaching, though it is never overbearing or unjust, though
   it never tries to intimidate men, or (as one may sometimes have been
   tempted to think in a mission service) to bully them into faith, is as
   urgent and passionate as the sense of the atoning death can make it. To
   receive the reconciliation, or not to receive it -- to be a Christian,
   or not to be a Christian -- is not a matter of comparative
   indifference; it is not the case of being a somewhat better man, or a
   man, perhaps, not quite so good; it is a case of life or death. It is
   difficult to speak of this as it ought to be spoken of, and to urge it
   in any given situation may easily expose the preacher to the charge of
   intolerance, uncharitableness, or moral blindness; but difficult as it
   may be to preach the gospel in the spirit of the gospel, with a sense
   at the same time of the infinite love which is in it, and the infinite
   responsibility which it puts upon us, it is not a difficulty which the
   preacher's vocation will allow him to evade. He may easily be
   represented as saying that he is making the acceptance of his own
   theology the condition of acceptance with God, and arrogating to
   himself the right to judge others; but while he repudiates such charges
   as inconsistent with his whole relation both to God and man, he will
   not abandon his conviction that the apostolic sense of the infinite
   consequences determined by man's relation to the gospel is justified,
   and that it is justified because it is in harmony with all that the New
   Testament teaches about: the finished work of Christ. God has spoken
   His last word in His Son; He has done all that He can do for men;
   revelation and redemption are complete, and the finality on which the
   Epistle to the Hebrews lays such emphasis as characteristic of
   everything belonging to the new covenant ought to have an echo in every
   proclamation of it. If therefore we are conscious that this note is
   wanting in our preaching -- that it fails in urgency and entreaty --
   that it is expository merely, or attractive, or hortatory -- that it is
   interpretative or illuminative, or has the character of good advice,
   very good advice indeed, when we come to think of it, -- it is probably
   time to ask what place in it is held by the Atonement. The proclamation
   of the finished work of Christ is not good advice, it is good news,
   good news that means immeasurable joy for those who welcome it,
   irreparable loss for those who reject it, infinite and urgent
   responsibility for all. The man who has this to preach has a gospel
   about which he ought to be in dead earnest just because there is
   nothing which concentrates in the same way the judgment and the mercy
   of God, there is nothing which has the same power to evoke seriousness
   and passion in the preacher.

   Leaving out of account its importance to the sinner, the supreme
   interest of the doctrine of the Atonement is, of course, its interest
   for the evangelist; without a firm grasp of it he can do nothing
   whatever in his vocation. But what is central in religion must be
   central also in all reflection upon it, and the theologian no less than
   the evangelist must give this great truth its proper place in his mind.
   I have no intention of outlining a system of theology in which the
   atonement made in the death of Christ should be the determinative
   principle; but short of this, it is possible to indicate its bearing
   and significance in regard to some vital questions.

   For example, if we have been correct in our appreciation of its place
   in the New Testament, it is not too much to say that as the focus of
   revelation it is the key to all that precedes. It may not always be
   historically true, but it will always be divinely true -- that is, it
   will answer to God's mind as we can see it now, if not as it was
   apprehended from stage to stage in the history of revelation -- if we
   let the light of the final revelation of the New Testament fall all
   along upon the Old. The nature of the unity which belongs to Scripture
   has always been a perplexing question -- so perplexing, indeed, that
   the very existence of any unity at all has been denied; yet there is an
   answer to it. Scripture converges upon the doctrine of the Atonement;
   it has the unity of a consentient testimony to a love of God which
   bears the sin of the world. How this is done we do not see clearly
   until we come to Christ, or until He comes to us; but once we get this
   insight from Him, we get it for revelation as a whole. To Him bear all
   the Scriptures witness; and it is as a testimony to Him, the Bearer of
   sin, the Redeemer who gave His life a ransom for us, that we
   acknowledge them. This is the burden of the Bible, the one fundamental
   omnipresent truth to which the Holy Spirit bears witness by and with
   the word in our hearts. This, at bottom, is what we mean when we say
   that Scripture is inspired.

   It is worth while to insist on this in view of the widespread confusion
   which prevails in regard to inspiration; the apparent readiness, on the
   part of some, to give it up as an insignificant or irrelevant idea, if
   not an utterly discredited one; and the haphazard attempts, on the part
   of others, to save it piece meal, after abandoning it as a whole. The
   truth is, the unity of the Bible and its inspiration are correlative
   terms. If we can discover a real unity in it -- as I believe we can and
   do when we see that it converges upon and culminates in a divine love
   bearing the sin of the world -- then that unity and its inspiration are
   one and the same thing. And it is not only inspired as a whole, it is
   the only book in the world which is inspired. It is the only book in
   the world to which God sets His seal in our hearts when we read in
   search of an answer to the question, How shall a sinful man be
   righteous with God? It is mere irrelevance and misunderstanding to talk
   in this connection of the inspiration' of great minds like Aeschylus or
   Plato, not to speak of those who have been born and bred in the
   Christian atmosphere, like Dante or Shakespeare. We do not believe in
   inspiration because we find something in Isaiah which we do not find in
   Aeschylus -- though we do; nor because we find something in St. Paul
   which we do not find in Plato -- though again, and more emphatically,
   we do; we believe in inspiration because in the whole Bible, from
   Isaiah to St. Paul, and earlier and later, there is a unity of mind and
   spirit and purpose which shines out on us at last in the atoning work
   of Christ. When we approach the greatest of human minds with the
   problem of religion, How shall a sinful man be just with God? we shall,
   no doubt, find sympathy, for the problem of religion is a universal
   problem; we find sympathy, for instance, of the profoundest in writers
   like Aeschylus and Sophocles. But when we approach Scripture with this
   problem, we not only find sympathy, but a solution; and with the
   solution is identified all that we mean by inspiration. All the
   suggestions of the Bible with reference to this problem converge upon
   the Cross. The Cross dominates everything. It interprets everything. It
   puts all things in their true relations to each other. Usually those
   who are perplexed about the inspiration of the Bible discuss their
   difficulties with no consideration of what the Bible means as a whole;
   and yet it is only as a whole that we can attach any meaning to its
   being inspired. There is no sense in saying that every separate
   sentence is inspired: we know that every separate sentence is not.
   There are utterances of bad men in the Bible, and suggestions of the
   devil. Neither is there any sense in going through the Bible with a
   blue pencil, and striking out what is not inspired that we may stand by
   the rest. This may have the apologetic or educational advantage of
   compelling some people to see that after all abatements are made there
   is a great deal which retains its authority, and imposes
   responsibility; but it is precarious and presumptuous in the highest
   degree. And though it may have the appearance of greater plausibility,
   it is just as futile to attempt to graduate the inspiration of
   Scripture, to mark the ebb and flow of the divine presence in the heart
   of a writer, or the gradual rise of the tide from the remote beginnings
   of revelation until it reaches its height in Christ. No doubt it is a
   task for the historian to trace the gradual progress of revelation and
   to indicate its stages, but the historian would be the first to
   acknowledge that the questions so often raised about the inspiration of
   persons or books or sentences or arguments are mostly unreal. We will
   never know what inspiration is until Scripture has resolved itself for
   us into a unity. That unity, I venture to say, will be its testimony to
   a love in God which we do not earn, which we can never repay, but which
   in our sins comes to meet us with mercy, dealing, nevertheless, with
   our sins in all earnest, and at infinite cost doing right by God's holy
   law in regard to them; a love which becomes incarnate in the Lamb of
   God bearing the sin of the world, and putting it away by the sacrifice
   of Himself. It is in its testimony to this that the unity of Scripture
   and its inspiration consists, and whoever believes in this believes in
   inspiration in the only sense which can be rationally attached to the
   word.

   The doctrine of the atonement, in the central place which Scripture
   secures for it, has decisive importance in another way: it is the
   proper evangelical foundation for a doctrine of the Person of Christ.
   To put it in the shortest possible form, Christ is the person who can
   do this work for us. This is the deepest and most decisive thing we can
   know about Him, and in answering the questions which it prompts we are
   starting from a basis in experience. There is a sense in which Christ
   as the Reconciler confronts us. He is doing the will of God on our
   behalf, and we can only look on. It is the judgment and the mercy of
   God in relation to our sins which we see in Him, and His Presence and
   work on earth are a divine gift, a divine visitation. He is the gift of
   God to men, not the offering of men to God, and God gives Himself to us
   in and with Him. We owe to Him all that we call divine life. On the
   other hand, this divine visitation is made, and this divine life is
   imparted, through a life and work which are truly human. The presence
   and work of Jesus in the world, even the work of bearing sin, does not
   prompt us to define human and divine by contrast with each other: there
   is no suggestion of incongruity between them. Nevertheless, they are
   both there, and the fact that they are both there justifies us in
   raising the question as to Jesus' relation to God on the one hand, and
   to men on the other. We become sensible, as we contemplate this divine
   visitation, this achievement of a work so necessary to man yet so
   transcending his powers, that Jesus is not in the human race one man
   more to whom our relation may be as fortuitous as to any other. Rather
   does the whole phenomenon justify us in putting such a question as
   Dale's: What must Christ's relation to men be in order to make it
   possible that He should die for them? -- a question leading to an
   essentially evangelical argument, that Christ must have had an original
   and central relation to the human race and to every member of it.
   Whether this is the best way to express the conclusion need not here be
   considered, but that this is the final way to approach the problem is
   not open to doubt.

   In this connection I venture to emphasize again a point referred to at
   the close of the first chapter. It is the doctrine of the Atonement
   which secures for Christ His place in the gospel, and which makes it
   inevitable that we should have a Christology or a doctrine of His
   Person. Reduced to the simplest religious expression, the doctrine of
   the Atonement signifies that we owe to Christ and to His finished work
   our whole being as Christians. We are His debtors, and it is a real
   debt; a debt infinite, never to be forgotten, never to be discharged.
   The extraordinary statement of Harnack -- as extraordinary, perhaps, in
   its ambiguity as in its daring -- that in the gospel as Jesus preached
   it the Son has no place but only the Father, owes whatever plausibility
   it has under the most favorable construction to the assumption that in
   the gospel as Jesus preached it there is no such thing as an atoning
   work of Jesus. Jesus did nothing in particular by which men become His
   debtors; He only showed in His own life what the state of the case was
   between God and men, quite apart from anything He did or had to do. He
   was the personal realization and the power of the gospel, and is ever
   again experienced as such.' One might be tempted to criticize this from
   Kierkegaard's point of view, and to urge that it betrays no adequate
   appreciation of the gulf between Christ and sinful men, and of the
   dreadful difficulty of bridging it; but it is sufficient to say that it
   departs so widely not only from the consciousness of primitive
   Christianity as it is reflected in the epistles, but from the mind of
   Christ as we have seen cause to interpret it through the gospels, that
   it is impossible to assent to it. Christ not only was something in the
   world, He did something. He did something that made an infinite
   difference, and that puts us under an infinite obligation: He bore our
   sins. That secures His place in the gospel and in the adoration of the
   church. That is the impulse and the justification of all Christologies.
   Harnack's statement, quoted above, is meant to give a religious
   justification for lightening the ship of the church by casting
   Christological controversy overboard; but the Atonement always says to
   us again, Consider how great this Man was! As long as it holds; its
   place in the preaching of the gospel, and asserts itself in the church,
   as it does in the New Testament, as the supreme inspiration to praise,
   so long will Christians find in the Person of their Lord a subject of
   high and reverent thought. It is a common idea that Socinianism (or
   Unitarianism) is specially connected with the denial of the
   Incarnation. It began historically with the denial of the Atonement. It
   is with the denial of the Atonement that it always begins anew, and it
   cannot be too clearly pointed out that to begin here is to end, sooner
   or later, with putting Christ out of the Christian religion altogether.

   It is the more necessary to insist on this point of view because there
   is in some quarters a strong tendency to put the Atonement out of its
   place, and to concentrate attention on the Incarnation as something
   which can be appreciated in entire independence of it. The motives for
   this are various. Sometimes they may not unfairly be described as
   speculative. The great aim of the Christian Platonists,' says Mr. Inge,
   was to bring the Incarnation into closest relation with the cosmic
   process. It need hardly be said that no Christian philosophy can have
   any value which does not do this.' [77] Those, therefore, whose
   interest is in the cosmic process, or in articulating all that is known
   as Christian into the framework of the universe, devote their attention
   to the Person of Christ, and seek in it the natural consummation, so to
   speak, of all that has gone before. Without that Person the universe
   would be without a crown or a head. It is so constituted that only He
   gives it unity and completeness. That its unity had been broken before
   He came to earth, and that He completed it by a work of reversal and
   not of direct evolution -- -a work which, however truly it may be said
   to have carried out the original idea of God, is yet in the strictest
   sense supernatural, a redemption, not a natural consummation -- is
   practically overlooked. With others, again, the motive may be said to
   be ethical. To put the Atonement at the foundation of Christianity
   seems to them to narrow it morally in the most disastrous way. It is as
   though they lost the breadth and variety of interest and motive which
   appeal to the conscience from the life of Christ in the pages of the
   evangelists. But there is a misconception here. Those who make the
   Atonement fundamental do not turn their backs on the gospels. They are
   convinced, however, that the whole power of the motives which appeal to
   us from the life of Jesus is not felt until we see it condensed,
   concentrated, and transcended in the love in which He bore our sins in
   His own body on the tree. Others displace the Atonement for what may be
   called a dogmatic reason. It is a fixed point with them that so great a
   thing as the Incarnation could not be in any proper sense contingent;
   the presence of the Son of God in the world cannot be an after-thought'
   or an accident'; the whole intent of it cannot be given in such an
   expression as remedial.' The universe must have been constituted from
   the first with a view to it, and it would have taken place all the same
   even though there had been no sin and no need for redemption. When it
   did take place, indeed, it could not be exactly as had been intended;
   under the conditions of the fall, the Incarnation entailed a career
   which meant Atonement; it was Incarnation into a sinful race, and the
   Atonement was made when the Son of God accepted the conditions which
   sin had determined, and fulfilled man's destiny under them. Perhaps the
   truth might be put within the four corners of such a formula, but the
   tendency in those who adopt this point of view is to minimize all that
   is said in the New Testament about the death of Christ in relation to
   sin. The specific assertions and definitions of the apostolic writings
   are evaded. They are interpreted emotionally but not logically, as if
   the men who say the strong things on this subject in the New Testament
   had said them without thinking, or would have been afraid of their own
   thoughts. The most distinguished representative of this tendency in our
   own country was Bishop Westcott. Not that what has just been said is
   applicable in its entirety to him; but the assumption that the
   Incarnation is something which we can estimate apart from the
   Atonement, something which has a significance and a function of its
   own, independent of man's redemption from sin, underlies much of his
   writing, and tends to keep him from doing full justice to apostolic
   ideas on this subject. The logic of the position becomes apparent in a
   writer like Archdeacon Wilson, who frankly merges the Atonement in the
   Incarnation, assures us that in making a distinct problem of the former
   we have been asking meaningless questions, getting meaningless answers,
   and repelling men from the gospel. Let us say boldly that the
   Incarnation, that is the life and death of the Christ, for the life and
   death were equally necessary -- is the identification of the human and
   the divine life. This identification is the atonement. There is no
   other.' [78] One can only regret that this short and easy method was
   not discovered until the close of the nineteenth century; anything less
   like the terrible problem sin presented to the apostles, and their
   intense preoccupation with it, it would not be easy to conceive.

   There are three broad grounds on which the interpretation of the
   Atonement as a mere incident, or consequence, or modification of the
   Incarnation -- the Incarnation being regarded as something in itself
   natural and intelligible on grounds which have no relation to sin,
   ought to be discounted by the evangelist and the theologian alike.

   (1) It shifts the center of gravity in the New Testament. The
   Incarnation may be the thought round which everything gravitates in the
   Nicene Creed, and in the theology of the ancient Catholic Church which
   found in that creed its first dogmatic expression; but that only shows
   how far the first ecclesiastical apprehension of Christianity was from
   doing justice to New Testament conceptions. Even in the Gospel and the
   Epistles of St. John, as has been shown above, the Incarnation cannot
   be said (without serious qualification) to have the character here
   claimed for it, and it cannot be asserted with the faintest
   plausibility for the synoptic gospels or the Epistles of St. Paul. The
   New Testament knows nothing of an incarnation which can be defined
   apart from its relation to atonement; it is to put away sin, and to
   destroy the works of the devil, that even in the evangelist of the
   Incarnation the Son of God is made manifest. It is not in His being
   here, but in His being here as a propitiation for the sins of the
   world, that the love of God is revealed. Not Bethlehem, but Calvary, is
   the focus of revelation, and any construction of Christianity which
   ignores or denies this distorts Christianity by putting it out of
   focus.

   (2) A second ground for resisting the tendency to put the Incarnation
   into the place which properly belongs to the Atonement is that it is
   concerned under these conditions with metaphysical, rather than with
   moral problems. Now Scripture has no interest in metaphysics except as
   metaphysical questions are approached through and raised by moral ones.
   The Atonement comes to us in the moral world and deals with us there;
   it is concerned with conscience and the law of God, with sin and grace,
   with alienation and peace, with death to sin and life to holiness; it
   has its being and its efficacy in a world where we can find our
   footing, and be assured that we are dealing with realities. The
   Incarnation, when it is not defined by relation to these realities --
   in other words, when it is not conceived as the means to the Atonement,
   but as part of a speculative theory of the world quite independent of
   man's actual moral necessities -- can never attain to a reality as
   vivid and profound. It can never become thoroughly credible, just
   because it is not essentially related to anything in human or Christian
   experience sufficiently great to justify it. It does not answer moral
   questions, especially those which bring the sinful man to despair; at
   best it answers metaphysical questions about the relation of the human
   to the divine, about the proper way to define these words in relation
   to each other, whether it be by contrast or by mutual affinity, about
   the divine as being the truth of the human and the human as being the
   reality of the divine, and so forth. It does not contain a gospel for
   lost souls, but a philosophy for speculative minds. Now the New
   Testament is a gospel for lost souls, or it is nothing; and whatever
   philosophy it may lead to or justify, we cannot see that philosophy
   itself in the light in which it demands to be seen, unless we keep the
   gospel in its New Testament place. If we start in the abstract
   speculative way there is no getting out of it, or getting any
   specifically Christian good out of it either; it is only when the
   Person of Christ is conceived as necessarily related to a work in which
   we have a life and death moral interest, that it has religious import,
   and can be a real subject for us. There is in truth only one religious
   problem in the world -- the existence of sin; and one religious
   solution of it -- the Atonement, in which the love of God bears the
   sin, taking it, in all its terrible reality for us, upon itself. And
   nothing can be central or fundamental either in Christian preaching or
   in Christian thinking which is not in direct and immediate relation to
   this problem and its solution.

   (3) The third ground on which we should deprecate the obtrusion of the
   Incarnation at the cost of the Atonement is that in point of fact --
   whether it is an inevitable result or not need not be inquired -- it
   tends to sentimentality. It is dangerous to bring into religion
   anything which is not vitally related to morals, and Incarnation not
   determined by Atonement is open to this charge. The Christmas
   celebrations in many churches supply all the proof that is needed: they
   are an appeal to anything and everything in man except that to which
   the gospel is designed to appeal. The New Testament is just as little
   sentimental as it is metaphysical, it is ethical, not metaphysical;
   passionate, not sentimental. And its passionate and ethical character
   are condensed and guaranteed in that atoning work of Christ which is in
   every sense of the word its vital center.

   If it is a right conception of the Atonement which enables us to attain
   to a right conception of the Person of Christ, similarly we may say it
   is through a right conception of the Atonement that we come to a right
   conception of the nature or character of God. In the Atonement
   revelation is complete, and we must have it fully in view in all
   affirmations we make about God as the ultimate truth and reality. The
   more imperfect our conceptions of God, the more certainly they tend to
   produce skepticism and unbelief; and nothing presents greater
   difficulties to faith than the idea of a God who either gives no heed
   to the sin and misery of man, or saves sinners, as it were, from a
   distance, without entering into the responsibility and tragedy of their
   life and making it His own. To put the same thing in other words,
   nothing presents greater difficulties to faith than a conception of God
   falling short of that which the New Testament expresses in the words,
   God is love. Not that this conception is self-interpreting or
   selfaccrediting, as is often supposed. There is no proposition which is
   more in need both of explanation and of proof. We may say God is love,
   and know just as little what love means as what God means. Love is like
   every word of moral or spiritual import; it has no fixed meaning, like
   a word denoting a physical object or attribute; it stands, so to speak,
   upon a sliding scale, and it stands higher or lower as the experience
   of those who use it enables them to place it. St. John, when he placed
   it where he did, was only enabled to do so by the experience in which
   Christ was revealed to him as the propitiation for sins. It is with
   this in his mind that he says, Hereby perceive we love. The word love,
   especially in such a proposition as God is love, has to fill with its
   proper meaning before it can be said to have any meaning at all; it is
   used in a thousand senses which in such a proposition would only be
   absurd or profane. Now the person who first uttered that sublime
   sentence felt his words fill with meaning as he contemplated Christ
   sent by God a propitiation for the whole world. A God who could do that
   -- a God who could bear the sin of the world in order to restore to man
   the possibility of righteousness and eternal life -- such a God is
   love. Such love, too, is the ultimate truth about God. But apart from
   this the apostle would not have said that God is love, nor is it quite
   real or specifically Christian for any one else to say so. There is no
   adequate way of telling what he means. Until it is demonstrated as it
   is in the Atonement, love remains an indeterminate sentimental
   expression, with no clear moral value, and with infinite possibilities
   of moral misunderstanding; when it fills with meaning through the
   contemplation of the Atonement, the danger of mere sentimentalism and
   other moral dangers are provided against, for love in the Atonement is
   inseparable from law. The universal moral elements in the relations of
   God and man are unreservedly acknowledged, and it is in the cost at
   which justice is done to them in the work of redemption that the love
   of God is revealed and assured. We see then its reality and its scale.
   We see what it is willing to do, or rather what it has done. We see
   something of the breadth and length and depth and height which pass
   knowledge. We believe and know the love which God has in our case, and
   can say God is love. And it is from the vantage-ground of this
   assurance that we look out henceforth on all the perplexities of the
   world and of our own life in it. We are certain that it is in God to
   take the burden and responsibility of it upon Himself. We are certain
   that it is in the divine nature not to be indifferent to the tragedy or
   human life, not to help it from afar off, not to treat as unreal in it
   the very thing which makes it real to us -- the eternal difference of
   right and wrong -- but to bear its sin, and to establish the law in the
   very act and method of justifying the ungodly. It is a subordinate
   remark in this connection, but not for that reason an insignificant
   one, that this final revelation of love in God is at the same time the
   final revelation of sin: for sin, too, needs to be revealed, and there
   is a theological doctrine of it as well as an experience antecedent to
   all doctrines. Love is that which is willing to take the responsibility
   of sin upon it for the sinner's sake, and which does so; and sin, in
   the last resort -- sin as that which cuts man finally off from God --
   is that which is proof against the appeal of such love.

   There is another great department of Christian science to which the
   Atonement is of fundamental importance -- the department of Christian
   ethics, the scientific interpretation of the new life. It has
   undoubtedly been a fault in much systematic theology, that in dealing
   with the work which Christ finished in His death it has shown no
   relation, or no adequate and satisfactory relation, between that death
   and the Christian life which is born of faith in it. There must be such
   a relation, or there would be no such thing in the world as Christian
   life or the Christian religion. The only difficulty, indeed, in
   formulating it is that the connection is so close and immediate that it
   might be supposed to be impossible to hold apart, even in imagination,
   the two things which we wish to define by relation to each other. But
   it; may be put thus. The death of Christ, interpreted as the, New
   Testament interprets it, constitutes a great appeal to sinful men. It
   appeals for faith. To yield to its appeal, to abandon oneself in faith
   to the love of God which is manifested in it, is to enter into life. It
   is the only way in which a sinful man can enter into life at all. The
   new life is constituted in the soul by the response of faith to the
   appeal of Christ's death, or by Christ's death evoking the response of
   faith. It does not matter which way we put it. We may say that we have
   received the Atonement, and that the Atonement regenerates; or that we
   have been justified by faith, and that justification regenerates; or
   that we have received an assurance of God's love which is deeper than
   our sin, and extends to all our life past, present, and to come; and
   that such an assurance, which is the gift of the Spirit shed abroad in
   our hearts, regenerates: it is all one. It is the same experience which
   is described, and truly described, in every case. But both the power
   and the law of the new life, the initiation of which can be so
   variously expressed, are to be found in the atoning death of Christ, by
   which faith is evoked, and there only; and the Atonement, therefore, is
   the presupposition of Christian ethics as it is the inspiring and
   controlling force in Christian life. Nothing can beget in the soul that
   life of which we speak except the appeal of the Cross, and what the
   appeal of the Cross does beget is a life which, in its moral quality,
   corresponds to the death of Christ itself. It is a life, as it has been
   put already, which has that death in it, and which only lives upon this
   condition. It is a life to which sin is all that sin was to Christ --
   law, and holiness, and God, all that law and holiness and God were to
   Christ as He hung upon the tree; a life which is complete and
   self-sufficing, because it is sustained at every moment by the
   inspiration of the Atonement. This is why St. Paul is not afraid to
   trust the new life to its own resources, and why he objects equally to
   supplementing it by legal regulations afterwards, or by what are
   supposed to be ethical securities beforehand. It does not need them,
   and is bound to repel them as dishonoring to Christ. To demand moral
   guarantees from a sinner before you give him the benefit of the
   Atonement, or to impose legal restrictions on him after he has yielded
   to its appeal, and received it through faith, is to make the Atonement
   itself of no effect. St. Paul, taught by his own experience, scorned
   such devices. The Son of God, made sin for men, so held his eyes and
   heart, entered into His being with such annihilative, such creative
   power, that all he was and all he meant by life were due to Him alone.
   He does not look anywhere but to the Cross for the ideals and motives
   of the Christian, they are all there. And the more one dwells in the
   New Testament, and tries to find the point of view from which to reduce
   it to unity, the more is he convinced that the Atonement is the key to
   Christianity as a whole. The Son of Man came to give His life a ransom
   for many.' Christ died for the ungodly.' He bore our sins in His own
   body on the tree.' He is the propitiation for the whole world.' I
   beheld, and lo, a lamb as it had been slain.' It is in words like these
   that we discover the open secret of the new creation.

   [74] I venture to quote two sentences in illustration of this
   paragraph. Dr, Dale (Life, p. 666), who read Pusey's life with a deep
   impression of the nobleness and massiveness of his nature, and feeling
   more than ever that the power of God was with him,' had nevertheless to
   add: The absence of joy in his religious life was only the inevitable
   effect of his conception of God's method of saving men; in parting with
   the Lutheran truth concerning justification (it might equally well be
   said with the New Testament truth of Christ's finished work) he parted
   with the springs of gladness.' It is in the same line that Dr.
   Fairbairn has said of Pusey, that the sense of sin was more a matter
   for himself to bear than for grace to remove' (Philosophy of the
   Christian Religion, p. 333). The other sentence is from Chalmers, a
   great nature who had an original experience of the New Testament
   religion and often found original utterance for it: Regaled myself with
   the solidity of the objective part of religion, and long to enter a
   field of enlargement in preaching on the essential truths of the
   gospel' (Life, by Hanna, vol. 2. p. 417).

CHAPTER 7
The Atonement and the Modern Mind

   IT will be admitted by most Christians that if the Atonement, quite
   apart from precise definitions of it, is anything to the mind, it is
   everything. It is the most profound of all truths, and the most
   recreative. It determines more than anything else our conceptions of
   God, of man, of history, and even of nature; it determines them, for we
   must bring them all in some way into accord with it. It is the
   inspiration of all thought, the impulse and the law of all action, the
   key, in the last resort, to all suffering. Whether we call it a fact or
   a truth, a power or a doctrine, it is that in which the differentia of
   Christianity, its peculiar and exclusive character, is specifically
   shown; it is the focus of revelation, the point at which we see deepest
   into the truth of God, and come most completely under its power. For
   those who recognize it at all it is Christianity in brief; it
   concentrates in itself, as in a germ of infinite potency, all that the
   wisdom, power and love of God mean in relation to sinful men.

   Accordingly, when we speak of the Atonement and the modern mind, we are
   really speaking of the modern mind and the Christian religion. The
   relation between these two magnitudes may vary. The modern mind is no
   more than a modification of the human mind as it exists in all ages,
   and the relation of the modern mind to the Atonement is one phase -- it
   may be a specially interesting or a specially well-defined phase -- of
   the perennial relation of the mind of man to the truth of God. There is
   always an affinity between the two, for God made man in His own image,
   and the mind can only rest in truth; but there is always at the same
   time an antipathy, for man is somehow estranged from God, and resents
   divine intrusion into his life. This is the situation at all times, and
   therefore in modern times; we only need to remark that when the
   Atonement is in question, the situation, so to speak, becomes acute.
   All the elements in it define themselves more sharply. If there is
   sympathy between the mind and the truth, it is a profound sympathy,
   which will carry the mind far; if there are lines of approach, through
   which the truth can find access to the mind, they are lines laid deep
   in the nature of things and of men, and the access which the truth
   finds by them is one from which it will not easily be dislodged. On the
   other hand, if it is antagonism which is roused in the mind by the
   Atonement, it is an antagonism which feels that everything is at stake.
   The Atonement is a reality of such a sort that it can make no
   compromise. The man who fights it knows that he is fighting for his
   life, and puts all his strength into the battle. To surrender is
   literally to give up himself, to cease to be the man he is, and to
   become another man. For the modern mind, therefore, as for the ancient,
   the attraction and the repulsion of Christianity are concentrated at
   the same point; the cross of Christ is man's only glory, or it is his
   final stumbling- block.

   What I wish to do in the following pages is so to present the facts as
   to mediate, if possible, between the mind of our time and the Atonement
   -- so to exhibit the specific truth of Christianity as to bring out its
   affinity for what is deepest in the nature of man and in human
   experience -- so to appreciate the modern mind itself, and the
   influences which have given it its constitution and temper, as to
   discredit what is false in it, and enlist on the side of the Atonement
   that which is profound and true. And if any one is disposed to marvel
   at the ambition or the conceit of such a program, I would ask him to
   consider if it is not the program prescribed to every Christian, or at
   least to every Christian minister who would do the work of an
   evangelist. To commend the eternal truth of God, as it is finally
   revealed in the Atonement, to the mind in which men around us live and
   move and have their being, is no doubt a difficult and perilous task;
   but if we approach it in a right spirit, it need not tempt us to any
   presumption; it cannot tempt us, as long as we feel that it is our
   duty. Who is sufficient for these things? . . . Our sufficiency is of
   God.'

   The Christian religion is a historical religion, and whatever we say
   about it must rest upon historical ground. We cannot define it from
   within, by reference merely to our individual experience. Of course it
   is equally impossible to define it apart from experience; the point is
   that such experience itself must be historically derived; it must come
   through something outside of our individual selves. What is true of the
   Christian religion as a whole is pre-eminently true of the Atonement in
   which it is concentrated. The experience which it brings to us, and the
   truth which we teach on the basis of it, are historically mediated.
   They rest ultimately on that testimony to Christ which we find in the
   Scriptures and especially in the New Testament. No one can tell what
   the Atonement is except on this basis. No one can consciously approach
   it -- no one can be influenced by it to the full extent to which it is
   capable of influencing human nature -- except through this medium. We
   may hold that just because it is divine, it must be eternally true,
   omnipresent in its gracious power; but even granting this, it is not
   known as an abstract or eternal somewhat; it is historically, and not
   otherwise than historically, revealed. It is achieved by Christ, and
   the testimony to Christ, on the strength of which we accept it, is in
   the last resort the testimony of Scripture.

   In saying so, I do not mean that the Atonement is merely a problem of
   exegesis, or that we have simply to accept as authoritative the
   conclusions of scholars as to the meaning of New Testament texts. The
   modern mind here is ready with a radical objection. The writers of the
   New Testament, it argues, were men like ourselves; they had personal
   limitations and historical limitations; their forms of thought were
   those of a particular age and upbringing; the doctrines they preached
   may have had a relative validity, but we cannot so benumb our minds as
   to accept them without question. The intelligence which has learned to
   be a law to itself, criticizing, rejecting, appropriating,
   assimilating, cannot deny its nature and suspend its functions when it
   opened the New Testament. It cannot make itself the slave of men, not
   even though the men are Peter and Paul and John; no, not even though it
   were the Son of Man Himself. It resents dictation, not willfully nor
   wantonly, but because it must; and it resents it all the more when it
   claims to be inspired. If, therefore, the Atonement can only be
   received by those who are prepared from the threshold to acknowledge
   the inspiration and the consequent authority of Scripture, it can never
   be received by modern men at all.

   This line of remark is familiar inside the Church as well as outside.
   Often it is expressed in the demand for a historical as opposed to a
   dogmatic interpretation of the New Testament, a historical
   interpretation being one that which we can sit freely, because the
   result to which it leads us is the mind of a time which we have
   survived and presumably transcended; a dogmatic interpretation, on the
   other hand, being one which claims to reach an abiding truth, and
   therefore to have a present authority. A more popular and inconsistent
   expression of the same mood may be found among those who say petulant
   things about the rabbinizing of Paul, but profess the utmost devotion
   to the words of Jesus. Even in a day of overdone distinctions, one
   might point out that interpretations are not properly to be classified
   as historical or dogmatic, but as true or false. If they are false, it
   does not matter whether they are called dogmatic or historical; and if
   they are true, they may quite well be both. But this by the way. For my
   own part, I prefer the objection in its most radical form, and indeed
   find nothing in it to which any Christian, however sincere or profound
   his reverence for the Bible, should hesitate to assent. Once the mind
   has come to know itself, there can be no such thing for it as blank
   authority. It cannot believe things -- the things by which it has to
   live -- simply on the word of Paul or John. It is not irreverent, it is
   simply the recognition of a fact, if we add that it can just as little
   believe them simply on the word of Jesus. [79] This is not the sin of
   the mind, but the nature and essence of mind, the being which it owes
   to God. If we are to speak of authority at all in this connection, the
   authority must be conceived as belonging not to the speaker but to that
   which he says, not to the witness but to the truth. Truth, in short, is
   the only thing which has authority for the mind, and the only way in
   which truth finally evinces its authority is by taking possession of
   the mind for itself. It may be that any given truth can only be reached
   by testimony -- that is, can only come to us by some historical
   channel; but if it a truth of eternal import, if it is part of a
   revelation of God the reception of which is eternal life, then its
   authority lies in itself and in its power to win the mind, and not in
   any witness however trustworthy.

   Hence in speaking of the Atonement, whether in preaching or in
   theologizing, it is quite unnecessary to raise any question about the
   inspiration of Scripture, or to make any claim of authority, either for
   the Apostles or for the Lord. Belief in the inspiration of Scripture is
   neither the beginning of the Christian life nor the foundation of
   Christian theology; it is the last conclusion -- a conclusion which
   becomes every day more sure -- to which experience of the truth of
   Scripture leads. When we tell, therefore, what the Atonement is, we are
   telling it not on the authority of any person or persons whatever, but
   on the authority of the truth in it by which it has won its place in
   our minds and hearts. We find this truth in the Christian Scriptures
   undoubtedly, and therefore we prize them; but the truth does not derive
   its authority from the Scriptures, or from those who penned them. On
   the contrary, the Scriptures are prized by the Church because through
   them the soul is brought into contact with this truth. No doubt this
   leaves it open to any one who does not see in Scripture what we see, or
   who is not convinced as we are of its truth, to accuse us here of
   subjectivity, of having no standard of truth but what appeals to us
   individually, but I could never feel the charge a serious one. It is
   like urging that a man does not see at all, or does not see truly,
   because he only sees with his own eyes. This is the only authentic kind
   of seeing yet known to mankind. We do not judge at all those who do not
   see what we do. We do not know what hinders them, or whether they are
   at all to blame for it; we do not know how soon the hindrance is going
   to be put out of the way. Today, as at the beginning, the light shines
   in the darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not. But that is the
   situation which calls for evangelists; not a situation in which the
   evangelist is called to renounce his experience and his vocation.

   What, then, is the Atonement, as it is presented to us in the
   Scriptures, and vindicates for itself in our minds the character of
   truth, and indeed, as I have said already, the character of the
   ultimate truth of God?

   The simplest expression that can be given to it in words is: Christ
   died for our sins. Taken by itself, this is too brief to be
   intelligible; it implies many things which need to be made explicit
   both about Christ's relation to us and about the relation of sin and
   death. But the important thing, to begin with, is not to define these
   relations, but to look through the words to the broad reality which is
   interpreted in them. What they tell us, and tell us on the basis of an
   incontrovertible experience, is that the forgiveness of sins is for the
   Christian mediated through the death of Christ. In one respect,
   therefore, there is nothing singular in the forgiveness of sins: it is
   in the same position as every other blessing of which the New Testament
   speaks. It is the presence of a Mediator, as Westcott says in one of
   his letters, which makes the Christian religion what it is; and the
   forgiveness of sins is mediated to us through Christ, just as the
   knowledge of God as the Father is mediated, or the assurance of a life
   beyond death. But there is something specific about the mediation of
   forgiveness; the gift and the certainty of it come to us, not simply
   through Christ, but through the blood of His Cross. The sum of His
   relation to sin is that He died for it. God forgives, but this is the
   way in which His forgiveness comes. He forgives freely, but it is at
   this cost to Himself and to the Son of His love.

   This, it seems to me, is the simplest possible statement of what the
   New Testament means by the Atonement, and probably there are few who
   would dispute its correctness. But it is possible to argue that there
   is a deep cleft in the New Testament itself, and that the teaching of
   Jesus on the subject of forgiveness is completely at variance with that
   which we find in the Epistles, and which is implied in this description
   of the Atonement. Indeed there are many who do so argue. But to follow
   them would be to forget the place which Jesus has in His own teaching.
   Even if we grant that the main subject of that teaching is the Kingdom
   of God, it is as clear as anything can be that the Kingdom depends for
   its establishment on Jesus, or rather that in Him it is already
   established in principle; and that all participation in its blessings
   depends on some kind of relation to Him. All things have been delivered
   to Him by the Father, and it is by coming under obligation to Him, and
   by that alone, that men know the Father. It is by coming under
   obligation to Him that they know the pardoning love of the Father, as
   well as everything else that enters into Christian experience and
   constitutes the blessedness of life in the Kingdom of God. Nor is it
   open to any one to say that he knows this simply because Christ has
   told it. We are dealing here with things too great to be simply told.
   If they are ever to be known in their reality, they must be revealed by
   God, they must rise upon the mind of man experimentally, in their awful
   and glorious truth, in ways more wonderful than words. They can be
   spoken about afterwards, but hardly beforehand. They can be celebrated
   and preached -- that is, declared as the speakers experience, delivered
   as his testimony -- but not simply told. It was enough if Jesus made
   His disciples feel, as surely He did make them feel, not only in every
   word He spoke, but more emphatically still in His whole attitude toward
   them, that He was Himself the Mediator of the new covenant, and that
   all the blessings of the relation between God and man which we call
   Christianity were blessings due to Him. If men knew the Father, it was
   through Him. If they knew the Father's heart to the lost, it was
   through Him. Through Him, be it remembered, not merely through the
   words that He spoke. There was more in Christ than even His own
   wonderful words expressed, and all that He was and did and suffered, as
   well as what He said, entered into the convictions He inspired. But He
   knew this as well as His disciples, and for this very reason it is
   beside the mark to point to what He said, or rather to what He did not
   say, in confutation of their experience. For it is their experience --
   the experience that the forgiveness of sins was mediated to them
   through His cross that is expressed in the doctrine of Atonement: He
   died for our sins.

   The objection which is here in view is most frequently pointed by
   reference to the parable of the prodigal son. There is no Atonement
   here, we are told, no mediation of forgiveness at all. There is love on
   the one side and penitence on the other, and it is treason to the pure
   truth of this teaching to cloud and confuse it with the thoughts of men
   whose Master was over their heads often, but most of all here. Such a
   statement of the case is plausible, and judging from the frequency with
   which it occurs must to some minds be very convincing, but nothing
   could be more superficial, or more unjust both to Jesus and the
   apostles. A parable is a comparison, and there is a point of comparison
   in it on which everything turns. The more perfect the parable is, the
   more conspicuous and dominating will the point of comparison be. The
   parable of the prodigal illustrates this. It brings out, through a
   human parallel, with incomparable force and beauty, the one truth of
   the freeness of forgiveness. God waits to be gracious. His pardoning
   love rushes out to welcome the penitent. But no one who speaks of the
   Atonement ever dreams of questioning this. The Atonement is concerned
   with a different point -- not the freeness of pardon, about which all
   are agreed, but the cost of it; not the spontaneity of God's love,
   which no one questions, but the necessity under which it lay to
   manifest itself in a particular way if God was to be true to Himself,
   and to win the heart of sinners for the holiness which they had
   offended. The Atonement is not the denial that God's love is free; it
   is that specific manifestation or demonstration of God's free love
   which is demanded by the situation of men. One can hardly help
   wondering whether those who tell us so confidently that there is no
   Atonement in the parable of the prodigal have ever noticed that there
   is no Christ in it either -- no elder brother who goes out to seek and
   to save the lost son, and to give his life a ransom for him. Surely we
   are not to put the Good Shepherd out of the Christian religion. Yet if
   we leave Him His place, we cannot make the parable of the prodigal the
   measure of Christ's mind about the forgiveness of sins. One part of His
   teaching it certainly contains -- one part of the truth about the
   relation of God the Father to His sinful children; but another part of
   the truth was present, though not on that occasion rendered in words,
   in the presence of the Speaker, when all the publicans and sinners drew
   near to Him for to hear Him.' The love of God to the sinful was
   apprehended in Christ Himself, and not in what He said as something
   apart from Himself; on the contrary, it was in the identity of the
   Speaker and the word that the power of the word lay; God's love evinced
   itself to men as a reality in Him, in His presence in the world, and in
   His attitude to its sin, it so evinced itself, finally and supremely,
   in His death. It is not the idiosyncrasy of the apostle, it is the
   testimony of the Church, a testimony in keeping with the whole claim
   made by Christ in His teaching and life and death: in Him we have our
   redemption, through His blood, even the forgiveness of our trespasses.'
   And this is what the Atonement means: it means the mediation of
   forgiveness through Christ, and specifically through His death.
   Forgiveness, in the Christian sense of the term, is only realized as we
   believe in the Atonement: in other words, as we come to feel the cost
   at which alone the love of God could assert itself as divine and holy
   love in the souls of sinful men. We may say, if we please, that
   forgiveness is bestowed freely upon repentance; but we must add, if we
   would do justice to the Christian position, that repentance in its
   ultimate character is the fruit of the Atonement. Repentance is not
   possible apart from the apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ. It
   is the experience of the regenerate -- peonitentiam interpretor
   regenerationem, as Calvin says -- and it is the Atonement which
   regenerates.

   This, then, in the broadest sense, is the truth which we wish to
   commend to the modern mind: the truth that there is forgiveness with
   God, and that this forgiveness comes to us only through Christ, and
   signally or specifically through His death. Unless it becomes true to
   us that Christ died for our sins, we cannot appreciate forgiveness at
   its specifically Christian value. It cannot be for us that kind of
   reality, it cannot have for us that kind of inspiration, which it
   unquestionably is and has in the New Testament.

   But what, we must now ask, is the modern mind to which this primary
   truth of Christianity has to be commended? Can we diagnose it in any
   general yet recognizable fashion, so as to find guidance in seeking
   access to it for the gospel of the Atonement? There may seem to be
   something presumptuous in the very idea, as though any one making the
   attempt assumed a superiority to the mind of his time, an exemption
   from its limitations and prejudices, a power to see over it and round
   about it. All such presumption is of course disclaimed here; but even
   while we disclaim it, the attempt to appreciate the mind of our time is
   forced upon us. Whoever has tried to preach the gospel, and to persuade
   men of truth as truth is in Jesus, and especially of the truth of God's
   forgiveness as it is in the death of Jesus for sin, knows that there is
   a state of mind which is somehow inaccessible to this truth, and to
   which the truth consequently appeals in vain. I do not speak of
   unambiguous moral antipathy to the ideas of forgiveness and atonement,
   although antipathy to these ideas in general, as distinct from any
   given presentation of them, cannot but have a moral character, just as
   a moral character always attaches to the refusal to acknowledge Christ
   or to become His debtor; but of something which, though vaguer and less
   determinate, puts the mind wrong, so to speak, with Christianity from
   the start. It is clear, for instance, in all that has been said about
   forgiveness, that certain relations are presupposed as subsisting
   between God and man, relations which make it possible for man to sin,
   and possible for God, not indeed to ignore his sin, but in the very act
   of recognizing it as all that it is to forgive it, to liberate man from
   it, and to restore him to Himself and righteousness. Now if the latent
   presuppositions of the modern mind are to any extent inconsistent with
   such relations, there will be something to overcome before the
   conceptions of forgiveness or atonement can get a hearing. These
   conceptions have their place in a certain view of the world as a whole,
   and if the mind is preoccupied with a different view, it will have an
   instinctive consciousness that it cannot accommodate them, and a
   disposition therefore to reject them ab initio. This is, in point of
   fact, the difficulty with which we have to deal. And let no one say
   that it is transparently absurd to suggest that we must get men to
   accept a true philosophy before we can begin to preach the gospel to
   them, as though that settled the matter or got over the difficulty. We
   have to take men as we find them; we have to preach the gospel to the
   mind which is around us; and if that mind is rooted in a view of the
   world which leaves no room for Christ and His work as Christian
   experience has realized them, then that view of the world must be
   appreciated by the evangelist, it must be undermined at its weak
   places, its inadequacy to interpret all that is present even in the
   mind which has accepted it -- in other words, its inherent
   inconsistency -- must be demonstrated; the attempt must be made to
   liberate the mind, so that it may be open to the impression of
   realities which under the conditions supposed it could only encounter
   with instinctive antipathy. It is necessary, therefore, at this point
   to advert to the various influences which have contributed to form the
   mind of our time, and to give it its instinctive bias in one direction
   or another. Powerful and legitimate as these influences have been, they
   have nevertheless been in various ways partial, and because of their
   very partiality they have, when they absorbed the mind, as new modes of
   thought are apt to do, prejudiced it against the consideration of
   other, possibly of deeper and more far-reaching, truths.

   First, there is the enormous development of physical science. This has
   engrossed human intelligence in our own times to an extent which can
   hardly be over-estimated. Far more mind has been employed in
   constructing the great fabric of knowledge, which we call science, than
   in any other pursuit of men. Far more mind has had its characteristic
   qualities and temper imparted to it by scientific study than by study
   in any other field. It is of science -- which to all intents and
   purposes means physical science -- of science and its methods and
   results that the modern mind is most confident, and speaks with the
   most natural and legitimate pride. Now science, even in this restricted
   sense, covers a great range of subjects; it may be physics in the
   narrowest meaning of the word, or chemistry, or biological science. The
   characteristic of our own age has been the development of the last, and
   in particular its extension to man. It is impossible to dispute the
   legitimacy of this extension. Man has his place in nature; the
   phenomena of life have one of their signal illustrations in him, and he
   is as proper a subject of biological study as any other living being.
   But the intense preoccupation of much of the most vigorous intelligence
   of our time with the biological study of man is not without effects
   upon the mind itself, which we need to consider. It tends to produce a
   habit of mind to which certain assumptions are natural and inevitable,
   certain other assumptions incredible from the first. This habit of mind
   is in some ways favorable to the acceptance of the Atonement. For
   example, the biologist's invincible conviction of the unity of life,
   and of the certainty and power with which whatever touches it at one
   point touches it through and through, is in one way entirely favorable.
   Many of the most telling popular objections to the idea of Atonement
   rest on an atomic conception of personality -- a conception according
   to which every human being is a closed system, incapable in the last
   resort of helping or being helped, of injuring or being injured, by
   another. This conception has been finally discredited by biology, and
   so far the evangelist must be grateful. The Atonement presupposes the
   unity of human life and its solidarity; it presupposes a common and
   universal responsibility. I believe it presupposes also such a
   conception of the unity of man and nature as biology proceeds upon; and
   in all these respects its physical presuppositions, if we may so
   express ourselves, are present to the mind of today, thanks to biology,
   as they were not even so lately as a hundred years ago.

   But this is not all that we have to consider. The mind has been
   influenced by the movement of physical and even of biological science,
   not only in a way which is favorable, but in ways which are prejudicial
   to the acceptance of the Atonement. Every physical science seems to
   have a boundless ambition; it wants to reduce everything to its own
   level, to explain everything in the terms and by the categories with
   which it itself works. The higher has always to fight for its life
   against the lower. The physicist would like to reduce chemistry to
   physics; the chemist has an ambition to simplify biology into
   chemistry; the biologist in turn looks with suspicion on anything in
   man which cannot be interpreted biologically. He would like to give,
   and is sometimes ready to offer, a biological explanation of
   self-consciousness, of freedom, of religion, morality, sin. Now a
   biological explanation, when all is done, is a physical explanation,
   and a physical explanation of self-consciousness or the moral life is
   one in which the very essence of the thing to be explained is either
   ignored or explained away. Man's life is certainly rooted in nature,
   and therefore a proper subject for biological study; but unless it
   somehow transcended nature, and so demanded other than physical
   categories for its complete interpretation, there could not be any
   study or any science at all. If there were nothing but matter, as M.
   Naville has said, there would be no materialism; and if there were
   nothing but life, there would be no biology. Now it is in the higher
   region of human experience, to which all physical categories are
   unequal, that we encounter those realities to which the Atonement is
   related, and in relation to which it is real; and we must insist upon
   these higher realities, in their specific character, against a strong
   tendency in the scientifically trained modern mind, and still more in
   the general mind as influenced by it, to reduce them to the merely
   physical level.

   Take, for instance, the consciousness of sin. Evidently the Atonement
   becomes incredible if the consciousness of sin is extinguished or
   explained away. There is nothing for the Atonement to do; there is
   nothing to relate it to; it is as unreal as a rock in the sky. But many
   minds at the present time, under the influence of current conceptions
   in biology, do explain it away. All life is one, they argue. It rises
   from the same spring, it runs the same course, it comes to the same
   end. The life of man is rooted in nature, and that which beats in my
   veins is an inheritance from an immeasurable past. It is absurd to
   speak of my responsibility for it, or of my guilt because it manifests
   itself in me, as it inevitably does, in such and such forms. There is
   no doubt that this mode of thought is widely prevalent, and that it is
   one of the most serious hindrances to the acceptance of the gospel, and
   especially of the Atonement. How are we to appreciate it? We must point
   out, I think, the consequence to which it leads. If a man denies that
   he is responsible for the nature which he has inherited -- denies
   responsibility for it on the ground that it is inherited -- it is a
   fair question to ask him for what he does accept responsibility. When
   he has divested himself of the inherited nature, what is left? The real
   meaning of such disowning of responsibility is that a man asserts that
   his life is a part of the physical phenomena of the universe, and
   nothing else; and he forgets, in the very act of making the assertion,
   that if it were true, it could not be so much as made. The merely
   physical is transcended in every such assertion; and the man who has
   transcended it, rooted though his life be in nature, and one with the
   life of the whole and of all the past, must take the responsibility of
   living that life out on the high level of self-consciousness and
   morality which his very disclaimer involves. The sense of sin which
   wakes spontaneously with the perception that he is not what he ought to
   have been must not be explained away; at the level which life has
   reached in him, this is unscientific as well as immoral; his sin -- for
   I do not know another word for it -- must be realized as all that it is
   in the moral world if he is ever to be true to himself, not to say if
   he is ever to welcome the Atonement, and leave his sin behind. We
   should have no need of words like sin and atonement -- we could not
   have the experiences which they designate -- unless we had a higher
   than merely natural life; and one of the tendencies of the modern mind
   which has to be counteracted by the evangelist is the tendency induced
   by physical and especially by biological science to explain the
   realities of personal experience by sub-personal categories. In
   conscience, in the sense of personal dignity, in the ultimate inability
   of man to deny the self which he is, we have always an appeal against
   such tendencies, which cannot fail; but it needs to be made resolutely
   when conscience is lethargic and the whole bias of the mind is to the
   other side.

   Passing from physical science, the modern mind has perhaps been
   influenced most by the great idealist movement in philosophy -- the
   movement which in Germany began with Kant and culminated in Hegel. This
   idealism, just like physical science, gives a certain stamp to the
   mind; when it takes possession of intelligence it casts it, so to
   speak, into a certain mold; even more than physical science it
   dominates it so that it becomes incapable of self-criticism, and very
   difficult to teach. Its importance to the preacher of Christianity is
   that it assumes certain relations between the human and the divine,
   relations which foreclose the very questions which the Atonement
   compels us to raise. To be brief, it teaches the essential unity of God
   and man. God and man, to speak of them as distinct, are necessary to
   each other, but man is as necessary to God as God is to man. God is the
   truth of man, but man is the reality of God. God comes to consciousness
   of Himself in man, and man in being conscious of himself is at the same
   time conscious of God. Though many writers of this school make a
   copious use of Christian phraseology, it seems to me obvious that it is
   not in an adequate Christian sense. Sin is not regarded as that which
   ought not to be, it is that which is to be transcended. It is as
   inevitable as anything in nature; and the sense of it, the bad
   conscience which accompanies it, is no more than the growing pains of
   the soul. On such a system there is no room for atonement in the sense
   of the mediation of God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ. We may
   consistently speak in it of a man being reconciled to himself, or even
   reconciled to his sins, but not, so far as I can understand, of his
   being reconciled to God, and still less, reconciled to God through the
   death of His Son. The penetration of Kant saw from the first all that
   could be made of atonement on the basis of any such system. What it
   means to the speculative mind is that the new man bears the sin of the
   old. When the sinner repents and is converted, the weight of what he
   has done comes home to him; the new man in him -- the Son of God in him
   -- accepts the responsibility of the old man, and so he has peace with
   God. Many whose minds are under the influence of this mode of thought
   do not see clearly to what it leads, and resent criticism of it as if
   it were a sort of impiety. Their philosophy is to them a surrogate for
   religion, but they should not be allowed to suppose (if they do
   suppose) that it is the equivalent of Christianity. There can be no
   Christianity without Christ; it is the presence of the Mediator which
   makes Christianity what it is. But a unique Christ, without whom our
   religion disappears, is frankly disavowed by the more candid and
   outspoken of our idealist philosophers. Christ, they tell us, was
   certainly a man who had an early and a magnificently strong faith in
   the unity of the human and the divine; but it was faith in a fact which
   enters into the constitution of every human consciousness, and it is
   absurd to suppose that the recognition of the fact, or the realization
   of it, is essentially dependent on Him. He was not sinless -- which is
   an expression without meaning, when we think of a human being which has
   to rise by conflict and self-suppression out of nature into the world
   of self-consciousness and right and wrong; He was not in any sense
   unique or exceptional; He was only what we all are in our degree; at
   best, He was only one among really great men who have contributed in
   their place and time to the spiritual elevation of the race. Such, I
   say, is the issue of this mode of thought as it is frankly avowed by
   some of its representative men; but the peculiarity of it, when it is
   obscurely fermenting as a leaven in the mind, is that it appeals to men
   as having special affinities to Christianity. In our own country it is
   widely prevalent among those who have had a university education, and
   indeed in a much wider circle, and it is a serious question how we are
   to address our gospel to those who confront it in such a mental mood.

   I have no wish to be unsympathetic, but I must frankly express my
   conviction that this philosophy only lives by ignoring the greatest
   reality of the spiritual world. There is something in that world --
   something with which we can come into intelligible and vital relations
   -- something which can evince to our minds its truth and reality, for
   which this philosophy can make no room: Christ's consciousness of
   Himself. It is a theory of the universe which (on principle) cannot
   allow Christ to be anything else than an additional unit in the world's
   population; but if this were the truth about Him, no language could be
   strong enough to express the self-delusion in which He lived and died.
   That He was thus self-deluded is a hypothesis I do not feel called to
   discuss. One may be accused of subjectivity again, of course, though a
   subjective opinion which has the consent of the Christian centuries
   behind it need not tremble at hard names; but I venture to say that
   there is no reality in the world which more inevitably and
   uncompromisingly takes hold of the mind as a reality than our Lord's
   consciousness of Himself as it is attested to us in the Gospels. But
   when we have taken this reality for all that it is worth, the idealism
   just described is shaken to the foundation. What seemed to us so
   profound a truth -- the essential unity of the human and the divine --
   may come to seem a formal and delusive platitude; in what we once
   regarded as the formula of the perfect religion -- the divinity of man
   and the humanity of God -- we may find quite as truly the formula of
   the first, not to say the final, sin. To see Christ not in the light of
   this speculative theorem, but in the light of His own consciousness of
   Himself, is to realize not only our kinship to God, but our remoteness
   from Him; it is to realize our incapacity for self-realization when we
   are left to ourselves; it is to realize the need of the Mediator if we
   would come to the Father; it is to realize, in principle, the need of
   the Atonement, the need, and eventually the fact. When the modern mind
   therefore presents itself to us in this mood of philosophical
   competence, judging Christ from the point of view of the whole, and
   showing Him His place, we can only insist that the place is unequal to
   His greatness, and that His greatness cannot be explained away. The
   mind which is closed to the fact of His unique claims, and the unique
   relation to God on which they rest, is closed inevitably to the
   mediation of God's forgiveness through His death.

   There is one other modification of mind, characteristic of modern
   times, of which we have yet to take account -- I mean that which is
   produced by devotion to historical study. History is, as much as
   science, one of the achievements of our age; and the historical temper
   is as characteristic of the men we meet as the philosophical or the
   scientific. The historical temper, too, is just as apt as these others,
   perhaps unconsciously, perhaps quite consciously, but under the
   engaging plea of modesty, to pronounce absolute sentences which strike
   at the life of the Christian religion, and especially, therefore, at
   the idea of the Atonement. Sometimes this is done broadly, so that
   every one sees what it means. If we are told, for example, that
   everything historical is relative, that it belongs of necessity to a
   time, and is conditioned in ways so intricate that no knowledge can
   ever completely trace them; if we are told, further, that for this very
   reason nothing historical can have absolute significance, or can
   condition the eternal life of man, it is obvious that the Christian
   religion is being cut at the root. It is no use speaking about the
   Atonement -- about the mediation of God's forgiveness to the soul
   through a historical person and work -- if this is true. The only thing
   to be done is to raise the question whether it is true. It is no more
   for historical than for physical science to exalt itself into a theory
   of the universe, or to lay down the law with speculative absoluteness
   as to the significance and value which shall attach to facts. When we
   face the fact with which we are here concerned -- the fact of Christ's
   consciousness of Himself and His vocation, to which reference has
   already been made -- are we not forced to the conclusion that here a
   new spiritual magnitude has appeared in history, the very differentia
   of which is that it has eternal significance, and that it is eternal
   life to know it? If we are to preach the Atonement, we cannot allow
   either history or philosophy to proceed on assumptions which ignore or
   degrade the fact of Christ. Only a person in whom the eternal has
   become historical can be the bearer of the Atonement, and it must be
   our first concern to show, against all assumptions whether made in the
   name of history or of philosophy, that in point of fact there is such a
   person here.

   This consideration requires to be kept in view even when we are dealing
   with the modern mind inside the Church. Nothing is commoner than to
   hear those who dissent from any given construction of the Atonement
   plead for a historical as opposed to a dogmatic interpretation of
   Christ. It is not always clear what is meant by this distinction, nor
   is it clear that those who use it are always conscious of what it would
   lead to if it were made absolute. Sometimes a dogmatic interpretation
   of the New Testament means an interpretation vitiated by dogmatic
   prejudice, an interpretation in which the meaning of the writers is
   missed because the mind is blinded by prepossessions of its own: in
   this sense a dogmatic interpretation is a thing which no one would
   defend. Sometimes, however, a dogmatic interpretation is one which
   reveals or discovers in the New Testament truths of eternal and divine
   significance, and to discredit such interpretation in the name of the
   historical is another matter. The distinction in this case, as has been
   already pointed out, is not absolute. It is analogous to the
   distinction between fact and theory, or between thing and meaning, or
   between efficient cause and final cause. None of these distinctions is
   absolute, and no intelligent mind would urge either side in them to the
   disparagement of the other. If we are to apprehend the whole reality
   presented to us, we must apprehend the theory as well as the fact, the
   meaning as well as the thing, the final as well as the efficient cause.
   In the subject with which we are dealing, this truth is frequently
   ignored. It is assumed, for example, that because Christ was put to
   death by His enemies, or because He died in the faithful discharge of
   His calling, therefore He did not die, in the sense of the Atonement,
   for our sins: the historical causes which brought about His death are
   supposed to preclude that interpretation of it according to which it
   mediates to us the divine forgiveness. But there is no incompatibility
   between the two things. To set aside an interpretation of Christ's
   death as dogmatic, on the ground that there is another which is
   historical, is like setting aside the idea that a watch is made to
   measure time because you know it was made by a watchmaker. It was both
   made by a watchmaker and made to measure time. Similarly it may be
   quite true both that Christ was crucified and slain by wicked men, and
   that He died for our sins. But without entering into the questions
   which this raises as to the relation between the wisdom of God and the
   course of human history, it is enough to be conscious of the prejudice
   which the historical temper is apt to generate against the recognition
   of the eternal in time. Surely it is a significant fact that the New
   Testament contains a whole series of books -- the Johannine books --
   which have as their very burden the eternal significance of the
   historical eternal life in Jesus Christ, come in flesh, the
   propitiation for the whole world. Surely also it is a significant fact
   of a different and even an ominous kind that we have at present in the
   Church a whole school of critics which is so far from appreciating the
   truth in this that it is hardly an exaggeration to say that it has
   devoted itself to a paltry and peddling criticism of these books in
   which the impression of the eternal is lost. But whether we are to be
   indebted to John's eyes, or to none but our own, if the eternal is not
   to be seen in Jesus, He can have no place in our religion; if the
   historical has no dogmatic content, it cannot be essential to eternal
   life. Hence if we believe and know that we have eternal life in Jesus,
   we must assert the truth which is implied in this against any
   conception of history which denies it. Nor is it really difficult to do
   so. With the experience of nineteen centuries behind us, we have only
   to confront this particular historical reality, Jesus Christ, without
   prejudice; in evangelizing, we have only to confront others with Him;
   and we shall find it still possible to see God in Him, the Holy Father
   who through the Passion of His Son ministers to sinners the forgiveness
   of their sins.

   In what has been said thus far by way of explaining the modern mind,
   emphasis may seem to have fallen mainly on those characteristics which
   make it less accessible than it might be to Christian truth, and
   especially to the Atonement. I have tried to point out the assailable
   side of its prepossessions, and to indicate the fundamental truths
   which must be asserted if our intellectual world is to be one in which
   the gospel may find room. But the modern mind has other
   characteristics. Some of these may have been exhibited hitherto mainly
   in criticizing current representations of the Atonement; but in
   themselves they are entirely legitimate, and the claims they put
   forward are such as we cannot disown. Before proceeding to a further
   statement of the Atonement, I shall briefly refer to one or two of
   them: a doctrine of Atonement which did not satisfy them would
   undoubtedly stand condemned.

   (1) The modern mind requires that everything shall be based on
   experience. Nothing is true or real to it which cannot be
   experimentally verified. This we shall all concede. But there is an
   inference sometimes drawn from it at which we may look with caution. It
   is the inference that, because everything must be based on experience,
   no appeal to Scripture has any authority. I have already explained in
   what sense it is possible to speak of the authority of Scripture, and
   here it is only necessary to make the simple remark that there is no
   proper contrast between Scripture and experience. Scripture, so far as
   it concerns us here, is a record of experience or an interpretation of
   it. It was the Church's experience that it had its redemption in
   Christ; it was the interpretation of that experience that Christ died
   for our sins. Yet in emphasizing experience the modern mind is right,
   and Scripture would lose its authority if the experience it describes
   were not perpetually verified anew.

   (2) The modern mind desires to have everything in religion ethically
   construed. As a general principle this must command our unreserved
   assent. Anything which violates ethical standards, anything which is
   immoral or less than moral, must be excluded from religion. It may be,
   indeed, that ethical has sometimes been too narrowly defined. Ideas
   have been objected to as unethical which are really at variance not
   with a true perception of the constitution of humanity, and of the laws
   which regulate moral life, but with an atomic theory of personality
   under which moral life would be impossible. Persons are not atoms; in a
   sense they interpenetrate, though individuality has been called the
   true impenetrability. The world has been so constituted that we do not
   stand absolutely outside of each other; we can do things for each
   other. We can bear each other's burdens, and it is not unethical to say
   so, but the reverse. And again, it need not be unethical, though it
   transcends the ordinary sphere and range of ethical action, if we say
   that God in Christ is able to do for us what we cannot do for one
   another. With reference to the Atonement, the demand for ethical
   treatment is usually expressed in two ways.

   (a) There is the demand for analogies to it in human life. The demand
   is justifiable in so far as God has made man in His own image; but, as
   has been suggested above, it has a limit, in so far as God is God and
   not man, and must have relations to the human race which its members do
   not and cannot have to each other.

   (b) There is the demand that the Atonement shall be exhibited in vital
   relation to a new life in which sin is overcome. This demand also is
   entirely legitimate, and it touches a weak point in the traditional
   Protestant doctrine. Dr. Chalmers tells us that he was brought up --
   such was the effect of the current orthodoxy upon him -- in a certain
   distrust of good works. Some were certainly wanted, but not as being
   themselves salvation; only, as he puts it, as tokens of justification.
   It was a distinct stage in his religious progress when he realized that
   true justification sanctifies, and that the soul can and ought to
   abandon itself spontaneously and joyfully to do the good that it
   delights in. The modern mind assumes what Dr. Chalmers painfully
   discovered. An atonement that does not regenerate, it truly holds, is
   not an atonement in which men can be asked to believe. Such then, in
   its prejudices good and bad, is the mind to which the great truth of
   the Christian religion has to be presented.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [79] Of course this does not touch the fact that the whole authority'
   of the Christian religion is in Jesus Himself -- in His historical
   presence in the world, His words and works, His life and death and
   resurrection. He is the truth, the acceptance of which by man is life
   eternal.

CHAPTER 8
Sin and the Divine Reaction Against it

   WE have now seen in a general way what is meant by the Atonement, and
   what are the characteristics of the mind to which the Atonement has to
   make its appeal. In that mind there is, as I believe, much which falls
   in with the Atonement, and prepares a welcome for it; but much also
   which creates prejudice against it, and makes it as possible still as
   in the first century to speak of the offense of the cross. No doubt the
   Atonement has sometimes been presented in forms which provoke
   antagonism, which challenge by an ostentation of unreason, or by a
   defiance of morality, the reason and conscience of man; but this alone
   does not explain the resentment which it often encounters. There is
   such a thing to be found in the world as the man who will have nothing
   to do with Christ on any terms, and who will least of all have anything
   to do with Him when Christ presents Himself in the character which
   makes man His debtor for ever. All men, as St. Paul says, have not
   faith: it is a melancholy fact, whether we can make anything of it or
   not. Discounting, however, this irrational or inexplicable opposition,
   which is not expressed in the mind but in the will, how are we to
   present the Atonement so that it shall excite the least prejudice, and
   find the most unimpeded access to the mind of our own generation? This
   is the question to which we have now to address ourselves.

   To conceive the Atonement, that is, the fact that forgiveness is
   mediated to us through Christ, and specifically through His death, as
   clearly and truly as possible, it is necessary for us to realize the
   situation to which it is related. We cannot think of it except as
   related to a given situation. It is determined or conditioned by
   certain relations subsisting between God and man, as these relations
   have been affected by sin. What we must do, therefore, in the first
   instance, is to make clear to ourselves what these relations are, and
   how sin affects them.

   To begin with, they are personal relations; they are relations the
   truth of which cannot be expressed except by the use of personal
   pronouns. We need not ask whether the personality of God can be proved
   antecedent to religion, or as a basis for a religion yet to be
   established; in the only sense in which we can be concerned with it,
   religion is an experience of the personality of God, and of our own
   personality in relation to it. O Lord, Thou hast searched me and known
   me.' I am continually with Thee.' No human experience can be more vital
   or more normal than that which is expressed in these words, and no
   argument, be it ever so subtle or so baffling, can weigh a
   feather's-weight against such experience. The same conception of the
   relations of God and man is expressed again as unmistakably in every
   word of Jesus about the Father and the Son and the nature of their
   communion with each other. It is only in such personal relations that
   the kind of situation can emerge, and the kind of experience be had,
   with which the Atonement deals; and antecedent to such experience, or
   in independence of it, the Atonement must remain an incredible because
   an unrealizable thing.

   But to say that the relations of God and man are personal is not
   enough. They are not only personal, but universal. Personal is
   habitually used in a certain contrast with legal, and it is very easy
   to lapse into the idea that personal relations, because distinct from
   legal ones, are independent of law; but to say the least of it, that is
   an ambiguous and misleading way of describing the facts. The relations
   of God and man are not lawless, they are not capricious, incalculable,
   incapable of moral meaning; they are personal, but determined by
   something of universal import; in other words, they are not merely
   personal but ethical. That is ethical which is at once personal and
   universal. Perhaps the simplest way to make this evident is to notice
   that the relations of man to God are the relations to God not of atoms,
   or of self-contained individuals, each of which is a world in itself,
   but of individuals which are essentially related to each other, and
   bound up in the unity of a race. The relations of God to man therefore
   are not capricious though they are personal: they are reflected or
   expressed in a moral constitution to which all personal beings are
   equally bound, a moral constitution of eternal and universal validity,
   which neither God nor man can ultimately treat as anything else than
   what it is.

   This is a point at which some prejudice has been raised against the
   Atonement by theologians, and more, perhaps, by persons protesting
   against what they supposed theologians to mean. If one may be excused a
   personal reference, few things have astonished me more than to be
   charged with teaching a forensic' or legal' or judicial' doctrine of
   Atonement, resting, as such a doctrine must do, on a forensic' or
   legal' or judicial' conception of man's relation to God. It is all the
   more astonishing when the charge is combined with what one can only
   decline as in the circumstances totally unmerited compliments to the
   clearness with which he has expressed himself. There is nothing which I
   should wish to reprobate more whole-heartedly than the conception which
   is expressed by these words. To say that the relations of God and man
   are forensic is to say that they are regulated by statute -- that sin
   is a breach of statute -- that the sinner is a criminal -- and that God
   adjudicates on him by interpreting the statute in its application to
   his case. Everybody knows that this is a travesty of the truth, and it
   is surprising that any one should be charged with teaching it, or that
   any one should applaud himself, as though he were in the foremost files
   of time, for not believing it. It is superfluously apparent that the
   relations of God and man are not those of a magistrate on the bench
   pronouncing according to the act on the criminal at the bar. To say
   this, however, does not make these relations more intelligible. In
   particular, to say that they are personal, as opposed to forensic, does
   not make them more intelligible. If they are to be rational, if they
   are to be moral, if they are to be relations in which an ethical life
   can be lived, and ethical responsibilities realized, they must be not
   only personal, but universal; they must be relations that in some sense
   are determined by law. Even to say that they are the relations, not of
   judge and criminal, but of Father and child, does not get us past this
   point. The relations of father and child are undoubtedly more adequate
   to the truth than those of judge and criminal; they are more adequate,
   but so far as our experience of them goes, they are not equal to it. If
   the sinner is not a criminal before his judge, neither is he a naughty
   child before a parent whose own weakness or affinity to evil introduces
   an incalculable element into his dealing with his child's fault. I
   should not think of saying that it is the desire to escape from the
   inexorableness of law to a God capable of indulgent human tenderness
   that inspires the violent protests so often heard against forensic' and
   legal' ideas': but that is the impression which one sometimes
   involuntarily receives from them. It ought to be apparent to every one
   that even the relation of parent and child, if it is to be a moral
   relation, must be determined in a way which has universal and final
   validity. It must be a relation in which -- ethically speaking -- some
   things are for ever obligatory, and some things for ever impossible; in
   other words, it must be a relation determined by law, and law which
   cannot deny itself. But law in this sense is not legal.' It is not
   judicial, ' or forensic,' or statutory.' None the less it is real and
   vital, and the whole moral value of the relation depends upon it. When
   a man says -- as some one has said -- There are many to whom the
   conception of forgiveness resting on a judicial transaction does not
   appeal at all,' I entirely agree with him; it does not appeal at all to
   me. But what would be the value of a forgiveness which did not
   recognize in its eternal truth and worth that universal law in which
   the relations of God and man are constituted? Without the recognition
   of that law -- that moral order or constitution in which we have our
   life in relation to God and each other -- righteousness and sin,
   atonement and forgiveness, would all alike be words without meaning.

   In connection with this, reference may be made to an important point in
   the interpretation of the New Testament. The responsibility for what is
   called the forensic conception of the Atonement is often traced to St.
   Paul, and the greatest of all the ministers of grace is not
   infrequently spoken of as though he had deliberately laid the most
   insuperable of stumbling-blocks in the way to the gospel. Most people,
   happily, are conscious that they do not look well talking down to St.
   Paul, and occasionally one can detect a note of misgiving in the brave
   words in which his doctrine is renounced, a note of misgiving which
   suggests that the charitable course is to hear such protests in
   silence, and to let those who utter them think over the matter again.
   But there is what claims to be a scientific way of expressing dissent
   from the apostle, a way which, equally with the petulant one, rests, I
   am convinced, on misapprehension of his teaching. This it would not be
   fair to ignore. It interprets what the apostle says about law solely by
   reference to the great question at issue between the Jewish and the
   Christian religions, making the word law mean the statutory system
   under which the Jews lived, and nothing else. No one will deny that
   Paul does use the word in this sense; the law often means for him
   specifically the law of Moses. The law of Moses, however, never means
   for him anything less than the law of God; it is one specific form in
   which the universal relations subsisting between God and man, and
   making religion and morality possible, have found historical
   expression. But Paul's mind does not rest in this one historical
   expression. He generalizes it. He has the conception of a universal
   law, to which he can appeal in Gentile as well as in Jew -- a law in
   the presence of which sin is revealed, and by the reaction of which sin
   is judged -- a law which God could not deny without denying Himself,
   and to which justice is done (in other words, which is maintained in
   its integrity), even when God justifies the ungodly. But when law is
   thus universalized, it ceases to be legal; it is not a statute, but the
   moral constitution of the world. Paul preached the same gospel to the
   Gentiles as he did to the Jews; he preached in it the same relation of
   the Atonement and of Christ's death to divine law. But he did not do
   this by extending to all mankind a Pharisaic, legal, forensic relation
   to God: he did it by rising above such conceptions, even though as a
   Pharisee he may have had to start from them, to the conception of a
   relation of all men to God expressing itself in a moral constitution --
   or, as he would have said, but in an entirely unforensic sense, in a
   law -- of divine and unchanging validity. The maintenance of this law,
   or of this moral constitution, in its inviolable integrity was the
   signature of the forgiveness Paul preached. The Atonement meant to him
   that forgiveness was mediated through One in whose life and death the
   most signal homage was paid to this law: the very glory of the
   Atonement was that it manifested the righteousness of God; it
   demonstrated God's consistency with His own character, which would have
   been violated alike by indifference to sinners and by indifference to
   that universal moral order -- that law of God -- in which alone eternal
   life is possible.

   Hence it is a mistake to say -- though this also has been said -- that
   Paul's problem was not that of the possibility of forgiveness; it was
   the Jewish law, the Old Testament dispensation, how to justify his
   breach with it, how to demonstrate that the old order had been annulled
   and a new order inaugurated. ' There is a false contrast in all such
   propositions. Paul's problem was that of the Jewish law, and it was
   also that of the possibility of forgiveness; it was that of the Jewish
   law, and it was also that of a revelation of grace, in which God should
   justify the ungodly, Jew or Gentile, and yet maintain inviolate those
   universal moral relations between Himself and man for which law is the
   compendious expression. It does not matter whether we suppose him to
   start from the concrete instance of the Jewish law, and to generalize
   on the basis of it; or to start from the universal conception of law,
   and to recognize in existing Jewish institutions the most available and
   definite illustration of it: in either case, the only Paul whose mind
   is known to us has completely transcended the forensic point of view.
   The same false contrast is repeated when we are told that, That
   doctrine (Paul's "juristic doctrine") had its origin, not so much in
   his religious experience, as in apologetic necessities. ' The only
   apologetic necessities which give rise to fundamental doctrines are
   those created by religious experience. The apologetic of any religious
   experience is just the definition of it as real in relation to other
   acknowledged realities. Paul had undoubtedly an apologetic of
   forgiveness -- namely, his doctrine of atonement. But the acknowledged
   reality in relation to which he defined forgiveness -- the reality with
   which, by means of his doctrine of atonement, he showed forgiveness to
   be consistent -- was not the law of the Jews (though that was included
   in it, or might be pointed to in illustration of it): it was the law of
   God, the universal and inviolable order in which alone eternal life is
   possible, and in which all men, and not the Jews only, live and move
   and have their being. It was the perception of this which made Paul an
   apostle to the Gentiles, and it is this very thing itself which some
   would degrade into an awkward, unintelligent, and outworn rag of
   Pharisaic apologetic, which is the very heart and soul of Paul's
   Gentile gospel. Paul himself was perfectly conscious of this; he could
   not have preached to the Gentiles at all unless he had been. But there
   is nothing in it which can be characterized as legal,' judicial, ' or
   forensic'; and of this also, I have no doubt, the apostle was well
   aware. Of course he occupied certain historical position, had certain
   historical questions to answer, was subject to historical limitations
   of different kinds; but I have not the courage to treat him, nor do his
   words entitle any one to do so, as a man who in the region of ideas
   could not put two and two together.

   But to return to the point from which this digression on St. Paul
   started. We have seen that the relations of God and man are personal,
   and also that they are universal, that is, there is a law of them, or,
   if we like to say so, a law in them, on the maintenance of which their
   whole ethical value depends. The next point to be noticed is that these
   relations are deranged or disordered by sin. Sin is, in fact, nothing
   else than this derangement or disturbance: it is that in which wrong is
   done to the moral constitution under which we live. And let no one say
   that in such an expression we are turning our back on the personal
   world, and lapsing, or incurring the risk of lapsing, into mere
   legalism again. It cannot be too often repeated that if the universal
   element, or law, be eliminated from personal relations, there is
   nothing intelligible left: no reason, no morality, no religion, no sin
   or righteousness or forgiveness, nothing to appeal to mind or
   conscience. In the widest sense of the word, sin, as a disturbance of
   the personal relations between God and man, is a violence done to the
   constitution under which God and man form one moral community, share,
   as we may reverently express it, one life, have in view the same moral
   ends.

   It is no more necessary in connection with the Atonement than in any
   other connection that we should have a doctrine of the origin of sin.
   We do not know its origin, we only know that it is here. We cannot
   observe the genesis of the bad conscience any more than we can observe
   the genesis of consciousness in general. We see that consciousness does
   stand in relief against the background of natural life; but though we
   believe that, as it exists in us, it has emerged from that background,
   we cannot see it emerge; it is an ultimate fact, and is assumed in all
   that we can ever regard as its physical antecedents and
   presuppositions. In the same way, the moral consciousness is an
   ultimate fact, and irreducible. The physical theory of evolution must
   not be allowed to mislead us here, and in particular it must not be
   allowed to discredit the conception of moral responsibility for sin
   which is embodied in the story of the Fall. Each of us individually has
   risen into moral life from a mode of being which was purely natural; in
   other words, each of us, individually, has been a subject of evolution;
   but each of us also has fallen -- fallen, presumably, in ways
   determined by his natural constitution, yet certainly, as conscience
   assures us, in ways for which we are morally answerable, and to which,
   in the moral constitution of the world, consequences attach which we
   must recognize as our due. They are not only results of our action, but
   results which that action has merited, and there is no moral hope for
   us unless we accept them as such. Now what is true of any, or rather of
   all, of us, without compromise of the moral consciousness, may be true
   of the race, or of the first man, if there was a first man. Evolution
   and a Fall cannot be inconsistent, for both enter into every moral
   experience of which we know anything; and no opinion we hold about the
   origin of sin can make it anything else than it is in conscience, or
   give its results any character other than that which they have to
   conscience. Of course when one tries to interpret sin outside of
   conscience, as though it were purely physical, and did not have its
   being in personality, consciousness, and will, it disappears; and the
   laborious sophistries of such interpretations must be left to
   themselves. The point for us is that no matter how sin originated, in
   the moral consciousness in which it has its being it is recognized as a
   derangement of the vital relations of man, a violation of that
   universal order outside of which he has no true good.

   In what way, now, let us ask, does the reality of sin come home to the
   sinner? How does he recognize it as what it is? What is the reaction
   against the sinner, in the moral order under which he lives, which
   reveals to him the meaning of his sinful act or state?

   In the first place, there is that instantaneous but abiding reaction
   which is called the bad conscience -- the sense of guilt, of being
   answerable to God for sin. The sin may be an act which is committed in
   a moment, but in this aspect of it, at least, it does not fade into the
   past. An animal may have a past, for anything we can tell, and
   naturalistic interpreters of sin may believe that sin dies a natural
   death with time, and need not trouble us permanently; but this is not
   the voice of conscience, in which alone sin exists, and which alone can
   tell us the truth about it. The truth is that the spiritual being has
   no past. Just as he is continually with God, his sin is continually
   with him. He cannot escape it by not thinking. When he keeps silence,
   as the Psalmist says -- and that is always his first resource, as
   though, if he were to say nothing about it, God might say nothing about
   it, and the whole thing blow over -- it devours him like a fever
   within: his bones wax old with his moaning all day long. This sense of
   being wrong with God, under His displeasure, excluded from His
   fellowship, afraid to meet Him yet bound to meet Him, is the sense of
   guilt. Conscience confesses in it its liability to God, a liability
   which in the very nature of the case it can do nothing to meet, and
   which therefore is nearly akin to despair.

   But the bad conscience, real as it is, may be too abstractly
   interpreted. Man is not a pure spirit, but a spiritual being whose
   roots strike to the very depths of nature, and who is connected by the
   most intimate and vital relations not only with his fellow-creatures of
   the same species, but with the whole system of nature in which he
   lives. The moral constitution in which he has his being comprehends, if
   we may say so, nature in itself: the God who has established the moral
   order in which man lives, has established the natural order also as
   part of the same whole with it. In some profound way the two are one.
   We distinguish in man, legitimately enough, between the spiritual and
   the physical; but man is one, and the universe in which he lives is
   one, and in man's relation to God the distinction of physical and
   spiritual must ultimately disappear. The sin which introduces disorder
   into man's relations to God produces reactions affecting man as a whole
   -- not reactions that, as we sometimes say, are purely spiritual, but
   reactions as broad as man's being and as the whole divinely constituted
   environment in which it lives. I am well aware of the difficulty of
   giving expression to this truth, and of the hopelessness of trying to
   give expression to it by means of those very distinctions which it is
   its nature to transcend. The distinctions are easy and obvious; what we
   have to learn is that they are not final. It seems so conclusive to
   say, as some one has done in criticizing the idea of atonement, that
   spiritual transgressing brings spiritual penalty, and physical brings
   physical; it seems so conclusive, and it is in truth so completely
   beside the mark. We cannot divide either man or the universe in this
   fashion into two parts which move on different planes and have no vital
   relations; we cannot, to apply this truth to the subject before us,
   limit the divine reaction against sin, or the experiences through
   which, in any case whatever, sin is brought home to man as what it is,
   to the purely spiritual sphere. Every sin is a sin of the indivisible
   human being, and the divine reaction against it expresses itself to
   conscience through the indivisible frame of that world, at once natural
   and spiritual, in which man lives. We cannot distribute evils into the
   two classes of physical and moral, and subsequently investigate the
   relation between them, if we could, it would be of no service here.
   What we have to understand is that when a man sins he does something in
   which his whole being participates, and that the reaction of God
   against his sin is a reaction in which he is conscious, or might be
   conscious, that the whole system of things is in arms against him.

   There are those, no doubt, to whom this will seem fantastic, but it is
   a truth, I am convinced, which is presupposed in the Christian doctrine
   of Atonement, as the mediation of forgiveness through the suffering and
   death of Christ -- and it is a truth also, if I am not much mistaken,
   to which all the highest poetry, which is also the deepest vision of
   the human mind, bears witness. We may distinguish natural law and moral
   law as sharply as we please, and it is as necessary sometimes as it is
   easy to make these sharp and absolute distinctions; but there is a
   unity in experience which makes itself felt deeper than all the
   antitheses of logic, and in that unity nature and spirit are no more
   defined by contrast with each other -- on the contrary, they
   interpenetrate and support each other, they are aspects of the same
   whole. When we read in the prophet Amos, Lo, He that formeth the
   mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his
   thought, that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high
   places of the earth, the Lord, the God of hosts, is His name,' this is
   the truth which is expressed. The power which reveals itself in
   conscience -- telling us all things that ever we did, declaring unto us
   what is our thought -- is the same which reveals itself in nature,
   establishing the everlasting hills, creating the winds which sweep over
   them, turning the shadow of death into the morning and making the day
   dark with night, calling for the waters of the sea, and pouring them
   out on the face of the earth. Conscience speaks in a still small voice,
   but it is no impotent voice; it can summon the thunder to give it
   resonance; the power which we sometimes speak of as if it were purely
   spiritual is a power which clothes itself spontaneously and of right in
   all the majesty and omnipotence of nature. It is the same truth, again,
   in another aspect of it, which is expressed in Wordsworth's sublime
   lines to Duty:

   Thou dost preserve the Stars from wrong, And the most ancient Heavens
   through Thee are fresh and strong.'

   When the mind sees deepest, it is conscious that it needs more than
   physical astronomy, more than spectrum analysis, to tell us everything
   even about the stars. There is a moral constitution, it assures us,
   even of the physical world, and though it is impossible for us to work
   it out in detail, the assumption of it is the only assumption on which
   we can understand the life of a being related as man is related both to
   the natural and the spiritual. I do not pretend to prove that there is
   articulate or conscious reflection on this in either the Old Testament
   or the New; I take it for granted, as self-evident, that this sense of
   the ultimate unity of the natural and the spiritual -- which is,
   indeed, but one form of belief in God -- pervades the Bible from
   beginning to end. It knows nothing of our abstract and absolute
   distinctions; to come to the matter in hand, it knows nothing of a sin
   which has merely spiritual penalties. Sin is the act or the state of
   man, and the reaction against it is the reaction of the whole order, at
   once natural and spiritual, in which man lives.

   Now the great difficulty which the modern mind has with the Atonement,
   or with the representation of it in the New Testament, is that it
   assumes some kind of connection between sin and death. Forgiveness is
   mediated through Christ, but specifically through His death. He died
   for our sins; if we can be put right with God apart from this, then,
   St. Paul tells us, He died for nothing. One is almost ashamed to repeat
   that this is not Paulinism, but the Christianity of the whole Apostolic
   Church. What St. Paul made the basis of his preaching, that Christ died
   for our sins, according to the Scriptures, he had on his own showing
   received as the common Christian tradition. But is there anything in
   it? Can we receive it simply on the authority of the primitive Church?
   Can we realize any such connection between death and sin as makes it a
   truth to us, an intelligible, impressive, overpowering thought, that
   Christ died for our sins?

   I venture to say that a great part of the difficulty which is felt at
   this point is due to the false abstraction just referred to. Sin is put
   into one world -- the moral; death is put into another world -- the
   natural; and there is no connection between them. This is very
   convincing if we find it possible to believe that we live in two
   unconnected worlds. But if we find it impossible to believe this -- and
   surely the impossibility is patent -- its plausibility is gone. It is a
   shining example of this false abstraction when we are told, as though
   it were a conclusive objection to all that the New Testament has to say
   about the relation of sin and death, that the specific penalty of sin
   is not a fact of the natural life, but of the moral life.' What right
   has any one, in speaking of the ultimate realities in human life, of
   those experiences in which man becomes conscious of all that is
   involved in his relations to God and their disturbance by sin, to split
   that human life into natural' and moral,' and fix an impassable gulf
   between? The distinction is legitimate, as has already been remarked,
   within limits, but it is not final; and what the New Testament teaches,
   or rather assumes, about the relation of sin and death, is one of the
   ways in which we are made sensible that it is not final. Sin and death
   do not belong to unrelated worlds. As far as man is concerned, the two
   worlds, to use an inadequate figure, intersect; and at one point in the
   line of their intersection sin and death meet and interpenetrate. In
   the indivisible experience of man he is conscious that they are parts
   or aspects of the same thing.

   That this is what Scripture means when it assumes the connection of
   death and sin is not to be refuted by pointing either to the third
   chapter of Genesis or to the fifth of Romans. It does not, for example,
   do justice either to Genesis or to St. Paul to say, as has been said,
   that according to their representation, Death -- not spiritual, but
   natural death -- is the direct consequence of sin and its specific
   penalty.' In such a dictum, the distinctions again mislead. To read the
   third chapter of Genesis in this sense would mean that what we had to
   find in it was a mythological explanation of the origin of physical
   death. But does any one believe that any Bible writer was ever curious
   about this question? or does any one believe that a mythological
   solution of the problem, how death originated -- a solution which ex
   hypothesi has not a particle of truth or even of meaning in it -- could
   have furnished the presupposition for the fundamental doctrine of the
   Christian religion, that Christ died for our sins, and that in Him we
   have our forgiveness through His blood? A truth which has appealed so
   powerfully to man cannot be sustained on a falsehood. That the third
   chapter of Genesis is mythological in form, no one who knows what
   mythology is will deny; but even mythology is not made out of nothing,
   and in this chapter every atom is stuff o' the conscience.' What we see
   in it is conscience, projecting as it were in a picture on a screen its
   own invincible, dear-bought, despairing conviction that sin and death
   are indissolubly united -- that from death the sinful race can never
   get away -- that it is part of the indivisible reality of sin that the
   shadow of death darkens the path of the sinner, and at last swallows
   him up. It is this also which is in the mind of St. Paul when he says
   that by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin. It is not
   the origin of death he is interested in, nor the origin of sin either,
   but the fact that sin and death hang together. And just because sin is
   sin, this is not a fact of natural history, or a fact which natural
   history can discredit. Scripture has no interest in natural history,
   nor does such an interest help us to understand it. It is no doubt
   perfectly true that to the biologist death is part of the indispensable
   machinery of nature; it is a piece of the mechanism without which the
   movement of the whole would be arrested; to put it so, death to the
   biologist is part of the same whole as life, or life and death are for
   him aspects of one thing. One can admit this frankly without
   compromising, because without touching, the other and deeper truth
   which is so interesting and indeed so vital alike in the opening pages
   of revelation and in its consummation in the Atonement. The biologist,
   when he deals with man, and with his life and death, deliberately deals
   with them in abstraction, as merely physical phenomena; to him man is a
   piece of nature, and he is nothing more. But the Biblical writers deal
   with man in the integrity of his being, and in his relations to God;
   they transcend the distinction of natural and moral, because for God it
   is not final, they are sensible of the unity in things which the
   everyday mind, for practical purposes, finds it convenient to keep
   apart. It is one great instance of this that they are sensible of the
   unity of sin and death. We may call sin a spiritual thing, but the man
   who has never felt the shadow of death fall upon it does not know what
   that spiritual thing is: and we may call death a natural thing, but the
   man who has not felt its natural pathos deepen into tragedy as he faced
   it with the sense of sin upon him does not know what that natural thing
   is. We are here, in short, at the vanishing point of this distinction
   -- God is present, and nature and spirit interpenetrate in His
   presence. We hear much in other connections of the sacramental
   principle, and its importance for the religious interpretation of
   nature. It is a somber illustration of this principle if we say that
   death is a kind of sacrament of sin. It is in death, ultimately, that
   the whole meaning of sin comes home to the sinner; he has not sounded
   it to its depths until he has discovered that this comes into it at
   last. And we must not suppose that when Paul read the third chapter of
   Genesis he read it as a mythological explanation of the origin of
   physical death, and accepted it as such on the authority of
   inspiration. With all his reverence for the Old Testament, Paul
   accepted nothing from it that did not speak to his conscience, and
   waken echoes there; and what so spoke to him from the third chapter of
   Genesis was not a mythical story of how death invaded Paradise, but the
   profound experience of the human race expressed in the story, all
   experience in which sin and death interpenetrate, interpret, and in a
   sense constitute each other. To us they are what they are only in
   relation to each other, and when we deny the relation we see the
   reality of neither. This is the truth, as I apprehend it, of all we are
   taught either in the Old Testament or in the New about the relation of
   sin and death. It is part of the greater truth that what we call the
   physical and spiritual worlds are ultimately one, being constituted
   with a view to each other; and most of the objections which are raised
   against it are special cases of the objections which are raised against
   the recognition of this ultimate unity. So far as they are such, it is
   not necessary to discuss them further; and so far as the ultimate unity
   of the natural and the spiritual is a truth rather to be experienced
   than demonstrated, it is not probable that much can be done by argument
   to gain acceptance for the idea that sin and death have essential
   relations to each other. But there are particular objections to this
   idea to which it may be worth while to refer.

   There is, to begin with, the undoubted fact that many people live and
   die without, consciously at least, recognizing this relation. The
   thought of death may have had a very small place in their lives, and
   when death itself comes it may, for various reasons, be a very
   insignificant experience to them. It may come in a moment, suddenly,
   and give no time for feeling; or it may come as the last step in a
   natural process of decay, and arrest life almost unconsciously; or it
   may come through a weakness in which the mind wanders to familiar
   scenes of the past, living these over again, and in a manner escaping
   by so doing the awful experience of death itself; or it may come in
   childhood before the moral consciousness is fully awakened, and moral
   reflection and experience possible. This last case, properly speaking,
   does not concern us; we do not know how to define sin in relation to
   those in whom the moral consciousness is as yet undeveloped: we only
   know that somehow or other they are involved in the moral as well as in
   the natural unity of the race. But leaving them out of account, is
   there any real difficulty in the others? any real objection to the
   Biblical idea that sin and death in humanity are essentially related? I
   do not think there is. To say that many people are unconscious of the
   connection is only another way of saying that many people fail to
   realize in full and tragic reality what is meant by death and sin. They
   think very little about either. The third chapter of Genesis could
   never have been written out of their conscience. Sin is not for them
   all one with despair: they are not, through fear of death, all their
   lifetime subject to bondage. Scripture, of course, has no difficulty in
   admitting this; it depicts, on the amplest scale, and in the most vivid
   colors, the very kind of life and death which are here supposed. But it
   does not consider that such a life and death are ipso facto a
   refutation of the truth it teaches about the essential relations of
   death and sin. On the contrary, it considers them a striking
   demonstration of that moral dullness and insensibility in man which
   must be overcome if he is ever to see and feel his sin as what it is to
   God, or welcome the Atonement as that in which God's forgiveness of sin
   is mediated through the tremendous experience of death. I know there
   are those who will call this arrogant, or even insolent, as though I
   were passing a moral sentence on all who do not accept a theorem of
   mine; but I hope I do not need here to disclaim any such unchristian
   temper. Only, it is necessary to insist that the connection of sin and
   death in Scripture is neither a fantastic piece of mythology,
   explaining, as mythology does, the origin of a physical law, nor, on
   the other hand, a piece of supernaturally revealed history, to be
   accepted on the authority of Him who has revealed it; in such
   revelations no one believes any longer; it is a profound conviction and
   experience of the human conscience, and all that is of interest is to
   show that such a conviction and experience can never be set aside by
   the protest of those who aver that they know nothing about it. One must
   insist on this, however it may expose him to the charge of judging. Can
   we utter any truth at all, in which conscience is concerned, and which
   is not universally acknowledged, without seeming to judge?

   Sometimes, apart from the general denial of any connection between
   death and sin, it is pointed out that death has another and a totally
   different character. Death in any given case may be so far from coming
   as a judgment of God, that it actually comes as a gracious gift from
   Him; it may even be an answer to prayer, a merciful deliverance from
   pain, an event welcomed by suffering human nature, and by all who
   sympathize with it. This is quite true, but again, one must point out,
   rests on the false abstraction so often referred to. Man is regarded in
   all this simply in the character of a sufferer, and death as that which
   brings suffering to an end; but that is not all the truth about man,
   nor all the truth about death. Physical pain may be so terrible that
   consciousness is absorbed and exhausted in it, sometimes even
   extinguished, but it is not to such abnormal conditions we should
   appeal to discover the deepest truths in the moral consciousness of
   man. If the waves of pain subsided, and the whole nature collected its
   forces again, and conscience was once more audible, death too would be
   seen in a different light. It might not indeed be apprehended at once,
   as Scripture apprehends it, but it would not be regarded simply as a
   welcome relief from pain. It would become possible to see in it
   something through which God spoke to the conscience, and eventually to
   realize its intimate relation to sin.

   The objections we have just considered are not very serious, because
   they practically mean that death has no moral character at all; they
   reduce it to a natural phenomenon, and do not bring it into any
   relation to the conscience. It is a more respectable, and perhaps a
   more formidable objection, when death is brought into the moral world,
   and when the plea is put forward that so far from being God's judgment
   upon sin, it may be itself a high moral achievement. A man may die
   greatly; his death may be a triumph; nothing in his life may become him
   like the leaving it. Is not this inconsistent with the idea that there
   is any peculiar connection between death and sin? From the Biblical
   point of view the answer must again be in the negative. There is no
   such triumph over death as makes death itself a noble ethical
   achievement, which is not at the same time a triumph over sin. Man
   vanquishes the one only as in the grace of God he is able to vanquish
   the other. The doom that is in death passes away only as the sin to
   which it is related is transcended. But there is more than this to be
   said. Death cannot be so completely an action that it ceases to be a
   passion; it cannot be so completely achieved that it ceases to be
   accepted or endured. And in this last aspect of it the original
   character which it bore in relation to sin still makes itself felt.
   Transfigure it, as it may be transfigured, by courage, by devotion, by
   voluntary abandonment of life for a higher good, and it remains
   nevertheless the last enemy. There is something in it monstrous and
   alien to the spirit, something which baffles the moral intelligence,
   until the truth dawns upon us that for all our race sin and death are
   aspects of one thing. If we separate them, we understand neither; nor
   do we understand the solemn greatness of martyrdom itself if we regard
   it as a triumph only, and eliminate from the death which martyrs die
   all sense of the universal relation in humanity of death and sin. No
   one knew the spirit of the martyr more thoroughly than St. Paul. No one
   could speak more confidently and triumphantly of death than he. No one
   knew better how to turn the passion into action, the endurance into a
   great spiritual achievement. But also, no one knew better than he, in
   consistency with all this, that sin and death are needed for the
   interpretation of each other, and that fundamentally, in the experience
   of the race, they constitute one whole. Even when he cried, O death,
   where is thy sting?' he was conscious that the sting of death is sin.'
   Each, so to speak, had its reality in the other. No one could vanquish
   death who had not vanquished sin. No one could know what sin meant
   without tasting death. These were not mythological fancies in St.
   Paul's mind, but the conviction in which the Christian conscience
   experimentally lived, and moved, and had its being. And these
   convictions, I repeat, furnish the point of view from which we must
   appreciate the Atonement, i. e., the truth that forgiveness, as
   Christianity preaches it, is specifically mediated through Christ's
   death.

CHAPTER 9
Christ and Man in the Atonement

   OUR conception of the relations subsisting between God and man, of the
   manner in which these relations are affected by sin, and particularly
   of the Scripture doctrine of the connection between sin and death, must
   determine, to a great extent, our attitude to the Atonement. The
   Atonement, as the New Testament presents it, assumes the connection of
   sin and death. Apart from some sense and recognition of such
   connection, the mediation of forgiveness through the death of Christ
   can only appear an arbitrary, irrational, unacceptable idea. But
   leaving the Atonement meanwhile out of sight, and looking only at the
   situation created by sin, the question inevitably arises, What can be
   done with it? Is it possible to remedy or to reverse it? It is an
   abnormal and unnatural situation; can it be annulled, and the relations
   of God and man put upon an ideal footing? Can God forgive sin and
   restore the soul? Can we claim that He shall? And if it is possible for
   Him to do so, can we tell how or on what conditions it is possible?

   When the human mind is left to itself, there are only two answers which
   it can give to these questions. Perhaps they are not specially
   characteristic of the modern mind, but the modern mind in various moods
   has given passionate expression to both of them. The first says roundly
   that forgiveness is impossible. Sin is, and it abides. The sinner can
   never escape from the past. His future is mortgaged to it, and it
   cannot be redeemed. He can never get back the years which the locust
   has eaten. His leprous flesh can never come again like the flesh of a
   little child. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap, and
   reap for ever and ever. It is not eternal punishment which is
   incredible; nothing else has credibility. Let there be no illusion
   about this: forgiveness is a violation, a reversal, of law, and no such
   thing is conceivable in a world in which law reigns.

   The answer to this is, that sin and its consequences are here conceived
   as though they belonged to a purely physical world, whereas, if the
   world were only physical, there could be no such thing as sin. As soon
   as we realize that sin belongs to a world in which freedom is real -- a
   world in which reality means the personal relations subsisting between
   man and God, and the experiences realized in these relations -- the
   question assumes a different aspect. It is not one of logic or of
   physical law, but of personality, of character, of freedom. There is at
   least a possibility that the sinner's relation to his sin and God's
   relation to the sinner should change, and that out of these changed
   relations a regenerative power should spring, making the sinner, after
   all, a new creature. The question, of course, is not decided in this
   sense, but it is not foreclosed.

   At the opposite extreme from those who pronounce forgiveness impossible
   stand those who give the second answer to the great question, and
   calmly assure us that forgiveness may be taken for granted. They
   emphasize what the others overlooked -- the personal character of the
   relations of God and man. God is a loving Father; man is His weak and
   unhappy child; and of course God forgives. As Heine put it, c'est son
   metier, it is what He is for. But the conscience which is really
   burdened by sin does not easily find satisfaction in this cheap pardon.
   There is something in conscience which will not allow it to believe
   that God can simply condone sin: to take forgiveness for granted, when
   you realize what you are doing, seems to a live conscience impious and
   profane. In reality, the tendency to take forgiveness for granted is
   the tendency of those who, while they properly emphasize the personal
   character of the relations of God and man, overlook their universal
   character, that is, exclude from them that element of law without which
   personal relations cease to be ethical. But a forgiveness which ignores
   this stands in no relation to the needs of the soul or the character of
   God.

   What the Christian religion holds to be the truth about forgiveness --
   a truth embodied in the Atonement -- is something quite distinct from
   both the propositions which have just been considered. The New
   Testament does not teach, with the naturalistic or the legal mind, that
   forgiveness is impossible; neither does it teach, with the sentimental
   or lawless mind, that it may be taken for granted. It teaches that
   forgiveness is mediated to sinners through Christ, and specifically
   through His death: in other words, that it is possible for God to
   forgive, but possible for God only through a supreme revelation of His
   love, made at infinite cost, and doing justice to the uttermost to
   those inviolable relations in which alone, as I have already said, man
   can participate in eternal life, the life of God Himself -- doing
   justice to them as relations in which there is an inexorable divine
   reaction against sin, finally expressing itself in death. It is
   possible on these terms, and it becomes actual as sinful men open their
   hearts in penitence and faith to this marvelous revelation, and abandon
   their sinful life unreservedly to the love of God in Christ who died
   for them.

   From this point of view it seems to me possible to present in a
   convincing and persuasive light some of the truths involved in the
   Atonement to which the modern mind is supposed to be specially averse.

   Thus it becomes credible -- we say so not a priori, but after
   experience -- that there is a divine necessity for it; in other words,
   there is no forgiveness possible to God without it if He forgives at
   all, it must be in this way and in no other. To say so beforehand would
   be inconceivably presumptuous, but it is quite another thing to say so
   after the event. What it really means is that in the very act of
   forgiving sin -- or, to use the daring word of St. Paul, in the very
   act of justifying the ungodly, God must act in consistency with His
   whole character. He must demonstrate Himself to be what He is in
   relation to sin, a God with whom evil cannot dwell, a God who maintains
   inviolate the moral constitution of the world, taking sin as all that
   it is in the very process through which He mediates His forgiveness to
   men.

   It is the recognition of this divine necessity -- not to forgive, but
   to forgive in a way which shows that God is irreconcilable to evil, and
   can never treat it as other or less than it is -- it is the recognition
   of this divine necessity, or the failure to recognize it, which
   ultimately divides interpreters of Christianity into evangelical and
   non-evangelical, those who are true to the New Testament and those who
   cannot digest it.

   No doubt the forms in which this truth is expressed are not always
   adequate to the idea they are meant to convey, and if we are only
   acquainted with them at second hand they will probably appear even less
   adequate than they are. When Athanasius, e.g., speaks of God's truth in
   this connection, and then reduces God's truth to the idea that God must
   keep His word -- the word which made death the penalty of sin -- we may
   feel that the form only too easily loses contact with the substance.

   246 Yet Athanasius is dealing with the essential fact of the case, that
   God must be true to Himself, and to the moral order in which men live,
   in all His dealings with sin for man's deliverance from it; and that He
   has been thus true to Himself in sending His son to live our life and
   to die our death for our salvation. Or again, when Anselm in the Cur
   Deus Homo speaks of the satisfaction which is rendered to God for the
   infringement of His honor by sin -- a satisfaction apart from which
   there can be no forgiveness -- we may feel again, and even more
   strongly, that the form of the thought is inadequate to the substance.
   But what Anselm means is that sin makes a real difference to God, and
   that even in forgiving God treats that difference as real, and cannot
   do otherwise. He cannot ignore it, or regard it as other or less than
   it is; if He did so, He would not be more gracious than He is in the
   Atonement, He would cease to be God. It is Anselm's profound grasp of
   this truth which, in spite of all its inadequacy in form, and of all
   the criticism to which its inadequacy has exposed it, makes the Cur
   Deus Homo the truest and greatest book on the Atonement that has ever
   been written. It is the same truth of a divine necessity for the
   Atonement which is emphasized by St. Paul in the third chapter of
   Romans, where he speaks of Christ's death as a demonstration of God's
   righteousness. Christ's death, we may paraphrase his meaning, is an act
   in which (so far as it is ordered in God's providence) God does justice
   to Himself. He does justice to His character as a gracious God,
   undoubtedly, who is moved with compassion for sinners: if He did not
   act in a way which displayed His compassion for sinners, He would not
   do justice to Himself; there would be no endeixis of His dikaiosune: it
   would be in abeyance: He would do Himself an injustice, or be untrue to
   Himself. It is with this in view that we can appreciate the arguments
   of writers like Diestel and Ritschl, that God's righteousness is
   synonymous with His grace. Such arguments are true to this extent, that
   God's righteousness includes His grace. He could not demonstrate it, He
   could not be true to Himself, if His grace remained hidden. We must
   not, however, conceive of this as if it constituted on our side a claim
   upon grace or upon forgiveness: such a claim would be a contradiction
   in terms. All that God does in Christ He does in free love, moved with
   compassion for the misery and doom of men. But though God's
   righteousness as demonstrated in Christ's death -- in other words, His
   action in consistency with His character -- includes, and, if we choose
   to interpret the term properly, even necessitates, the revelation of
   His grace, it is not this only -- I do not believe it is this primarily
   -- which St. Paul has here in mind. God, no doubt, would not do justice
   to Himself if He did not show His compassion for sinners; but, on the
   other hand -- and here is what the apostle is emphasizing -- He would
   not do justice to Himself if He displayed His compassion for sinners in
   a way which made light of sin, which ignored its tragic reality, or
   took it for less than it is. In this case He would again be doing
   Himself injustice; there would be no demonstration that He was true to
   Himself as the author and guardian of the moral constitution under
   which men live; as Anselm put it, He would have ceased to be God. The
   apostle combines the two sides. In Christ set forth a propitiation in
   His blood -- in other words, in the Atonement in which the sinless Son
   of God enters into the bitter realization of all that sin means for
   man, yet loves man under and through it all with an everlasting love --
   there is an endeixis of God's righteousness, a demonstration of His
   self-consistency, in virtue of which we can see how He is at the same
   time just Himself and the justifier of him who believes on Jesus, a God
   who is irreconcilable to sin, yet devises means that His banished be
   not expelled from Him. We may say reverently that this was the only way
   in which God could forgive. He cannot deny Himself, means at the same
   time He cannot deny His grace to the sinful, and He cannot deny the
   moral order in which alone He can live in fellowship with men; and we
   see the inviolableness of both asserted in the death of Jesus. Nothing
   else in the world demonstrates how real is God's love to the sinful,
   and how real the sin of the world is to God. And the love which comes
   to us through such an expression, bearing sin in all its reality, yet
   loving us through and beyond it, is the only love which at once
   forgives and regenerates the soul.

   It becomes credible also that there is a human necessity for the
   Atonement: in other words, that apart from it the conditions of being
   forgiven could no more be fulfilled by man than forgiveness could be
   bestowed by God.

   There are different tendencies in the modern mind with regard to this
   point. On the one hand, there are those who frankly admit the truth
   here asserted. Yes, they say, the Atonement is necessary for us. If we
   are to be saved from our sins, if our hearts are to be touched and won
   by the love of God, if we are to be emancipated from distrust and
   reconciled to the Father whose love we have injured, there must be a
   demonstration of that love so wonderful and overpowering that all
   pride, alienation and fear shall be overcome by it; and this is what we
   have in the death of Christ. It is a demonstration of love powerful
   enough to evoke penitence and faith in man, and it is through penitence
   and faith alone that man is separated from his sins and reconciled to
   God. A demonstration of love, too, must be given in act; it is not
   enough to be told that God loves: the reality of love lies in another
   region than that of words. In Christ on His cross the very thing itself
   is present, beyond all hope of telling wonderful, and without its
   irresistible appeal our hearts could never have been melted to
   penitence, and won for God. On the other hand, there are those who
   reject the Atonement on the very ground that for pardon and
   reconciliation nothing is required but repentance, the assumption being
   that repentance is something which man can and must produce out of his
   own resources.

   On these divergent tendencies in the modern mind I should wish to make
   the following remarks.

   First, the idea that man can repent as he ought, and whenever he will,
   without coming under any obligation to God for his repentance, but
   rather (it might almost be imagined) putting God under obligation by
   it, is one to which experience lends no support. Repentance is an
   adequate sense not of our folly, nor of our misery, but of our sin. As
   the New Testament puts it, it is repentance toward God. It is the
   consciousness of what our sin is to Him: of the wrong it does to His
   holiness, of the wound which it inflicts on His love. Now such a
   consciousness it is not in the power of the sinner to produce at will.
   The more deeply he has sinned, the more (so to speak) repentance is
   needed, the less is it in his power. It is the very nature of sin to
   darken the mind and harden the heart, to take away the knowledge of God
   alike in His holiness and in His love. Hence it is only through a
   revelation of God, and especially of what God is in relation to sin,
   that repentance can be evoked in the soul. Of all terms in the
   vocabulary of religion, repentance is probably the one which is most
   frequently misused. It is habitually applied to experiences which are
   not even remotely akin to true penitence. The self-centered regret
   which a man feels when his sin has found him out -- the wish,
   compounded of pride, shame, and anger at his own inconceivable folly,
   that he had not done it: these are spoken of as repentance. But they
   are not repentance at all. They have no relation to God. They
   constitute no fitness for a new relation to Him. They are no opening of
   the heart in the direction of His reconciling love. It is the simple
   truth that that sorrow of heart, that healing and sanctifying pain in
   which sin is really put away, is not ours in independence of God; it is
   a saving grace which is begotten in the soul under that impression of
   sin which it owes to the revelation of God in Christ. A man can no more
   repent than he can do anything else without a motive, and the motive
   which makes evangelic repentance possible does not enter into any man's
   world until he sees God as God makes Himself known in the death of
   Christ. All true penitents are children of the Cross. Their penitence
   is not their own creation, it is the reaction towards God produced in
   their souls by this demonstration of what sin is to Him, and of what
   His love does to reach and win the sinful.

   The other remark I wish to make refers to those who admit the death of
   Christ to be necessary for us -- necessary, in the way I have just
   described, to evoke penitence and trust in God -- but who on this very
   ground deny it to be divinely necessary. It had to be, because the hard
   hearts of men could not be touched by anything less moving: but that is
   all. This, I feel sure, is another instance of those false abstractions
   to which reference has already been made. There is no incompatibility
   between a divine necessity and a necessity for us. It may very well be
   the case that nothing less than the death of Christ could win the trust
   of sinful men for God, and at the same time that nothing else than the
   death of Christ could fully reveal the character of God in relation at
   once to sinners and to sin. For my own part I am persuaded, not only
   that there is no incompatibility between the two things, but that they
   are essentially related, and that only the acknowledgment of the divine
   necessity in Christ's death enables us to conceive in any rational way
   the power which it exercises over sinners in inducing repentance and
   faith. It would not evoke a reaction Godward unless God were really
   present in it, that is, unless it were a real revelation of His being
   and will: but in a real revelation of God's being and will there can be
   nothing arbitrary, nothing which is determined only from without,
   nothing, in other words, that is not divinely necessary. The
   demonstration of what God is, which is made in the death of Christ, is
   no doubt a demonstration singularly suited to call forth penitence and
   faith in man, but the necessity of it does not lie simply in the desire
   to call forth penitence and faith. It lies in the divine nature itself.
   God could not do justice to Himself, in relation to man and sin, in any
   way less awful than this; and it is the fact that He does not shrink
   even from this -- that in the Person of His Son He enters, if we may
   say so, into the whole responsibility of the situation created by sin
   -- which constitutes the death of Jesus a demonstration of divine love,
   compelling penitence and faith. Nothing less would have been sufficient
   to touch sinful hearts to their depths -- in that sense the Atonement
   is humanly necessary; but neither would anything else be a sufficient
   revelation of what God is in relation to sin and to sinful men -- in
   that sense it is divinely necessary. And the divine necessity is the
   fundamental one. The power exercised over us by the revelation of God
   at the Cross is dependent on the fact that the revelation is true -- in
   other words, that it exhibits the real relation of God to sinners and
   to sin. It is not by calculating what will win us, but by acting in
   consistency with Himself, that God irresistibly appeals to men. We dare
   not say that He must be gracious, as though grace could cease to be
   free, but we may say that He must be Himself, and that it is because He
   is what we see Him to be in the death of Christ, understood as the New
   Testament understands it, that sinners are moved to repentance and to
   trust in Him. That which the eternal being of God made necessary to Him
   in the presence of sin is the very thing which is necessary also to win
   the hearts of sinners. Nothing but what is divinely necessary could
   have met the necessities of sinful men.

   When we admit this twofold necessity for the Atonement, we can tell
   ourselves more clearly how we are to conceive Christ in it, in relation
   to God on the one hand and to man on the other. The Atonement is God's
   work. It is God who makes the Atonement in Christ. It is God who
   mediates His forgiveness of sins to us in this way. This is one aspect
   of the matter, and probably the one about which there is least dispute
   among Christians. But there is another aspect of it. The Mediator
   between God and man is Himself man, Christ Jesus. What is the relation
   of the man Christ Jesus to those for whom the Atonement is made? What
   is the proper term to designate, in this atoning work, what He is in
   relation to them? The doctrine of Atonement current in the Church in
   the generation preceding our own answered frankly that in His atoning
   work Christ is our substitute. He comes in our nature, and He comes
   into our place. He enters into all the responsibilities that sin has
   created for us, and He does justice to them in His death. He does not
   deny any of them: He does not take sin as anything less or else than it
   is to God; in perfect sinlessness He consents even to die, to submit to
   that awful experience in which the final reaction of God's holiness
   against sin is expressed. Death was not His due: it was something alien
   to One who did nothing amiss; but it was our due, and because it was
   ours He made it His. It was thus that He made Atonement. He bore our
   sins. He took to Himself all that they meant, all in which they had
   involved the world. He died for them, and in so doing acknowledged the
   sanctity of that order in which sin and death are indissolubly united.
   In other words, He did what the human race could not do for itself, yet
   what had to be done if sinners were to be saved: for how could men be
   saved if there were not made in humanity an acknowledgment of all that
   sin is to God, and of the justice of all that is entailed by sin under
   God's constitution of the world? Such an acknowledgment, as we have
   just seen, is divinely necessary, and necessary, too, for man, if sin
   is to be forgiven.

   This was the basis of fact on which the substitutionary character of
   Christ's sufferings and death in the Atonement was asserted. It may be
   admitted at once that when the term substitute is interpreted without
   reference to this basis of fact it lends itself very easily to
   misconstruction. It falls in with, if it does not suggest, the idea of
   a transference of merit and demerit, the sin of the world being carried
   over to Christ's account, and the merit of Christ to the world's
   account, as if the reconciliation of God and man, or the forgiveness of
   sins and the regeneration of souls, could be explained without the use
   of higher categories than are employed in bookkeeping. It is surely not
   necessary at this time of day to disclaim an interpretation of personal
   relations which makes use only of sub-personal categories. Merit and
   demerit cannot be mechanically transferred like sums in an account. The
   credit, so to speak, of one person in the moral sphere cannot become
   that of another, apart from moral conditions. It is the same truth, in
   other words, if we say that the figure of paying a debt is not in every
   respect adequate to describe what Christ does in making the Atonement.
   The figure, I believe, covers the truth; if it did not, we should not
   have the kind of language which frequently occurs in Scripture; but it
   is misread into falsehood and immorality whenever it is pressed as if
   it were exactly equivalent to the truth. But granting these drawbacks
   which attach to the word, is there not something in the work of Christ,
   as mediating the forgiveness of sins, which no other word can express?
   No matter on what subsequent conditions its virtue for us depends, what
   Christ did had to be done, or we should never have had forgiveness; we
   should never have known God, and His nature and will in relation to
   sin; we should never have had the motive which alone could beget real
   repentance; we should never have had the spirit which welcomes pardon
   and is capable of receiving it. We could not procure these things for
   ourselves, we could not produce them out of our own resources: but He
   by entering into our nature and lot, by taking on Him our
   responsibilities and dying our death, has so revealed God to us as to
   put them within our reach. We owe them to Him; in particular, and in
   the last resort, we owe them to the fact that He bore our sins in His
   own body to the tree. If we are not to say that the Atonement, as a
   work carried through in the sufferings and death of Christ, sufferings
   and death determined by our sin, is vicarious or substitutionary, what
   are we to call it?

   The only answer which has been given to this question, by those who
   continue to speak of Atonement at all, is that we must conceive Christ
   not as the substitute but as the representative of sinners. I venture
   to think that, with some advantages, the drawbacks of this word are
   quite as serious as those which attach to substitute. It makes it less
   easy, indeed, to think of the work of Christ as a finished work which
   benefits the sinner ipso facto, and apart from any relation between him
   and the Savior: but of what sort is the relation which it does suggest?
   A representative, in all ordinary circumstances, is provided or
   appointed by those whom he represents, and it is practically impossible
   to divest the term of the associations which this involves, misleading
   as they are in the present instance. The case for representative as
   opposed to substitute was put forward with great earnestness in an able
   review of The Death of Christ. The reviewer was far from saying that a
   writer, who finds a substitutionary doctrine throughout the New
   Testament is altogether wrong. He was willing to admit that if we look
   at the matter from what may be called an external point of view, no
   doubt we may speak of the death of Christ as in a certain sense
   substitutionary.' What this, certain sense' is he does not define. But
   no one, he held, can do justice to Paul who fails to recognize that the
   death of Christ was a racial act; and if we place ourselves at Paul's
   point of view, we shall see that to the eye of God the death of Christ
   presents itself less as an act which Christ does for the race than as
   an act which the race does in Christ.' In plain English, Paul teaches
   less that Christ died for the ungodly, than that the ungodly in Christ
   died for themselves. This brings out the logic of what representative
   means when representative is opposed to substitute. The representative
   is ours, we are in Him, and we are supposed to get over all the moral
   difficulties raised by the idea of substitution just because He is
   ours, and because we are one with Him. But the fundamental fact of the
   situation is that, to begin with, Christ is not ours, and we are not
   one with Him. In the apostle's view, and in point of fact, we are
   without Christ' (choris Christou). It is not we who have put Him there.
   It is not to us that His presence and His work in the world are due. If
   we had produced Him and put Him forward, we might call Him our
   representative, in the sense suggested by the sentences just quoted; we
   might say it is not so much He who dies for us, as we who die in Him;
   but a representative not produced by us, but given to us -- not chosen
   by us, but the elect of God -- is not a representative at all in the
   first instance, but a substitute. He stands in our stead, facing all
   our responsibilities for us as God would have them faced and it is what
   He does for us, and not the effect which this produces in us, still
   less the fantastic abstraction of a racial act, ' which is the
   Atonement in the sense of the New Testament. To speak of Christ as our
   representative, in the sense that His death is to God less an act which
   He does for the race than an act which the race does in Him, is in
   principle to deny the grace of the gospel, and to rob it of its motive
   power.

   To do justice to the truth here, both on its religious and its ethical
   side, it is necessary to put in their proper relation to one another
   the aspects of reality which the terms substitute and representative
   respectively suggest. The first is fundamental. Christ is God's gift to
   humanity. He stands in the midst of us, the pledge of God's love,
   accepting our responsibilities as God would have them accepted,
   offering to God, under the pressure of the world's sin and all its
   consequences, that perfect recognition of God's holiness in so visiting
   sin which men should have offered but could not; and in so doing He
   makes Atonement for us. In so doing, also, He is our substitute, not
   yet our representative. But the Atonement thus made is not a spectacle,
   it is a motive. It is not a transaction in business, or in bookkeeping,
   which is complete in itself; in view of the relations of God and man it
   belongs to its very nature to be a moral appeal. It is a divine
   challenge to men, which is designed to win their hearts. And when men
   are won -- when that which Christ in His love has done for them comes
   home to their souls -- when they are constrained by His infinite grace
   to the self-surrender of faith, then we may say He becomes their
   representative. They begin to feel that what He has done for them must
   not remain outside of them, but be reproduced somehow in their own
   life. The mind of Christ in relation to God and sin, as He bore their
   sins in His own body to the tree, must become their mind; this and
   nothing else is the Christian salvation. The power to work this change
   in them is found in the death of Christ itself; the more its meaning is
   realized as something there, in the world, outside of us, the more
   completely does it take effect within us. In proportion as we see and
   feel that out of pure love to us He stands in our place -- our
   substitute -- bearing our burden -- in that same proportion are we
   drawn into the relation to Him that makes Him our representative. But
   we should be careful here not to lose ourselves in soaring words. The
   New Testament has much to say about union with Christ, but I could
   almost be thankful that it has no such expression as mystical union.
   The only union it knows is a moral one -- a union due to the moral
   power of Christ's death, operating morally as a constraining motive on
   the human will, and begetting in believers the mind of Christ in
   relation to sin, but this moral union remains the problem and the task,
   as well as the reality and the truth, of the Christian life. Even when
   we think of Christ as our representative, and have the courage to say
   we died with Him, we have still to reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,
   and to put to death our members which are upon the earth; and to go
   past this, and speak of a mystical union with Christ in which we are
   lifted above the region of reflection and motive, of gratitude and
   moral responsibility, into some kind of metaphysical identity with the
   Lord, does not promote intelligibility, to say the least. If the
   Atonement were not, to begin with, outside of us -- if it were not in
   that sense objective, a finished work in which God in Christ makes a
   final revelation of Himself in relation to sinners and sin -- in other
   words, if Christ could not be conceived in it as our substitute, given
   by God to do in our place what we could not do for ourselves, there
   would be no way of recognizing or preaching or receiving it as a
   motive; while, on the other hand, if it did not operate as a motive, if
   it did not appeal to sinful men in such a way as to draw them into a
   moral fellowship with Christ -- in other words, if Christ did not under
   it become representative of us, our surety to God that we should yet be
   even as He in relation to God and to sin, we could only say that it had
   all been vain. Union with Christ, in short, is not a presupposition of
   Christ's work, which enables us to escape all the moral problems raised
   by the idea of a substitutionary Atonement; it is not a presupposition
   of Christ's work, it is its fruit. To see that it is its fruit is to
   have the final answer to the objection that substitution is immoral. If
   substitution, in the sense in which we must assert it of Christ, is the
   greatest moral force in the world -- if the truth which it covers, when
   it enters into the mind of man, enters with divine power to assimilate
   him to the Savior, uniting him to the Lord in a death to sin and a life
   to God -- obviously, to call it immoral is an abuse of language. The
   love which can literally go out of itself and make the burden of others
   its own is the radical principle of all the genuine and victorious
   morality in the world. And to say that love cannot do any such thing,
   that the whole formula of morality is, every man shall bear his own
   burden, is to deny the plainest facts of the moral life.

   Yet this is a point at which difficulty is felt by many in trying to
   grasp the Atonement. On the one hand, there do seem to be analogies to
   it, and points of attachment for it, in experience. No sin that has
   become real to conscience is ever outlived and overcome without
   expiation. There are consequences involved in it that go far beyond our
   perception at the moment, but they work themselves inexorably out, and
   our sin ceases to be a burden on conscience, and a fetter on will, only
   as we accept the punishment of our iniquity,' and become conscious of
   the holy love of God behind it. But the consequences of sin are never
   limited to the sinner. They spread beyond him in the organism of
   humanity, and when they strike visibly upon the innocent, the sense of
   guilt is deepened. We see that we have done we know not what, something
   deeply and mysteriously bad beyond all our reckoning, something that
   only a power and goodness transcending our own avail to check. It is
   one of the startling truths of the moral life that such consequences of
   sin, striking visibly upon the innocent, have in certain circumstances
   a peculiar power to redeem the sinful. When they are accepted, as they
   sometimes are accepted, without repining or complaint -- when they are
   borne, as they sometimes are borne, freely and lovingly by the
   innocent, because to the innocent the guilty are dear -- then something
   is appealed to in the guilty which is deeper than guilt, something may
   be touched which is deeper than sin, a new hope and faith may be born
   in them, to take hold of love so, wonderful, and by attaching
   themselves to it to transcend the evil past. The suffering of such love
   (they are dimly aware), or rather the power of such love persisting
   through all the suffering brought on it by sin, opens the gate of
   righteousness to the sinful in spite of all that has been; sin is
   outweighed by it, it is annulled, exhausted, transcended in it. The
   great Atonement of Christ is somehow in line with this, and we do not
   need to shrink from the analogy. If there were no witness,' as Dr.
   Robertson Nicoll puts it, in the world's deeper literature' -- if there
   were no witness, that is, in the universal experience of man -- to the
   fact of an Atonement, the Atonement would be useless, since the formula
   expressing it would be unintelligible.' It is the analogy of such
   experiences which makes the Atonement credible, yet it must always in
   some way transcend them. There is something in it which is ultimately
   incomparable. When we speak of others as innocent, the term is used
   only in a relative sense; there is no human conscience pure to God.
   When we speak of the sin of others coming in its consequences on the
   innocent, we speak of something in which the innocent are purely
   passive; if there is moral response on their part, the situation is not
   due to moral initiative of theirs. But with Christ it is different. He
   knew no sin, and He entered freely, deliberately, and as the very work
   of His calling, into all that sin meant for God and brought on man.
   Something that I experience in a particular relation, in which another
   has borne my sin and loved me through it, may help to open my eyes to
   the meaning of Christ's love; but when they are opened, what I see is
   the propitiation for the whole world. There is no guilt of the human
   race, there is no consequence in which sin has involved it, to which
   the holiness and love made manifest in Christ are unequal. He reveals
   to all sinful men the whole relation of God to them and to their sins
   -- a sanctity which is inexorable to sin, and cannot take it as other
   than it is in all its consequences, and a love which through all these
   consequences and under the weight of them all, will not let the sinful
   go. It is in this revelation of the character of God and of His
   relation to the sin of the world that the forgiveness of sins is
   revealed. It is not intimated in the air; it is preached, as St. Paul
   says, in this man'; it is mediated to the world through Him and
   specifically through His death, because it is through Him, and
   specifically through His death, that we get the knowledge of God's
   character which evokes penitence and faith, and brings the assurance of
   His pardon to the heart.

   From this point of view we may see how to answer the question that is
   sometimes asked about the relation of Christ's life to His death, or
   about the relation of both to the Atonement. If we say that what we
   have in the Atonement is an assurance of God's character, does it not
   follow at once that Christ's teaching and His life contribute to it as
   directly as His death? Is it not a signal illustration of the false
   abstractions which we have so often had cause to censure, when the
   death of Christ is taken as if it had art existence or a significance
   apart from His life, or could be identified with the Atonement in a way
   in which His life could not? I do not think this is so clear. Of course
   it is Christ Himself who is the Atonement or propitiation -- He,
   Himself, as St. John puts it, and not anything, not even His death,
   into which He does not enter. But it is He, Himself, as making to us
   the revelation of God in relation to sin and to sinners; and apart from
   death, as that in which the conscience of the race sees the final
   reaction of God against evil, this revelation is not fully made. If
   Christ had done less than die for us, therefore -- if He had separated
   Himself from us, or declined to be one with us, in the solemn
   experience in which the darkness of sin is sounded, and all its
   bitterness tasted, there would have been no Atonement. It is impossible
   to say this of any particular incident in His life, and in so far the
   unique emphasis laid on His death in the New Testament is justified.
   But I should go further than this, and say that even Christ's life,
   taken as it stands in the Gospels, only enters into the Atonement, and
   has reconciling power, because it is pervaded from beginning to end by
   the consciousness of His death. Instead of depriving His death of the
   peculiar significance, Scripture assigns to it, and making it no more
   than the termination, or at least the consummation, of His life, I
   should rather argue that the Scriptural emphasis is right, and that His
   life attains its true interpretation only as we find in it everywhere
   the power and purpose of His death. There is nothing artificial or
   unnatural in this. There are, plenty of people who never have death out
   of their minds an hour at a time. They are not cowards, nor mad, nor
   even somber: they may have purposes and hopes and gaieties as well as
   others; but they see life steadily and see it whole and of all their
   thoughts the one which has most determining and omnipresent power is
   the thought of the inevitable end. There is death in all their life. It
   was not, certainly, as the inevitable end, the inevitable debt of
   nature,' that death was present to the mind of Christ; but if we can
   trust the Evangelists at all, from the hour of His baptism it was
   present to His mind as something involved in His vocation; and it was a
   presence so tremendous that it absorbed everything into itself. I have
   a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened until it be
   accomplished. ' Instead of saying that Christ's life as well as His
   death contributed to the Atonement -- that His active obedience (to use
   the theological formula) as well as His passive obedience was essential
   to His propitiation -- we should rather say that His life is part of
   His death: a deliberate and conscious descent, ever deeper and deeper,
   into the dark valley where at the last hour the last reality of sin was
   to be met and borne. And if the objection is made that after all this
   only means that death is the most vital point of life, its intensest
   focus, I should not wish to make any reply. Our Lord's Passion is His
   sublimest action -- an action so potent that all His other actions are
   sublated in it, and we know everything when we know that He died for
   our sins.

   The desire to bring the life of Christ as well as His death into the
   Atonement has probably part of its motive in the feeling that when the
   death is separated from the life it loses moral character: it is
   reduced to a merely physical incident, which cannot carry such vast
   significance as the Atonement. Such a feeling certainly exists, and
   finds expression in many forms. How often, for example, we hear it said
   that it is not the death which atones, but the spirit in which the
   Savior died -- not His sufferings which expiate sin, but the innocence,
   the meekness, the love to man and obedience to God in which they were
   borne. The Atonement, in short, was a moral achievement, to which
   physical suffering and death are essentially irrelevant. This is our
   old enemy, the false abstraction, once more, and that in the most
   aggressive form. The contrast of physical and moral is made absolute at
   the very point at which it ceases to exist. As against such absolute
   distinctions we must hold that if Christ had not really died for us,
   there would have been no Atonement at all, and on the other hand that
   what are called His physical sufferings and death have no existence
   simply as physical, they are essential elements in the moral
   achievement of the Passion. It leads to no truth to say that it is not
   His death, but the spirit in which He died, that atones for sin, the
   spirit in which He died has its being in His death, and in nothing else
   in the world.

   It seems to me that what is really wanted here, both by those who seek
   to co-ordinate Christ's life with His death in the Atonement, and by
   those who distinguish between His death and the spirit in which He
   died, is some means of keeping hold of the Person of Christ in His
   work, and that this is not effectively done apart from the New
   Testament belief in the Resurrection. There is no doubt that in
   speaking of the death of Christ as that through which the forgiveness
   of sins is mediated to us we are liable to think of it as if it were
   only an event in the past. We take the representation of it in the
   Gospel and say, Such and such is the impression which this event
   produces upon me; I feel in it how God is opposed to sin, and how I
   ought to be opposed to it; I feel in it how God's love appeals to me to
   share His mind about sin; and as I yield to this appeal I am at once
   set free from sin and assured of pardon; this is the only ethical
   forgiveness; to know this experimentally is to know the Gospel.' No one
   can have any interest in disputing another's obligation to Christ, but
   it may fairly be questioned whether this kind of obligation to Christ
   amounts to Christianity in the sense of the New Testament. There is no
   living Christ here, no coming of the living Christ to the soul, in the
   power of the Atonement, to bring it to God. But this is what the New
   Testament shows us. It is He who is the propitiation for our sins -- He
   who died for them and rose again. The New Testament preaches a Christ
   who was dead and is alive, not a Christ who was alive and is dead. It
   is a mistake to suppose that the New Testament conception of the
   Gospel, involving as it does the spiritual presence and action of
   Christ, in the power of the Atonement, is a matter of indifference to
   us, and that in all our thinking and preaching we must remain within
   purely historical limits if by purely historical limits is meant that
   our creed must end with the words crucified, dead, and buried.' To
   preach the Atonement means not only to preach One who bore our sins in
   death, but One who by rising again from the dead demonstrated the final
   defeat of sin, and One who comes in the power of His risen life --
   which means, in the power of the Atonement accepted by God -- to make
   all who commit themselves to Him in faith partakers in His victory. It
   is not His death, as an incident in the remote past, however
   significant it may be; it is the Lord Himself, appealing to us in the
   virtue of His death, who assures us of pardon and restores our souls.

   One of the most singular phenomena in the attitude of many modern minds
   to the Atonement is the disposition to plead against the Atonement what
   the New Testament represents as its fruits. It is as though it had done
   its work so thoroughly that people could not believe that it ever
   needed to be done at all. The idea of fellowship with Christ, for
   example, is constantly urged against the idea that Christ died for us,
   and by His death made all mankind His debtors in a way in which we
   cannot make debtors of each other. The New Testament itself is pressed
   into the service. It is pointed out that our Lord called His disciples
   to drink of His cup and to be baptized with His baptism, where the
   baptism and the cup are figures of His Passion; and it is argued that
   there cannot be anything unique in His experience or service, anything
   which He does for men which it is beyond the power of His disciples to
   do also. Or again, reference is made to St. Paul's words to the
   Colossians, Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up
   on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my
   flesh for His body's sake, which is the Church'; and it is argued that
   St. Paul here represents himself as doing exactly what Christ did, or
   even as supplementing a work which Christ admittedly left imperfect.
   The same idea is traced where the Christian is represented as called
   into the fellowship of the Son of God, or more specifically as called
   to know the fellowship of His sufferings by becoming conformed to His
   death. It is seen pervading the New Testament in the conception of the
   Christian as a man in Christ. And to descend from the apostolic age to
   our own, it has been put by an American theologian into the
   epigrammatic form that Christ redeems us by making us redeemers. What,
   it may be asked, is the truth in all this? and how is it related to
   what we have already seen cause to assert about the uniqueness of
   Christ's work in making atonement for sin, or mediating the divine
   forgiveness to man?

   I do not think it is impossible or even difficult to reconcile the two:
   it is done, indeed, whenever we see that the life to which we are
   summoned, in the fellowship of Christ, is a life which we owe
   altogether to Him, and which He does not in the least owe to us. The
   question really raised is this, Has Jesus Christ a place of His own in
   the Christian religion? Is it true that there is one Mediator between
   God and man, Himself man, this man, Christ Jesus? In spite of the
   paradoxical assertion of Harnack to the contrary, it is not possible to
   deny, with any plausibility, that this was the mind of Christ Himself,
   and that it has been the mind of all who call Him Lord. He knew and
   taught, what they have learned by experience as well as by His word,
   that all men must owe to Him their knowledge of the Father, their place
   in the Kingdom of God, and their part in all its blessings. He could
   not have taught this of any but Himself, nor is it the experience of
   the Church that such blessings come through any other. Accordingly,
   when Christ calls on men to drink His cup and to be baptized with His
   baptism, while He may quite well mean, and does mean, that His life and
   death are to be the inspiration of theirs, and while He may quite well
   encourage them to believe that sacrifice on their part, as on His, will
   contribute to bless the world, He need not mean, and we may be sure He
   does not mean, that their blood is, like His, the blood of the
   covenant, or that their sinful lives, even when purged and quickened by
   His Spirit, could be, like His sinless life, described as the world's
   ransom. The same considerations apply to the passages quoted from St.
   Paul, and especially to the words in Colossians 1:24. The very purpose
   of the Epistle to the Colossians is to assert the exclusive and perfect
   mediatorship of Christ, alike in creation and redemption; all that we
   call being, and all that we call reconciliation, has to be defined by
   relation to Him, and not by relation to any other persons or powers,
   visible or invisible; and however gladly Paul might reflect that in his
   enthusiasm for suffering he was continuing Christ's work, and
   exhausting some of the afflictions -- they were Christ's own
   afflictions -- which had yet to be endured ere the Church could be made
   perfect, it is nothing short of grotesque to suppose that in this
   connection he conceived of himself as doing what Christ did, atoning
   for sin, and reconciling the world to God. All this was done already,
   perfectly done, done for the whole world; and it was on the basis of
   it, and under the inspiration of it, that the apostle sustained his
   enthusiasm for a life of toil and pain in the service of men. Always,
   where we have Christian experience to deal with, it is the Christ
   through whom the divine forgiveness comes to us at the Cross -- the
   Christ of the substitutionary Atonement, who bore all our burden alone,
   and did a work to which we can forever recur, but to which we did not
   and do not and never can contribute at all -- it is this Christ who
   constrains us to find our representative with God in Himself, and to
   become ourselves His representatives to men. It is as we truly
   represent Him that we can expect our testimony to Him to find
   acceptance, but that testimony far transcends everything that our
   service enables men to measure. What is anything that a sinful man,
   saved by grace, can do for his Lord or for his kind, compared with what
   the sinless Lord has done for the sinful race? It is true that He calls
   us to drink of His cup, to learn the fellowship of His sufferings, even
   to be conformed to His death; but under all the intimate relationship
   the eternal difference remains which makes Him Lord -- He knew no sin,
   and we could make no atonement. It is the goal of our life to be found
   in Him; but I cannot understand the man who thinks it more profound to
   identify himself with Christ and share in the work of redeeming the
   world, than to abandon himself to Christ and share in the world's
   experience of being redeemed. And I am very sure that in the New
   Testament the last is first and fundamental.
