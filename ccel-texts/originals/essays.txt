ESSAY

    ON THE

INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE

   IT is a strange, though familiar fact, that great differences of
   opinion exist respecting the Interpretation of Scripture. All
   Christians receive the Old and New Testament as sacred writings, but
   they are not agreed about the meaning which they attribute to them. The
   book itself remains as at the first; the commentators seem rather to
   reflect the changing atmosphere of the world or of the Church.
   Different individuals or bodies of Christians have a different point of
   view, to which their interpretation is narrowed or made to conform. It
   is assumed, as natural and necessary, that the same words will present
   one idea to the mind of the Protestant, another to the Roman Catholic;
   one meaning to the German, another to the English interpreter. The
   Ultramontane or Anglican divine is not supposed to be impartial in his
   treatment of passages which afford an apparent foundation for the
   doctrine of purgatory or the primacy of St. Peter on the one hand, or
   the three orders of clergy and the divine origin of episcopacy on the
   other. It is a received view with many, that the meaning of the Bible
   is to be defined by that of the Prayer-book; while there are other's
   who interpret the Bible and the Bible only' with a silent reference to
   the traditions of the Reformation. Philosophical differences are in the
   background, into which the differences about Scripture also resolve
   themselves. They seem to run up at last into a difference of opinion
   respecting Revelation itself--whether given beside the human faculties
   or through them, whether an interruption of the laws of nature or their
   perfection and fulfilment.

   This effort to pull the authority of Scripture in different directions
   is not peculiar to our own day; the same phenomenon appears in the past
   history of the Church. At the Reformation, in the Nicene or Pelagian
   times, the New Testament was the ground over which men fought; it might
   also be compared to the armoury which furnished them with weapons.
   Opposite aspects of the truth which it contains were appropriated by
   different sides. Justified by faith without works' and justified by
   faith as well as works' are equally Scriptural expressions; the one has
   become the formula of Protestants, the other of Roman Catholics. The
   fifth and ninth chapters of the Romans, single verses such as 1 Cor.
   iii. 15; John iii. 3, still bear traces of many a life-long strife in
   the pages of commentators. The difference of interpretation which
   prevails among ourselves is partly traditional, that is to say,
   inherited from the controversies of former ages. The use made of
   Scripture by Fathers of the Church, as well as by Luther and Calvin,
   affects our idea of its meaning at the present hour.

   Another cause of the multitude of interpretations is the growth or
   progress of the human mind itself. Modes of interpreting vary as time
   goes on; they partake of the general state of literature or knowledge.
   It has not been easily or at once that mankind have learned to realize
   the character of sacred writings--they seem almost necessarily to veil
   themselves from human eyes as circumstances change; it is the old age
   of the world only that has at length understood its childhood. (Or
   rather perhaps is beginning to understand it, and learning to make
   allowance for its own deficiency of knowledge; for the infancy of the
   human race, as of the individual, affords but few indications of the
   workings of the mind within.) More often than we suppose, the great
   sayings and doings upon the earth, thoughts that breathe and words that
   burn,' are lost in a sort of chaos to the apprehension of those that
   come after. Much of past history is dimly seen and receives only a
   conventional interpretation, even when the memorials of it remain.
   There is a time at which the freshness of early literature is lost;
   mankind have turned rhetoricians, and no longer write or feel in the
   spirit which created it. In this unimaginative period in which sacred
   or ancient writings are partially unintelligible, many methods have
   been taken at different times to adapt the ideas of the past to the
   wants of the present. One age has wandered into the flowery paths of
   allegory,

   In pious meditation fancy fed.'

   Another has straitened the liberty of the Gospel by a rigid application
   of logic, the former being a method which was at first more naturally
   applied to the Old Testament, the latter to the New. Both methods of
   interpretation, the mystical and logical, as they may be termed, have
   been practised on the Vedas and the Koran, as well as on the Jewish and
   Christian Scriptures, the true glory and note of divinity in these
   latter being not that they have hidden mysterious or double meanings,
   but a simple and universal one, which is beyond them and will survive
   them. Since the revival of literature, interpreters have not
   unfrequently fallen into error of another kind from a pedantic and
   misplaced use of classical learning; the minute examination of words
   often withdrawing the mind from more important matters. A tendency may
   be observed within the last century to clothe systems of philosophy in
   the phraseology of Scripture. But new wine cannot thus be put into old
   bottles.' Though roughly distinguishable by different ages, these modes
   or tendencies also exist together; the remains of all of them may be
   remarked in some of the popular commentaries of our own day.

   More common than any of these methods, and not peculiar to any age, is
   that which may be called by way of distinction the rhetorical one. The
   tendency to exaggerate or amplify the meaning of simple words for the
   sake of edification may indeed have a practical use in sermons, the
   object of which is to awaken not so much the intellect as the heart and
   conscience. Spiritual food, like natural, may require to be of a
   certain bulk to nourish the human mind. But this tendency to
   edification' has had an unfortunate influence on the interpretation of
   Scripture. For the preacher almost necessarily oversteps the limits of
   actual knowledge, his feelings overflow with the subject; even if he
   have the power, he has seldom the time for accurate thought or inquiry.
   And in the course of years spent in writing, perhaps, without study, he
   is apt to persuade himself, if not others, of the truth of his own
   repetitions. The trivial consideration of making a discourse of
   sufficient length is often a reason why he overlays the words of Christ
   and his Apostles with commonplaces. The meaning of the text is not
   always the object which he has in view, but some moral or religious
   lesson which he has found it necessary to append to it; some cause
   which he is pleading, some error of the day which he has to combat. And
   while in some passages he hardly dares to trust himself with the full
   force of Scripture (Matt. v. 34; ix. 13; xix. 21: Acts v. 29), in
   others he extracts more from words than they really imply (Matt. xxii.
   21; xxviii. 20: Rom. xiii. 1; &c.), being more eager to guard against
   the abuse of some precept than to enforce it, attenuating or adapting
   the utterance of prophecy to the requirements or to the measure of
   modern times. Any one who has ever written sermons is aware how hard it
   is to apply Scripture to the wants of his hearers and at the same time
   to preserve its meaning.

   The phenomenon which has been described in the preceding pages is so
   familiar, and yet so extraordinary, that it requires an effort of
   thought to appreciate its true nature. We do not at once see the
   absurdity of the same words having many senses, or free our minds from
   the illusion that the Apostle or Evangelist must have written with a
   reference to the creeds or controversies or circumstances of other
   times. Let it be considered, then, that this extreme variety of
   interpretation is found to exist in the case of no other book, but of
   the Scriptures only. Other writings are preserved to us in dead
   languages--Greek, Latin, Oriental, some of them in fragments, all of
   them originally in manuscript. It is true that difficulties arise in
   the explanation of these writings, especially in the most ancient, from
   our imperfect acquaintance with the meaning of words, or the
   defectiveness of copies, or the want of some historical or geographical
   information which is required to present an event or character in its
   true bearing. In comparison with the wealth and light of modern
   literature, our knowledge of Greek classical authors, for example, may
   be called imperfect and shadowy. Some of them have another sort of
   difficulty arising from subtlety or abruptness in the use of language;
   in lyric poetry especially, and some of the earlier prose, the
   greatness of the thought struggles with the stammering lips. It may be
   observed that all these difficulties occur also in Scripture; they are
   found equally in sacred and profane literature. But the meaning of
   classical authors is known with comparative certainty; and the
   interpretation of them seems to rest on a scientific basis. It is not,
   therefore, to philological or historical difficulties that the greater
   part of the uncertainty in the interpretation of Scripture is to be
   attributed. No ignorance of Hebrew or Greek is sufficient to account
   for it. Even the Vedas and the Zendavesta, though beset by obscurities
   of language probably greater than are found in any portion of the
   Bible, are interpreted, at least by European scholars, according to
   fixed rules, and beginning to be clearly understood.

   To bring the parallel home, let us imagine the remains of some
   well-known Greek author, as Plato or Sophocles, receiving the same
   treatment at the hands of the world which the Scriptures have
   experienced. The text of such an author, when first printed by Aldus or
   Stephens, would be gathered from the imperfect or miswritten copies
   which fell in the way of the editors; after awhile older and better
   manuscripts come to light, and the power of using and estimating the
   value of manuscripts is greatly improved. We may suppose, further, that
   the readings of these older copies do not always conform to some
   received canons of criticism. Up to the year 1550, or 1624,
   alterations, often proceeding on no principle, have been introduced
   into the text; but now a stand is made--an edition which appeared at
   the latter of the two dates just mentioned is invested with authority;
   this authorized text is a pièce de résistance against innovation. Many
   reasons are given why it is better to have bad readings to which the
   world is accustomed than good ones which are novel and strange--why the
   later manuscripts of Plato or Sophocles are often to be preferred to
   earlier ones--why it is useless to remove imperfections where perfect
   accuracy is not to be attained. A fear of disturbing the critical
   canons which have come down from former ages is, however, suspected to
   be one reason for the opposition. And custom and prejudice, and the
   nicety of the subject, and all the arguments which are intelligible to
   the many against the truth, which is intelligible only to the few, are
   thrown into the scale to preserve the works of Plato or Sophocles as
   nearly as possible in the received text.

   Leaving the text, we proceed to interpret and translate. The meaning of
   Greek words is known with tolerable certainty; and the grammar of the
   Greek language has been minutely analyzed both in ancient and modern
   times. Yet the interpretation of Sophocles is tentative and uncertain;
   it seems to vary from age to age: to some the great tragedian has
   appeared to embody in his choruses certain theological or moral ideas
   of his own age or country; there are others who find there an allegory
   of the Christian religion or of the history of modern Europe. Several
   schools of critics have commented on his works; to the Englishman he
   has presented one meaning, to the Frenchman another, to the German a
   third; the interpretations have also differed with the philosophical
   systems which the interpreters espoused. To one the same words have
   appeared to bear a moral, to another a symbolical meaning; a third is
   determined wholly by the authority of old commentators; while there is
   a disposition to condemn the scholar who seeks to interpret Sophocles
   from himself only, and with reference to the ideas and beliefs of the
   age in which he lived. And the error of such an one is attributed not
   only to some intellectual but even to a moral obliquity which prevents
   his seeing the true meaning.

   It would be tedious to follow into details the absurdity which has been
   supposed. By such methods it would be truly said that Sophocles or
   Plato may be made to mean anything. It would seem as if some Novum
   Organum were needed to lay down rules of interpretation for ancient
   literature. Still one other supposition has to be introduced which will
   appear, perhaps, more extravagant than any which have preceded.
   Conceive then that these modes of interpreting Sophocles had existed
   for ages; that great institutions and interests had become interwoven
   with them, and in some degree even the honour of nations and
   churches--is it too much to say that in such a case they would be
   changed with difficulty, and that they would continue to be maintained
   long after critics and philosophers had seen that they were
   indefensible?

   No one who has a Christian feeling would place classical on a level
   with sacred literature; and there are other particulars in which the
   preceding comparison fails, as, for example, the style and subject.
   But, however different the subject, although the interpretation of
   Scripture requires a vision and faculty divine,' or at least a moral
   and religious interest which is not needed in the study of a Greek poet
   or philosopher, yet in what may be termed the externals of
   interpretation, that is to say, the meaning of words, the connexion of
   sentences, the settlement of the text, the evidence of facts, the same
   rules apply to the Old and New Testaments as to other books. And the
   figure is no exaggeration of the erring fancy of men in the use of
   Scripture, or of the tenacity with which they cling to the
   interpretations of other times, or of the arguments by which they
   maintain them. All the resources of knowledge may be turned into a
   means not of discovering the true rendering, but of upholding a
   received one. Grammar appears to start from an independent point of
   view, yet inquiries into the use of the article or the preposition have
   been observed to wind round into a defence of some doctrine. Rhetoric
   often magnifies its own want of taste into the design of inspiration.
   Logic (that other mode of rhetoric) is apt to lend itself to the
   illusion, by stating erroneous explanations with a clearness which is
   mistaken for truth. Metaphysical aid' carries away the common
   understanding into a region where it must blindly follow. Learning
   obscures as well as illustrates; it heaps up chaff when there is no
   more wheat. These are some of the ways in which the sense of Scripture
   has become confused, by the help of tradition, in the course of ages,
   under a load of commentators.

   The book itself remains as at the first, unchanged amid the changing
   interpretations of it. The office of the interpreter is not to add
   another, but to recover the original one; the meaning, that is, of the
   words as they struck on the ears or flashed before the eyes of those
   who first heard and read them. He has to transfer himself to another
   age; to imagine that he is a disciple of Christ or Paul; to disengage
   himself from all that follows. The history of Christendom is nothing to
   him; but only the scene at Galilee or Jerusalem, the handful of
   believers who gathered themselves together at Ephesus, or Corinth, or
   Rome. His eye is fixed on the form of one like the Son of man, or of
   the Prophet who was girded with a garment of camel's hair, or of the
   Apostle who had a thorn in the flesh. The greatness of the Roman Empire
   is nothing to him; it is an inner not an outer world that he is
   striving to restore. All the after-thoughts of theology are nothing to
   him; they are not the true lights which light him in difficult places.
   His concern is with a book in which, as in other ancient writings, are
   some things of which we are ignorant; which defect of our knowledge
   cannot, however, be supplied by the conjectures of fathers or divines.
   The simple words of that book he tries to preserve absolutely pure from
   the refinements or distinctions of later times. He acknowledges that
   they are fragmentary, and would suspect himself, if out of fragments he
   were able to create a well-rounded system or a continuous history. The
   greater part of his learning is a knowledge of the text itself; he has
   no delight in the voluminous literature which has overgrown it. He has
   no theory of interpretation; a few rules guarding against common errors
   are enough for him. His object is to read Scripture like any other
   book, with a real interest and not merely a conventional one. He wants
   to be able to open his eyes and see or imagine things as they truly
   are.

   Nothing would be more likely to restore a natural feeling on this
   subject than a history of the Interpretation of Scripture. It would
   take us back to the beginning; it would present in one view the causes
   which have darkened the meaning of words in the course of ages; it
   would clear away the remains of dogmas, systems, controversies, which
   are encrusted upon them. It would show us the erring fancy' of
   interpreters assuming sometimes to have the Spirit of God Himself, yet
   unable to pass beyond the limits of their own age, and with a judgement
   often biassed by party. Great names there have been among them, names
   of men who may be reckoned also among the benefactors of the human
   race, yet comparatively few who have understood the thoughts of other
   times, or who have bent their minds to interrogate' the meaning of
   words. Such a work would enable us to separate the elements of doctrine
   and tradition with which the meaning of Scripture is encumbered in our
   own day. It would mark the different epochs of interpretation from the
   time when the living word was in process of becoming a book to Origen
   and Tertullian, from Origen to Jerome and Augustine, from Jerome and
   Augustine to Abelard and Aquinas; again, making a new beginning with
   the revival of literature, from Erasmus, the father of Biblical
   criticism in more recent times, with Calvin and Beza for his immediate
   successors, through Grotius and Hammond, down to De Wette and Meyer,
   our own contemporaries. We should see how the mystical interpretation
   of Scripture originated in the Alexandrian age; how it blended with the
   logical and rhetorical; how both received weight and currency from
   their use in support of the claims and teaching of the Church. We
   should notice how the new learning' of the fifteenth and sixteenth
   centuries gradually awakened the critical faculty in the study of the
   sacred writings; how Biblical criticism has slowly but surely followed
   in the track of philological and historical (not without a remoter
   influence exercised upon it also by natural science); how, too, the
   form of the scholastic literature, and even of notes on the classics,
   insensibly communicated itself to commentaries on Scripture. We should
   see how the word inspiration, from being used in a general way to
   express what may be called the prophetic spirit of Scripture, has
   passed, within the last two centuries, into a sort of technical term;
   how, in other instances, the practice or feeling of earlier ages has
   been hollowed out into the theory or system of later ones. We should
   observe how the popular explanations of prophecy as in heathen (Thucyd.
   ii. 54), so also in Christian times, had adapted themselves to the
   circumstances of mankind. We might remark that in our own country, and
   in the present generation especially, the interpretation of Scripture
   had assumed an apologetic character, as though making an effort to
   defend itself against some supposed inroad of science and Criticism;
   while among German commentators there is, for the first time in the
   history of the world, an approach to agreement and certainty. For
   example, the diversity among German writers on prophecy is far less
   than among English ones. That is a new phenomenon which has to be
   acknowledged. More than any other subject of human knowledge, Biblical
   criticism has hung to the past; it has been hitherto found truer to the
   traditions of the Church than to the words of Christ. It has made,
   however, two great steps onward--at the time of the Reformation and in
   our day. The diffusion of a critical spirit in history and literature
   is affecting the criticism of the Bible in our own day in a manner not
   unlike the burst of intellectual life in the fifteenth or sixteenth
   centuries. Educated persons are beginning to ask, not what Scripture
   may be made to mean, but what it does. And it is no exaggeration to say
   that he who in the present state of knowledge will confine himself to
   the plain meaning of words and the study of their context may know more
   of the original spirit and intention of the authors of the New
   Testament than all the controversial writers of former ages put
   together.

   Such a history would be of great value to philosophy as well as to
   theology. It would be the history of the human mind in one of its most
   remarkable manifestations. For ages which are not original show their
   character in the interpretation of ancient writings. Creating nothing,
   and incapable of that effort of imagination which is required in a true
   criticism of the past, they read and explain the thoughts of former
   times by the conventional modes of their own. Such a history would form
   a kind of preface or prolegomena to the study of Scripture. Like the
   history of science, it would save many a useless toil; it would
   indicate the uncertainties on which it is not worth while to speculate
   further; the by-paths or labyrinths in which men lose themselves; the
   mines that are already worked out. He who reflects on the multitude of
   explanations which already exist of the number of the beast,' the two
   witnesses,' the little horn,' the man of sin,' who observes the manner
   in which these explanations have varied with the political movements of
   our own time, will be unwilling to devote himself to a method of
   inquiry in which there is so little appearance of certainty or
   progress. These interpretations would destroy one another if they were
   all placed side by side in a tabular analysis. It is art instructive
   fact, which may be mentioned in passing, that Joseph Mede, the greatest
   authority on this subject, twice fixed the end of the world in the last
   century and once during his own lifetime. In like manner, he who
   notices the circumstance that the explanations of the first chapter of
   Genesis have slowly changed, and, as it were, retreated before the
   advance of geology, will be unwilling to add another to the spurious
   reconcilements of science and revelation. Or, to take an example of
   another kind, the Protestant divine who perceives that the types and
   figures of the Old Testament are employed by Roman Catholics in support
   of the tenets of their church, will be careful not to use weapons which
   it is impossible to guide, and which may with equal force be turned
   against himself. Those who have handled them on the Protestant side
   have before now fallen victims to them, not observing as they fell that
   it was by their own hand.

   Much of the uncertainty which prevails in the interpretation of
   Scripture arises out of party efforts to wrest its meaning to different
   sides. There are, however, deeper reasons which have hindered the
   natural meaning of the text from immediately and universally
   prevailing. One of these is the unsettled state of many questions which
   have an important but indirect bearing on this subject. Some of these
   questions veil themselves in ambiguous terms; and no one likes to draw
   them out of their hiding-place into the light of day. In natural
   science it is felt to be useless to build on assumptions; in history we
   look with suspicion on a priori ideas of what ought to have been; in
   mathematics, when a step is wrong, we pull the house down until we
   reach the point at which the error is discovered. But in theology it is
   otherwise; there the tendency has been to conceal the unsoundness of
   the foundation under the fairness and loftiness of the superstructure.
   It has been thought safer to allow arguments to stand which, although
   fallacious, have been on the right side, than to point out their
   defect. And thus many principles have imperceptibly grown up which have
   overridden facts. No one would interpret Scripture, as many do, but for
   certain previous suppositions with which we come to the perusal of it.
   There can be no error in the Word of God,' therefore the discrepancies
   in the books of Kings and Chronicles are only apparent, or may be
   attributed to differences in the copies:--It is a thousand times more
   likely that the interpreter should err than the inspired writer.' For a
   like reason the failure of a prophecy is never admitted, in spite of
   Scripture and of history (Jer. xxxvi. 30: Isa. xxiii: Amos vii. 10-17);
   the mention of a name later than the supposed age of the prophet is not
   allowed, as in other writings, to be taken in evidence of the date
   (Isa. xlv. 1). The accuracy of the Old Testament is measured not by the
   standard of primaeval history, but of a modern critical one, which,
   contrary to all probability, is supposed to be attained; this arbitrary
   standard once assumed, it becomes a point of honour or of faith to
   defend every name, date, place, which occurs. Or to take another class
   of questions, it is said that the various theories of the origin of the
   three first Gospels are all equally unknown to the Holy Catholic
   Church,' or as another writer of a different school expresses himself,
   they tend to sap the inspiration of the New Testament.' Again, the
   language in which our Saviour speaks of His own union with the Father
   is interpreted by the language of the creeds. Those who remonstrate
   against double senses, allegorical interpretations, forced
   reconcilements, find themselves met by a sort of presupposition that
   God speaks not as man speaks.' The limitation of the human faculties is
   confusedly appealed to as a reason for abstaining from investigations
   which are quite within their limits. The suspicion of Deism, or perhaps
   of Atheism, awaits inquiry. By such fears a good man refuses to be
   influenced; a philosophical mind is apt to cast them aside with too
   much bitterness. It is better to close the book than to read it under
   conditions of thought which are imposed from without. Whether those
   conditions of thought are the traditions of the Church, or the opinions
   of the religious world--Catholic or Protestant -- makes no difference.
   They are inconsistent with the freedom of the truth and the moral
   character of the Gospel. It becomes necessary, therefore, to examine
   briefly some of these prior questions which lie in the way of a
   reasonable criticism.

   § 2.

   Among these previous questions, that which first presents itself is the
   one already alluded to--the question of inspiration. Almost all
   Christians agree in the word, which use and tradition have consecrated
   to express the reverence which they truly feel for the Old and New
   Testaments. But here the agreement of opinion ends; the meaning of
   inspiration has been variously explained, or more often passed over in
   silence from a fear of stirring the difficulties that would arise about
   it. It is one of those theological terms which may be regarded as great
   peacemakers,' but which are also sources of distrust and
   misunderstanding. For while we are ready to shake hands with any one
   who uses the same language as ourselves, a doubt is apt to insinuate
   itself whether he takes language in the same senses--whether a
   particular term conveys all the associations to another which it does
   to ourselves--whether it is not possible that one who disagrees about
   the word may not be more nearly agreed about the thing. The advice has,
   indeed, been given to the theologian that he should take care of words
   and leave things to themselves;' the authority, however, who gives the
   advice is not good--it is placed by Goethe in the mouth of
   Mephistopheles. Pascal seriously charges the Jesuits with acting on a
   similar maxim--excommunicating those who meant the same thing and said
   another, holding communion with those who said the same thing and meant
   another. But this is not the way to heal the wounds of the Church of
   Christ; we cannot thus skin and film' the weak places of theology.
   Errors about words, and the attribution to words themselves of an
   excessive importance, lie at the root of theological as of other
   confusions. In theology they are more dangerous than in other sciences,
   because they cannot so readily be brought to the test of facts.

   The word inspiration has received more numerous gradations and
   distinctions of meaning than perhaps any other in the whole of
   theology. There is an inspiration of superintendence and an inspiration
   of suggestion; an inspiration which would have been consistent with the
   Apostle or Evangelist falling into error, and an inspiration which
   would have prevented him from erring; verbal organic inspiration by
   which the inspired person is the passive utterer of a Divine Word, and
   an inspiration which acts through the character of the sacred writer;
   there is an inspiration which absolutely communicates the fact to be
   revealed or statement to be made, and an inspiration which does not
   supersede the ordinary knowledge of human events; there is an
   inspiration which demands infallibility in matters of doctrine, but
   allows for mistakes in fact. Lastly, there is a view of inspiration
   which recognizes only its supernatural and prophetic character, and a
   view of inspiration which regards the Apostles and Evangelists as
   equally inspired in their writings and in their lives, and in both
   receiving the guidance of the Spirit of truth in a manner not different
   in kind but only in degree from ordinary Christians. Many of these
   explanations lose sight of the original meaning and derivation of the
   word; some of them are framed with the view of meeting difficulties;
   all perhaps err in attempting to define what, though real, is incapable
   of being defined in an exact manner. Nor for any of the higher or
   supernatural views of inspiration is there any foundation in the
   Gospels or Epistles. There is no appearance in their writings that the
   Evangelists or Apostles had any inward gift, or were subject to any
   power external to them different from that of preaching or teaching
   which they daily exercised; nor do they anywhere lead us to suppose
   that they were free from error or infirmity. St. Paul writes like a
   Christian teacher, exhibiting all the emotions and vicissitudes of
   human feeling, speaking, indeed, with authority, but hesitating in
   difficult cases and more than once correcting himself, corrected, too,
   by the course of events in his expectation of the coming of Christ. The
   Evangelist who saw it, bare record, and his record is true: and he
   knoweth that he saith true' (John xix. 35). Another Evangelist does not
   profess to be an original narrator, but only to set forth in order a
   declaration of what eye-witnesses had delivered,' like many others
   whose writings have not been preserved to us (Luke i. 1, 2). And the
   result is in accordance with the simple profession and style in which
   they describe themselves; there is no appearance, that is to say, of
   insincerity or want of faith; but neither is there perfect accuracy or
   agreement. One supposes the original dwelling-place of our Lord's
   parents to have been Bethlehem (Matt. ii. 1, 22), another Nazareth
   (Luke ii. 4); they trace his genealogy in different ways; one mentions
   the thieves blaspheming, another has preserved to after-ages the record
   of the penitent thief; they appear to differ about the day and hour of
   the Crucifixion; the narrative of the woman who anointed our Lord's
   feet with ointment is told in all four, each narrative having more or
   less considerable variations. These are a few instances of the
   differences which arose in the traditions of the earliest ages
   respecting the history of our Lord. But he who wishes to investigate
   the character of the sacred writings should not be afraid to make a
   catalogue of them all with the view of estimating their cumulative
   weight. (For it is obvious that the answer which would be admitted in
   the case of a single discrepancy, will not be the true answer when
   there are many.) He should further consider that the narratives in
   which these discrepancies occur are short and partly identical--a cycle
   of tradition beyond which the knowledge of the early fathers never
   travels, though if all the things that Jesus said and did had been
   written down, the world itself could not have contained the books that
   would have been written' (John xx. 30; xxi. 25). For the proportion
   which these narratives bear to the whole subject, as well as their
   relation to one another, is an important element in the estimation of
   differences. In the same way, he who would understand the nature of
   prophecy in the Old Testament, should have the courage to examine how
   far its details were minutely fulfilled. The absence of such a
   fulfilment may further lead him to discover that he took the letter for
   the spirit in expecting it.

   The subject will clear of itself if we bear in mind two
   considerations:--First, that the nature of inspiration can only be
   known from the examination of Scripture. There is no other source to
   which we can turn for information; and we have no right to assume some
   imaginary doctrine of inspiration like the infallibility of the Roman
   Catholic church. To the question, What is inspiration' the first answer
   therefore is, That idea of Scripture which we gather from the knowledge
   of it.' It is no mere a priori notion, but one to which the book is
   itself a witness. It is a fact which we infer from the study of
   Scripture--not of one portion only, but of the whole. Obviously then it
   embraces writings of very different kinds--the book of Esther, for
   example, or the Song of Solomon, as well as the Gospel of St. John. It
   is reconcileable with the mixed good and evil of the characters of the
   Old Testament, which nevertheless does not exclude them from the favour
   of God, with the attribution to the Divine Being of actions at variance
   with that higher revelation, which He has given of himself in the
   Gospel; it is not inconsistent with imperfect or opposite aspects of
   the truth as in the Book of Job or Ecclesiastes, with variations of
   fact in the Gospels or the books of Kings and Chronicles, with
   inaccuracies of language in the Epistles of St. Paul. For these are all
   found in Scripture; neither is there any reason why they should not be,
   except a general impression that Scripture ought to have been written
   in a way different from what it has. A principle of progressive
   revelation admits them all; and this is already contained in the words
   of our Saviour, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts;' or even
   in the Old Testament, Henceforth there shall be no more this proverb in
   the house of Israel.' For what is progressive is necessarily imperfect
   in its earlier stages, and even erring to those who come after, whether
   it be the maxims of a half-civilized world which are compared with
   those of a civilized one, or the Law with the Gospel. Scripture itself
   points the way to answer the moral objections to Scripture. Lesser
   difficulties remain, but only such as would be found commonly in
   writings of the same age or country. There is no more reason why
   imperfect narratives should be excluded from Scripture than imperfect
   grammar; no more ground for expecting that the New Testament would be
   logical or Aristotelian in form, than that it would be written in Attic
   Greek.

   The other consideration is one which has been neglected by writers on
   this subject. It is this--that any true doctrine of inspiration must
   conform to all well-ascertained facts of history or of science. The
   same fact cannot be true and untrue, any more than the same words can
   have two opposite meanings. The same fact cannot be true in religion
   when seen by the light of faith, and untrue in science, when looked at
   through the medium of evidence or experiment. It is ridiculous to
   suppose that the sun goes round the earth in the same sense in which
   the earth goes round the sun; or that the world appears to have
   existed, but has not existed during the vast epochs of which geology
   speaks to us., But if so, there is no need of elaborate reconcilements
   of revelation and science; they reconcile themselves the moment any
   scientific truth is distinctly ascertained. As the idea of nature
   enlarges, the idea of revelation also enlarges; it was a temporary
   misunderstanding which severed them. And as the knowledge of nature
   which is possessed by the few is communicated in its leading features
   at least to the many, they will receive with it a higher conception of
   the ways of God to man. It may hereafter appear as natural to the
   majority of mankind to see the providence of God in the order of the
   world, as it once was to appeal to interruptions of it.

   It is true that there is a class of scientific facts with which popular
   opinions on theology often conflict and which do not seem to conform in
   all respects to the severer conditions of inductive science: such
   especially are the facts relating to the formation of the earth and the
   beginnings of the human race. But it is not worth while to fight on
   this debateable ground a losing battle in the hope that a generation
   will pass away before we sound a last retreat. Almost all intelligent
   persons are agreed that the earth has existed for myriads of ages; the
   best informed are of opinion that the history of nations extends back
   some thousand years before the Mosaic chronology; recent discoveries in
   geology may perhaps open a further vista of existence for the human
   species, while it is possible, and may one day be known, that mankind
   spread not from one but from many centres over the globe; or as others
   say, that the supply of links which are at present wanting in the chain
   of animal life may lead to new conclusions respecting the origin of
   man. Now let it be granted that these facts, being with the past,
   cannot be shown in the same palpable and evident manner as the facts of
   chemistry or physiology; and that the proof of some of them, especially
   of those last mentioned, is wanting; still it is a false policy to set
   up inspiration or revelation in opposition to them, a principle which
   can have no influence on them and should be rather kept out of their
   way. The sciences of geology and comparative philology are steadily
   gaining ground; many of the guesses of twenty years ago have become
   certainties, and the guesses of to-day may hereafter become so. Shall
   we peril religion on the possibility of their untruth? on such a cast
   to stake the life of man implies not only a recklessness of facts, but
   a misunderstanding of the nature of the Gospel. If it is fortunate for
   science, it is perhaps more fortunate for Christian truth, that the
   admission of Galileo's discovery has for ever settled the principle of
   the relations between them.

   A similar train of thought may be extended to the results of historical
   inquiries. These results cannot be barred by the dates or narrative of
   Scripture; neither should they be made to wind round into agreement
   with them. Again, the idea of inspiration must expand and take them in.
   Their importance in a religious point of view is not that they impugn
   or confirm the Jewish history, but that they show more clearly the
   purposes of God towards the whole human race. The recent chronological
   discoveries from Egyptian monuments do not tend to overthrow
   revelation, nor the Ninevite inscriptions to support it. The use of
   them on either side may indeed arouse a popular interest in them; it is
   apt to turn a scientific inquiry into a semi-religious controversy. And
   to religion either use is almost equally injurious, because seeming to
   rest truths important to human life on the mere accident of an
   archaeological discovery. Is it to be thought that Christianity gains
   anything from the deciphering of the names of some Assyrian and
   Babylonian kings, contemporaries chiefly with the later Jewish history?
   As little as it ought to lose from the appearance of a contradictory
   narrative of the Exodus in the chamber of an Egyptian temple of the
   year B.C. 1500. This latter supposition may not be very probable. But
   it is worth while to ask ourselves the question, whether we can be
   right in maintaining any view of religion which can be affected by such
   a probability.

   It will be a further assistance in the consideration of this subject,
   to observe that the interpretation of Scripture has nothing to do with
   any opinion respecting its origin. The meaning of Scripture is one
   thing; the inspiration of Scripture is another. It is conceivable that
   those who hold the most different views about the one, may be able to
   agree about the other. Rigid upholders of the verbal inspiration of
   Scripture, and those who deny inspiration altogether, may nevertheless
   meet on the common ground of the meaning of words. If the term
   inspiration were to fall into disuse, no fact of nature, or history, or
   language, no event in the life of man, or dealings of God with him,
   would be in any degree altered. The word itself is but of yesterday,
   not found in the earlier confessions of the reformed faith; the
   difficulties that have arisen about it are only two or three centuries
   old. Therefore the question of inspiration, though in one sense
   important, is to the interpreter as though it were not important; he is
   in no way called upon to determine a matter with which he has nothing
   to do, and which was not determined by fathers of the Church. And he
   had better go on his way and leave the more precise definition of the
   word to the progress of knowledge and the results of the study of
   Scripture, instead of entangling himself with a theory about it.

   It is one evil of conditions or previous suppositions in the study of
   Scripture, that the assumption of them has led to an apologetic temper
   in the interpreters of Scripture. The tone of apology is always a tone
   of weakness, and does injury to a good cause. It is the reverse of ye
   shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.' It is
   hampered with the necessity of making a defence, and also with previous
   defences of the same side; it accepts, with an excess of reserve and
   caution, the truth itself, when it comes from an opposite quarter.
   Commentators are often more occupied with the proof of miracles than
   with the declaration of life and immortality; with the fulfilment of
   the details of prophecy than with its life and power; with the
   reconcilement of the discrepancies in the narrative of the infancy,
   pointed out by Schleiermacher, than with the importance of the great
   event of the appearance of the Saviour--To this end was I born and for
   this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the
   truth.' The same tendency is observable also in reference to the Acts
   of the Apostles and the Epistles, which are not only brought into
   harmony with each other, but interpreted with a reference to the
   traditions of existing communions. The natural meaning of particular
   expressions, as for example: Why are they then baptized for the dead?'
   (1 Cor. xv. 29), or the words because of the angels' (1 Cor. xi. 10);
   or, this generation shall not pass away until all these things be
   fulfilled' (Matt. xxiv. 34); or, upon this rock will I build my Church'
   (Matt. xvi. 18), is set aside in favour of others, which, however
   improbable, are more in accordance with preconceived opinions, or seem
   to be more worthy of the sacred writers. The language, and also the
   text, are treated on the same defensive and conservative principles.
   The received translations of Phil. ii. 6 (Who, being in the form of
   God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God'), or of Rom. iii. 25
   (Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
   blood'), or Rom. xv. 6 (God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ'), though erroneous, are not given up without a struggle; the 1
   Tim. iii. 16, and 1 John v. 7 (the three witnesses), though the first
   (God manifest in the flesh,' ThS for OS) is not found in the best
   manuscripts, and the second in no Greek manuscript worth speaking of,
   have not yet disappeared from the editions of the Greek Testament
   commonly in use in England, and still less from the English
   translation. An English commentator who, with Lachmann and Tischendorf,
   supported also by the authority of Erasmus, ventures to alter the
   punctuation of the doxology in Rom. ix. 5 (Who is over all God blessed
   for ever') hardly escapes the charge of heresy. That in most of these
   eases the words referred to have a direct bearing on important
   controversies is a reason not for retaining, but for correcting them.

   The temper of accommodation shows itself especially in two ways: first,
   in the attempt to adapt the truths of Scripture to the doctrines of the
   creeds; secondly, in the adaptation of the precepts and maxims of
   Scripture to the language or practice of our own age. Now the creeds
   are acknowledged to be a part of Christianity; they stand in a close
   relation to the words of Christ and his Apostles; nor can it be said
   that any heterodox formula makes a nearer approach to a simple and
   scriptural rule of faith. Neither is anything gained by contrasting
   them with Scripture, in which the germs of the expressions used in them
   are sufficiently apparent. Yet it does not follow that they should be
   pressed into the service of the interpreter. The growth of ideas in the
   interval which separated the first century from the fourth or sixth
   makes it impossible to apply the language of the one to the explanation
   of the other. Between Scripture and the Nicene or Athanasian Creed, a
   world of the understanding comes in--that world of abstractions and
   second notions; and mankind are no longer at the same point as when the
   whole of Christianity was contained in the words, Believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ and thou mayest be saved,' when the Gospel centred in the
   attachment to a living or recently departed friend and Lord. The
   language of the New Testament is the first utterance and consciousness
   of the mind of Christ; or the immediate vision of the Word of life (1
   John i. 1) as it presented itself before the eyes of His first
   followers, or as the sense of His truth and power grew upon them (Rom.
   i. 3, 4); the other is the result of three or four centuries of
   reflection arid controversy. And although this last had a truth suited
   to its age, and its technical expressions have sunk deep into the heart
   of the human race, it is not the less unfitted to be the medium by the
   help of which Scripture is to be explained. If the occurrence of the
   phraseology of the Nicene age in a verse of the Epistles would detect
   the spuriousness of the verse in which it was found, how can the Nicene
   or Athanasian Creed be a suitable instrument for the interpretation of
   Scripture? That advantage which the New Testament has over the teaching
   of the Church, as representing what may be termed the childhood of the
   Gospel, would be lost if its language were required to conform to that
   of the Creeds.

   To attribute to St. Paul or the Twelve the abstract notion of Christian
   truth, which afterwards sprang up in the Catholic Church, is the same
   sort of anachronism as to attribute to them a system of philosophy. It
   is the same error as to attribute to Homer the ideas of Thales or
   Heraclitus, or to Thales the more developed principles of Aristotle and
   Plato. Many persons who have no difficulty in tracing the growth of
   institutions, yet seem to fail in recognizing the more subtle progress
   of an idea. It is hard to imagine the absence of conceptions with which
   we are familiar; to go back to the germ of what we know only in
   maturity; to give up what has grown to us, and become a part of our
   minds. In the present case, however, the development is not difficult
   to prove. The statements of Scripture are unaccountable if we deny it;
   the silence of Scripture is equally unaccountable. Absorbed as St. Paul
   was in the person of Christ with an intensity of faith and love of
   which in modern days and at this distance of time we can scarcely form
   a conception--high as he raised the dignity of his Lord above all
   things in heaven and earth--looking to Him as the Creator of all
   things, and the head of quick and dead, he does not speak of Him as
   equal to the Father,' or of one substance with the Father.' Much of the
   language of the Epistles (passages for example such as Rom. i. 2: Phil.
   ii. 6) would lose their meaning if distributed in alternate clauses
   between our Lord's humanity and divinity. Still greater difficulties
   would be introduced into the Gospels by the attempt to identify them
   with the Creeds. We should have to suppose that He was and was not
   tempted; that when He prayed to His Father He prayed also to Himself;
   that He knew and did not know of that hour' of which He as well as the
   angels were ignorant. How could He have said, My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me'? or, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
   from me'? How could He have doubted whether when the Son cometh he
   shall find faith upon the earth'? These simple and touching words have
   to be taken out of their natural meaning and connexion to be made the
   theme of apologetic discourses if we insist on reconciling them with
   the distinctions of later ages.

   Neither, as has been already remarked, would the substitution of any
   other precise or definite rule of faith, as for example the Unitarian,
   be more favourable to the interpretation of Scripture. How could the
   Evangelist St. John have said the Word was God,' or God was the Word'
   (according to either mode of translating), or how would our Lord
   Himself have said, I and the Father are one,' if either had meant that
   Christ was a mere man, a prophet or as one of the prophets'? No one who
   takes words in their natural sense can suppose that in the beginning'
   (John i. 1) means, at the commencement of the ministry of Christ,' or
   that the Word was with God,' only relates to the withdrawal of Christ
   to commune with God,' or that the Word is said to be God,' in the
   ironical sense of John x. 35. But while venturing to turn one eye on
   these (perhaps obsolete) perversions of the meanings of words in old
   opponents, we must not forget also to keep the other open to our own.
   The object of the preceding remark is not to enter into controversy
   with them, or to balance the statements of one side with those of the
   other, but only to point out the error of introducing into the
   interpretation of Scripture the notions of a later age which is common
   alike to us and them.

   The other kind of accommodation which was alluded to above arises out
   of the difference between the social and ecclesiastical state of the
   world, as it exists in actual fact, and the ideal which the Gospel
   presents to us. An ideal is, by its very nature, far removed from
   actual life. It is enshrined not in the material things of the external
   world, but in the heart and conscience. Mankind are dissatisfied at
   this separation; they fancy that they can make the inward kingdom an
   outward one also. But this is not possible. The frame of civilization,
   that is to say, institutions and laws, the usages of business, the
   customs of society, these are for the most part mechanical, capable
   only in a certain degree of a higher and spiritual life. Christian
   motives have never existed in such strength, as to make it safe or
   possible to entrust them with the preservation of social order. Other
   interests are therefore provided and other principles, often
   independent of the teaching of the Gospel, or even apparently at
   variance with it. If a man smite thee on the right cheek turn to him
   the other also,' is not a regulation of police but an ideal rule of
   conduct, not to be explained away, but rarely if ever to be literally
   acted upon in a civilized country; or rather to be acted upon always in
   spirit, yet not without a reference to the interests of the community.
   If a missionary were to endanger the public peace and come like the
   Apostles saying, I ought to obey God rather than man,' it is obvious
   that the most Christian of magistrates could not allow him (say in
   India or New Zealand) to shield himself under the authority of these
   words. For in religion as in philosophy there are two opposite poles;
   of truth and action, of doctrine and practice, of idea and fact. The
   image of God in Christ is over against the necessities of human nature
   and the state of man on earth. Our Lord Himself recognizes this
   distinction, when He says, Of whom do the kings of the earth gather
   tribute?' and then are the children free' (Matt. xvii. 26). And again,
   Notwithstanding lest we should offend them,' &c. Here are contrasted
   what may be termed the two poles of idea and fact.

   All men appeal to Scripture, and desire to draw the authority of
   Scripture to their side; its voice may be heard in the turmoil of
   political strife; a merely verbal similarity, the echo of a word, has
   weight in the determination of a controversy. Such appeals are not to
   be met always by counter-appeals; they rather lead to the consideration
   of deeper questions as to the manner in which Scripture is to be
   applied. In what relation does it stand to actual life? Is it a law, or
   only a spirit? for nations, or for individuals? to be enforced
   generally, or in details also? Are its maxims to be modified by
   experience, or acted upon in defiance of experience? Are the accidental
   circumstances of the first believers to become a rule for us? Is
   everything, in short, done or said by our Saviour and His Apostles, to
   be regarded as a precept or example which is to be followed on all
   occasions and to last for all time? That can hardly be, consistently
   with the changes of human things. It would be a rigid skeleton of
   Christianity (not the image of Christ), to which society and politics,
   as well as the lives of individuals, would be conformed. It would be
   the oldness of the letter, on which the world would be stretched; not
   the law of the spirit of life' which St. Paul teaches. The attempt to
   force politics and law into the framework of religion is apt to drive
   us up into a corner, in which the great principles of truth and justice
   have no longer room to make themselves felt. It is better, as well as
   safer, to take the liberty with which Christ has made us free. For our
   Lord Himself has left behind Him words, which contain a principle large
   enough to admit all the forms of society or of life; My kingdom is not
   of this world' (John xviii. 36). It does not come into collision with
   politics or knowledge; it has nothing to do with the Roman government
   or the Jewish priesthood, or with corresponding institutions in the
   present day; it is a counsel of perfection, and has its dwelling-place
   in the heart of man. That is the real solution of questions of Church
   and State; all else is relative to the history or circumstances of
   particular nations. That is the answer to a doubt which is also raised
   respecting the obligation of the letter of the Gospel on individual
   Christians. But this inwardness of the words of Christ is what few are
   able to receive; it is easier to apply them superficially to things
   without, than to be a partaker of them from within. And false and
   miserable applications of them are often made, and the kingdom of God
   becomes the tool of the kingdoms of the world.

   The neglect of this necessary contrast between the ideal and the actual
   has had a twofold effect on the Interpretation of Scripture. It has led
   to an unfair appropriation of some portions of Scripture and an undue
   neglect of others. The letter is in many cases really or apparently in
   harmony with existing practices, or opinions, or institutions. In other
   cases it is far removed from them; it often seems as if the world would
   come to an end before the words of Scripture could be realized. The
   twofold effect just now mentioned, corresponds to these two classes.
   Some texts of Scripture have been eagerly appealed to and made (in one
   sense) too much of; they have been taken by force into the service of
   received opinions and beliefs; texts of the other class have been
   either unnoticed or explained away. Consider, for example, the
   extraordinary and unreasonable importance attached to single words,
   sometimes of doubtful meaning, in reference to any of the following
   subjects:-- (1) Divorce; (2) Marriage with a Wife's Sister; (3)
   Inspiration; (4) the Personality of the Holy Spirit; (5) Infant
   Baptism; (6) Episcopacy; (7) Divine Right of Kings; (8) Original Sin.
   There is, indeed, a kind of mystery in the way in which the chance
   words of a simple narrative, the occurrence of some accidental event,
   the use even of a figure of speech, or a mistranslation of a word in
   Latin or English, have affected the thoughts of future ages and distant
   countries. Nothing so slight that it has not been caught at; nothing so
   plain that it may not be explained away. What men have brought to the
   text they have also found there; what has received no interpretation or
   witness, either in the customs of the Church or in the thoughts of many
   hearts,' is still an unknown tongue' to them. It is with Scripture as
   with oratory, its effect partly depends on the preparation in the mind
   or in circumstances for the reception of it. There is no use of
   Scripture, no quotation or even misquotation of a word which is not a
   power in the world, when it embodies the spirit of a great movement or
   is echoed by the voice of a large party.

   (1) On the first of the subjects referred to above, it is argued from
   Scripture that adulterers should not be allowed to marry again; and the
   point of the argument turns on the question whether the words (ektos
   logou porneias) saving for the cause of fornication,' which occur in
   the first clause of an important text on marriage, were designedly or
   accidentally omitted in the second (Matt. v. 32: Whosoever shall put
   away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to
   commit adultery, and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
   committeth adultery;' compare also Mark x. 11, 12). (2) The Scripture
   argument in the second instance is almost invisible, being drawn from a
   passage the meaning of which is irrelevant (Lev. xviii. 18: Neither
   shalt thou take a wife to her sister to vex her, to uncover her
   nakedness beside the other in her lifetime'): and transferred from the
   Polygamy which prevailed in Eastern countries 3000 years ago to the
   Monogamy of the nineteenth century and the Christian Church, in spite
   of the custom and tradition of the Jews and the analogy of the
   brother's widow. (3) In the third case the word (theopneustos) given by
   inspiration of God' is spoken of the Old Testament, and is assumed to
   apply to the New, including that Epistle in which the expression occurs
   (2 Tim. iii. 16). (4) In the fourth example the words used are
   mysterious (John xiv. 26; xvi. 15), and seem to come out of the depths
   of a divine consciousness; they have sometimes, however, received a
   more exact meaning than they could truly bear; what is spoken in a
   figure is construed with the severity of a logical statement, while
   passages of an opposite tenour are overlooked or set aside. (5) In the
   fifth instance, the mere mention of a family of a jailer at Philippi
   who was baptized (he and all his,' Acts xvi. 33), has led to the
   inference that in this family there were probably young children, and
   hence that infant baptism is, first, permissive, secondly, obligatory.
   (6) In the sixth case the chief stress of the argument from Scripture
   turns on the occurrence of the word (episkopos) bishop, in the Epistles
   to Timothy and Titus, which is assisted by a supposed analogy between
   the position of the Apostles and of their successors; although the term
   bishop is clearly used in the passages referred to as well as in other
   parts of the New Testament indistinguishably from Presbyter, and the
   magisterial authority of bishops in after ages is unlike rather than
   like the personal authority of the Apostles in the beginning of the
   Gospel. The further development of Episcopacy into Apostolical
   succession has often been rested on the promise, Lo, I am with you
   alway, even to the end of the world.' (7) In the seventh case the
   precepts of order which are addressed in the Epistle to the fifth
   monarchy men of those days,' are transferred to a duty of obedience to
   hereditary princes; the fact of the house of David, the Lord's
   anointed,' sitting on the throne of Israel is converted into a
   principle for all times and countries. And the higher lesson which our
   Saviour teaches: Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's,' that
   is to say, Render unto all their due, and to God above all,' is spoiled
   by being made into a precept of political subjection. (8) Lastly, the
   justice of God who rewardeth every man according to his works,' and the
   Christian scheme of redemption, have been staked on two figurative
   expressions of St. Paul to which there is no parallel in any other part
   of Scripture (1 Cor. xv. 22: For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
   shall all be made alive,' and the corresponding passage in Rom. v. 12);
   notwithstanding the declaration of the Old Testament as also of the
   New, Every soul shall bear its own iniquity,' and neither this man
   sinned nor his parents.' It is not necessary for our purpose to engage
   further in the matters of dispute which have arisen by the way in
   attempting to illustrate the general argument. Yet to avoid
   misconception it may be remarked, that many of the principles, rules,
   or truths mentioned, as for example, Infant Baptism, or the Episcopal
   Form of Church Government, have sufficient grounds; the weakness is the
   attempt to derive them from Scripture.

   With this minute and rigid enforcement of the words of Scripture in
   passages where the ideas expressed in them either really or apparently
   agree with received opinions or institutions, there remains to be
   contrasted the neglect, or in some instances the misinterpretation of
   other words which are not equally in harmony with the spirit of the
   age. In many of our Lord's discourses He speaks of the blessedness of
   poverty:' of the hardness which they that have riches will experience
   in attaining eternal life.' It is easier for a camel to go through a
   needle's eye,' and Son, thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good
   things,' and again One thing thou lackest, go sell all that thou hast.'
   Precepts like these do not appeal to our own experience of life; they
   are unlike anything that we see around us at the present day, even
   among good men; to some among us they will recall the remarkable saying
   of Lessing,--that the Christian religion had been tried for eighteen
   centuries; the religion of Christ remained to be tried.' To take them
   literally would be injurious to ourselves and to society (at least, so
   we think). Religious sects or orders who have seized this aspect of
   Christianity have come to no good, and have often ended in
   extravagance. It will not do to go into the world saying, Woe unto you,
   ye rich men,' or on entering a noble mansion to repeat the
   denunciations of the prophet about cedar and vermilion,' or on being
   shown the prospect of a magnificent estate to cry out, Woe unto them
   that lay field to field that they may be placed alone in the midst of
   the earth.' Times have altered, we say, since these denunciations were
   uttered; what appeared to the Prophet or Apostle a violation of the
   appointment of Providence has now become a part of it. It will not do
   to make a great supper, and mingle at the same board the two ends of
   society, as modern phraseology calls them, fetching in the poor, the
   maimed, the lame, the blind,' to fill the vacant places of noble
   guests. That would be eccentric in modern times, and even hurtful.
   Neither is it suitable for us to wash one another's feet, or to perform
   any other menial office, because our Lord set us the example. The
   customs of society do not admit it; no good would be done by it, and
   singularity is of itself an evil. Well, then, are the precepts of
   Christ not to be obeyed? Perhaps in their fullest sense they cannot be
   obeyed. But at any rate they are not to be explained away; the standard
   of Christ is not to be lowered to ordinary Christian life, because
   ordinary Christian life cannot rise, even in good men, to the standard
   of Christ. And there may be standing among us' some one in ten thousand
   whom we know not,' in whom there is such a divine union of charity and
   prudence that he is most blest in the entire fulfilment of the
   precept--Go sell all that thou hast,'--which to obey literally in other
   cases would be evil, and not good. Many there have been, doubtless (not
   one or two only), who have given all that they had on earth to their
   family or friends--the poor servant casting her two mites into the
   treasury,' denying herself the ordinary comforts of life for the sake
   of an erring parent or brother; that is not probably an uncommon case,
   and as near an approach as in this life we make to heaven. And there
   may be some one or two rare natures in the world in whom there is such
   a divine courtesy, such a gentleness and dignity of soul, that
   differences of rank seem to vanish before them, and they look upon the
   face of others, even of their own servants and dependents, only as they
   are in the sight of God and will be in His kingdom. And there may be
   some tender and delicate woman among us, who feels that she has a
   divine vocation to fulfil the most repulsive offices towards the dying
   inmates of a hospital, or the soldier perishing in a foreign land.
   Whether such examples of self-sacrifice are good or evil, must depend,
   not altogether on social or economical principles, but on the spirit of
   those who offer them, and the power which they have in themselves of
   making all things kin.' And even if the ideal itself were not carried
   out by us in practice, it has nevertheless what may be termed a truth
   of feeling. Let them that have riches be as though they had them not.'
   Let the rich man wear the load lightly; he will one day fold them up as
   a vesture.' Let not the refinement of society make us forget that it is
   not the refined only who are received into the kingdom of God; nor the
   daintiness of life hide from us the bodily evils of which the rich man
   and Lazarus are alike heirs. Thoughts such as these have the power to
   reunite us to our fellow-creatures from whom the accidents of birth,
   position, wealth have separated us; they soften our hearts towards
   them, when divided not only by vice and ignorance, but what is even a
   greater barrier, difference of manners and associations. For if there
   be anything in our own fortune superior to that of others, instead of
   idolizing or cherishing it in the blood, the Gospel would have us cast
   it from us; and if there be anything mean or despised in those with
   whom we have to do, the Gospel would have us regard such as friends and
   brethren, yea, even as having the person of Christ.

   Another instance of apparent, if not real neglect of the precepts of
   Scripture, is furnished by the commandment against swearing. No precept
   about divorce is so plain, so universal, so exclusive as this; Swear
   not at all.' Yet we all know how the custom of Christian countries has
   modified this counsel of perfection' which was uttered by the Saviour.
   This is the more remarkable because in this case the precept is not, as
   in the former, practically impossible of fulfilment or even difficult.
   And yet in this instance again, the body who have endeavoured to follow
   more nearly the letter of our Lord's commandment, seem to have gone
   against the common sense of the Christian world. Or to add one more
   example: Who, that hears of the Sabbatarianism, as it is called, of
   some Protestant countries, would imagine that the Author of our
   religion had cautioned His disciples, not against the violation of the
   Sabbath, but only against its formal and Pharisaical observance; or
   that the chiefest of the Apostles had warned the Colossians to Let no
   man judge them in respect of the new moon, or of the Sabbath-days' (ii.
   16).

   The neglect of another class of passages is even more surprising, the
   precepts contained in them being quite practicable and in harmony with
   the existing state of the world. In this instance it seems as if
   religious teachers had failed to gather those principles of which they
   stood most in need. Think ye that those eighteen upon whom the tower of
   Siloam fell?' is the characteristic lesson of the Gospel on the
   occasion of any sudden visitation. Yet it is another reading of such
   calamities which is commonly insisted upon. The observation is seldom
   made respecting the parable of the good Samaritan, that the true
   neighbour is also a person of a different religion. The words, Forbid
   him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that
   can lightly speak evil of me,' are often said to have no application to
   sectarian differences in the present day, when the Church is
   established and miracles have ceased. The conduct of our Lord to the
   woman taken in adultery, though not intended for our imitation always,
   yet affords a painful contrast to the excessive severity with which
   even a Christian society punishes the errors of women. The boldness
   with which St. Paul applies the principle of individual judgement, Let
   every man be fully persuaded in his own mind,' as exhibited also in the
   words quoted above, Let no man judge you in respect of the new moon, or
   of the sabbath-days,' is far greater than would be allowed in the
   present age. Lastly, that the tenet of the damnation of the heathen
   should ever have prevailed in the Christian world, or that the
   damnation of Catholics should have been a received opinion among
   Protestants, implies a strange forgetfulness of such passages as Rom.
   ii. 1-16. Who rewardeth every man according to his work,' and When the
   Gentiles, which know not the law, do by nature the things contained in
   the law,' &c. What a difference between the simple statement which the
   Apostle makes of the justice of God and the uncovenanted mercies' or
   invincible ignorance' of theologians half reluctant to give up, yet
   afraid to maintain the advantage of denying salvation to those who are
   extra palum Ecclesiae!'

   The same habit of silence or misinterpretation extends to words or
   statements of Scripture in which doctrines are thought to be
   interested. When maintaining the Athanasian doctrine of the Trinity, we
   do not readily recall the verse, of that hour knoweth no man, no not
   the Angels of God, neither the Son, but the Father' (Mark xiii. 32).
   The temper or feeling which led St. Ambrose to doubt the genuineness of
   the words marked in italics, leads Christians in our own day to pass
   them over. We are scarcely just to the Millenarians or to those who
   maintain the continuance of miracles or spiritual gifts in the
   Christian Church, in not admitting the degree of support which is
   afforded to their views by many passages of Scripture. The same remark
   applies to the Predestinarian controversy; the Calvinist is often
   hardly dealt with, in being deprived of his real standing ground in the
   third and ninth chapters of the Epistle to the Romans. And the
   Protestant who thinks himself bound to prove from Scripture the very
   details of doctrine or discipline which are maintained in his Church,
   is often obliged to have recourse to harsh methods, and sometimes to
   deny appearances which seem to favour some particular tenet of Roman
   Catholicism (Matt. xvi. 18, 19; xviii. 18: 1 Cor. iii. 15). The Roman
   Catholic, on the other hand, scarcely observes that nearly all the
   distinctive articles of his creed are wanting in the New Testament; the
   Calvinist in fact ignores almost the whole of the sacred volume for the
   sake of a few verses. The truth is, that in seeking to prove our own
   opinions out of Scripture, we are constantly falling into the common
   fallacy of opening our eyes to one class of facts and closing them to
   another. The favourite verses shine like stars, while the rest of the
   page is thrown into the shade.

   Nor indeed is it easy to say what is the meaning of proving a doctrine
   from Scripture.' For when we demand logical equivalents and similarity
   of circumstances, when we balance adverse statements, St. James and St.
   Paul, the New Testament with the Old, it will be hard to demonstrate
   from Scripture any complex system either of doctrine or practice. The
   Bible is not a book of statutes in which words have been chosen to
   cover the multitude of cases, but in the greater portion of it,
   especially the Gospels and Epistles, like a man talking to his friend.'
   Nay, more, it is a book written in the East, which is in some degree
   liable to be misunderstood, because it speaks the language and has the
   feeling of Eastern lands. Nor can we readily determine in explaining
   the words of our Lord or of St. Paul, how much (even of some of the
   passages just quoted) is to be attributed to Oriental modes of speech.
   Expressions which would be regarded as rhetorical exaggerations in the
   Western world are the natural vehicles of thought to an Eastern people.
   How great then must be the confusion where an attempt is made to draw
   out these Oriental modes with the severity of a philosophical or legal
   argument! Is it not such a use of the words of Christ which He Himself
   rebukes when He says? It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh
   profiteth nothing' (John vi. 52, 63).

   There is a further way in which the language of creeds and liturgies as
   well as the ordinary theological use of terms exercises a disturbing
   influence on the interpretation of Scripture. Words which occur in
   Scripture are singled out and incorporated in systems, like stones
   taken out of an old building and put into a new one. They acquire a
   technical meaning more or less divergent from the original one. It is
   obvious that their use in Scripture, and not their later and technical
   sense, must furnish the rule of interpretation. We should not have
   recourse to the meaning of a word in Polybius, for the explanation of
   its use in Plato, or to the turn of a sentence in Lycophron, to
   illustrate a construction of Aeschylus. It is the same kind of
   anachronism which would interpret Scripture by the scholastic or
   theological use of the language of Scripture. It is remarkable that
   this use is indeed partial, that is to say it affects one class of
   words and not another. Love and truth, for example, have never been
   theological terms; grace and faith, on the other hand, always retain an
   association with the Pelagian or Lutheran controversies. Justification
   and inspiration are derived from verbs which occur in Scripture, and
   the later substantive has clearly affected the meaning of the original
   verb or verbal in the places where they occur. The remark might be
   further illustrated by the use of Scriptural language respecting the
   Sacraments, which has also had a reflex influence on its interpretation
   in many passages of Scripture, especially in the Gospel of St. John
   (John iii. 5; vi. 56, &c). Minds which are familiar with the mystical
   doctrine of the Sacraments seem to see a reference to them in almost
   every place in the Old Testament as well as in the New, in which the
   words water,' or bread and wine' may happen to occur.

   Other questions meet us on the threshold, of a different kind, which
   also affect the interpretation of Scripture, and therefore demand an
   answer. Is it admitted that the Scripture has one and only one true
   meaning? Or are we to follow the fathers into mystical and allegorical
   explanations? or with the majority of modern interpreters to confine
   ourselves to the double senses of prophecy, and the symbolism of the
   Gospel in the law? In either case, we assume what can never be proved,
   and an instrument is introduced of such subtlety and pliability as to
   make the Scriptures mean anything--Gallus in campanili,' as the
   Waldenses described it; the weathercock on the church tower,' which is
   turned hither and thither by every wind of doctrine. That the present
   age has grown out of the mystical methods of the early fathers is a
   part of its intellectual state. No one will now seek to find hidden
   meanings in the scarlet thread of Rahab, or the number of Abraham's
   followers, or in the little circumstance mentioned after the
   resurrection of the Saviour that St. Peter was the first to enter the
   sepulchre. To most educated persons in the nineteenth century, these
   applications of Scripture appear foolish. Yet it is rather the excess
   of the method which provokes a smile than the method itself. For many
   remains of the mystical interpretation exist among ourselves; it is not
   the early fathers only who have read the Bible crosswise, or deciphered
   it as a book of symbols. And the uncertainty is the same in any part of
   Scripture if there is a departure from the plain and obvious meaning.
   If, for example, we alternate the verses in which our Lord speaks of
   the last things between the day of judgement and the destruction of
   Jerusalem; or, in the elder prophecies, which are the counterparts of
   these, make a corresponding division between the temporal and the
   spiritual Israel; or again if we attribute to the details of the
   Mosaical ritual a reference to the New Testament; or, once more,
   supposing the passage of the Red Sea to be regarded not merely as a
   figure of baptism, but as a pre-ordained type, the principle is
   conceded; there is no good reason why the scarlet thread of Rahab
   should not receive the explanation given to it by Clement. A little
   more or a little less of the method does not make the difference
   between certainty and uncertainty in the interpretation of Scripture.
   In whatever degree it is practised it is equally incapable of being
   reduced to any rule; it is the interpreter's fancy, and is likely to be
   not less but more dangerous and extravagant when it adds the charm of
   authority from its use in past ages.

   The question which has been suggested runs up into a more general one,
   the relation between the Old and New Testaments.' For the Old Testament
   will receive a different meaning accordingly as it is explained from
   itself or from the New. In the first case a careful and conscientious
   study of each one for itself is all that is required; in the second
   case the types and ceremonies of the law, perhaps the very facts and
   persons of the history, will be assumed to be predestined or made after
   a pattern corresponding to the things that were to be in the latter
   days. And this question of itself stirs another question respecting the
   interpretation of the Old Testament in the New. Is such interpretation
   to be regarded as the meaning of the original text, or an accommodation
   of it to the thoughts of other times?

   Our object is not to attempt here the determination of these questions,
   but to point out that they must be determined before any real progress
   can be made or any agreement arrived at in the interpretation of
   Scripture. With one more example of another kind we may close this part
   of the subject. The origin of the three first Gospels is an inquiry
   which has not been much considered by English theologians since the
   days of Bishop Marsh. The difficulty of the question has been sometimes
   misunderstood; the point being how there can be so much agreement in
   words, and so much disagreement both in words and facts; the double
   phenomenon is the real perplexity--how in short there can be all
   degrees of similarity and dissimilarity, the kind and degree of
   similarity being such as to make it necessary to suppose that large
   portions are copied from each other or from common documents; the
   dissimilarities being of a kind which seem to render impossible any
   knowledge in the authors of one another's writings. The most probable
   solution of this difficulty is, that the tradition on which the three
   first Gospels are based was at first preserved orally, and slowly put
   together and written in the three forms which it assumed at a very
   early period, those forms being in some places, perhaps, modified by
   translation. It is not necessary to develop this hypothesis farther.
   The point to be noticed is, that whether this or some other theory be
   the true account (and some such account is demonstrably necessary), the
   assumption of such a theory, or rather the observation of the facts on
   which it rests, cannot but exercise an influence on interpretation. We
   can no longer speak of three independent witnesses of the Gospel
   narrative. Hence there follow some other consequences. (1) There is no
   longer the same necessity as heretofore to reconcile inconsistent
   narratives; the harmony of the Gospels only means the parallelism of
   similar words. (2) There is no longer any need to enforce everywhere
   the connexion of successive verses, for the same words will be found to
   occur in different connexions in the different Gospels. (3) Nor can the
   designs attributed to their authors be regarded as the free handling of
   the same subject on different plans; the difference consisting chiefly
   in the occurrence or absence of local or verbal explanations, or the
   addition or omission of certain passages. Lastly, it is evident that no
   weight can be given to traditional statements of facts about the
   authorship, as, for example, that respecting St. Mark being the
   interpreter of St. Peter, because the Fathers who have handed down
   these statements were ignorant or unobservant of the great fact, which
   is proved by internal evidence, that they are for the most part of
   common origin.

   Until these and the like questions are determined by interpreters, it
   is not possible that there should be agreement in the interpretation of
   Scripture. The Protestant and Catholic, the Unitarian and Trinitarian
   will continue to fight their battle on the ground of the New Testament.
   The Preterists and Futurists, those who maintain that the roll of
   prophecies is completed in past history, or in the apostolical age;
   those who look forward to a long series of events which are yet to come
   [es aphanes ton muthon aneneikas ouk echei elenchon], may alike claim
   the authority of the Book of Daniel, or the Revelation. Apparent
   coincidences will always be discovered by those who want, to find them.
   Where there is no critical interpretation of Scripture, there will be a
   mystical or rhetorical one. If words have more than one meaning, they
   may have any meaning. Instead of being a rule of life or faith,
   Scripture becomes the expression of the ever-changing aspect of
   religious opinions. The unchangeable word of God, in the name of which
   we repose, is changed by each age and each generation in accordance
   with its passing fancy. The book in which we believe all religious
   truth to be contained, is the most uncertain of all books, because
   interpreted by arbitrary and uncertain methods.

   § 3.

   It is probable that some of the preceding statements may be censured as
   a wanton exposure of the difficulties of Scripture. It will be said
   that such inquiries are for the few; while the printed page lies open
   to the many, and that the obtrusion of them may offend some weaker
   brother, some half-educated or prejudiced soul, for whom,'
   nevertheless, in the touching language of St. Paul, Christ died.' A
   confusion of the heart and head may lead sensitive minds into a
   desertion of the principles of the Christian life, which are their own
   witness, because they are in doubt about facts which are really
   external to them. Great evil to character may sometimes ensue from such
   causes. No man can serve two' opinions without a sensible harm to his
   nature. The consciousness of this responsibility should be always
   present to writers on theology. But the responsibility is really
   twofold; for there is a duty to speak the truth as well as a duty to
   withhold it. The voice of a majority of the clergy throughout the
   world, the half sceptical, half conservative instincts of many laymen,
   perhaps, also, individual interest, are in favour of the latter course;
   while a higher expediency pleads that honesty is the best policy,' and
   that truth alone makes free.' To this it may be replied, that truth is
   not truth to those who are unable to use it; no reasonable man would
   attempt to lay before the illiterate such a question as that concerning
   the origin of the Gospels. And yet it may be rejoined once more, the
   healthy tone of religion among the poor depends upon freedom of thought
   and inquiry among the educated. In this conflict of reasons, individual
   judgement must at last decide. That there has been no rude, or improper
   unveiling of the difficulties of Scripture in the preceding pages, is
   thought to be shown by the following considerations:

   First, that the difficulties referred to are very well known; they
   force themselves on the attention, not only of the student, but of
   every intelligent reader of the New Testament, whether in Greek or
   English. The treatment of such difficulties in theological works is no
   measure of public opinion respecting them. Thoughtful persons, whose
   minds have turned towards theology, are continually discovering that
   the critical observations which they make themselves have been made
   also by others apparently without concert. The truth is that they have
   been led to them by the same causes, and these again lie deep in the
   tendencies of education and literature in the present age. But no one
   is willing to break through the reticence which is observed on these
   subjects; hence a sort of smouldering scepticism. It is probable that
   the distrust is greatest at the time when the greatest efforts are made
   to conceal it. Doubt comes in at the window, when Inquiry is denied at
   the door. The thoughts of able and highly educated young men almost
   always stray towards the first principles of things; it is a great
   injury to them, and tends to raise in their minds a sort of incurable
   suspicion, to find that there is one book of the fruit of the knowledge
   of which they are forbidden freely to taste, that is, the Bible. The
   same spirit renders the Christian Minister almost powerless in the
   hands of his opponents. He can give no true answer to the mechanic or
   artisan who has either discovered by his mother-wit or who retails at
   second-hand the objections of critics; for he is unable to look at
   things as they truly are.

   Secondly, as the time has come when it is no longer possible to ignore
   the results of criticism, it is of importance that Christianity should
   be seen to be in harmony with them. That objections to some received
   views should be valid, and yet that they should be always held up as
   the objections of infidels, is a mischief to the Christian cause. It is
   a mischief that critical observations which any intelligent man can
   make for himself, should be ascribed to atheism or unbelief. It would
   be a strange and almost incredible thing that the Gospel, which at
   first made war only on the vices of mankind, should now be opposed to
   one of the highest and rarest of human virtues--the love of truth. And
   that in the present day the great object of Christianity should be, not
   to change the lives of men, but to prevent them from changing their
   opinions; that would be a singular inversion of the purposes for which
   Christ came into the world. The Christian religion is in a false
   position when all the tendencies of knowledge are opposed to it. Such a
   position cannot be long maintained, or can only end in the withdrawal
   of the educated classes from the influences of religion. It is a grave
   consideration whether we ourselves may not be in an earlier stage of
   the same religious dissolution, which seems to have gone further in
   Italy and France. The reason for thinking so is not to be sought in the
   external circumstances of our own or any other religious communion, but
   in the progress of ideas with which Christian teachers seem to be ill
   at ease. Time was when the Gospel was before the age; when it breathed
   a new life into a decaying world --when the difficulties of
   Christianity were difficulties of the heart only, and the highest minds
   found in its truths not only the rule of their lives, but a well-spring
   of intellectual delight. Is it to be held a thing impossible that the
   Christian religion, instead of shrinking into itself, may again embrace
   the thoughts of men upon the earth? Or is it true that since the
   Reformation all intellect has gone the other way'? and that in
   Protestant countries reconciliation is as hopeless as Protestants
   commonly believe to be the case in Catholic?

   Those who hold the possibility of such a reconcilement or restoration
   of belief, are anxious to disengage Christianity from all suspicion of
   disguise or unfairness. They wish to preserve the historical use of
   Scripture as the continuous witness in all ages of the higher things in
   the heart of man, as the inspired source of truth and the way to the
   better life. They are willing to take away some of the external
   supports, because they are not needed and do harm; also, because they
   interfere with the meaning. They have a faith, not that after a period
   of transition all things will remain just as they were before, but that
   they will all come round again to the use of man and to the glory of
   God. When interpreted like any other book, by the same rules of
   evidence and the same canons of criticism, the Bible will still remain
   unlike any other book; its beauty will be freshly seen, as of a picture
   which is restored after many ages to its original state; it will create
   a new interest and make for itself a new kind of authority by the life
   which is in it. It will be a spirit and not a letter; as it was in the
   beginning, having an influence like that of the spoken word, or the
   book newly found. The purer the light in the human heart, the more it
   will have an expression of itself in the mind of Christ; the greater
   the knowledge of the development of man, the truer will be the insight
   gained into the increasing purpose' of revelation. In which also the
   individual soul has a practical part, finding a sympathy with its own
   imperfect feelings, in the broken utterance of the Psalmist or the
   Prophet as well as in the fullness of Christ. The harmony between
   Scripture and the life of man, in all its stages, may be far greater
   than appears at present. No one can form any notion from what we see
   around us, of the power which Christianity might have if it were at one
   with the conscience of man, and not at variance with his intellectual
   convictions. There, a world weary of the heat and, dust of
   controversy--of speculations about God and man--weary too of the
   rapidity of its own motion, would return home and find rest.

   But for the faith that the Gospel might win again the minds of
   intellectual men, it would be better to leave religion to itself,
   instead of attempting to draw them together. Other walks in literature
   have peace and pleasure and profit; the path of the critical
   Interpreter of Scripture is almost always a thorny one in England. It
   is not worth while for any one to enter upon it who is not supported by
   a sense that he has a Christian and moral object. For although an
   Interpreter of Scripture in modern times will hardly say with the
   emphasis of the Apostle, Woe is me, if I speak not the truth without
   regard to consequences,' yet he too may feel it a matter of duty not to
   conceal the things which he knows. He does not hide the discrepancies
   of Scripture, because the acknowledgement of them is the first step
   towards agreement among interpreters. He would restore the original
   meaning because seven other' meanings take the place of it; the book is
   made the sport of opinion and the instrument of perversion of life. He
   would take the excuses of the head out of the way of the heart; there
   is hope too that by drawing Christians together on the ground of
   Scripture, he may also draw them nearer to one another. He is not
   afraid that inquiries, which have for their object the truth, can ever
   be displeasing to the God of truth; or that the Word of God is in any
   such sense a word as to be hurt by investigations into its human origin
   and conception.

   It may be thought another ungracious aspect of the preceding remarks,
   that they cast a slight upon the interpreters of Scripture in former
   ages. The early Fathers, the Roman Catholic mystical writers, the Swiss
   and German Reformers, the Nonconformist divines, have qualities for
   which we look in vain among ourselves; they throw an intensity of light
   upon the page of Scripture which we nowhere find in modern
   commentaries. But it is not the light of interpretation. They have a
   faith which seems indeed to have grown dim nowadays, but that faith is
   not drawn from the study of Scripture; it is the element in which their
   own mind moves which overflows on the meaning of the text. The words of
   Scripture suggest to them their own thoughts or feelings. They are
   preachers, or in the New Testament sense of the word, prophets rather
   than interpreters. There is nothing in such a view derogatory to the
   saints and doctors of former ages. That Aquinas or Bernard did not
   shake themselves free from the mystical method of the Patristic times
   or the Scholastic one which was more peculiarly their own; that Luther
   and Calvin read the Scriptures in connexion with the ideas which were
   kindling in the mind of their age, and the events which were passing
   before their eyes, these and similar remarks are not to be construed as
   depreciatory of the genius or learning of famous men of old; they
   relate only to their interpretation of Scripture, in which it is no
   slight upon them, to maintain that they were not before their day.

   What remains may be comprised in a few precepts, or rather is the
   expansion of a single one. Interpret the Scripture like any other book.
   There are many respects in which Scripture is unlike any other book;
   these will appear in the results of such an interpretation. The first
   step is to know the meaning, and this can only be done in the same
   careful and impartial way that we ascertain the meaning of Sophocles or
   of Plato. The subordinate principles which flow out of this general one
   will also be gathered from the observation of Scripture. No other
   science of Hermeneutics is possible but an inductive one, that is to
   say, one based on the language and thoughts and narrations of the
   sacred writers. And it would be well to carry the theory of
   interpretation no further than in the case of other works. Excessive
   system tends to create an impression that the meaning of Scripture is
   out of our reach, or is to be attained in some other way than by the
   exercise of manly sense and industry. Who would write a bulky treatise
   about the method to be pursued in interpreting Plato or Sophocles? Let
   us not set out on our journey so heavily equipped that there is little
   chance of our arriving at the end of it. The method creates itself as
   we go on, beginning only with a few reflections directed against plain
   errors. Such reflections are the rules of common sense, which we
   acknowledge with respect to other works written in dead languages;
   without pretending to novelty they may help us to return to nature' in
   the study of the sacred writings.

   First, it may be laid down, that Scripture has one meaning--the meaning
   which it had to the mind of the Prophet or Evangelist who first uttered
   or wrote, to the hearers or readers who first received it. Another view
   may be easier or more familiar to us, seeming to receive a light and
   interest from the circumstances of our own age. But such accommodation
   of the text must be laid aside by the interpreter, whose business is,
   to place himself as nearly as possible in the position of the sacred
   writer. That is no easy task--to call up the inner and outer life of
   the contemporaries of our Saviour; to follow the abrupt and involved
   utterance of St. Paul or of one of the old Prophets; to trace the
   meaning of words when language first became Christian. He will often
   have to choose the more difficult interpretation (Gal. ii. 20; Rom.
   iii. 15, &c.), and to refuse one more in agreement with received
   opinions, because the latter is less true to the style and time of the
   author. He may incur the charge of singularity, or confusion of ideas,
   or ignorance of Greek, from a misunderstanding of the peculiarity of
   the subject in the person who makes the charge. For if it be said that
   the translation of some Greek words is contrary to the usages of
   grammar (Gal. iv. 13), that is not in every instance to be denied; the
   point is, whether the usages of grammar are always observed. Or if it
   be objected to some interpretation of Scripture that it is difficult
   and perplexing, the answer is--that may very well be--it is the fact,'
   arising out of differences in the modes of thought of other times, or
   irregularities in the use of language which no art of the interpreter
   can evade. One consideration should be borne in mind, that the Bible is
   the only book in the world written in different styles and at many
   different times, which is in the hands of persons of all degrees of
   knowledge and education. The benefit of this outweighs the evil, yet
   the evil should be admitted--namely, that it leads to a hasty and
   partial interpretation of Scripture, which often obscures the true one.
   A sort of conflict arises between scientific criticism and popular
   opinion. The indiscriminate use of Scripture has a further tendency to
   maintain erroneous readings or translations; some which are allowed to
   be such by scholars have been stereotyped in the mind of the English
   reader; and it becomes almost a political question how far we can
   venture to disturb them.

   There are difficulties of another kind in many parts of Scripture, the
   depth and inwardness of which require a measure of the same qualities
   in the interpreter himself. There are notes struck in places, which
   like some discoveries of science have sounded before their time; and
   only after many days have been caught up and found a response on the
   earth. There are germs of truth which after thousands of years have
   never yet taken root in the world. There are lessons in the Prophets
   which, however simple, mankind have not yet learned even in theory; and
   which the complexity of society rather tends to hide; aspects of human
   life in Job and Ecclesiastes which have a truth of desolation about
   them which we faintly realize in ordinary circumstances. It is,
   perhaps, the greatest difficulty of all to enter into the meaning of
   the words of Christ--so gentle, so human, so divine, neither adding to
   them nor marring their simplicity. The attempt to illustrate or draw
   them out in detail, even to guard against their abuse, is apt to
   disturb the balance of truth. The interpreter needs nothing short of
   fashioning' in himself the image of the mind of Christ. He has to be
   born again into a new spiritual or intellectual world, from which the
   thoughts of this world are shut out. It is one of the highest tasks on
   which the labour of a life can be spent, to bring the words of Christ a
   little nearer the heart of man.

   But while acknowledging this inexhaustible or infinite character of the
   sacred writings, it does not, therefore, follow that we are willing to
   admit of hidden or mysterious meanings in them: in the same way we
   recognize the wonders and complexity of the laws of nature to be far
   beyond what eye has seen or knowledge reached, yet it is not therefore
   to be supposed that we acknowledge the existence of some other laws,
   different in kind from those we know, which are incapable of
   philosophical analysis. In like manner we have no reason to attribute
   to the Prophet or Evangelist any second or hidden sense different from
   that which appears on the surface. All that the Prophet meant may not
   have been consciously present to his mind; there were depths which to
   himself also were but half revealed. He beheld the fortunes of Israel
   passing into the heavens; the temporal kingdom was fading into an
   eternal one. It is not to be supposed that what he saw at a distance
   only was clearly defined to him; or that the universal truth which was
   appearing and reappearing in the history of the surrounding world took
   a purely spiritual or abstract form in his mind. There is a sense in
   which we may still say with Lord Bacon, that the words of prophecy are
   to be interpreted as the words of one with whom a thousand years are as
   one day, and one day as a thousand years.' But that is no reason for
   turning days into years, or for interpreting the things that must
   shortly come to pass' in the book of Revelation, as the events of
   modern history, or for separating the day of judgement from the
   destruction of Jerusalem in the Gospels. The double meaning which is
   given to our Saviour's discourse respecting the last things is not that
   form of eternity' of which Lord Bacon speaks; it resembles rather the
   doubling of an object when seen through glasses placed at different
   angles. It is true also that there are types in Scripture which were
   regarded as such by the Jews themselves, as for example, the scapegoat,
   or the paschal lamb. But that is no proof of all outward ceremonies
   being types when Scripture is silent; --if we assume the New Testament
   as a tradition running parallel with the Old, may not the Roman
   Catholic assume with equal reason tradition running parallel with the
   New? Prophetic symbols, again, have often the same meaning in different
   places (e. g. the four beasts or living creatures, the colours white or
   red); the reason is that this meaning is derived from some natural
   association (as of fruitfulness, purity, or the like); or again, they
   are borrowed in some of the later prophecies from earlier ones; we are
   not, therefore, justified in supposing any hidden connexion in the
   prophecies where they occur. Neither is there any ground for assuming
   design of any other kind in Scripture any more than in Plato or Homer.
   Wherever there is beauty and order, there is design; but there is no
   proof of any artificial design, such as is often traced by the Fathers,
   in the relation of the several parts of a book, or of the several books
   to each other. That is one of those mischievous notions which enables
   us, under the disguise of reverence, to make Scripture mean what we
   please. Nothing that can be said of the greatness or sublimity, or
   truth, or depth, or tenderness, of many passages, is too much. But that
   greatness is of a simple kind; it is not increased by double senses, or
   systems of types, or elaborate structure, or design. If every sentence
   was a mystery, every word a riddle, every letter a symbol, that would
   not make the Scriptures more worthy of a Divine author; it is a
   heathenish or Rabbinical fancy which reads them in this way. Such
   complexity would not place them above but below human compositions in
   general; for it would deprive them of the ordinary intelligibleness of
   human language. It is not for a Christian theologian to say that words
   were given to mankind to conceal their thoughts, neither was revelation
   given them to conceal the Divine.

   The second rule is an application of the general principle; interpret
   Scripture from itself,' as in other respects like any other book
   written in an age and country of which little or no other literature
   survives, and about which we know almost nothing except what is derived
   from its pages. Not that all the parts of Scripture are to be regarded
   as an indistinguishable mass. The Old Testament is not to be identified
   with the New, nor the Law with the Prophets, nor the Gospels with the
   Epistles, nor the Epistles of St. Paul to be violently harmonized with
   the Epistle of St. James. Each writer, each successive age, has
   characteristics of its own, as strongly marked, or more strongly than
   those which are found in the authors or periods of classical
   literature. These differences are not to be lost in the idea of a
   Spirit from whom they proceed or by which they were overruled. And
   therefore, illustration of one part of Scripture by another should be
   confined to writings of the same age and the same authors, except where
   the writings of different ages or persons offer obvious similarities.
   It may be said further that illustration should be chiefly derived, not
   only from the same author, but from the same writing, or from one of
   the same period of his life. For example, the comparison of St. John
   and the synoptic' Gospels, or of the Gospel of St. John with the
   Revelation of St. John, will tend rather to confuse than to elucidate
   the meaning of either; while, on the other hand, the comparison of the
   Prophets with one another, and with the Psalms, offers many valuable
   helps and lights to the interpreter. Again, the connexion between the
   Epistles written by the Apostle St. Paul about the same time (e.g.
   Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians--Colossians, Philippians,
   Ephesians--compared with Romans, Colossians--Ephesians, Galatians, &c.)
   is far closer than of Epistles which are separated by an interval of
   only a few years.

   But supposing all this to be understood, and that by the interpretation
   of Scripture from itself is meant a real interpretation of like by
   like, it may be asked, what is it that we gain from a minute comparison
   of a particular author or writing? The indiscriminate use of parallel
   passages taken from one end of Scripture and applied to the other
   (except so far as earlier compositions may have afforded the material
   or the form of later ones) is useless and uncritical. The uneducated or
   imperfectly educated person who looks out the marginal references of
   the English Bible, imagining himself in this way to gain a clearer
   insight into the Divine meaning, is really following the religious
   associations of his own mind. Even the critical use of parallel
   passages is not without danger. For are we to conclude that an author
   meant in one place what he says in another? Shall we venture to mend a
   corrupt phrase on the model of some other phrase, which memory,
   prevailing over judgement, calls up and thrusts into the text? It is
   this fallacy which has filled the pages of classical writers with
   useless and unfounded emendations.

   The meaning of the Canon Non nisi ex Scripturâ Scripturam potes
   interpretari,' is only this, That we cannot understand Scripture
   without becoming familiar with it.' Scripture is a world by itself,
   from which we must exclude foreign influences, whether theological or
   classical. To get inside that world is an effort of thought and
   imagination, requiring the sense of a poet as well as a
   critic--demanding, much more than learning, a degree of original power
   and intensity of mind. Any one who, instead of burying himself in the
   pages of the commentators, would learn the sacred writings by heart,
   and paraphrase them in English, will probably make a nearer approach to
   their true meaning than he would gather from any commentary. The
   intelligent mind will ask its own questions, and find for the most part
   its own answers. The true use of interpretation is to get rid of
   interpretation, and leave us alone in company with the author. When the
   meaning of Greek words is once known, the young student has almost all
   the real materials which are possessed by the greatest Biblical
   scholar, in the book itself. For almost our whole knowledge of the
   history of the Jews is derived from the Old Testament and the
   Apocryphal books, and almost our whole knowledge of the life of Christ
   and of the Apostolical age is derived from the New; whatever is added
   to them is either conjecture, or very slight topographical or
   chronological illustration. For this reason the rule given above, which
   is applicable to all books, is applicable to the New Testament more
   than any other.

   Yet in this consideration of the separate books of Scripture it is not
   to be forgotten that they have also a sort of continuity. We make a
   separate study of the subject, of the mode of thought, in some degree
   also of the language of each book. And at length the idea arises in our
   minds of a common literature, a pervading life, an overruling law. It
   may be compared to the effect of some natural scene in which we
   suddenly perceive a harmony or picture, or to the imperfect appearance
   of design which suggests itself in looking at the surface of the globe.
   That is to say, there is nothing miraculous or artificial in the
   arrangement of the books of Scripture; it is the result, not the
   design, which appears in them when bound in the same volume. Or if we
   like so to say, there is design, but a natural design which is revealed
   to after ages. Such continuity or design is best expressed under some
   notion of progress or growth, not regular, however, but with broken and
   imperfect stages, which the want of knowledge prevents our minutely
   defining. The great truth of the unity of God was there from the first;
   slowly as the morning broke in the heavens, like some central light, it
   filled and afterwards dispersed the mists of human passion in which it
   was itself enveloped. A change passes over the Jewish religion from
   fear to love, from power to wisdom, from the justice of God to the
   mercy of God, from the nation to the individual, from this world to
   another; from the visitation of the sins of the fathers upon the
   children, to every soul shall bear its own iniquity;' from the fire,
   the earthquake, and the storm, to the still small voice. There never
   was a time after the deliverance from Egypt, in which the Jewish people
   did not bear a kind of witness against the cruelty and licentiousness
   of the surrounding tribes. In the decline of the monarchy, as the
   kingdom itself was sinking under foreign conquerors, whether springing
   from contact with the outer world, or from some reaction within, the
   undergrowth of morality gathers strength; first, in the anticipation of
   prophecy, secondly, like a green plant in the hollow rind of
   Pharisaism--and individuals pray and commune with God each one for
   himself. At length the tree of life blossoms; the faith in immortality
   which had hitherto slumbered in the heart of man, intimated only in
   doubtful words (2 Sam. xii. 23; Psalm xvii. 15), or beaming for an
   instant in dark places (Job xix. 25), has become the prevailing belief.

   There is an interval in the Jewish annals which we often exclude from
   our thoughts, because it has no record in the canonical
   writings--extending over about four hundred years, from the last of the
   prophets of the Old Testament to the forerunner of Christ in the New.
   This interval, about which we know so little, which is regarded by many
   as a portion of secular rather than of sacred history, was nevertheless
   as fruitful in religious changes as any similar period which preceded.
   The establishment of the Jewish sects, and the wars of the Maccabees,
   probably exercised as great an influence on Judaism as the captivity
   itself. A third influence was that of the Alexandrian literature, which
   was attracting the Jewish intellect, at the same time that the Galilean
   zealot was tearing the nation in pieces with the doctrine that it was
   lawful to call no man master but God.' In contrast with that wild
   fanaticism as well as with the proud Pharisee, came One most unlike all
   that had been before, as the kings or rulers of mankind. In an age
   which was the victim of its own passions, the creature of its own
   circumstances, the slave of its own degenerate religion, our Saviour
   taught a lesson absolutely free from all the influences of a
   surrounding world. He made the last perfect revelation of God to man; a
   revelation not indeed immediately applicable to the state of society or
   the world, but in its truth and purity inexhaustible by the after
   generations of men. And of the first application of the truth which He
   taught as a counsel of perfection to the actual circumstances of
   mankind, we have the example in the Epistles.

   Such a general conception of growth or development in Scripture,
   beginning with the truth of the Unity of God in the earliest books and
   ending with the perfection of Christ, naturally springs up in our minds
   in the perusal of the sacred writings. It is a notion of value to the
   interpreter, for it enables him at the same time to grasp the whole and
   distinguish the parts. It saves him from the necessity of maintaining
   that the Old Testament is one and the same everywhere; that the books
   of Moses contain truths or precepts, such as the duty of prayer or the
   faith in immortality, or the spiritual interpretation of sacrifice,
   which no one has ever seen there. It leaves him room enough to admit
   all the facts of the case. No longer is he required to defend, or to
   explain away, David's imprecations against his enemies, or his
   injunctions to Solomon, any more than his sin in the matter of Uriah.
   Nor is he hampered with a theory of accommodation. Still, the sense of
   the increasing purpose which through the ages ran' is present to him,
   nowhere else continuously discernible or ending in a divine perfection.
   Nowhere else is there found the same interpenetration of the political
   and religious element--a whole nation, though never good for much at
   any time,' possessed with the conviction that it was living in the face
   of God--in whom the Sun of righteousness shone upon the corruption of
   an Eastern nature--the fewest of all people,' yet bearing the greatest
   part in the education of the world. Nowhere else among the teachers and
   benefactors of mankind is there any form like His, in whom the desire
   of the nation is fulfilled, and not of that nation only,' but of all
   mankind, whom He restores to His Father and their Father, to His God
   and their God.

   Such a growth or development may be regarded as a kind of progress from
   childhood to manhood. In the child there is an anticipation of truth;
   his reason is latent in the form of feeling; many words are used by him
   which he fin-perfectly understands; he is led by temporal promises,
   believing that to be good is to be happy always; he is pleased by
   marvels and has vague terrors. He is confined to a spot of earth, and
   lives in a sort of prison of sense, yet is bursting also with a fulness
   of childish life: he imagines God to be like a human father, only
   greater and more awful; he is easily impressed with solemn thoughts,
   but soon rises up to play' with other children. It is observable that
   his ideas of right and wrong are very simple, hardly extending to
   another life; they consist chiefly in obedience to his parents, whose
   word is his law. As he grows older he mixes more and more with others;
   first with one or two who have a great influence in the direction of
   his mind. At length the world opens upon him; another work of education
   begins; and he learns to discern more truly the meaning of things and
   his relation to men in general. You may complete the image, by
   supposing that there was a time in his early days when he was a
   helpless outcast in the land of Egypt and the house of bondage.' And as
   he arrives at manhood he reflects on his former years, the progress of
   his education, the hardships of his infancy, the home of his youth (the
   thought of which is ineffaceable in after life), and he now understands
   that all this was but a preparation for another state of being, in
   which he is to play a part for himself. And once more in age you may
   imagine him like the patriarch looking back on the entire past, which
   he reads anew, perceiving that the events of life had a purpose or
   result which was not seen at the time; they seem to him bound each to
   each by natural piety.'

   Which things are an allegory,' the particulars of which any one may
   interpret for himself. For the child born after the flesh is the symbol
   of the child born after the Spirit. The law was a schoolmaster to bring
   men to Christ,' and now we are under a schoolmaster' no longer. The
   anticipation of truth which came from without to the childhood or youth
   of the human race is witnessed to within; the revelation of God is not
   lost but renewed in the heart and understanding of the man. Experience
   has taught us the application of the lesson in a wider sphere. And many
   influences have combined to form the after life' of the world. When at
   the close (shall we say) of a great period in the history of man, we
   cast our eyes back on the course of events, from the angel of his
   presence in the wilderness' to the multitude of peoples, nations,
   languages, who are being drawn together by His Providence--from the
   simplicity of the pastoral state in the dawn of the world's day, to all
   the elements of civilization and knowledge which are beginning to meet
   and mingle in a common life, we also understand that we are no longer
   in our early home, to which, nevertheless, we fondly look; and that the
   end is yet unseen, and the purposes of God towards the human race only
   half revealed. And to turn once more to the Interpreter of Scripture,
   he too feels that the continuous growth of revelation which he traces
   in the Old and New Testament, is a part of a larger whole extending
   over the earth and reaching to another world.

   § 4.

   Scripture has an inner life or soul; it has also an outward body or
   form. That form is language, which imperfectly expresses our common
   notions, much more those higher truths which religion teaches. At the
   time when our Saviour came into the world the Greek language was itself
   in a state of degeneracy and decay. It had lost its poetic force, and
   was ceasing to have the sway over the mind which classical Greek once
   held. That is a more important revolution in the mental history of
   mankind, than we easily conceive in modern times, when all languages
   sit loosely on thought, and the peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of one
   are corrected by our knowledge of another. It may be numbered among the
   causes which favoured the growth of Christianity. That degeneracy was a
   preparation for the Gospel--the decaying soil in which the new elements
   of life were to come forth--the beginning of another state of man, in
   which language and mythology and philosophy were no longer to exert the
   same constraining power as in the ancient world. The civilized portion
   of mankind were becoming of one speech, the diffusion of which along
   the shores of the Mediterranean sea made a way for the entrance of
   Christianity into the human understanding, just as the Roman empire
   prepared the framework of its outward history. The first of all
   languages, for glory and for beauty,' had become the common dialect' of
   the Macedonian kingdoms; it had been moulded in the schools of
   Alexandria to the ideas of the East and the religious wants of Jews.
   Neither was it any violence to its nature to be made the vehicle of the
   new truths which were springing up in the heart of man. The
   definiteness and absence of reflectiveness in the earlier forms of
   human speech, would have imposed a sort of limit on the freedom and
   spirituality of the Gospel; even the Greek of Plato would have coldly
   furnished forth' the words of eternal life.' A religion which was to be
   universal required the divisions of languages, as of nations, to be in
   some degree broken down. [Poena linguarum dispersit homines, donum
   linguarum in unum collegit.'] But this community or freedom of language
   was accompanied by corresponding defects; it had lost its logical
   precision; it was less coherent, and more under the influence of
   association. It might be compared to a garment which allowed and yet
   impeded the exercise of the mind by being too large and loose for it.

   From the inner life of Scripture it is time to pass on to the
   consideration of this outward form, including that other framework of
   modes of thought and figures of speech which is between the two. A
   knowledge of the original language is a necessary qualification of the
   Interpreter of Scripture. It takes away at least one chance of error in
   the explanation of a passage; it removes one of the films which have
   gathered over the page; it brings the meaning home in a more intimate
   and subtle way than a translation could do. To this, however, another
   qualification should be added, which is, the logical power to perceive
   the meaning of words in reference to their context. And there is a
   worse fault than ignorance of Greek in the interpretation of the New
   Testament, that is, ignorance of any language. The Greek fathers, for
   example, are far from being the best verbal commentators, because their
   knowledge of Greek often leads them away from the drift of the passage.
   The minuteness of the study in our own day has also a tendency to
   introduce into the text associations which are not really found there.
   There is a danger of making words mean too much; refinements of
   signification are drawn out of them, perhaps contained in their
   etymology, which are lost in common use and parlance. There is the
   error of interpreting every particle, as though it were a link in the
   argument, instead of being, as is often the case, an excrescence of
   style. The verbal critic magnifies his art, which is really great in
   Aeschylus or Pindar, but not of equal importance in the interpretation
   of the simpler language of the New Testament. His love of scholarship
   will sometimes lead him to impress a false system on words and
   constructions. A great critic [1] who has commented on the three first
   chapters of the Epistle to the Galatians, has certainly afforded a
   proof that it is possible to read the New Testament under a distorting
   influence from classical Greek. The tendency gains support from the
   undefined feeling that Scripture does not come behind in excellence of
   language any more than of thought. And if not, as in former days, the
   classic purity of the Greek of the New Testament, yet its certainty and
   accuracy, the assumption of which, as any other assumption, is only the
   parent of inaccuracy, is still maintained.

   The study of the language of the New Testament has suffered in another
   way by following too much in the track of classical scholarship. All
   dead languages which have passed into the hands of grammarians, have
   given rise to questions which have either no result or in which the
   importance of the result, or the certainty, if certain, is out of
   proportion to the labour spent in attaining it. The field is exhausted
   by great critics, and then subdivided among lesser ones. The subject,
   unlike that of physical science, has a limit, and unless new ground is
   broken up, as for example in mythology, or comparative philology, is
   apt to grow barren. Though it is not true to say that we know as much
   about the Greeks and Romans as we ever shall,' it is certain that we
   run a danger from the deficiency of material, of wasting time in
   questions which do not add anything to real knowledge, or in
   conjectures which must always remain uncertain, and may in turn give
   way to other conjectures in the next generation. Little points may be
   of great importance when rightly determined, because the observation of
   them tends to quicken the instinct of language; but conjectures about
   little things or rules respecting them which were not in the mind of
   Greek authors themselves, are not of equal value. There is the
   scholasticism of philology, not only in the Alexandrian, but in our own
   times; as in the middle ages, there was the scholasticism of
   philosophy. Questions of mere orthography, about which there cannot be
   said to have been a right or wrong, have been pursued almost with a
   Rabbinical minuteness. The story of the scholar who regretted that he
   had not concentrated his life on the dative case,' is hardly a
   caricature of the spirit of such inquiries. The form of notes to the
   classics often seems to arise out of a necessity for observing a
   certain proportion between the commentary and the text. And the same
   tendency is noticeable in many of the critical and philological
   observations which are made on the New Testament. The field of Biblical
   criticism is narrower, and its materials more fragmentary; so too the
   minuteness and uncertainty of the questions raised has been greater.
   For example, the discussions respecting the chronology of St. Paul's
   life and his second imprisonment: or about the identity of James, the
   brother of the Lord, or in another department, respecting the use of
   the Greek article, have gone far beyond the line of utility.

   There seem to be reasons for doubting whether any considerable light
   can be thrown on the New Testament from inquiry into the language. Such
   inquiries are popular, because they are safe; but their popularity is
   not the measure of their use. It has not been sufficiently considered
   that the difficulties of the New Testament are for the most part common
   to the Greek and the English. The noblest translation in the world has
   a few great errors, more than half of them in the text; but we do it
   violence' to haggle over the words. Minute corrections of tenses or
   particles are no good; they spoil the English without being nearer the
   Greek. Apparent mistranslations are often due to a better knowledge of
   English rather than a worse knowledge of Greek. It is true that the
   signification of a few uncommon expressions, e. g. exousia, epibalon,
   sunapagomeno, k.t.l., is yet uncertain. But no result of consequence
   would follow from the attainment of absolute certainty respecting the
   meaning of any of these. A more promising field opens to the
   interpreter in the examination of theological terms, such as faith
   (pistis), grace (charis), righteousness (dikaiosune), sanctification
   (hagiasmos), the law (nomos), the spirit (pneuma), the comforter
   (parakletos), &c. provided always that the use of such terms in the New
   Testament is clearly separated (1) from their derivation or previous
   use in Classical or Alexandrian Greek, (2) from their after use in the
   Fathers and in systems of theology. To which may be added another
   select class of words descriptive of the offices or customs of the
   Apostolic Church, such as Apostle (apostolos), Bishop (episkopos),
   Elder (presbuteros), Deacon and Deaconess (ho kai he diakonos),
   love-feast (agapai), the Lord's day (he kuriake hemera), &c. It is a
   lexilogus of these and similar terms, rather than a lexicon of the
   entire Greek Testament that is required. Interesting subjects of real
   inquiry are also the comparison of the Greek of the New Testament with
   modern Greek on the one hand, and the Greek of the LXX on the other. It
   is not likely, however, that they will afford much more help than they
   have already done in the elucidation of the Greek of the New Testament.

   It is for others to investigate the language of the Old Testament, to
   which the preceding remarks are only in part applicable. And it may be
   observed in passing of this, as of any other old language, that not the
   later form of the language, but the cognate dialects, must ever be the
   chief source of its illustration. For in every ancient language,
   antecedent or contemporary forms, not the subsequent ones, afford the
   real insight into its nature and structure. It must also be admitted,
   that very great and real obscurities exist in the English translation
   of the Old Testament, which even a superficial acquaintance with the
   original has a tendency to remove. Leaving, however, to others the
   consideration of the Semitic languages, which raise questions of a
   different kind from the Hellenistic Greek, we will offer a few remarks
   on the latter. Much has been said of the increasing accuracy of our
   knowledge of the language of the New Testament; the old Hebraistic
   method of explaining difficulties of language or construction has
   retired within very narrow limits; it might probably with advantage be
   confined to still narrower ones--[if it have any place at all except in
   the Apocalypse or the Gospel of St. Matthew]. There is, perhaps, some
   confusion between accuracy of our knowledge of language, and the
   accuracy of language itself; which is also strongly maintained. It is
   observed that the usages of barbarous as well as civilized nations
   conform perfectly to grammatical rules; that the uneducated in all
   countries have certain laws of speech as much as Shakespeare or Bacon;
   the usages of Lucian, it may be said, are as regular as those of Plato,
   even when they are different. The decay of language seems rather to
   witness to the permanence than to the changeableness of its structure;
   it is the flesh, not the bones, that begins to drop off. But such
   general remarks, although just, afford but little help in determining
   the character of the Greek of the New Testament, which has of course a
   certain system, failing in which it would cease to be a language. Some
   further illustration is needed of the change which has passed upon it.
   All languages do not decay in the same manner; and the influence of
   decay in the same language may be different in different countries;
   when used in writing and in speaking--when applied to the matters of
   ordinary life and to the higher truths of philosophy or religion. And
   the degeneracy of language itself is not a mere principle of
   dissolution, but creative also; while dead and rigid in some of its
   uses, it is elastic and expansive in others. The decay of an ancient
   language is the beginning of the construction of a modern one. The loss
   of some usages gives a greater precision or freedom to others. The
   logical element, as for example in the Medieval Latin, will probably be
   strongest when the poetical has vanished. A great movement, like the
   Reformation in Germany, passing over a nation, may give a new birth
   also to its language.

   These remarks may be applied to the Greek of the New Testament, which
   although classed vaguely. under the common dialect,' has, nevertheless,
   many features which are altogether peculiar to itself, and such as are
   found in no other remains of ancient literature. (1) It is more unequal
   in style even in the same books, that is to say, more original and
   plastic in one part, more rigid and unpliable in another. There is a
   want of the continuous power to frame a paragraph or to arrange clauses
   in subordination to each other, even to the extent in which it was
   possessed by a Greek scholiast or rhetorician. On the other hand there
   is a fullness of life, a new birth,' in the use of abstract terms,
   which is not found elsewhere after the golden age of Greek philosophy.
   Almost the only passage in the New Testament which reads like a Greek
   period of the time, is the first paragraph of the Gospel according to
   St. Luke, and the corresponding words of the Acts. But the power and
   meaning of the characteristic words of the New Testament is in
   remarkable contrast with the vapid and general use of the same words in
   Philo about the same time. There is also a sort of lyrical passion in
   some passages (1 Cor. xiii.; 2 Cor. vi. 6-10; xi. 21-33) which is a new
   thing in the literature of the world; to which, at any rate, no Greek
   author of a later age furnishes any parallel. (2) Though written, the
   Greek of the New Testament partakes of the character of a spoken
   language; it is more lively and simple, and less structural than
   ordinary writing--a peculiarity of style which further agrees with the
   circumstance that the Epistles of St. Paul were not written with his
   own hand, but probably dictated to an amanuensis, and that the Gospels
   also probably originate in an oral narrative. (3) The ground colours of
   the language may be said to be two; first, the LXX.; which is modified,
   secondly, by the spoken Greek of eastern countries, and by the
   differences which might be expected to arise between a translation and
   an original; many Hebraisms would occur in the Greek of a translator,
   which would never have come to his pen but for the influence of the
   work which he was translating. (4) To which may be added a. few Latin
   and Chaldee words, and a few Rabbinical formulae. The influence of
   Hebrew or Chaldee in the New Testament is for the most part at a
   distance, in the background, acting-not directly, but mediately,
   through the LXX. It has much to do with the clausular structure and
   general form, but hardly anything with the grammatical usage. Philo,
   too, did not know Hebrew, or at least the Hebrew Scriptures, yet there
   is also a mediate' influence of Hebrew traceable in his writings. (5)
   There is an element of constraint in the style of the New Testament,
   arising from the circumstance of its authors writing in a language
   which was not their own. This constraint shows itself in the repetition
   of words and phrases; in the verbal oppositions and anacolutha of St.
   Paul; in the short sentences of St. John. This is further increased by
   the fact that the writers of the New Testament were unlearned men,' who
   had not the same power of writing as of speech. Moreover, as has been
   often remarked, the difficulty of composition increases in proportion
   to the greatness of the subject; e. g., the narrative of Thucydides is
   easy and intelligible, while his reflections and speeches are full of
   confusion; the effort to concentrate seems to interfere with the
   consecutiveness and fluency of ideas. Something of this kind is
   discernible in those passages of the Epistles in which the Apostle St.
   Paul is seeking to set forth the opposite sides of God's dealing with
   man, e.g., Rom. iii. 1-9; ix., x.; or in which the sequence of the
   thought is interrupted by the conflict of emotions, 1 Cor. ix. 20; Gal.
   iv. 11-20. (6) The power of the Gospel over language must be
   recognized, showing itself, first of all, in the original and
   consequently variable signification of words (pistis, charis, soteria),
   which is also more comprehensive and human than the heretical usage of
   many of the same terms, e.g., gnosis (knowledge), sophia (wisdom),
   ktisis (creature, creation); secondly, in a peculiar use of some
   constructions, such as dikaiosune Theou (righteousness of God), pistis
   Iesou Christou (faith of Jesus Christ), en Christo (in Christ), en Theo
   (in God), huper hemon (for us), in which the meaning of the genitive
   case or of the preposition almost escapes our notice, from familiarity
   with the sound of it. Lastly, the degeneracy of the Greek language is
   traceable in the failure of syntactical power; in the insertion of
   prepositions to denote relations of thought, which classical Greek
   would have expressed by the case only; in the omission of them when
   classical Greek would have required them; in the incipient use of hina
   with the subjunctive for the infinitive; in the confusion of ideas of
   cause and effect; in the absence of the article in the case of an
   increasing number of words which are passing into proper names; in the
   loss of the finer shades of difference in the negative particles; in
   the occasional confusion of the aorist and perfect; in excessive
   fondness for particles of reasoning or inference; in various forms of
   apposition, especially that of the word to the sentence; in the use,
   sometimes emphatic, sometimes only pleonastic, of the personal and
   demonstrative pronouns. These are some of the signs that the language
   is breaking up and losing its structure.

   Our knowledge of the New Testament is derived almost exclusively from
   itself. Of the language, as well as of the subject, it may be truly
   said, that what other writers contribute is nothing in comparison of
   that which is gained from observation of the text. Some inferences
   which may be gathered from this general fact are the following:--First,
   that less weight should be given to lexicons, that is, to the authority
   of other Greek writers, and more to the context. The use of a word in a
   new sense, the attribution of a neuter meaning to a verb elsewhere
   passive (Rom. iii. 9 proechometha), the resolution of the compound into
   two simple notions (Gal. iii. 1 proegraphe), these, when the context
   requires it, are not to be set aside by the scholar because sanctioned
   by no known examples. The same remark applies to grammars as well as
   lexicons. We cannot be certain that dia with the accusative never has
   the same meaning as dia with the genitive (Gal. iv. 13; Phil. i. 15),
   or that the article always retains its defining power (2 Cor. i. 17;
   Acts xvii. 1), or that the perfect is never used in place of the aorist
   (1 Cor. xv. 4; Rev. v. 7, &c.); still less can we affirm that the
   latter end of a sentence never forgets the beginning (Rom. ii. 17-21;
   v. 12-18; ix. 22; xvi. 25-27; &c. &c.). Foreign influences tend to
   derange the strong natural perception or remembrance of the analogy of
   our own language. That is very likely to have occurred in the case of
   some of the writers of the New Testament; that there is such a
   derangement is a fact. There is no probability in favour of St. Paul
   writing in broken sentences, but there is no improbability which should
   lead us to assume, in such sentences, continuous grammar and thought,
   as appears to have been the feeling of the copyists who have corrected
   the anacolutha. The occurrence of them further justifies the
   interpreter in using some freedom with other passages in which the
   syntax does not absolutely break down. When confusion of two
   constructions,' meaning to say one thing and finishing with another,'
   saying two things in one instead of disposing them in their logical
   sequence,' are attributed to the Apostle; the use of these and similar
   expressions is defended by the fact that more numerous anacolutha occur
   in St. Paul's writings than in any equal portion of the New Testament,
   and far more than in the writings of any other Greek author of equal
   length.

   Passing from the grammatical structure, we may briefly consider the
   logical character of the language of the New Testament. Two things
   should be here distinguished, the logical form and the logical sequence
   of thought. Some ages have been remarkable for the former of these two
   characteristics; they have dealt in opposition, contradiction, climax,
   pleonasm, reason within reason, and the like; mere statements taking
   the form of arguments--each sentence seeming to be a link in a chain.
   In such periods of literature, the appearance of logic is rhetorical,
   and is to be set down to the style. That is the case with many passages
   in the New Testament which are studded with logical or rhetorical
   formulae, especially in the Epistles of St. Paul. Nothing can be more
   simple or natural than the object of the writer. Yet forms of the
   schools' appear (whether learnt at the feet of Gamaliel, that reputed
   master of Greek learning, or not) which imply a degree of logical or
   rhetorical training.

   The observation of this rhetorical or logical element has a bearing on
   the Interpretation of Scripture. For it leads us to distinguish between
   the superficial connexion of words and the real connexion of thoughts.
   Otherwise injustice is done to the argument of the sacred writer, who
   may be supposed to violate logical rules, of which he is unconscious.
   For example, the argument of Rom. iii. 19 may be classed by the
   logicians under some head of fallacy (Ex aliquo non sequitur omnis');
   the series of inferences which follow one another in Rom. i. 16-18 are
   for the most part different aspects or statements of the same truth. So
   in Rom. i. 32 the climax rather appears to be an anticlimax. But to
   dwell on these things interferes with the true perception of the
   Apostle's meaning, which is not contained in the repetitions of gar by
   which it is hooked together; nor are we accurately to weigh the
   proportions expressed by his ou monon--alla kai or pollo mallon:
   neither need we suppose that where men is found alone, there was a
   reason for the omission of de (Rom. i. 8; iii. 2); or that the
   opposition of words and sentences is always the opposition of ideas
   (Rom. v. 7; x. 10). It is true that these and similar forms or
   distinctions of language admit of translation into English; and in
   every case the interpreter may find some point of view in which the
   simplest truth of feeling may be drawn out in an antithetical or
   argumentative form. But whether these points of view were in the
   Apostle's mind at the time of writing may be doubted; the real meaning,
   or kernel, seems to lie deeper and to be more within. When we pass from
   the study of each verse to survey the whole at a greater distance, the
   form of thought is again seen to be unimportant in comparison of the
   truth which is contained in it. The same remark may be extended to the
   opposition, not only of words, but of ideas, which is found in the
   Scriptures generally, and almost seems to be inherent in human language
   itself. The law is opposed to faith, good to evil, the spirit to the
   flesh, light to darkness, the world to the believer; the sheep are set
   on his right hand, but the goats on the left.' The influence of this
   logical opposition has been great and not always without abuse in
   practice. For the opposition is one of ideas only which is not realized
   in fact. Experience shows us not that there are two classes of men
   animated by two opposing principles, but an infinite number of classes
   or individuals from the lowest depth of misery and sin to the highest
   perfection of which human nature is capable, the best not wholly good,
   the worst not entirely evil. But the figure or mode of representation
   changes these differences of degree into differences of kind. And we
   often think and speak and act in reference both to ourselves and
   others, as though the figure were altogether a reality.

   Other questions arise out of the analysis of the modes of thought of
   Scripture. Unless we are willing to use words without inquiring into
   their meaning, it is necessary for us to arrange them in some relation
   to our own minds. The modes of thought of the Old Testament are not the
   same with those of the New, and those of the New are only partially the
   same with those in use among ourselves at the present day. The
   education of the human mind may be traced as clearly from the Book of
   Genesis to the Epistles of St. Paul, as from Homer to Plato and
   Aristotle. When we hear St. Paul speaking of body and soul and spirit,'
   we know that such language as this would not occur in the Books of
   Moses or in the Prophet Isaiah. It has the colour of a later age, in
   which abstract terms have taken the place of expressions derived from
   material objects. When we proceed further to compare these or other
   words or expressions of St. Paul with the body and mind,' or mind' and
   matter,' which is a distinction, not only of philosophy, but of common
   language among ourselves, it is not easy at once to determine the
   relation between them. Familiar as is the sound of both expressions,
   many questions arise when we begin to compare them.

   This is the metaphysical difficulty in the Interpretation of Scripture,
   which it is better not to ignore, because the consideration of it is
   necessary to the understanding of many passages, and also because it
   may return upon us in the form of materialism or scepticism. To some
   who are not aware how little words affect the nature of things it may
   seem to raise speculations of a very serious kind. Their doubts would,
   perhaps, find expression in some such exclamations as the
   following:--How is religion possible when modes of thought are
   shifting? and words changing their meaning, and statements of doctrine,
   though "starched" with philosophy, are in perpetual danger of
   dissolution from metaphysical analysis?

   The answer seems to be, that Christian truth is not dependent on the
   fixedness of modes of thought. The metaphysician may analyze the ideas
   of the mind just as the physiologist may analyze the powers or parts of
   the bodily frame, yet morality and social life still go on, as in the
   body digestion is uninterrupted. That is not an illustration only; it
   represents the fact. Though we had no words for mind, matter, soul,
   body, and the like, Christianity would remain the same. This is
   obvious, whether we think of the case of the poor, who understand such
   distinctions very imperfectly, or of those nations of the earth, who
   have no precisely corresponding division of ideas. It is not of that
   subtle or evanescent character which is liable to be lost in shifting
   the use of terms. Indeed, it is an advantage at times to discard these
   terms with the view of getting rid of the oppositions to which they
   give rise. No metaphysical analysis can prevent our taking up the cross
   and following Christ,' or receiving the kingdom of heaven as little
   children. To analyze the trichotomy' of St. Paul is interesting as a
   chapter in the history of the human mind and necessary as a part of
   Biblical exegesis, but it has nothing to do with the religion of
   Christ. Christian duties may be enforced, and the life of Christ may be
   the centre of our thoughts, whether we speak of reason and faith, of
   soul and body, or of mind and matter, or adopt a mode of speech which
   dispenses with any of these divisions.

   Connected with the modes of thought or representation in Scripture are
   the figures of speech of Scripture, about which the same question may
   be asked: What division can we make between the figure and the
   reality?' And the answer seems to be of the same kind, that We cannot
   precisely draw the line between them.' Language, and especially the
   language of Scripture, does not admit of any sharp distinction. The
   simple expressions of one age become the allegories or figures of
   another; many of those in the New Testament are taken from the Old. But
   neither is there anything really essential in the form of these
   figures; nay, the literal application of many of them has been a great
   stumblingblock to the reception of Christianity. A recent commentator
   on Scripture appears willing to peril religion on the literal truth of
   such an expression as We shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the
   air.' Would he be equally ready to stake Christianity on the literal
   meaning of the words, Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not
   quenched ?

   Of what has been said this is the sum:--That Scripture, like other
   books, has one meaning, which is to be gathered from itself without
   reference to the adaptations of Fathers or Divines; and without regard
   to a priori notions about its nature and origin. It is to be
   interpreted like other books, with attention to the character of its
   authors, and the prevailing state of civilization and knowledge, with
   allowance for peculiarities of style and language, and modes of thought
   and figures of speech. Yet not without a sense that as we read there
   grows upon us the witness of God in the world, anticipating in a rude
   and primitive age the truth that was to be, shining more and more unto
   the perfect day in the life of Christ, which again is reflected from
   different points of view in the teaching of His Apostles.'

   § 4.

   It has been a principal aim of the preceding pages to distinguish the
   interpretation from the application of Scripture. Many of the errors
   alluded to arise out of a confusion of the two. The present is nearer
   to us than the past; the circumstances which surround us pre-occupy our
   thoughts; it is only by an effort that we reproduce the ideas, or
   events, or persons of other ages. And thus, quite naturally, almost by
   a law of the human mind, the application of Scripture takes the place
   of its original meaning. And the question is, not how to get rid of
   this natural tendency, but how we may have the true use of it. For it
   cannot be got rid of, or rather is one of the chief instruments of
   religious usefulness in the world: Ideas must be given through
   something;' those of religion find their natural expression in the
   words of Scripture, in the adaptation of which to another state of life
   it is hardly possible that the first intention of the writers should be
   always preserved. Interpretation is the province of few; it requires a
   finer perception of language, and a higher degree of cultivation than
   is attained by the majority of mankind. But applications are made by
   all, from the philosopher reading God in History,' to the poor woman
   who finds in them a response to her prayers, and the solace of her
   daily life. In the hour of death we do not want critical explanations;
   in most cases, those to whom they would be offered are incapable of
   understanding them. A few words, breathing the sense of the whole
   Christian world, such as I know that my Redeemer liveth ' (though the
   exact meaning of them may be doubtful to the Hebrew scholar); I shall
   go to him, but he shall not return to me;' touch a chord which would
   never be reached by the most skilful exposition of the argument of one
   of St. Paul's Epistles.

   There is also a use of Scripture in education and literature. This
   literary use, though secondary to the religious one, is not
   unimportant. It supplies a common language to the educated and
   uneducated, in which the best and highest thoughts of both are
   expressed; it is a medium between the abstract notions of the one and
   the simple feelings of the other. To the poor especially, it conveys in
   the form which they are most capable of receiving, the lesson of
   history and life. The beauty and power of speech and writing would be
   greatly impaired, if the Scriptures ceased to be known or used among
   us. The orator seems to catch from them a sort of inspiration; in the
   simple words of Scripture which he stamps anew, the philosopher often
   finds his most pregnant expressions. If modern times have been richer
   in the wealth of abstract thought, the contribution of earlier ages to
   the mind of the world has not been less, but, perhaps greater, in
   supplying the poetry of language. There is no such treasury of
   instruments and materials as Scripture. The loss of Homer, or the loss
   of Shakespeare, would have affected the whole series of Greek or
   English authors who follow. But the disappearance of the Bible from the
   books which the world contains, would produce results far greater; we
   can scarcely conceive the degree in which it would alter literature and
   language--the ideas of the educated and philosophical, as well as the
   feelings and habits of mind of the poor. If it has been said, with an
   allowable hyperbole, that Homer is Greece,' with much more truth may it
   be said, that the Bible is Christendom.'

   Many by whom considerations of this sort will be little understood,
   may, nevertheless, recognize the use made of the Old Testament in the
   New. The religion of Christ was first taught by an application of the
   words of the Psalms and the Prophets. Our Lord Himself sanctions this
   application. Can there be a better use of Scripture than that which is
   made by Scripture?' Or any more likely method of teaching the truths of
   Christianity than that by which they were first taught?' For it may be
   argued that the critical interpretation of Scripture is a device almost
   of yesterday; it is the vocation of the scholar or philosopher, not of
   the Apostle or Prophet. The new truth which was introduced into the Old
   Testament, rather than the old truth which was found there, was the
   salvation and the conversion of the world. There are many quotations
   from the Psalms and the, Prophets in the Epistles, in which the meaning
   is quickened or spiritualized, but hardly any, probably none, which is
   based on the original sense or context. That is not so singular a
   phenomenon as may at first sight be imagined. It may appear strange to
   us that Scripture should be interpreted in Scripture, in a manner not
   altogether in agreement with modern criticism; but would it not be more
   strange that it should be interpreted otherwise than in agreement with
   the ideas of the age or country in which it was written? The
   observation that there is such an agreement, leads to two conclusions
   which have a bearing on our present subject. First, it is a reason for
   not insisting on the applications which the New Testament makes of
   passages in the Old, as their original meaning. Secondly, it gives
   authority and precedent for the use of similar applications in our own
   day.

   But, on the other hand, though interwoven with literature, though
   common to all ages of the Church, though sanctioned by our Lord and His
   Apostles, it is easy to see that such an employment of Scripture is
   liable to error and perversion. For it may not only receive a new
   meaning; it may be applied in a spirit alien to itself. It may become
   the symbol of fanaticism, the cloke of malice, the disguise of policy.
   Cromwell at Drogheda, quoting Scripture to his soldiers; the well-known
   attack on the Puritans in the State, Service for the Restoration, Not
   every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord;' the reply of the Venetian
   Ambassador to the suggestion of Wolsey, that Venice should take a lead
   in Italy, which was only the Earth is the Lord's and the fulness
   thereof,' are examples of such uses. In former times, it was a real and
   not an imaginary fear, that the wars of the Lord in the Old Testament
   might arouse a fire in the bosom of Franks and Huns. In our own day
   such dangers have passed away; it is only a figure of speech when the
   preacher says, Gird on thy sword, O thou most Mighty.' The warlike
   passions of men are not roused by quotations from Scripture, nor can
   states of life such as slavery or polygamy, which belong to a past age,
   be defended, at least in England, by the example of the Old Testament.
   The danger or error is of another kind; more subtle, but hardly less
   real. For if we are permitted to apply Scripture under the pretence of
   interpreting it, the language of Scripture becomes only a mode of
   expressing the public feeling or opinion of our own day. Any passing
   phase of politics or art, or spurious philanthropy, may have a kind of
   Scriptural authority. The words that are used are the words of the
   Prophet or Evangelist, but we stand behind and adapt them to our
   purpose. Hence it is necessary to consider the limits and manner of a
   just adaptation; how much may be allowed for the sake of ornament; how
   far the Scripture, in all its details, may be regarded as an allegory
   of human life--where the true analogy begins--how far the
   interpretation of Scripture will serve as a corrective to its practical
   abuse.

   Truth seems to require that we should separate mere adaptations from
   the original meaning of Scripture. It is not honest or reasonable to
   confound illustration with argument, in theology, any more than in
   other subjects. For example, if a preacher chooses to represent the
   condition of a church or of an individual in the present day, under the
   figure of Elijah left alone among the idolatrous tribes of Israel, such
   an allusion is natural enough; but if he goes on to argue that
   individuals are therefore justified in remaining in what they believe
   to be an erroneous communion--that is a mere appearance of argument
   which ought not to have the slightest weight with a man of sense. Such
   a course may indeed be perfectly justifiable, but not on the ground
   that a prophet of the Lord once did so, two thousand five hundred years
   ago. Not in this sense were the lives of the Prophets written for our
   instruction. There are many important morals conveyed by them, but only
   so far as they themselves represent universal principles of justice and
   love. These universal principles they clothe with flesh and blood: they
   show them to us written on the hearts of men of like passions with
   ourselves. The prophecies, again, admit of many applications to the
   Christian Church or to the Christian life. There is no harm in speaking
   of the Church as the Spiritual Israel, or in using the imagery of
   Isaiah respecting Messiah's kingdom, as the type of good things to
   come. But when it is gravely urged, that from such passages as Kings
   shall be thy nursing fathers,' we are to collect the relations of
   Church and State, or from the pictorial description of Isaiah, that it
   is to be inferred there will be a reign of Christ on earth--that is a
   mere assumption of the forms of reasoning by the imagination. Nor is it
   a healthful or manly tone of feeling which depicts the political
   opposition to the Church in our own day, under imagery which is
   borrowed from the desolate Sion of the captivity. Scripture is apt to
   come too readily to the lips, when we are pouring out our own
   weaknesses, or enlarging on some favourite theme--perhaps idealizing in
   the language of prophecy the feebleness of preaching or missions in the
   present day, or from the want of something else to say. In many
   discussions on these and similar subjects, the position of the Jewish
   King, Church, Priest, has led to a confusion, partly caused by the use
   of similar words in modern senses among ourselves. The King or Queen of
   England may be called the Anointed of the Lord, but we should not
   therefore imply that the attributes of sovereignty are the same as
   those which belonged to King David. All these are figures of speech,
   the employment of which is too common, and has been injurious to
   religion, because it prevents our looking at the facts of history or
   life as they truly are.

   This is the first step towards a more truthful use of Scripture in
   practice--the separation of adaptation from interpretation. No one who
   is engaged in preaching or in religious instruction can be required to
   give up Scripture language; it is the common element in which his
   thoughts and those of his hearers move. But he may be asked to
   distinguish the words of Scripture from the truths of Scripture--the
   means from the end. The least expression of Scripture is weighty; it
   affects the minds of the hearers in a way that no other language can.
   Whatever responsibility attaches to idle words, attaches in still
   greater degree to the idle or fallacious use of Scripture terms. And
   there is surely a want of proper reverence for Scripture, when we
   confound the weakest and feeblest applications of its words with their
   true meaning--when we avail ourselves of their natural power to point
   them against some enemy--when we divert the eternal words of charity
   and truth into a defence of some passing opinion. For not only in the
   days of the Pharisees, but in our own, the letter has been taking the
   place of the spirit; the least matters, of the greatest, and the
   primary meaning has been lost in the secondary use.

   Other simple cautions may also be added. The applications of Scripture
   should be harmonized and, as it were, interpenetrated with the spirit
   of the Gospel, the whole of which should be in every part; though the
   words may receive a new sense, the new sense ought to be in agreement
   with the general truth. They should be used to bring home practical
   precepts, not to send the imagination on a voyage of discovery; they
   are not the real foundation of our faith in another world, nor can
   they, by pleasant pictures, add to our knowledge of it. They should not
   confound the accidents with the essence of religion--the restrictions
   and burdens of the Jewish law with the freedom of the Gospel--the
   things which Moses allowed for the hardness of the heart, with the
   perfection of the teaching of Christ. They should avoid the form of
   arguments, or they will insensibly be used, or understood to mean more
   than they really do. They should be subjected to an overruling
   principle, which is the heart and conscience of the Christian teacher,
   who indeed stands behind them,' not to make them the vehicles of his
   own opinions, but as the expressions of justice, and truth, and love.

   And here the critical interpretation of Scripture comes in and
   exercises a corrective influence on its popular use. We have already
   admitted that criticism is not for the multitude; it is not that which
   the Scripture terms the Gospel preached to the poor. Yet, indirectly
   passing from the few to the many, it has borne a great part in the
   Reformation of religion. It has cleared the eye of the mind to
   understand the original meaning. It was a sort of criticism which
   supported the struggle of the sixteenth century against the Roman
   Catholic Church; it is criticism that is leading Protestants to doubt
   whether the doctrine that the Pope is Antichrist, which has descended
   from the same period, is really discoverable in Scripture. Even the
   isolated thinker, against whom the religious world is taking up arms,
   has an influence on his opponents. The force of observations, which are
   based on reason and fact, remains when the tide of religious or party
   feeling is gone down. Criticism has also a healing influence in
   clearing away what may be termed the Sectarianism of knowledge. Without
   criticism it would be impossible to reconcile History and Science with
   Revealed Religion; they must remain for ever in a hostile and defiant
   attitude. Instead of being like other records, subject to the
   conditions of knowledge which existed in an early stage of the world,
   Scripture would be regarded on the one side as the work of organic
   Inspiration, and as a lying imposition on the other.

   The real unity of Scripture, as of man, has also a relation to our
   present subject. Amid all the differences of modes of thought and
   speech which have existed in different ages, of which much is said in
   our own day, there is a common element in human nature which bursts
   through these differences and remains unchanged, because akin to the
   first instincts of our being. The simple feeling of truth and right is
   the same to the Greek or Hindoo as to ourselves. However great may be
   the diversities of human character, there is a point at which these
   diversities end, and unity begins to appear. Now this admits of an
   application to the books of Scripture, as well as to the world
   generally. Written at many different times, in more than one language,
   some of them in fragments, they, too, have a common element of which
   the preacher may avail himself. This element is twofold, partly divine
   and partly human; the revelation of the truth and righteousness of God,
   and the cry of the human heart towards Him. Every part of Scripture
   tends to raise us above ourselves--to give us a deeper sense of the
   feebleness of man, and of the wisdom and power of God. It has a sort of
   kindred, as Plato would say, with religious truth everywhere in the
   world. It agrees also with the imperfect stages of knowledge and faith
   in human nature, and answers to its inarticulate cries. The universal
   truth easily breaks through the accidents of time and place in which it
   is involved. Although we cannot apply Jewish institutions to the
   Christian world, or venture in reliance on some text to resist the tide
   of civilization on which we are borne, yet it remains, nevertheless, to
   us, as well as to the Jews and first Christians, that Righteousness
   exalteth a nation,' and that love is the fulfilling not of the Jewish
   law only, but of all law.'

   In some cases, we have only to enlarge the meaning of Scripture to
   apply it even to the novelties and peculiarities of our own times. The
   world changes, but the human heart remains the same: events and details
   are different, but the principle by which they are governed, or the
   rule by which we are to act, is not different. When, for example, our
   Saviour says, Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
   free,' it is not likely that these words would have conveyed to the
   minds of the Jews who heard Him any notion of the perplexities of doubt
   or inquiry. Yet we cannot suppose that our Saviour, were He to come
   again upon earth, would refuse thus to extend them. The Apostle St.
   Paul, when describing the Gospel, which is to the Greek foolishness,
   speaks also of a higher wisdom which is known to those who are perfect.
   Neither is it unfair for us to apply this passage to that reconcilement
   of faith and knowledge, which may be termed Christian philosophy, as
   the nearest equivalent to its language in our own day. Such words,
   again, as Why seek ye the living among the dead?' admit of a great
   variety of adaptations to the circumstances of our own time. Many of
   these adaptations have a real germ in the meaning of the words. The
   precept, Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the
   things that are God's,' may be taken generally as expressing the
   necessity of distinguishing the divine and human--the things that
   belong to faith and the things that belong to experience. It is worth
   remarking in the application made of these words by Lord Bacon, Da
   fidei quae fidei sunt;' that, although the terms are altered, yet the
   circumstance that the form of the sentence is borrowed from Scripture
   gives them point and weight.

   The portion of Scripture which more than any other is immediately and
   universally applicable to our own times is, doubtless, that which is
   contained in the words of Christ Himself. The reason is that they are
   words of the most universal import. They do not relate to the
   circumstances of the time, but to the common life of all mankind. You
   cannot extract from them a political creed; only, Render unto Cæsar the
   things that are Cæsar's,' and The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses'
   seat; whatsoever, therefore, they say unto you do, but after their
   works do not.' They present to us a standard of truth and duty, such as
   no one can at once and immediately practise--such as, in its
   perfection, no one has fulfilled in this world. But this idealism does
   not interfere with their influence as a religious lesson. Ideals, even
   though unrealized, have effect on our daily life. The preacher of the
   Gospel is, or ought to be, aware that his calls to repentance, his
   standard of obligations, his lamentations over his own shortcomings or
   those of others, do not at once convert hundreds or thousands, as on
   the day of Pentecost. Yet it does not follow that they are thrown away,
   or that it would be well to substitute for them mere prudential or
   economical lessons, lectures on health or sanitary improvement. For
   they tend to raise men above themselves, providing them with Sabbaths
   as well as working days, giving them a taste of the good word of God'
   and of the powers of the world to come.' Human nature needs to be
   idealized; it seems as if it took a dislike to itself when presented
   always in its ordinary attire; it lives on in the hope of becoming
   better. And the image or hope of a better life--the vision of Christ
   crucified--which is held up to it, doubtless has an influence; not like
   the rushing mighty wind of the day of Pentecost; it may rather be
   compared to the leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of
   meal, till the whole was leavened.'

   The Parables of our Lord are a portion of the New Testament, which we
   may apply in the most easy and literal manner. The persons in them are
   the persons among whom we live and move; there are times and occasions
   at which the truths symbolized by them come home to the hearts of all
   who have ever been impressed by religion. We have been prodigal sons
   returning to our Father; servants to whom talents have been entrusted;
   labourers in the vineyard inclined to murmur at our lot, when compared
   with that of others, yet receiving every man his due; well-satisfied
   Pharisees; repentant Publicans:--we have received the seed, and the
   cares of the world have choked it--we hope also at times that we have
   found the pearl of great price after sweeping the house--we are ready
   like the Good Samaritan to show kindness to all mankind. Of these
   circumstances of life or phases of mind, which are typified by the
   parables, most Christians have experience. We may go on to apply many
   of them further to the condition of nations and churches. Such a
   treasury has Christ provided us of things new and old, which refer to
   all time and all mankind--may we not say in His own words--because He
   is the Son of Man?'

   There is no language of Scripture which penetrates the individual soul,
   and embraces all the world in the arms of its love, in the same manner
   as that of Christ Himself. Yet the Epistles contain lessons which are
   not found in the Gospels, or, at least, not expressed with the same
   degree of clearness. For the Epistles are nearer to actual life--they
   relate to the circumstances of the first believers, to their struggles
   with the world without, to their temptations and divisions from
   within--their subject is not only the doctrine of the Christian
   religion, but the business of the early Church. And although their
   circumstances are not our circumstances--we are not afflicted or
   persecuted, or driven out of the world, but in possession of the
   blessings, and security, and property of an established religion--yet
   there is a Christian spirit which infuses itself into all
   circumstances, of which they are a pure and living source. It is
   impossible to gather from a few fragmentary and apparently not always
   consistent expressions, how the Communion was celebrated, or the Church
   ordered, what was the relative position of Presbyters and Deacons, or
   the nature of the gift of tongues, as a rule for the Church in after
   ages;--such inquiries have no certain answer, and, at the best, are
   only the subject of honest curiosity. But the words, Charity never
   faileth,' and Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and
   have not charity, I am nothing,'--these have a voice which reaches to
   the end of time. There are no questions of meats and drinks nowadays,
   yet the noble words of the Apostle remain: If meat make my brother to
   offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my
   brother to offend.' Moderation in controversy, toleration towards
   opponents or erring members, is a virtue which has been thought by many
   to belong to the development and not to the origin of Christianity, and
   which is rarely found in the commencement of a religion. But lessons of
   toleration may be gathered from the Apostle, which have not yet been
   learned either by theologians or by mankind in general. The
   persecutions and troubles which awaited the Apostle no longer await us;
   we cannot, therefore, without unreality, except, perhaps, in a very few
   cases, appropriate his words, I have fought the, good fight, I have
   finished my course, I have kept the faith.' But that other text still
   sounds gently in our ears: My strength is perfected in weakness,' and
   when I am weak, then am I strong.' We cannot apply to ourselves the
   language of authority in which the Apostle speaks of himself as an
   ambassador for Christ, without something like bad taste. But it is not
   altogether an imaginary hope that those of us who are ministers of
   Christ, may attain to a real imitation of his great diligence, of his
   sympathy with others, and consideration for them--of his willingness to
   spend and be spent in his Master's service.

   Such are a few instances of the manlier in which the analogy of faith
   enables us to apply the words of Christ and His Apostles, with a strict
   regard to their original meaning. But the Old Testament has also its
   peculiar lessons which are not conveyed with equal point or force in
   the New. The beginnings of human history are themselves a lesson,
   having a freshness as of the early dawn. There are forms of evil
   against which the Prophets and the prophetical spirit of the Law carry
   on a warfare, in terms almost too bold for the way of life of modern
   times. There, more plainly than in any other portion of Scripture, is
   expressed the antagonism of outward and inward, of ceremonial and
   moral, of mercy and sacrifice. There all the masks of hypocrisy are
   rudely torn asunder, in which an unthinking world allows itself to be
   disguised. There the relations of rich and poor in the sight of God,
   and their duties towards one another, are most clearly enunciated.
   There the religion of suffering first appears--adversity, the blessing'
   of the Old Testament, as well as of the New. There the sorrows and
   aspirations of the soul find their deepest expression, and also their
   consolation. The feeble person has an image of himself in the bruised
   reed;' the suffering servant of God passes into the beloved one, in
   whom my soul delighteth.' Even the latest and most desolate phases of
   the human mind are reflected in Job and Ecclesiastes; yet not without
   the solemn assertion that to fear God and keep his commandments' is the
   beginning and end of all things.

   It is true that there are examples in the Old Testament which were not
   written for our instruction, and that, in some instances, precepts or
   commands are attributed to God Himself, which must be regarded as
   relative to the state of knowledge which then existed of the Divine
   nature, or given for the hardness of men's hearts.' It cannot be denied
   that such passages of Scripture are liable to misunderstanding; the
   spirit of the Old Covenanters, although no longer appealing to the
   action of Samuel, hewing Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal,' is
   not altogether extinguished. And a community of recent origin in
   America found their doctrine of polygamy on the Old Testament. But the
   poor generally read the Bible unconsciously; they take the good, and
   catch the prevailing spirit, without stopping to reason whether this or
   that practice is sanctioned by the custom or example of Scripture. The
   child is only struck by the impiety of the children who mocked the
   prophet; he does not think of the severity of the punishment which is
   inflicted upon them. And the poor, in this respect, are much like
   children; their reflection on the morality or immorality of characters
   or events is suppressed by reverence for Scripture. The Christian
   teacher has a sort of tact by which he guides them to perceive only the
   spirit of the Gospel everywhere; they read in the Psalms of David's sin
   and repentance; of the never-failing goodness of God to Him, and his
   never-failing trust in Him, not of his imprecations against his
   enemies. Such difficulties are greater in theory and on paper, than in
   the management of a school or parish. They are found to affect the
   half-educated, rather than either the poor, or those who are educated
   in a higher sense. To be above such difficulties is the happiest
   condition of human life and knowledge, or to be below them; to see, or
   think we see, how they may be reconciled with Divine power and wisdom,
   or not to see how they are apparently at variance with them.

   § 5.

   Some application of the preceding subject may be further made to
   theology and life.

   Let us introduce this concluding inquiry with two remarks.

   First, it may be observed, that a change in some of the prevailing
   modes of interpretation is not so much a matter of expediency as of
   necessity. The original meaning of Scripture is beginning to be clearly
   understood. But the apprehension of the original meaning is
   inconsistent with the reception of a typical or conventional one. The
   time will come when educated men will be no more able to believe that
   the words, Out of Egypt have I called my son' (Matt. ii. 15; Hos. xi.
   1), were intended by the prophet to refer to the return of Joseph and
   Mary from Egypt, than they are now able to believe the Roman Catholic
   explanation of Gen. iii. 15, Ipsa conteret caput tuum.' They will no
   more think that the first chapters of Genesis relate the same tale
   which Geology and Ethnology unfold than they now think the meaning of
   Joshua x. 12, 13, to be in accordance with Galileo's discovery.

   From the circumstance that in former ages there has been a fourfold or
   a sevenfold interpretation of Scripture, we cannot argue to the
   possibility of upholding any other than the original one in our own.
   The mystical explanations of Origen or Philo were not seen to be
   mystical; the reasonings of Aquinas and Calvin were not supposed to go
   beyond the letter of the text. They have now become the subject of
   apology; it is justly said that we should not judge the greatness of
   the Fathers or Reformers by their suitableness to our own day. But this
   defence of them shows that their explanations of Scripture are no
   longer tenable; they belong to a way of thinking and speaking which was
   once diffused over the world, but has now passed away. And what we give
   up as a general principle we shall find it impossible to maintain
   partially, e. g., in the types of the Mosaic Law and the double
   meanings of prophecy, at least, in any sense in which it is not equally
   applicable to all deep and suggestive writings.

   The same observation may be applied to the historical criticism of
   Scripture. From the fact that Paley or Butler were regarded in their
   generation as supplying a triumphant answer to the enemies of
   Scripture, we cannot argue that their answer will be satisfactory to
   those who inquire into such subjects in our own. Criticism has far more
   power than it formerly had; it has spread itself over ancient, and even
   modern, history; it extends to the thoughts and ideas of men as well as
   to words and facts; it has also a great place in education. Whether the
   habit of mind which has been formed in classical studies will not go on
   to Scripture; whether Scripture can be made an exception to other
   ancient writings, now that the nature of both is more understood;
   whether in the fuller light of history and science the views of the
   last century will hold out--these are questions respecting which the
   course of religious opinion in the past does not afford the means of
   truly judging.

   Secondly, it has to be considered whether the intellectual forms under
   which Christianity has been described may not also be in a state of
   transition and resolution, in this respect contrasting with the
   never-changing truth of the Christian life (1 Cor. xiii. 8). Looking
   backwards at past ages, we experience a kind of amazement at the
   minuteness of theological distinctions, and also at their permanence.
   They seem to have borne a part in the education of the Christian world,
   in an age when language itself had also a greater influence than
   nowadays. It is admitted that these distinctions are not observed in
   the New Testament, and are for the most part of a later growth. But
   little is gained by setting up theology against Scripture, or Scripture
   against theology; the Bible against the Church, or the Church against
   the Bible. At different periods either has been a bulwark against some
   form of error: either has tended to correct the abuse of the other. A
   true inspiration guarded the writers of the New Testament from Gnostic
   or Manichean tenets; at a later stage, a sound instinct prevented the
   Church from dividing the humanity and Divinity of Christ. It may be
   said that the spirit of Christ forbids us to determine beyond what is
   written; and the decision of the council of Nicaea has been described
   by an eminent English prelate [2] as the greatest misfortune that ever
   befel the Christian world.' That is, perhaps, true; yet a different
   decision would have been a greater misfortune. Nor does there seem any
   reason to suppose that the human mind could have been arrested in its
   theological course. It is a mistake to imagine that the dividing and
   splitting of words is owing to the depravity of the human heart; was it
   not rather an intellectual movement (the only phenomenon of progress
   then going on among men) which led, by a sort of necessity, some to go
   forward to the completion of the system, while it left others to stand
   aside? A veil was on the human understanding in the great controversies
   which absorbed the Church in earlier ages; the cloud which the
   combatants themselves raised intercepted the view. They did not
   see--they could not have imagined--that there was a world which lay
   beyond the range of the controversy.

   And now, as the Interpretation of Scripture is receiving another
   character, it seems that distinctions of theology, which were in great
   measure based on old interpretations, are beginning to fade away. A
   change is observable in the manner in which doctrines are stated and
   defended; it is no longer held sufficient to rest them on texts of
   Scripture, one, two, or more, which contain, or appear to contain,
   similar words or ideas. They are connected more closely with our moral
   nature; extreme consequences are shunned; large allowances are made for
   the ignorance of mankind. It is held that there is truth on both sides;
   about many questions there is a kind of union of opposites; others are
   admitted to have been verbal only; all are regarded in the light which
   is thrown upon them by church history and religious experience. A
   theory has lately been put forward, apparently as a defence of the
   Christian faith, which denies the objective character of any of them.
   And there are other signs that times are changing, and we are changing
   too. It would be scarcely possible at present to revive the interest
   which was felt less than twenty years ago [3] in the doctrine of
   Baptismal Regeneration; nor would the arguments by which it was
   supported or impugned have the meaning which they once had. The
   communion of the Lord's Supper is also ceasing, at least in the Church
   of England, to be a focus or centre of disunion--

   Our greatest love turned to our greatest hate.'

   A silence is observable on some other points of doctrine around which
   controversies swarmed a generation ago. Persons begin to ask what was
   the real difference which divided the two parties. They are no longer
   within the magic circle, but are taking up a position external to it.
   They have arrived at an age of reflection, and begin to speculate on
   the action and reaction, the irritation and counter-irritation, of
   religious forces; it is a common observation that revivals are not
   permanent;' the movement is criticized even by those who are subject to
   its influence. In the present state of the human mind, any
   consideration of these subjects, whether from the highest or lowest or
   most moderate point of view, is unfavourable to the stability of
   dogmatical systems, because it rouses inquiry into the meaning of
   words. To the sense of this is probably to be attributed the reserve on
   matters of doctrine and controversy which characterizes the present
   day, compared with the theological activity of twenty years ago [4] .

   These reflections bring us back to the question with which we
   began--What effect will the critical interpretation of Scripture have
   on theology and on life?' Their tendency is to show that the result is
   beyond our control, and that the world is not unprepared for it. More
   things than at first sight appear are moving towards the same end.
   Religion often bids us think of ourselves, especially in later life,
   as, each one in his appointed place, carrying on a work which is
   fashioned within by unseen hands. The theologian, too, may have peace
   in the thought, that he is subject to the conditions of his age rather
   than one of its moving powers. When he hears theological inquiry
   censured as tending to create doubt and confusion, he knows very well
   that the cause of this is not to be sought in the writings of so-called
   rationalists or critics who are disliked partly because they unveil the
   age to itself; but in the opposition of reason and feeling, of the past
   and the present, in the conflict between the Calvinistic tendencies of
   an elder generation, and the influences which even in the same family
   naturally affect the young.

   This distraction of the human mind between adverse influences and
   associations, is a fact which we should have to accept and make the
   best of, whatever consequences might seem to follow to individuals or
   Churches. It is not to be regarded as a merely heathen notion that
   truth is to be desired for its own sake even though no "good" result
   from it.' As a Christian paradox it may be said, What hast thou to do
   with "good?" follow thou Me.' But the Christian revelation does not
   require of us this Stoicism in most cases; it rather shows how good and
   truth are generally coincident. Even in this life, there are numberless
   links which unite moral good with intellectual truth. It is hardly too
   much to say that the one is but a narrower form of the other. Truth is
   to the world what holiness of life is to the individual--to man
   collectively the source of justice and peace and good.

   There are many ways in which the connexion between truth and good may
   be traced in the Interpretation of Scripture. Is it a mere chimera that
   the different sections of Christendom may meet on the common ground of
   the New Testament? Or that the individual may be urged by the vacancy
   and unprofitableness of old traditions to make the Gospel his own--a
   life of Christ in the soul, instead of a theory of Christ which is in a
   book or written down? Or that in missions to the heathen Scripture may
   become the expression of universal truths rather than of the tenets of
   particular men or churches? That would remove many obstacles to the
   reception of Christianity. Or that the study of Scripture may have a
   more important place in a liberal education than hitherto? Or that the
   rational service' of interpreting Scripture may dry up the crude and
   dreamy vapours of religious excitement? Or, that in preaching, new
   sources of spiritual health may flow from a more natural use of
   Scripture? Or that the lessons of Scripture may have a nearer way to
   the hearts of the poor when disengaged from theological formulas? Let
   us consider more at length some of these topics.

   I. No one casting his eye over the map of the Christian world can
   desire that the present lines of demarcation should always remain, any
   more than he will be inclined to regard the division of Christians to
   which he belongs himself, as in a pre-eminent or exclusive sense the
   Church of Christ. Those lines of demarcation seem to he political
   rather than religious; they are differences of nations, or governments,
   or ranks of society, more than of creeds or forms of faith. The feeling
   which gave rise to them has, in a great measure, passed away; no
   intelligent man seriously inclines to believe that salvation is to be
   found only in his own denomination. Examples of this sturdy orthodoxy,'
   in our own generation, rather provoke a smile than arouse serious
   disapproval. Yet many experiments show that these differences cannot be
   made up by any formal concordat or scheme of union; the parties cannot
   be brought to terms, and if they could, would cease to take an interest
   in the question at issue. The friction is too great when persons are
   invited to meet for a discussion of differences; such a process is like
   opening the doors and windows to put out a slumbering flame. But that
   is no reason for doubting that the divisions of the Christian world are
   beginning to pass away. The progress of politics, acquaintance with
   other countries, the growth of knowledge and of material greatness,
   changes of opinion in the Church of England, the present position of
   the Roman Communion--all these phenomena show that the ecclesiastical
   state of the world is not destined to be perpetual. Within the envious
   barriers which divide human nature into very little pieces' (Plato,
   Rep. iii. 395), a common sentiment is springing up of religious truth;
   the essentials of Christianity are contrasted with the details and
   definitions of it; good men of all religions find that they are more
   nearly agreed than heretofore. Neither is it impossible that this
   common feeling may so prevail over the accidental circumstances of
   Christian communities, that their political or ecclesiastical
   separation may be little felt. The walls which no adversary has scaled
   may fall down of themselves. We may perhaps figure to ourselves the
   battle against error and moral evil taking the place of one of sects
   and parties.

   In this movement, which we should see more clearly but for the
   divisions of the Christian world which partly conceal it, the critical
   interpretation of Scripture will have a great influence. The Bible will
   be no longer appealed to as the witness of the opinions of particular
   sects, or of our own age; it will cease to be the battle-field of
   controversies. But as its true meaning is more clearly seen, its moral
   power will also be greater. If the outward and inward witness, instead
   of parting into two, as they once did, seem rather to blend and
   coincide in the Christian consciousness, that is not a source of
   weakness, but of strength. The Book itself, which links together the
   beginning and end of the human race, will not have a less inestimable
   value because the spirit has taken the place of the letter. Its
   discrepancies of fact, when we become familiar with them, will seem of
   little consequence in comparison with the truths which it unfolds. That
   these truths, instead of floating down the stream of tradition, or
   being lost in ritual observances, have been preserved for ever in a
   book, is one, of the many blessings which the Jewish and Christian
   revelations have conferred on the world--a blessing not the less real,
   because it is not necessary to attribute it to miraculous causes.

   Again, the Scriptures are a bond of union to the whole Christian world.
   No one denies their authority, and could all be brought to an
   intelligence of their true meaning, all might come to agree in matters
   of religion. That may seem to be a hope deferred, yet not altogether
   chimerical. If it is not held to be a thing impossible that there
   should be agreement in the meaning of Plato or Sophocles, neither is it
   to be regarded as absurd that there should be a like agreement in the
   interpretation of Scripture. The disappearance of artificial notions
   and systems will pave the way to such an agreement. The recognition of
   the fact, that many aspects and stages of religion are found in
   Scripture; that different, or even opposite parties existed in the
   Apostolic Church; that the first teachers of Christianity had a
   separate and individual mode of regarding the Gospel of Christ; that
   any existing communion is necessarily much more unlike the brotherhood
   of love in the New Testament than we are willing to
   suppose--Protestants in some respects, as much so as Catholics--that
   rival sects in our own day--Calvinists and Arminians--those who
   maintain and those who deny the final restoration of man--may equally
   find texts which seem to favour their respective tenets (Mark ix.
   44-48; Romans xi. 32)--the recognition of these and similar facts will
   make us unwilling to impose any narrow rule of religious opinion on the
   ever-varying conditions of the human mind and Christian society.

   II. Christian missions suggest another sphere in which a more
   enlightened use of Scripture might offer a great advantage to the
   teacher. The more he is himself penetrated with the universal spirit of
   Scripture, the more he will be able to resist the literal and servile
   habits of mind of Oriental nations. You cannot transfer English ways of
   belief, and almost the history of the Church of England itself, as the
   attempt is sometimes made--not to an uncivilized people, ready like
   children to receive new impressions, but to an ancient and decaying
   one, furrowed with the lines of thought, incapable of the principle of
   growth. But you may take the purer light or element of religion, of
   which Christianity is the expression, and make it shine on some
   principle in human nature which is the fallen image of it. You cannot
   give a people who have no history of their own, a sense of the
   importance of Christianity, as an historical fact; but, perhaps, that
   very peculiarity of their character may make them more impressible by
   the truths or ideas of Christianity. Neither is it easy to make them
   understand the growth of Revelation in successive ages--that there are
   precepts of the Old Testament which are reversed in the New--or that
   Moses allowed many things for the hardness of men's hearts. They are in
   one state of the world, and the missionary who teaches them is in
   another, and the Book through which they are taught does not altogether
   coincide with either. Many difficulties thus arise which we are most
   likely to be successful in meeting when we look them in the face. To
   one inference they clearly point, which is this: that it is not the
   Book of Scripture which we should seek to give them, to be reverenced
   like the Vedas or the Koran, and consecrated in its words and letters,
   but the truth of the Book, the mind of Christ and His Apostles, in
   which all lesser details and differences should be lost and absorbed.
   We want to awaken in them the sense that God is their Father, and they
   His children;--that is of more importance than any theory about the
   inspiration of Scripture. But to teach in this spirit, the missionary
   should himself be able to separate the accidents from the essence of
   religion; he should be conscious that the power of the Gospel resides
   not in the particulars of theology, but in the Christian life.

   III. It may be doubted whether Scripture has ever been sufficiently
   regarded as an element of liberal education. Few deem it worth while to
   spend in the study of it the same honest thought or pains which are
   bestowed on a classical author. Nor, as at present studied, can it be
   said always to have an elevating effect. It is not a useful lesson for
   the young student to apply to Scripture principles which he would
   hesitate to apply to other books; to make formal reconcilements of
   discrepancies which he would not think of reconciling in ordinary
   history; to divide simple words into double meanings; to adopt the
   fancies or conjectures of Fathers and Commentators as real knowledge.
   This laxity of knowledge is apt to infect the judgement when
   transferred to other subjects. It is not easy to say how much of the
   unsettlement of mind which prevails among intellectual young men is
   attributable to these causes; the mixture of truth and falsehood in
   religious education, certainly tends to impair, at the age when it is
   most needed, the early influence of a religious home.

   Yet Scripture studied in a more liberal spirit might supply a part of
   education which classical literature fails to provide. The best book
   for the heart might also be made the best book for the intellect.' The
   noblest study of history and antiquity is contained in it; a poetry
   which is also the highest form of moral teaching; there, too, are lives
   of heroes and prophets, and especially of One whom we do not name with
   them, because He is above them. This history, or poetry, or biography,
   is distinguished from all classical or secular writings by the
   contemplation of man as he appears in the sight of God. That is a sense
   of things into which we must grow as well as reason ourselves, without
   which human nature is but a truncated, half-educated sort of being. But
   this sense or consciousness of a Divine presence in the world, which
   seems to be natural to the beginnings of the human race, but fades away
   and requires to be renewed in its after history, is not to be gathered
   from Greek or Roman literature, but from the Old and New Testament. And
   before we can make the Old and New Testament a real part of education,
   we must read them not by the help of custom or tradition, in the spirit
   of apology or controversy, but in accordance with the ordinary laws of
   human knowledge.

   IV. Another use of Scripture is that in sermons, which seems to be
   among the tritest, and yet is far from being exhausted. If we could
   only be natural and speak of things as they truly are, with a real
   interest and not merely a conventional one! The words of Scripture come
   readily to hand, and the repetition of them requires no effort of
   thought in the writer or speaker. But, neither does it produce any
   effect on the hearer, which will always be in proportion to the degree
   of feeling or consciousness in ourselves. It may be said that
   originality is the gift of few; no Church can expect to have, not a
   hundred, but ten such preachers as Robertson or Newman. But, without
   originality, it seems possible to make use of Scripture in sermons in a
   much more living way than at present. Let the preacher make it a sort
   of religion, and proof of his reverence for Scripture, that he never
   uses its words without a distinct meaning; let him avoid the form of
   argument from Scripture, and catch the feeling and spirit. Scripture is
   itself a kind of poetry, when not overlaid with rhetoric. The scene and
   country has a freshness which may always be renewed; there is the
   interest of antiquity and the interest of home or common life as well.
   The facts and characters of Scripture might receive a new reading by
   being described simply as they are. The truths of Scripture again would
   have greater reality if divested of the scholastic form in which
   theology has cast them. The universal and spiritual aspects of
   Scripture might be more brought forward to the exclusion of questions
   of the Jewish law, or controversies about the sacraments, or
   exaggerated statements of doctrines which seem to be at variance with
   morality. The life of Christ, regarded quite naturally as of one who
   was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin,' is also the
   life and centre of Christian teaching. There is no higher aim which the
   preacher can propose to himself than to awaken what may be termed the
   feeling of the presence of God and the mind of Christ in Scripture; not
   to collect evidences about dates and books, or to familiarize
   metaphysical distinctions; but to make the heart and conscience of his
   hearers bear him witness that the lessons which are contained in
   Scripture--lessons of justice and truth--lessons of mercy and peace--of
   the need of man and the goodness of God to him, are indeed not human
   but divine.

   V. It is time to make an end of this long disquisition--let the end be
   a few more words of application to the circumstances of a particular
   class in the present age. If any one who is about to become a clergyman
   feels, or thinks that he feels, that some of the preceding statements
   cast a shade of trouble or suspicion on his future walk of life, who,
   either from the influence of a stronger mind than his own, or from some
   natural tendency in himself, has been led to examine those great
   questions which lie on the threshold of the higher study of theology,
   and experiences a sort of shrinking or dizziness at the prospect which
   is opening upon him; let him lay to heart the following
   considerations:--First, that he may possibly not be the person who is
   called upon to pursue such inquiries. No man should busy himself with
   them who has not clearness of mind enough to see things as they are,
   and a faith strong enough to rest in that degree of knowledge which God
   has really given; or who is unable to separate the truth from his own
   religious wants and experiences. For the theologian as well as the
   philosopher has need of dry light,' unmingled with any tincture of the
   affections,' the more so as his conclusions are oftener liable to be
   disordered by them. He who is of another temperament may find another
   work to do, which is in some respects a higher one. Unlike philosophy,
   the Gospel has an ideal life to offer, not to a few only, but to all.
   There is one word of caution, however, to be given to those who
   renounce inquiry; it is, that they cannot retain the right to condemn
   inquirers. Their duty is to say with Nicodemus, Doth the Gospel condemn
   any man before it hear him?' although the answer may be only Art thou
   also of Galilee?' They have chosen the path of practical usefulness,
   and they should acknowledge that it is a narrow path. For any but a
   strong swimmer' will be insensibly drawn out of it by the tide of
   public opinion or the current of party.

   Secondly, let him consider that the difficulty is not so great as
   imagination sometimes paints it, It is a difficulty which arises
   chiefly out of differences of education in different classes of
   society. It is a difficulty which tact, and prudence, and, much more,
   the power of a Christian life may hope to surmount. Much depends on the
   manner in which things are said; on the evidence in the writer or
   preacher of a real good will to his opponents, and a desire for the
   moral improvement of men. There is an aspect of truth which may always
   be put forward so as to find a way to the hearts of men. If there is
   danger and shrinking from one point of view, from another there is
   freedom and sense of relief. The wider contemplation of the religious
   world may enable us to adjust our own place in it. The acknowledgement
   of churches as political and national institutions is the basis of a
   sound government of them. Criticism itself is not only negative; if it
   creates some difficulties, it does away others. It may put us at
   variance with a party or section of Christians in our own
   neighbourhood. But, on the other hand, it enables us to look at all men
   as they are in the sight of God, not as they appear to human eye,
   separated and often interdicted from each other by lines of religious
   demarcation; it divides us from the parts to unite us to the whole.
   That is a great help to religious communion. It does away with the
   supposed opposition of reason and faith. It throws us back on the
   conviction that religion is a personal thing, in which certainty is to
   be slowly won and not assumed as the result of evidence or testimony.
   It places us, in some respects (though it be deemed a paradox to say
   so), more nearly in the position of the first Christians to whom the
   New Testament was not yet given, in whom the Gospel was a living word,
   not yet embodied in forms or supported by ancient institutions.

   Thirdly, the suspicion or difficulty which attends critical inquiries
   is no reason for doubting their value. The Scripture nowhere leads us
   to suppose that the circumstance of all men speaking well of us is any
   ground for supposing that we are acceptable in the sight of God. And
   there is no reason why the condemnation of others should be witnessed
   to by our own conscience. Perhaps it may be true that, owing to the
   jealousy or fear of some, the reticence of others, the terrorism of a
   few, we may not always find it easy to regard these subjects with
   calmness and judgement. But, on the other hand, these accidental
   circumstances have nothing to do with the question at issue; they
   cannot have the slightest influence on the meaning of words, or on the
   truth of facts. No one can carry out the principle that public opinion
   or church authority is the guide to truth, when he goes beyond the
   limits of his own church or country. That is a consideration which may
   well make him pause before he accepts of such a guide in the journey to
   another world. All the arguments for repressing inquiries into
   Scripture in Protestant countries hold equally in Italy and Spain for
   repressing inquiries into matters of fact or doctrine, and so for
   denying the Scriptures to the common people.

   Lastly, let him be assured that there is some nobler idea of truth than
   is supplied by the opinion of mankind in general, or the voice of
   parties in a church. Every one, whether a student of theology or not,
   has need to make war against his prejudices no less than against his
   passions; and, in the religious teacher, the first is even more
   necessary than the last. For, while the vices of mankind are in a great
   degree isolated, and are, at any rate, reprobated by public opinion,
   their prejudices have a sort of communion or kindred with the world
   without. They are a collective evil, and have their being in the
   interest, classes, states of society, and other influences amid which
   we live. He who takes the prevailing opinions of Christians and decks
   them out in their gayest colours--who reflects the better mind of the
   world to itself--is likely to be its favourite teacher. In that
   ministry of the Gospel, even when assuming forms repulsive to persons
   of education, no doubt the good is far greater than the error or harm.
   But there is also a deeper work which is not dependent on the opinions
   of men, in which many elements combine, some alien to religion, or
   accidentally at variance with it. That work can hardly expect to win
   much popular favour, so far as it runs counter to the feelings of
   religious parties. But he who bears a part in it may feel a confidence,
   which no popular caresses or religious sympathy could inspire, that he
   has by a Divine help been enabled to plant his foot somewhere beyond
   the waves of time. He may depart hence before the natural term, worn
   out with intellectual toil; regarded with suspicion by many of his
   contemporaries; yet not without a sure hope that the love of truth,
   which men of saintly lives often seem to slight, is, nevertheless,
   accepted before God.

ON CONVERSION

    AND

CHANGES OF CHARACTER

  ROMANS VII.

   Titus have we the image of the lifelong struggle gathered up in a
   single instant. In describing it we pass beyond the consciousness of
   the individual into a world of abstractions; we loosen the thread by
   which the spiritual faculties are held together, and view as objects
   what can, strictly speaking, have no existence, except in relation to
   the subject. The divided members of the soul are ideal, the combat
   between them is ideal, so also is the victory. What is real that
   corresponds to this is not a momentary, but a continuous conflict,
   which we feel rather than know--which has its different aspects of hope
   and fear, triumph and despair, the action and reaction of the Spirit of
   God in the depths of the human soul, awakening the sense of sin and
   conveying the assurance of forgiveness.

   The language in which we describe this conflict is very different from
   that of the Apostle. Our circumstances are so changed that we are
   hardly able to view it in its simplest elements. Christianity is now
   the established religion of the civilized portion of mankind. In our
   own country it has become part of the law of the land; it speaks with
   authority, it is embodied in a Church, it is supported by almost
   universal opinion, and fortified by wealth and prescription. Those who
   know least of its spiritual life do not deny its greatness as a power
   in the world. Analogous to this relation in which it stands to our
   history and social state, is the relation in which it stands also to
   the minds of individuals. We are brought up in it, and unconsciously
   receive it as the habit of our thoughts and the condition of our life.
   It is without us, and we are within its circle; we do not become
   Christians, we are so from our birth. Even in those who suppose
   themselves to have passed through some sudden and violent change, and
   to have tasted once for all of the heavenly gift, the change is hardly
   ever in the form or substance of their belief, but in its quickening
   power; they feel not a new creed, but a new spirit within them. So that
   we might truly say of Christianity, that it is the daughter of time;'
   it hangs to the past, not only because the first century is the era of
   its birth, but because each successive century strengthens its form and
   adds to its external force, and entwines it with more numerous links in
   our social state. Not only may we say, that it is part and parcel of
   the law of the land, but part and parcel of the character of each one,
   which even the worst of men cannot wholly shake off.

   But if with ourselves the influence of Christianity is almost always
   gradual and imperceptible, with the first believers it was almost
   always sudden. There was no interval which separated the preaching of
   Peter on the day of Pentecost, from the baptism of the three thousand.
   The eunuch of Candace paused for a brief space on a journey, and was
   then baptized into the name of Christ, which a few hours previously he
   had not so much as heard. There was no period of probation like that
   which, a century or two later, was appropriated to the instruction of
   the Catechumens. It was an impulse, an inspiration passing from the
   lips of one to a chosen few, and communicated by them to the ear and
   soul of listening multitudes. As the wind bloweth where it listeth, and
   we hear the sound thereof; as the lightning shineth from the one end of
   the heaven to the other; so suddenly, fitfully, simultaneously, new
   thoughts come into their minds, not to one only, but to many, to whole
   cities almost at once. They were pricked with the sense of sin; they
   were melted with the love of Christ; their spiritual nature came again
   like the flesh of a little child.' And some, like St. Paul, became the
   very opposite of their former selves; from scoffers, believers; from
   persecutors, preachers; the thing that they were was so strange to
   them, that they could no longer look calmly on the earthly scene, which
   they hardly seemed to touch, which was already lighted up with the
   wrath and mercy of God. There were those among them who saw visions and
   dreamed dreams,' who were caught up,' like St. Paul, into the third
   heaven,' or, like the twelve, spake with other tongues as the Spirit
   gave them utterance.' And sometimes, as in the Thessalonian Church, the
   ecstasy of conversion led to strange and wild opinions, such as the
   daily expectation of Christ's coming. The round world' itself began to
   reel before them, as they thought of the things that were shortly to
   come to pass.

   But however sudden were the conversions of the earliest believers,
   however wonderful the circumstances which attended them, they were not
   for that reason the less lasting or sincere. Though many preached
   Christ of contention,' though Demes forsook the Apostle,' there were
   few who, having once taken up the cross, turned back from the love of
   this present world.' They might waver between Paul and Peter, between
   the circumcision and the uncircumcision; they might give ear to the
   strange and bewitching heresies of the East; but there is no trace that
   many returned to those that were no gods,' or put off Christ; the
   impression of the truth that they had received was everlasting on their
   minds. Even sins of fornication and uncleanness, which from the
   Apostle's frequent warnings against them we must suppose to have
   lingered, as a sort of remnant of heathenism in the early Church, did
   not wholly destroy their inward relation to God and Christ. Though
   their last state might be worse than the first,' they could never
   return again to live the life of all men after having tasted the
   heavenly gift and the powers of the world to come.'

   Such was the nature of conversion among the early Christians, the new
   birth of which by spiritual descent we are ourselves the offspring. Is
   there anything in history like it? anything in our own lives which may
   help us to understand it? That which the Scripture describes from
   within, we are for a while going to look at from a different point of
   view, not with reference to the power of God, but to those secondary
   causes through which He works--the laws which experience shows that He
   himself imposes on the operations of His Spirit. Such an inquiry is not
   a mere idle speculation; it is not far from the practical question, How
   we are to become better.' Imperfect as any attempt to analyze our
   spiritual life must ever be, the changes which we ourselves experience
   or observe in others, compared with those greater and more sudden
   changes which took place in the age of the Apostle, will throw light
   upon each other.

   In the sudden conversions of the early Christians we observe three
   things which either tend to discredit, or do not accompany, the working
   of a similar power among ourselves.--First, that conversion was marked
   by ecstatic and unusual phenomena; secondly, that, though sudden, it
   was permanent; thirdly, that it fell upon whole multitudes at once.

   When we consider what is implied in such expressions as not many wise,
   not many learned' were called to the knowledge of the truth, we can
   scarcely avoid feeling that there must have been much in the early
   Church which would have been distasteful to us as men of education;
   much that must have worn the appearance of excitement and enthusiasm.
   Is the mean conventicle, looking almost like a private house, a better
   image of that first assembly of Christians which met in the large upper
   room,' or the Catholic church arrayed in all the glories of Christian
   art? Neither of them is altogether like in spirit perhaps, but in
   externals the first. Is the dignified hierarchy that occupy the seats
   around the altar, more like the multitudes of first believers, or the
   lowly crowd that kneel upon the pavement? If we try to embody in the
   mind's eye the forms of the first teachers, and still more of their
   followers, we cannot help reading the true lesson, however great may be
   the illusions of poetry or of art. Not St. Paul standing on Mars' hill
   in the fullness of manly strength, as we have him in the cartoon of
   Raphael, is the true image; but such a one as he himself would glory
   in, whose bodily presence was weak and speech feeble, who had an
   infirmity in his flesh, and bore in his body the marks of the Lord
   Jesus.

   And when we look at this picture, full in the face,' however we might
   by nature be inclined to turn aside from it, or veil its details in
   general language, we cannot deny that many things that accompany the
   religion of the uneducated now, must then also have accompanied the
   Gospel- preached to the poor. There must have been, humanly speaking,
   spiritual delusions where men lived so exclusively in the spiritual
   world; there were scenes which we know took place such as St. Paul says
   would make the unbeliever think that they were mad. The best and
   holiest persons among the poor and ignorant are not entirely free from
   superstition, according to the notions of the educated; at best they
   are apt to speak of religion in a manner not quite suited to our taste;
   they sing with a loud and excited voice; they imagine themselves to
   receive Divine oracles, even about the humblest cares of life. Is not
   this, in externals at least, very like the appearance which the first
   disciples must have presented, who obeyed the Apostle's injunction, Is
   any sad? let him pray; is any merry? let him sing psalms'? Could our
   nerves have borne to witness the speaking with tongues, or the
   administration of Baptism, or the love feasts as they probably existed
   in the early Church?

   This difference between the feelings and habits of the first Christians
   and ourselves, must be borne in mind in relation to the subject of
   conversion. For as sudden changes are more likely to be met with
   amongst the poor and uneducated in the present day, it certainly throws
   light on the subject of the first conversions, that to the poor and
   uneducated the Gospel was first preached. And yet these sudden changes
   were as real, nay, more real than any gradual changes which take place
   among ourselves. The Stoic or Epicurean philosopher who had come into
   an assembly of believers speaking with tongues, would have remarked,
   that among the vulgar religious extravagances were usually short-lived.
   But it was not so. There was more there than he had eyes to see, or
   than was dreamed of in a philosophy like his. Not only was there the
   superficial appearance of poverty and meanness and enthusiasm, from a
   nearer view of which we are apt to shrink, but underneath this,
   brighter from its very obscurity, purer from the meanness of the
   raiment in which it was apparelled, was the life hidden with Christ and
   God. There, and there only, was the power which made a man humble
   instead of proud, self-denying instead of self-seeking, spiritual
   instead of carnal; which made him embrace, not only the brethren, but
   the whole human race in the arms of his love.

   But it is a further difference between the power of the Gospel now and
   in the first ages, that it no longer converts whole multitudes at once.
   Perhaps this very individuality in its mode of working may not be
   without an advantage in awakening us to its higher truths and more
   entire spiritual freedom. Whether this be so or not; whether there be
   any spiritual law by which reason, in a measure, takes the place of
   faith, and the common religious impulse weakens as the power of
   reflection grows, we certainly observe a diminution in the collective
   force which religion exercises on the hearts of men. In our own days
   the preacher sees the seed which he has sown gradually spring up; first
   one, then another begins to lead a better life; then a change comes
   over the state of society, often from causes over which he has no
   control; he makes some steps forwards and a few backwards, and trusts
   far more, if he is wise, to the silent influence of religious education
   than to the power of preaching; and, perhaps, the result of a long life
   of ministerial labour is far less than that of a single discourse from
   the lips of the Apostles or their followers. Even in missions to the
   heathen the vital energies of Christianity cease to operate to any
   great extent, at least on the effete civilization of India and China;
   the limits of the kingdoms of light and darkness are nearly the same as
   heretofore. At any rate it cannot be said that Christianity has wrought
   any sudden amelioration of mankind by the immediate preaching of the
   word, since the conversion of the barbarians. Even within the Christian
   world there is a parallel retardation. The ebb and flow of reformation
   and counter-reformation have hardly changed the permanent landmarks.
   The age of spiritual crises is past. The growth of Christianity in
   modern times may be compared to the change of the body, when it has
   already arrived at its full stature. In one half-century so vast a
   progress was made, in a few centuries more the world itself seemed to
   have gone after Him,' and now for near a thousand years the voice of
   experience is repeating to us, Hitherto shalt thou go, but no further.'

   Looking at this remarkable phenomenon of the conversion of whole
   multitudes at once, not from its Divine but from its human aspect (that
   is, with reference to that provision that God himself has made in human
   nature for the execution of His will), the first cause to which we are
   naturally led to attribute it is the power of sympathy. Why it is that
   men ever act together is a mystery of which our individual
   self-consciousness gives no account, any more than why we speak a
   common language, or form nations or societies, or merely in our
   physical nature are capable of taking diseases from one another. Nature
   and the Author of nature have made us thus dependent on each other both
   in body and soul. Whoever has seen human beings collected together in
   masses, and watched the movements that pass over them, like the trees
   of the forest moving in the wind,' will have no difficulty in
   imagining, if not in understanding, how the same voice might have found
   its way at the same instant to a thousand hearts, without our being
   able to say where the fire was first kindled, or by whom the
   inspiration was first caught. Such historical events as the
   Reformation, or the Crusades, or the French Revolution, are a
   sufficient evidence that a whole people, or almost, we may say, half a
   world, may be drunk into one spirit,' springing up, as it might seem,
   spontaneously in the breast of each, yet common to all. A parallel yet
   nearer is furnished by the history of the Jewish people, in whose
   sudden rebellion and restoration to God's favour, we recognize
   literally the momentary workings of, what is to ourselves a figure of
   speech, a national conscience.

   In ordinary cases we should truly say that there must have been some
   predisposing cause of a great political or religious revolution; some
   latent elements acting alike upon all, which, though long smouldering
   beneath, burst forth at last into a flame. Such a cause might be the
   misery of mankind, or the intense corruption of human society, which
   could not be quickened except it die, or the long-suppressed yearnings
   of the soul after something higher than it had hitherto known upon
   earth, or the reflected light of one religion or one movement of the
   human mind upon another. Such causes were actually at work, preparing
   the way for the diffusion of Christianity. The law itself was beginning
   to pass away in an altered world, the state of society was hollow, the
   chosen people were hopelessly under the Roman yoke. Good men refrained
   from the wild attempt of the Galilean Judas; yet the spirit which
   animated such attempts was slumbering in their bosoms. Looking back at
   their own past history, they could not but remember, even in an altered
   world, that there was One who ruled among the kingdoms of men, beside
   whom there was no God.' Were they to suppose that His arm was
   straitened to save? that He had forgotten His tender mercies to the
   house of David? that the aspirations of the prophets were vain? that
   the blood of the Maccabean heroes had sunk like water into the earth?
   This was a hard saying; who could bear it? It was long ere the nation,
   like the individual, put off the old man--that is, the temporal
   dispensation--and put on the new man--that is, the spiritual Israel.
   The very misery of the people seemed to forbid them to acquiesce in
   their present state. And with the miserable condition of the nation
   sprang up also the feeling, not only in individuals but in the race,
   that for their sins they were chastened, the feeling which their whole
   history seemed to deepen and increase. At last the scales fell from
   their eyes; the veil that was on the face of Moses was first
   transfigured before them, then removed; the thoughts of many hearts
   turned simultaneously to the Hope of Israel, Him whom the law and the
   prophets foretold.' As they listened to the preaching of the Apostles,
   they seemed to hear a truth both new and old; what many had thought,
   but none had uttered; which in its comfort and joyousness seemed to
   them new, and yet, from its familiarity and suitableness to their
   condition, not the less old.

   Spiritual life, no less than natural life, is often the very opposite
   of the elements which seem to give birth to it. The preparation for the
   way of the Lord, which John the Baptist preached, did not consist in a
   direct reference to the Saviour. The words He shall baptize you with
   the Holy Ghost and with fire,' and He shall burn up the chaff with fire
   unquenchable,' could have given the Jews no exact conception of Him who
   did not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax.' It was in
   another way that John prepared for Christ, by quickening the moral
   sense of the people, and sounding in their ears the voice Repent, for
   the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Beyond this useful lesson, there was
   a kind of vacancy in the preaching of John. He himself, as he was
   finishing his course,' testified that his work was incomplete, and that
   he was not the Christ. The Jewish people were prepared by his preaching
   for the coming of Christ, just as an individual might be prepared to
   receive Him by the conviction of sin and the conscious need of
   forgiveness.

   Except from the Gospel history and the writings of Josephus and Philo,
   we know but little of the tendencies of the Jewish mind in the time of
   our Lord. Yet we cannot doubt that the entrance of Christianity into
   the world was not sudden and abrupt; that is an illusion which arises
   in the mind from our slender acquaintance with contemporary opinions.
   Better and higher and holier as it was, it was not absolutely distinct
   from the teaching of the doctors of the law either in form or
   substance; it was not unconnected with, but gave life and truth to, the
   mystic fancies of Alexandrian philosophy. Even in the counsels of
   perfection of the Sermon on the Mount, there is probably nothing which
   might not be found, either in letter or spirit, in Philo or some other
   Jewish or Eastern writer. The peculiarity of the Gospel is, not that it
   teaches what is wholly new, but that it draws out of the treasure-house
   of the human heart things new and old, gathering together in one the
   dispersed fragments of the truth. The common people would not have
   heard Him gladly,' but for the truth of what He said. The heart was its
   own witness to it. The better nature of man, though but for a moment,
   responded to it, spoken as it was with authority, and not as the
   scribes; with simplicity, and not as the great teachers of the law; and
   sanctified by the life and actions of Him from whose lips it came, and
   Who spake as never man spake.'

   And yet, after reviewing the circumstances of the first preaching of
   the Gospel, there remains something which cannot be resolved into
   causes or antecedents; which eludes criticism, and can no more be
   explained in the world than the sudden changes of character in the
   individual. There are processes of life and organization about which we
   know nothing, and we seem to know that we shall never know anything.
   That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die;' but the
   mechanism of this new life is too complex and yet too simple for us to
   untwist its fibres. The figure which St. Paul applies to the
   resurrection of the body is true also of the renewal of the soul,
   especially in the first ages of which we know so little, and in which
   the Gospel seems to have acted with such far greater power than among
   ourselves.

   Leaving further inquiry into the conversion of the first Christians at
   the point at which it hides itself from us in mystery, we have now to
   turn to a question hardly less mysterious, though seemingly more
   familiar to us, which may be regarded as a question either of moral
   philosophy or of theology--the nature of conversion and changes of
   character among ourselves. What traces are there of a spiritual power
   still acting upon the human heart? What is the inward nature, and what
   are the outward conditions of changes in human conduct? Is our life a
   gradual and insensible progress from infancy to age, from birth to
   death, governed by fixed laws; or is it a miracle and mystery of
   thirty, or fifty, or seventy years' standing, consisting of so many
   isolated actions or portions knit together by no common principle?

   Were we to consider mankind only from without, there could be no doubt
   of the answer which we should give to the last of these questions. The
   order of the world would scarcely even seem to be infringed by the free
   will of man. In morals, no less than in physics, everything would
   appear to proceed by regular law. Individuals have certain capacities,
   which grow with their growth and strengthen with their strength; and no
   one by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature. As the poet
   says--The boy is father to the man.' The lives of the great majority
   have a sort of continuity: as we know them by the same look, walk,
   manner; so when we come to converse with them, we recognize the same
   character as formerly. They may be changed; but the change in general
   is such as we expect to find in them from youth to maturity, or from
   maturity to decay. There is something in them which is not changed, by
   which we perceive them to be the same. If they were weak, they remain
   so still; if they were sensitive, they remain so still; if they were
   selfish or passionate, such faults are seldom cured by increasing age
   or infirmities. And often the same nature puts on many veils and
   disguises; to the outward eye it may have, in some instances, almost
   disappeared; when we look beneath, it is still there.

   The appearance of this sameness in human nature has led many to suppose
   that no real change ever takes place. Does a man from a drunkard become
   sober? from a knight errant become a devotee? from a sensualist a
   believer in Christ? or a woman from a life of pleasure pass to a
   romantic and devoted religion? It has been maintained that they are the
   same still; and that deeper similarities remain than the differences
   which are a part of their new profession. Those who make the remark
   would say, that such persons exhibit the same vanity, the same
   irritability, the same ambition; that sensualism still lurks under the
   disguise of refinement, or earthly and human passion transfuses itself
   into devotion.

   This practical fatalism,' which says that human beings can be what they
   are and nothing else, has a certain degree of truth, or rather, of
   plausibility, from the circumstance that men seldom change wholly, and
   that the part of their nature which changes least is the weakness and
   infirmity that shows itself on the surface. Few, comparatively, ever
   change their outward manner, except from the mere result of altered
   circumstances; and hence, to a superficial observer, they appear to
   change less than is really the fact. Probably St. Paul never lost that
   trembling and feebleness, which was one of the trials of his life. Nor,
   in so far as the mind is dependent on the body, can we pretend to be
   wholly free agents. Who can say that his view of life and his power of
   action are unaffected by his bodily state? or who expects to find a
   firm and decided character in the nervous and sensitive frame? The
   commonest facts of daily life sufficiently prove the connexion of mind
   and body; the more we attend to it the closer it appears. Nor, indeed,
   can it be denied that external circumstances fix for most men the path
   of life. They are the inhabitants of a particular country; they have a
   certain position in the world; they rise to their occupations as the
   morning comes round; they seldom get beyond the circle of ideas in
   which they have been brought up. Fearfully and wonderfully as they are
   made, though each one in his bodily frame, and even more in his
   thoughts and feelings, is a miracle of complexity, they seem, as they
   meet in society, to reunite into a machine, and society itself is the
   great automaton of which they are the parts. It is harder and more
   conventional than the individuals which compose it; it exercises a kind
   of regulating force on the wayward fancies of their wills; it says to
   them in an unmistakable manner that they shall not break their ranks.'
   The laws of trade, the customs of social life, the instincts of human
   nature, act upon us with a power little less than that of physical
   necessity.

   If from this external aspect of human things we turn inward, there
   seems to be no limit to the changes which we deem possible. We are no
   longer the same, but different every hour. No physical fact interposes
   itself as an obstacle to our thoughts any more than to our dreams. The
   world and its laws have nothing to do with our free determinations. At
   any moment we can begin a new life; in idea at least, no time is
   required for the change. One instant we may be proud, the next humble;
   one instant sinning, at the next repenting; one instant, like St. Paul,
   ready to persecute, at another to preach the Gospel; full of malice and
   hatred one hour, melting into tenderness the next. As we hear the words
   of the preacher, there is a voice within telling us, that now, even
   now, is the day of salvation;' and if certain clogs and hindrances of
   earth could only be removed, we are ready to pass immediately into
   another state. And, at times, it seems as though we had actually passed
   into rest, and had a foretaste of the heavenly gift. Something more
   than imagination enables us to fashion a divine pattern to which we
   conform for a little while. The new man' unto which we become
   transformed, is so pleasant to us that it banishes the thought of the
   old.' In youth especially, when we are ignorant of the compass of our
   own nature, such frames of mind are perpetually recurring; perhaps, not
   without attendant evils; certainly, also, for good.

   But besides such feelings as these, which we know to be partly true,
   partly illusive, every one's experience of himself appears to teach
   him, that he has gone through many changes and had many special
   providences vouchsafed to him; he says to himself that he has been led
   in a mysterious and peculiar way, not like the way of other men, and
   had feelings not common to others; he compares different times and
   places, and contrasts his own conduct here and there, now and then. In
   other men he remarks similarity of character; in himself he sees
   chiefly diversity. They seem to be the creatures of habit and
   circumstance; he alone is a free agent. The truth is, that he observes
   himself; he cannot equally observe them. He is not conscious of the
   inward struggles through which they have passed; he sees only the veil
   of flesh which conceals them from his view. He knows when he thinks
   about it, but he does not habitually remember, that, under that calm
   exterior, there is a like current of individual thoughts, feelings,
   interests, which have as great a charm and intensity for another as the
   workings of his own mind have for himself.

   And yet it does not follow, that this inward fact is to be set aside as
   the result of egotism and illusion. It may be not merely the dreamy
   reflection of our life and actions in the mirror of self, but the
   subtle and delicate spring of the whole machine. To purify the feelings
   or to move the will, the internal sense may be as necessary to us as
   external observation is to regulate and sustain them. Even to the
   formula of the fatalist, that freedom is the consciousness of
   necessity,' it may be replied, that that very consciousness, as he
   terms it, is as essential as any other link in the chain in which he
   binds fast the world.' Human nature is beset by the contradiction, not
   of two rival theories, but of many apparently contradictory facts. If
   we cannot imagine how the world could go on without law and order in
   human actions, neither can we imagine how morality could subsist unless
   we clear a space around us for the freedom of the will.

   But not in this place to get further into the meshes of the great
   question of freedom and necessity, let us rather turn aside for a
   moment to consider some practical aspects of the reflections which
   precede. Scripture and reason alike require that we should entirely
   turn to God, that we should obey the whole law. And hard as this may
   seem at first, there is a witness within us which pleads that it is
   possible. Our mind and moral nature are one; we cannot break ourselves
   into pieces in action any more than in thought. The whole man is in
   every part and in every act. This is not a mere mode of thought, but a
   truth of great practical importance. Easier to change many things than
   one,' is the common saying. Easier, we may add, in religion or
   morality, to change the whole than the part. Easier because more
   natural, more agreeable to the voice of conscience and the promises of
   Scripture. God himself deals with us as a whole; He does not forgive us
   in part any more than He requires us to serve Him in part. It may be
   true that, of the thousand hearers of the appeal of the preacher, not
   above one begins a new life. And some persons will imagine that it
   might be better to make an impression on them little by little, like
   the effect of the dropping of water upon stone. Not in this way is the
   Gospel written down on the fleshy tables of the heart. More true to our
   own experience of self, as well as to the words of Scripture, are such
   ideas as renovation, renewal, regeneration, taking up the cross and
   following Christ, dying with Christ that we may also live with Him.

   Many a person will tease himself by counting minutes and providing
   small rules for his life, who would have found the task an easier and a
   nobler one, had he viewed it in its whole extent, and gone to God in a
   large and liberal spirit,' to offer up his life to Him. To have no
   arrière pensée in the service of God and virtue is the great source of
   peace and happiness. Make clean that which is within, and you have no
   need to purify that which is without. Take care of the little things of
   life, and the great ones will take care of themselves, is the maxim of
   the trader, which is sometimes, and with a certain degree of truth,
   applied to the service of God. But much more true is it in religion
   that we should take care of the great things, and the trifles of life
   will take care of themselves. If thine eye be single, thy whole body
   will be full of light.' Christianity is not acquired as an art by long
   practice; it does not carve and polish human nature with a graving
   tool; it makes the whole man; first pouring out his soul before God,
   and then casting him in a mould.' Its workings are not to be measured
   by time, even though among educated persons, and in modern times,
   sudden and momentary conversions can rarely occur.

   For the doctrine of conversion the moralist substitutes the theory of
   habits. Good actions, he says, produce good habits; and the repetition
   of good actions makes them easier to perform, and fortifies us
   indefinitely against temptation.' There are bodily and mental
   habits--habits of reflection and habits of action. Practice gives skill
   or sleight of hand; constant attention, the faculty of abstraction; so
   the practice of virtue makes us virtuous, that of vice vicious. The
   more meat we eat, to use the illustration of Aristotle, in whom we find
   a cruder form of the same theory, the more we are able to eat meat; the
   more we wrestle, the more able we are to wrestle, and so forth. If a
   person has some duty to perform, say of common and trivial sort, to
   rise at a particular hour in the morning, to be at a particular place
   at such an hour, to conform to some rule about abstinence, we tell him
   that he will find the first occasion difficult, the second easy, and
   the difficulty is supposed to vanish by degrees until it wholly
   disappears. If a man has to march into a battle, or to perform a
   surgical operation, or to do anything else from which human nature
   shrinks, his nerves, we say, are gradually strengthened; his head, as
   was said of a famous soldier, clears up at the sound of the cannon;
   like the grave-digger in Hamlet, he has soon no feeling of his
   occupation.'

   From a consideration of such instances as these, the rule has been laid
   down, that, as the passive impression weakens, the active habit
   strengthens.' But is not this saying of a great man founded on a narrow
   and partial contemplation of human nature? For, in the first place, it
   leaves altogether out of sight the motives of human action; it is
   equally suited to the most rigid formalist and to a moral and spiritual
   being. Secondly, it takes no account of the limitation of the power of
   habits, which neither in mind nor body can be extended beyond a certain
   point; nor of the original capacity or peculiar character of
   individuals; nor of the different kinds of habits, nor of the degrees
   of strength and weakness in different minds; nor of the enormous
   difference between youth and age, childhood and manhood, in the
   capacity for acquiring habits. Old age does not move with accumulated
   force, either upwards or downwards; they are the lesser habits, not the
   great springs of life, that show themselves in it with increased power.
   Nor can the man who has neglected to form habits in youth, acquire them
   in mature life; like the body, the mind ceases to be capable of
   receiving a particular form. Lastly, such a description of human nature
   agrees with no man's account of himself; whatever moralists may say, he
   knows himself to be a spiritual being. The wind bloweth where it
   listeth,' and he cannot tell whence it cometh, or whither it goeth.'

   All that is true in the theory of habits seems to be implied in the
   notion of order or regularity. Even this is inadequate to give a
   conception of the structure of human beings. Order is the beginning,
   but freedom is the perfection of our moral nature. Men do not live at
   random, or act one instant without reference to their actions just
   before. And in youth especially, the very sameness of our occupations
   is a sort of stay and support to us, as in age it may be described as a
   kind of rest. But no one will say that the mere repetition of actions
   until they constitute a habit, gives any explanation of the higher and
   nobler forms of human virtue, or the finer moulds of character. Life
   cannot be explained as the working of a mere machine, still less can
   moral or spiritual life be reduced to merely mechanical laws.

   But if, while acknowledging that a great proportion of mankind are the
   creatures of habit, and that a great part of our actions are nothing
   more than the result of habit, we go on to ask ourselves about the
   changes of our life, and fix our minds on the critical points, we are
   led to view human nature, not only in a wider and more generous spirit,
   but also in a way more accordant with the language of Scripture. We no
   longer measure ourselves by days or by weeks; we are conscious that at
   particular times we have undergone great revolutions or emotions; and
   then, again, have intervened periods, lasting perhaps for years, in
   which we have pursued the even current of our way. Our progress towards
   good may have been in idea an imperceptible and regular advance; in
   fact, we know it to have been otherwise. We have taken plunges in life;
   there are many eras noted in our existence. The greatest changes are
   those of which we are the least able to give an account, and which we
   feel the most disposed to refer to a superior power. That they were
   simply mysterious, like some utterly unknown natural phenomena, is our
   first thought about them. But although unable to fathom their true
   nature, we are capable of analyzing many of the circumstances which
   accompany them, and of observing the impulses out of which they arise.

   Every man has the power of forming a resolution, or, without previous
   resolution, in any particular instance, acting as he will. As thoughts
   come into the mind one cannot tell how, so too motives spring up,
   without our being able to trace their origin. Why we suddenly see a
   thing in a new light, is often hard to explain; why we feel an action
   to be right or wrong which has previously seemed indifferent, is not
   less inexplicable. We fix the passing dream or sentiment in action, the
   thought is nothing, the deed may be everything. That day after day, to
   use a familiar instance, the drunkard will find abstinence easier, is
   probably untrue; but that from once abstaining he will gain a fresh
   experience, and receive a new strength and inward satisfaction, which
   may result in endless consequences, is what every one is aware of. It
   is not the sameness of what we do, but its novelty, which seems to have
   such a peculiar power over us; not the repetition of many blind
   actions, but the performance of a single conscious one, that is the
   birth to a new life. Indeed, the very sameness of actions is often
   accompanied with a sort of weariness, which makes men desirous of
   change.

   Nor is it less true, that by the commission, not of many, but a single
   act of vice or crime, an inroad is made into our whole moral
   constitution, which is not proportionably increased by its repetition.
   The first act of theft, falsehood, or other immorality, is an event in
   the life of the perpetrator which he never forgets. It may often happen
   that no account can be given of it; that there is nothing in the
   education, nor in the antecedents of the person, that would lead us, or
   even himself, to suspect it. In the weaker sort of natures, especially,
   suggestions of evil spring up we cannot tell how. Human beings are the
   creatures of habit; but they are the creatures of impulse too; and from
   the greater variableness of the outward circumstances of life, and
   especially of particular periods of life, and the greater freedom of
   individuals, it may, perhaps, be found that human actions, though less
   liable to wide-spread or sudden changes, have also become more
   capricious, and less reducible to simple causes, than formerly.

   Changes in character come more often in the form of feeling than of
   reason, from some new affection or attachment, or alienation of our
   former self, rather than from the slow growth of experience, or a
   deliberate sense of right and duty. The meeting with some particular
   person, the remembrance of some particular scene, the last words of a
   parent or friend, the reading of a sentence in a book, may call forth a
   world within us of the very existence of which we were previously
   unconscious. New interests arise such as we never before knew, and we
   can no longer lie grovelling in the mire, but must be up and doing; new
   affections seem to be drawn out, such as warm our inmost soul and make
   action and exertion a delight to us. Mere human love at first sight, as
   we say, has been known to change the whole character and produce an
   earthly effect, analogous to that heavenly love of Christ and the
   brethren, of which the New Testament speaks. Have we not seen the
   passionate become calm, the licentious pure, the weak strong, the
   scoffer devout? We may not venture to say with St. Paul, This is a
   great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.' But such
   instances serve, at least, to quicken our sense of the depth and
   subtlety of human nature.

   Of many of these changes no other reason can be given than that nature
   and the Author of nature have made men capable of them. There are
   others, again, which we seem to trace, not only to particular times,
   but to definite actions, from which they flow in the same manner that
   other effects follow from their causes. Among such causes none are more
   powerful than acts of self-sacrifice and devotion. A single deed of
   heroism makes a man a hero; it becomes a part of him, and, strengthened
   by the approbation and sympathy of his fellow-men, a sort of power
   which he gains over himself and them. Something like this is true of
   the lesser occasions of life no less than of the greatest; provided in
   either case the actions are not of such a kind that the performance of
   them is a violence to our nature. Many a one has stretched himself on
   the rack of asceticism, without on the whole raising his nature; often
   he has seemed to have gained in self-control only what he has lost in
   the kindlier affections, and by his very isolation to have wasted the
   opportunities which nature offered him of self-improvement. But no one
   with a heart open to human feelings, loving not man the less, but God
   more, sensitive to the happiness of this world, yet aiming at a
   higher--no man of such a nature ever made a great sacrifice, or
   performed a great act of self-denial, without impressing a change on
   his character, which lasted to his latest breath. No man ever took his
   besetting sin, it may be lust, or pride, or love of rank and position,
   and, as it were, cut it out by voluntarily placing himself where to
   gratify it was impossible, without sensibly receiving a new strength of
   character. In one day, almost in an hour, he may become an altered man;
   he may stand, as it were, on a different stage of moral and religious
   life; he may feel himself in new relations to an altered world.

   Nor, in considering the effects of action, must the influence of
   impressions be lost sight of. Good resolutions are apt to have a bad
   name; they have come to be almost synonymous with the absence of good
   actions. As they get older, men deem it a kind of weakness to be guilty
   of making them; so often do they end in raising pictures of virtue, or
   going over the theory of virtue in our minds.' Yet this contrast
   between passive impression and active habit is hardly justified by our
   experience of ourselves or others. Valueless as they are in themselves,
   good resolutions are suggestive of great good; they are seldom wholly
   without effect on our conduct; in the weakest of men they are still the
   embryo of action. They may meet with a concurrence of circumstances in
   which they take root and grow, coinciding with some change of place, or
   of pursuits, or of companions, or of natural constitution, in which
   they acquire a peculiar power. They are the opportunities of virtue, if
   not virtue itself. At the worst they make us think; they give us an
   experience of ourselves; they prevent our passing our lives in total
   unconsciousness. A man may go on all his life making and not keeping
   them; miserable as such a state appears, he is perhaps not the worse,
   but something the better for them. The voice of the preacher is not
   lost, even if he succeed but for a few instants in awakening them.

   A further cause of sudden changes in the moral constitution is the
   determination of the will by reason and knowledge. Suppose the case of
   a person living in a narrow circle of ideas, within the limits of his
   early education, perplexed by difficulties, yet never venturing beyond
   the wall of prejudices in which he has been brought up, or changing
   only into the false position of a rebellion against them. A new view of
   his relation to the world and to God is presented to him; such, for
   example, as in St. Paul's day was the grand acknowledgement that God
   was not the God of the Jews only;' such as in our own age would be the
   clear vision of the truth and justice of God, high above the clouds of
   earth and time, and of His goodwill to man. Convinced of the
   reasonableness of the Gospel, it becomes to him at once a self-imposed
   law. No longer does the human heart rebel; no longer has he to pose his
   understanding' with that odd resolution of Tertullian--certum quia
   impossibile.' He perceives that the perplexities of religion have been
   made, not by the appointment of God, but by the ingenuity of man.

   Lastly. Among those influences, by the help of which the will of man
   learns to disengage itself from the power of habit, must not be omitted
   the influence of circumstances. If men are creatures of habit, much
   more are they creatures of circumstances. These two, nature without us,
   and the second nature' that is within, are the counterbalancing forces
   of our being. Between them (so we may figure to ourselves the working
   of the mind) the human will inserts itself, making the force of one a
   lever against the other, and seeming to rule both. We fall under the
   power of habit, and feel ourselves weak and powerless to shake off the
   almost physical influence which it exerts upon us. The enfeebled frame
   cannot rid itself of the malady; the palsied springs of action cannot
   be strengthened for good, nor fortified against evil. Transplanted into
   another soil, and in a different air, we renew our strength. In youth
   especially, the character seems to respond kindly to the influence of
   the external world. Providence has placed us in a state in which we
   have many aids in the battle with self; the greatest of these is change
   of circumstances.

   We have wandered far from the subject of conversion in the early
   Church, into another sphere in which the words grace, faith, the
   spirit,' have disappeared, and notions of moral philosophy have taken
   their place. It is better, perhaps, that the attempt to analyze our
   spiritual nature should assume this abstract form. We feel that words
   cannot express the life hidden with Christ and God; we are afraid of
   declaring on the housetop, what may only be spoken in the closet. If
   the rites and ceremonies of the elder dispensation, which have so
   little in them of a spiritual character, became a figure of the true,
   much more may the moral world be regarded as a figure of the spiritual
   world of which religion speaks to us.

   There is a view of the changes of the characters of men which begins
   where this ends, which reads human nature by a different light, and
   speaks of it as the seat of a great struggle between the powers of good
   and evil. It would be untrue to identify this view with that which has
   preceded, and scarcely less untrue to attempt to interweave the two in
   a system of moral theology.' No addition of theological terms will
   transfigure Aristotle's Ethics into a Summa Theologiae.' When St. Paul
   says--O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
   this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord;' he is not
   speaking the language of moral philosophy, but of religious feeling. He
   expresses what few have truly felt concentrated in a single instant,
   what many have deluded themselves into s the belief of, what some have
   experienced accompanying them through life, what a great portion even
   of the better sort of mankind are wholly unconscious of. It seems as if
   Providence allowed us to regard the truths of religion and morality in
   many ways which are not wholly unconnected with each other, yet
   parallel rather than intersecting; providing for the varieties of human
   character, and not leaving those altogether without law, who are
   incapable in a world of sight of entering within the veil.

   As we return to that hidden life' of which the Scripture speaks, our
   analysis of human nature seems to become more imperfect, less reducible
   to rule or measure, less capable of being described in a language which
   all men understand. What the believer recognizes as the record of his
   experience is apt to seem mystical to the rest of the world. We do not
   seek to thread the mazes of the human soul, or to draw forth to the
   light its hidden communion with its Maker. but only to present in
   general outline the power of religion among other causes of human
   action.

   Directly, religious influences may be summed up under three heads:--The
   power of God; the love of Christ; the efficacy of prayer.

   (1) So far as the influence of the first of these is capable of
   analysis, it consists in the practical sense that we are dependent
   beings, and that' our souls are in the hands of God, who is acting
   through us, and ever present with us, in the trials of life and in the
   work of life. The believer is a minister who executes this work, hardly
   the partner in it; it is not his own, but God's. He does it with the
   greatest care, as unto the Lord and not to men, yet is indifferent as
   to the result, knowing that all things, even through his imperfect
   agency, are working together for good. The attitude of his soul towards
   God is such as to produce the strongest effects on his power of action.
   It leaves his faculties clear and unimpassioned; it places him above
   accidents; it gives him courage and freedom. Trusting in God only, like
   the Psalmist, he fears no enemy;' he has no want. There is a sort of
   absoluteness in his position in the world, which can neither be made
   better nor worse; as St. Paul says, All things are his, whether life or
   death, or things present, or things to come.'

   In merely human things, the aid and sympathy of others increase our
   power to act: it is also the fact that we can work more effectually and
   think more truly, where the issue is not staked on the result of our
   thought and work. The confidence of success would be more than half the
   secret of success, did it not also lead to the relaxation of our
   efforts. But in the life of the believer, the sympathy, if such a
   figure of speech may be allowed, is not human but Divine; the
   confidence is not a confidence in ourselves, but in the power of God,
   which at once takes us out of ourselves and increases our obligation to
   exertion. The instances just mentioned have an analogy, though but a
   faint one, with that which v e are considering. They are shadows of the
   support which we receive from the Infinite and Everlasting. As the
   philosopher said that his theory of fatalism was absolutely required to
   insure the repose necessary for moral action, it may be said, in a far
   higher sense, that the consciousness of a Divine Providence is
   necessary to enable a rational being to meet the present trials of
   life, and to look without fear on his future destiny.

   (2) But yet more strongly is it felt that the love of Christ has this
   constraining power over souls, that here, if anywhere, we are unlocking
   the twisted chain of sympathy, and reaching the inmost mystery of human
   nature. The sight, once for all, of Christ crucified, recalling the
   thought of what, more than 1800 years ago, He suffered for us, has
   ravished the heart and melted the affections, and made the world seem
   new, and covered the earth itself with a fair vision, that is, a
   heavenly one. The strength of this feeling arises from its being
   directed towards a person, a real being, an individual like ourselves,
   who has actually endured all this for our sakes, who was above us, and
   yet became one of us and felt as we did, and was like ourselves a true
   man. The love which He felt towards us, we seek to return to Him; the
   unity which He has with the Divine nature, He communicates to us; His
   Father is our Father, His God our God. And as human love draws men
   onwards to make sacrifices, and to undergo sufferings for the good of
   others, Divine love also leads us to cast away the interests of this
   world, and rest only in the noblest object of love, And this love is
   not only a feeling or sentiment, or attachment, such as we may
   entertain towards a parent, a child, or a wife, in which, pure and
   disinterested as it may be, some shadow of earthly passion unavoidably
   mingles; it is also the highest exercise of the reason, which it seems
   to endow with the force of the affections, making us think and feel at
   once. And although it begins in gentleness, and tenderness, and
   weakness, and is often supposed to be more natural to women than men,
   yet it grows up also to the fulness of the stature of the perfect man.'
   The truest note of the depth and sincerity of our feelings towards our
   fellow creatures is a manly--that is, a self-controlled--temper: still
   more is this true of the love of the soul towards Christ and God.

   Every one knows what it is to become like those whom we admire or
   esteem; the impress which a disciple may sometimes have received from
   his teacher, or the servant from his Lord. Such devotion to a
   particular person can rarely be thought to open our hearts to love
   others also; it often tends to weaken the force of individual
   character. But the love of Christ is the conducting medium to the love
   of all mankind; the image which He impresses upon us is the image not
   of any particular individual, but of the Son of Man. And this image, as
   we draw nearer to it, is transfigured into the image of the Son of God.
   As we become like Him, we see Him as He is; and see ourselves and all
   other things with true human sympathy. Lastly, we are sensible that
   more than all we feel towards Him, He feels towards us, and that it is
   He who is drawing us to Him, while we seem to be drawing to Him
   ourselves. This is a part of that mystery of which the Apostle speaks,
   of the length, and depth, and breadth of the love of Christ,' which
   passeth knowledge. Mere human love rests on instincts, the working of
   which we cannot explain, but which nevertheless touch the inmost
   springs of our being. So, too, we have spiritual instincts, acting
   towards higher objects, still more suddenly and wonderfully capturing
   our souls in an instant, and making us indifferent to all things else.
   Such instincts show themselves in the weak no less than in the strong;
   they seem to be not so much an original part of our nature as to fulfil
   our nature, and add to it, and draw it out, until they make us
   different beings to ourselves and others. It was the quaint fancy of a
   sentimentalist to ask whether any one who remembers the first sight of
   a beloved person, could doubt the existence of magic. We may ask
   another question, Can any one who has ever known the love of Christ,
   doubt the existence of a spiritual power?

   (3) The instrument whereby, above all others, we realize the power of
   God, and the love of Christ, which carries us into their presence, and
   places us within the circle of a Divine yet personal influence, is
   prayer. Prayer is the summing up of the Christian life in a definite
   act, which is at once inward and outward, the power of which on the
   character, like that of any other act, is proportioned to its
   intensity. The imagination of doing rightly adds little to our
   strength; even the wish to do so is not necessarily accompanied by a
   change of heart and conduct. But in prayer we imagine, and wish, and
   perform all in one. Our imperfect resolutions are offered up to God;
   our weakness becomes strength, our words deeds. No other action is so
   mysterious; there is none in which we seem, in the same manner, to
   renounce ourselves that we may be one with God.

   Of what nature that prayer is which is effectual to the obtaining of
   its requests is a question of the same kind as what constitutes a true
   faith. That prayer, we should reply, which is itself most of an act,
   which is most immediately followed by action, which is most truthful,
   manly, self-controlled, which seems to lead and direct, rather than to
   follow, our natural emotions. That prayer which is its own answer
   because it asks not for any temporal good, but for union with God. That
   prayer which begins with the confession, We know not what to pray for
   as we ought;' which can never by any possibility interfere with the
   laws of nature, because even in extremity of danger or suffering, it
   seeks only the fulfilment of His will. That prayer which acknowledges
   that our enemies, or those of a different faith, are equally with
   ourselves in the hands of God; in which we never unwittingly ask for
   our own good at the expense of others. That prayer in which faith is
   strong enough to submit to experience; in which the soul of man is
   nevertheless conscious not of any self-produced impression, but of a
   true communion with the Author and Maker of his being.

   In prayer, as in all religion, there is something that it is impossible
   to describe, and that seems to be untrue the moment it is expressed in
   words. In the relations of man with God, it is vain to attempt to
   separate what belongs to the finite and what to the infinite. We can
   feel, but we cannot analyze it. We can lay down practical rules for it,
   but can give no adequate account of it. It is a mystery which we do not
   need to fathom. In all religion there is an element of which we are
   conscious--which is no mystery, which ought to be and is on a level
   with reason and experience. There is something besides, which, in those
   who give way to every vague spiritual emotion, may often fall below
   reason (for to them it becomes a merely physical state); which may also
   raise us above ourselves, until reason and feeling meet in one, and the
   life on earth even of the poor and ignorant answers to the description
   of the Apostle, Having your conversation in heaven.'

   This partial indistinctness of the subject of religion, even
   independently of mysticism or superstition, may become to intellectual
   minds a ground for doubting the truth of that which will not be
   altogether reduced to the rules of human knowledge, which seems to
   elude our grasp, and retires into the recesses of the soul the moment
   we ask for the demonstration of its existence. Against this natural
   suspicion let us set two observations: first, that if the Gospel had
   spoken to the reason only, and not to the feelings--if the way to the
   blessed life' had to be won by clearness of ideas, then it is
   impossible that to the poor the Gospel should have been first
   preached.' It would have begun at the other end of society, and
   probably remained, like Greek philosophy, the abstraction of educated
   men. Secondly, let us remark that even now, judged by its effects, the
   power of religion is of all powers the greatest. Knowledge itself is a
   weak instrument to stir the soul compared with religion; morality has
   no way to the heart of man; but the Gospel reaches the feelings and the
   intellect at once. In nations as well as individuals, in barbarous
   times as well as civilized, in the great crises of history especially,
   even in the latest ages, when the minds of men seem to wax cold, and
   all things remain the same as at the beginning, it has shown itself to
   be a reality without which human nature would cease to be what it is.
   Almost every one has had the witness of it in himself. No one, says
   Plato, ever passed from youth to age in unbelief of the gods, in
   heathen times. Hardly any educated person in a Christian land has
   passed from youth to age without some aspiration after a better life,
   some thought of the country to which he is going.

   As a fact, it would be admitted by most, that, at some period of their
   lives, the thought of the world to come and of future judgement, the
   beauty and loveliness of the truths of the Gospel, the sense of the
   shortness of our days here, have wrought a more quickening and powerful
   effect than any moral truths or prudential maxims. Many a one would
   acknowledge that he has been carried whither he knew not; and had
   nobler thoughts, and felt higher aspirations, than the course of his
   ordinary life seemed to allow. These were the most important moments of
   his life for good or for evil; the critical points which have made him
   what be is, either as he used or neglected them. They came he knew not
   how, sometimes with some outward and apparent cause, at other times
   without--the result of affliction or sickness, or the wind blowing
   where it listeth.'

   And if such changes and such critical points should be found to occur
   in youth more often than in age, in the poor and ignorant rather than
   in the educated, in women more often than in men--if reason and
   reflection seem to weaken as they regulate the springs of human action,
   this very fact may lead us to consider that reason, and reflection, and
   education, and the experience of age, and the force of manly sense, are
   not the links which bind us to the communion of the body of Christ;
   that it is rather to those qualities which we have, or may have, in
   common with our fellow-men, that the Gospel is promised; and that it is
   with the weak, the poor, the babes in Christ--not with the
   strong-minded, the resolute, the consistent--that we shall sit down in
   the kingdom of heaven.

ESSAY

    ON

CONTRASTS OF PROPHECY

  ROMANS XI.

   EVERY reader of the Epistles must have remarked the opposite and
   apparently inconsistent uses, which the Apostle St. Paul makes of the
   Old Testament. This appearance of inconsistency arises out of the
   different and almost conflicting statements, which may be read in the
   Old Testament itself. The law and the prophets are their own witnesses,
   but they are witnesses also to a truth which is beyond them. Two
   spirits are found in them, and the Apostle sets aside the one, that he
   may establish the other. When he says that the man that doeth these
   things shall live in them,' x. 5, and again two verses afterwards, the
   word is very nigh unto thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart,' he is
   using the authority of the law, first, that out of its own mouth he may
   condemn the law; secondly, that he may confirm the Gospel by the
   authority of that which he condemns. Still more striking are the
   contrasts of prophecy in which he reads, not only the rejection of
   Israel, but its restoration; the over-ruling providence of God, as well
   as the free agency of man; not only as it is written, God gave unto
   them a spirit of heaviness,' but, who hath believed our. report;' nor
   only, all day long I have stretched forth my hand to a disobedient and
   gainsaying people,' but there shall come out of Sion a deliverer and he
   shall turn away iniquities from Jacob.' Experience and faith seem to
   contend together in the Apostle's own mind, and alike to find an echo
   in the two voices of prophecy.

   It were much to be wished that we could agree upon a chronological
   arrangement of the Old Testament, which would approach more nearly to
   the true order in which the books were written, than that in which they
   have been handed down to us. Such an arrangement would throw great
   light on the interpretation of prophecy. At present, we scarcely resist
   the illusion exercised upon our minds by four prophets the greater,
   followed by twelve prophets the less;' some of the latter being of a
   prior date to any of the former. Even the distinction of the law and
   the prophets as well as of the Psalms and the prophets leads indirectly
   to a similar error. For many elements of the prophetical spirit enter
   into the law, and legal precepts are repeated by the prophets. The
   continuity of Jewish history is further broken by the Apocrypha. The
   four centuries before Christ were as fruitful of hopes and struggles
   and changes of thought and feeling in the Jewish people as any
   preceding period of their existence as a nation, perhaps more so. And
   yet we piece together the Old and New Testament as if the interval were
   blank leaves only. Few, if any, English writers have ever attempted to
   form a conception of the growth of the spirit of prophecy, from its
   first beginnings in the law itself, as it may be traced in the lives
   and characters of Samuel and David, and above all, of Elijah and his
   immediate successor; as it reappears a few years later, in the written
   prophecies respecting the house of Israel, and the surrounding nations
   (not even in the oldest of the prophets, without reference to Messiah's
   kingdom); or again after the carrying away of the ten tribes, as it
   concentrates itself in Judah, uttering a sadder and more mournful cry
   in the hour of captivity, yet in the multitude of sorrows increasing
   the comfort; the very dispersion of the people widening the prospect of
   Christ's kingdom, as the nation is cut short in righteousness,' God
   being so much the nearer to those who draw near to Him.

   The fulfilment of prophecy has been sought for in a series of events
   which have been sometimes bent to make them fit, and one series of
   events has frequently taken the place of another. Even the passing
   circumstances of to-day or yesterday, at the distance of about two
   thousand years, and as many miles, which are but shadows flitting on
   the mountains compared with the deeper foundations of human history,
   are thought to be within the range of the prophet's eye. And it may be
   feared that, in attempting to establish a claim which, if it could be
   proved, might be made also for heathen oracles and prophecies,
   commentators have sometimes lost sight of those great characteristics
   which distinguish Hebrew prophecy from all other professing revelations
   of other religions: (1) the sense of the truthfulness, and holiness,
   and loving-kindness of the Divine Being, with which the prophet is as
   one possessed, which he can no more forget or doubt than he can cease
   to be himself; (2) their growth, that is, their growing perception of
   the moral nature of the revelation of God to man, apart from the
   commandments of the law or the privileges of the house of Israel.

   There are some prophecies more national, of which the fortunes of the
   Jewish people are the only subject; others more individual, seeming to
   enter more into the recesses of the human soul, and which are, at the
   same time, more universal, rising above earthly things, and passing
   into the distant heaven. At one time the prophet embodies these
   thoughts of many hearts' as present, at another as future; in some
   cases as following out of the irrevocable decree of God, in others as
   dependent on the sin or repentance of man. At one moment he is looking
   for the destruction of Israel, at another for its consolation; going
   from one of these aspects of the heavenly vision to another, like St.
   Paul himself in successive verses. And sometimes he sees the Lord's
   house exalted in the top of the mountains, and the image of the
   Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty Prince, the Everlasting God.' At
   other times, his vision is of the Servant whom it pleased the Lord to
   bruise,' whose form was marred more than that of the sons of men,' who
   was led as a lamb to the slaughter.'

   National, individual,--spiritual, temporal,--present,
   future,--rejection, restoration,--faith, the law, --Providence,
   freewill,--mercy, sacrifice,--Messiah suffering and triumphant,--are so
   many pairs of opposites with reference to which the structure of
   prophecy admits of being examined. It is true that such an examination
   is nothing more than a translation or decomposition of prophecy into
   the modes of thought of our own time, and is far from reproducing the
   living image which presented itself to the eyes of the prophet. But,
   like all criticism, it makes us think; it enables us to observe fresh
   points of connexion between the Old Testament and the New; it keeps us
   from losing our way in the region of allegory or of modern history.
   Many things are unlearnt as well as learnt by the aid of criticism; it
   clears the mind of conventional interpretations, teaching us to look
   amid the symbols of time and place for the higher and universal
   meaning.

   Prophecy has a human as well as a Divine element: that is to say, it
   partakes of the ordinary workings of the mind. There is also something
   beyond which the analogy of human knowledge fails to explain. Could the
   prophet himself have been asked what was the nature of that impulse by
   which he was carried away, he would have replied that the God of Israel
   was a living God' who had ordained him a prophet before he came forth
   from the womb.' Of the Divine element no other account can be given--it
   pleased God to raise up individuals in a particular age and country,
   who had a purer and loftier sense of truth than their fellow men.'
   Prophecy would be no longer prophecy if we could untwist its soul. But
   the human part admits of being analyzed like poetry or history, of
   which it is a kind of union; it is written with a man's pen in a known
   language; it is cast in the imaginative form of early language itself.
   The truth of God comes into contact with the world, clothing itself in
   human feelings, revealing the lesson of historical events. But human
   feelings and the lesson of events vary, and in this sense the prophetic
   lesson varies too. Even in the workings of our own minds we may
   perceive this; those who think much about themselves and God cannot but
   be conscious of great changes and transitions of feeling at different
   periods of life. We are the creatures of impressions and associations;
   and although Providence has not made our knowledge of himself dependent
   on these impressions, He has allowed it to be coloured by them. We
   cannot say that in the hours of prosperity and adversity, in health and
   sickness, in poverty and wealth, our sense of God's dealings with us is
   absolutely the same; still less, that all our prayers and aspirations
   have received the answer that we wished or expected. And sometimes the
   thoughts of our own hearts go before to God; at other times, the power
   of God seems to anticipate the thoughts of our hearts. And sometimes,
   in looking back at our past lives, it seems as if God had done
   everything; at other times, we are conscious of the movement of our own
   will. The wide world itself also, and the political fortunes of our
   country, have been enveloped in the light or darkness which rested on
   our individual soul.

   Especially are we liable to look at religious truth under many aspects,
   if we live amid changes of religious opinions, or are witnesses of some
   revival or reaction in religion, or supposing our lot to be cast in
   critical periods of history, such as extend the range and powers of
   human nature, or certainly enlarge our experience of it. Then the germs
   of new truths will subsist side by side with the remains of old ones;
   and thoughts, that are really inconsistent, will have a place together
   in our minds, without our being able to perceive their inconsistency.
   The inconsistency will be traced by posterity; they will remark that up
   to a particular point we saw clearly; but that no man is beyond his
   age--there was a circle which we could not pass. And some one living in
   our own day may look into the future with eagle eye;' he may weigh and
   balance with a sort of omniscience the moral forces of the world,
   perhaps with something too much of confidence that the right will
   ultimately prevail even on earth; and after ages may observe that his
   predictions were not always fulfilled or not fulfilled at the time he
   said.

   Such general reflections may serve as an introduction to what at first
   appears an anomaly in prophecy--that it has not one, but many lessons;
   and that the manner in which it teaches those lessons is through the
   alternations of the human soul itself. There are failings of prophecy,
   just as there are failings in our own anticipations of the future. And
   sometimes when we had hoped to be delivered it has seemed good to God
   to afflict us still. But it does not follow that religion is therefore
   a cunningly devised fable, either now or then. Neither the faith of the
   people, nor of the prophet, in the God of their fathers is shaken
   because the prophecies are not realized before their eyes; because the
   vision,' as they said, is delayed;' because in many cases events seem
   to occur which make it impossible that it should be accomplished. A
   true instinct still enables them to separate the prophets of Jehovah
   from the numberless false prophets with whom the land swarmed; they are
   gifted with the same discernment of spirits' which distinguished
   Micaiah from the four hundred whom Ahab called. The internal evidence
   of the true prophet we are able to recognize in the written prophecies
   also. In the earliest as well as the latest of them there is the same
   spirit one and continuous, the same witness of the invisible God, the
   same character of the Jewish people, the same law of justice and mercy
   in the dealings of Providence with respect to them, the same walking
   with God' in the daily life of the prophet himself.

   Novum Testamentum in vetere latet,' has come to be a favourite word
   among theologians, who have thought they saw in the truths of the
   Gospel the original design as well as the evangelical application of
   the Mosaical law. With a deeper meaning, it may be said that prophecy
   grows out of itself into the Gospel. Not, as some extreme critics have
   conceived, that the facts of the Gospel history are but the
   crystallization of the imagery of prophecy. Say, rather, that the river
   of the water of life is beginning again to flow. The Son of God himself
   is that prophet'--the prophet, not of one nation only, but of all
   mankind, in whom the particularity of the old prophets is finally done
   away, and the ever-changing form of the servant in whom my soul
   delighteth' at last finds rest. St. Paul, too, is a prophet who has
   laid aside the poetical and authoritative garb of old times, and is
   wrapped in the rhetorical or dialectical one of his own age. The
   language of the old prophets comes unbidden into his mind; it seems to
   be the natural expression of his own thoughts. Separated from Joel,
   Amos, Hosea, Micah, and Isaiah by an interval of about eight hundred
   years, he finds their words very near to him even in his mouth and his
   heart;' that is the word which he preached. When they spoke of
   forgiveness of sins, of non-imputation of sins, of a sudden turning to
   God, what did this mean but righteousness by faith? when they said I
   will have mercy, and not sacrifice,' here also was imaged the great
   truth, that salvation was not of the law. If St. Paul would have no man
   judged for a new moon or Sabbath,' the prophets of old time had again
   and again said in the name of Jehovah Your new moons and sabbaths I
   cannot away with.' Like the elder prophets, he came not to build up a
   temple made with hands,' but to teach a moral truth; like them he went
   forth alone, and not in connexion with the Church at Jerusalem. His
   calling is to be Apostle of the Gentiles; they also sometimes pass
   beyond the borders of Israel, to receive Egypt and Assyria into
   covenant with God.

   It is not, however, this deeper unity between St. Paul and the prophets
   of the old dispensation that we are about to consider further, but a
   more superficial parallelism, which is afforded by the alternation or
   successive representation of the purposes of God towards Israel, which
   we meet with in the Old Testament, and which recurs in the Epistle to
   the Romans. Like the elder prophets, St. Paul also prophesies in part,'
   feeling after events rather than seeing them, and divided between
   opposite aspects of the dealings of Providence with mankind. This
   changing feeling often finds an expression in the words of Isaiah or
   the Psalmist, or the author of the book of Deuteronomy. Hence a kind of
   contrast springs up in the writings of the Apostle, which admits of
   being traced to its source in the words of the prophets. Portions of
   his Epistles are the disjecta membra of prophecy. Oppositions are
   brought into view by him, and may be said to give occasion to a
   struggle in his own mind, which were unobserved by the prophets
   themselves. For so far from prophecy setting forth one unchanging
   purpose of God, it seems rather to represent a succession of purposes
   conditional on men's actions; speaking as distinctly of the rejection
   as of the restoration of Israel; and of the restoration almost as the
   correlative of the rejection; often, too, making a transition from the
   temporal to the spiritual. Some of these contrasts it is proposed to
   consider in detail as having an important bearing on St. Paul's
   Epistles, especially on the Epistles to the Thessalonians, and on
   chapters x.-xii. of the Epistle to the Romans.

   (1) All the prophets are looking for and hastening to the day of the
   Lord,' the great day,' which there is none like,' the day of the Lord's
   sacrifice,' the day of visitation,' of the great slaughter,' in which
   the Lord shall judge in the valley of Jehoshaphat,' in which they shall
   go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks,
   for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth
   to shake terribly the earth.' That day is the fulfilment and
   realization of prophecy, without which it would cease to have any
   meaning, just as religion itself would cease to have any meaning to
   ourselves, were there no future life, or retribution of good and evil.
   All the prophets are in spirit present at it; living alone with God,
   and hardly mingling with men on earth, they are fulfilled with its
   terrors and its glories. For the earth is not to go on for ever as it
   is, the wickednesses of the house of Israel are not to last for ever.
   First, the prophet sees the pouring out of the vials of wrath upon
   them; then, more at a distance, follows the vision of mercy, in which
   they are to be comforted, and their enemies, the ministers of God's
   vengeance on them, in turn punished. And evil and oppression
   everywhere, so far as it comes within the range of the prophet's eye,
   is to be punished in that day, and good is to prevail.

   In these terrors of the day of the Lord,' of which the prophets speak,
   the fortunes of the Jewish people mingle with another vision of a more
   universal judgement, and it has been usual to have recourse to the
   double senses of prophecy to separate the one from the other, an
   instrument of interpretation which has also been applied to the New
   Testament for the same purpose. Not in this way could the prophet or
   apostle themselves have conceived them. To them they were not two, but
   one; not double one against the other,' or separable into the figure
   and the thing signified. For the figure is in early ages the mode of
   conception also. More true would it be to say that the judgements of
   God on the Jewish people were an anticipation or illustration of His
   dealings with the world generally. If a separation is made at all, let
   us rather separate the accidents of time and place from that burning
   sense of the righteousness of God, which somewhere we cannot tell
   where, at some time we cannot tell when, must and will have retribution
   on evil; which has this other note of its Divine character, that in
   judgement it remembers mercy, pronouncing no endless penalty or
   irreversible doom, even upon the house of Israel. This twofold lesson
   of goodness and severity speaks to us as well as to the Jews. Better
   still to receive the words of prophecy as we have them, and to allow
   the feeling which it utters to find its way to our hearts, without
   stopping to mark out what was not separated in the prophet's own mind
   and cannot therefore be divided by us.

   Other contrasts are traceable in the teaching of the prophets
   respecting the day of the Lord. In that day the Lord is to judge
   Israel, and He is to punish Egypt and Assyria; and yet it is said also,
   the Lord shall heal Egypt, and Israel shall be the third with Egypt and
   Assyria whom the Lord shall bless (Is. xix. 25). In many of the
   prophecies also the judgement is of two kinds; it is a judgement on
   Israel, which is executed by the heathen; it is a judgement against the
   heathen, and in favour of Israel, in which God himself is sometimes
   said to be their advocate as well as their judge in that day.' A
   singular parallel with the New Testament is presented by another
   contrast which occurs in a single passage. That the day of the Lord is
   near,' it cometh, it cometh,' is the language of all the prophets; and
   yet there were those who said also in Ezekiel's time, The days are
   prolonged, and every vision faileth. Tell them therefore, Thus saith
   the Lord God; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more
   use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand,
   and the effect of every vision' (xii. 22). (Compare 2 Pet. iii. 4,
   Where is the promise of his coming?') On the other hand, in the later
   chapters of Isaiah (xl. seq.) we seem to trace the same feeling as in
   the New Testament itself: the anticipation of prophecy has ceased; the
   hour of its fulfilment has arrived; men seem to be conscious that they
   are living during the restoration of Israel as the disciples at the day
   of Pentecost felt that they were living amid the things spoken of by
   the prophet Joel.

   (2) A closer connexion with the Epistle to the Romans is furnished by
   the double and, on the surface, inconsistent language of prophecy
   respecting the rejection and restoration of Israel. These seem to
   follow one another often in successive verses. It is true that the
   appearance of inconsistency is greater than the reality, owing to the
   lyrical and concentrated style of prophecy (some of its greatest works
   being not much longer than this cobweb [5] ' of an essay); and this
   leads to opposite feelings and trains of thought being presented to us
   together, without the preparations and joinings which would be required
   in the construction of a modern poem. Yet, after making allowance for
   this peculiarity of the ancient Hebrew style, it seems as if there were
   two thoughts ever together in the prophet's mind: captivity,
   restoration,--judgement, mercy,--sin, repentance,--the people sitting
   in darkness, and the great light.'

   There are portions of prophecy in which the darkness is deep and
   enduring, darkness that may be felt,' in which the prophet is living
   amid the sins and sufferings of the people; and hope is a long way off
   from them--when they need to be awakened rather than comforted; and
   things must be worse, as men say, before they can become better. Such
   is the spirit of the greater part of the book of Jeremiah. But the tone
   of prophecy is on the whole that of alternation; God deals with the
   Israelites as with children; he cannot bear to punish them for long;
   his heart comes back to them when they are in captivity; their very
   helplessness gives them a claim on him. Vengeance may endure for a
   time, but soon the full tide of His mercy returns upon them. Another
   voice is heard, saying, Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people.' Speak ye
   comfortably to Jerusalem, and say unto her that she hath received of
   the Lord's hand double for all her sins.' So from the vision of God on
   Mount Sinai, at the giving of the Law amid storms and earthquakes,
   arises that tender human relation in which the Gospel teaches that He
   stands, not merely to His Church as a body, but to each one of us.

   Naturally this human feeling is called forth most in the hour of
   adversity. As the affliction deepens, the hope also enlarges, seeming
   often to pass beyond the boundaries of this life into a spiritual
   world. Though their sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow;
   when Jerusalem is desolate, there shall be a tabernacle on Mount Sion.
   The formula in which this enlargement of the purposes of God is
   introduced, is itself worthy of notice. It shall be no more said, The
   Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of
   Egypt; but, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel
   from the land of the North. and from all the lands whither he had
   driven them.' Their old servitude in Egypt came back to their minds now
   that they were captives in a strange land, and the remembrance that
   they had already been delivered from it was an earnest that they were
   yet to return. Deeply rooted in the national mind, it had almost become
   an attribute of God himself that He was their deliverer from the house
   of bondage.

   With this narrower view of the return of the children of Israel from
   captivity, not without a remembrance of that great empire which had
   once extended from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates, there blended
   also the hope of another kingdom in which dwelt righteousness--the
   kingdom of Solomon become the kingdom of Christ and God.' The children
   of Israel had been in their origin the fewest of all people,' and the
   most alien to the nations round about. The Lord their God was a jealous
   God, who would not suffer them to mingle with the idolatries of the
   heathen. And in that early age of the world, when national life was so
   strong and individuals so feeble, we cannot conceive how the worship of
   the true God could have been otherwise preserved. But the day had
   passed away when the nation could be trusted with the preservation of
   the faith of Jehovah; it had never been good for much at any time.' The
   prophets, too, seem to withdraw from the scenes of political events;
   they are no longer the judges and leaders of Israel; it is a part of
   their mission to commit to writing for the use of after ages the
   predictions which they utter. We pass into another country, to another
   kingdom in which the prospect is no more that which Moses saw from
   Mount Pisgah, but in which the Lord's horn is exalted in the top of the
   mountains and all nations flock to it.'

   In this kingdom the Gentiles have a place, still on the outskirts, but
   not wholly excluded from the circle of God's providence. Sometimes they
   are placed on a level with Israel, the circumcised with the
   uncircumcised,' as if only to teach the Apostle's lesson, that there is
   no respect of persons with God' (Jer. ix. 25, 26; compare Rom. ii.
   12-28). At other times they are themselves the subjects of promises and
   threatenings (Jer. xii. 14-17). It is to them that God will turn when
   His patience is exhausted with the rebellions of Israel; for whom it
   shall be more tolerable' than for Israel and Judah in the day of the
   Lord. They are those upon whom, though at a distance, the brightness of
   Jehovah must overflow; who, in the extremities of the earth, are bathed
   with the light of His presence. Helpers of the joy of Israel, they pour
   with gifts and offerings through the open gates of the city of God.
   They have a part in Messiah's kingdom, not of right, but because
   without them it would be imperfect and incomplete. In one passage only,
   which is an exception to the general spirit of prophecy, Israel makes
   the third' with Egypt and Assyria, whom the Lord of Hosts shall bless'
   (Is. xix. 18-25).

   It was not possible that such should be the relation of the Gentiles to
   the people of God in the Epistles of St. Paul. Experience seemed to
   invert the natural order of Providence--the Jew first and afterwards
   the Gentile. Accordingly, what is subordinate in the prophets, becomes
   of principal importance in the application of the Apostle. The dark
   sayings about the Gentiles had more meaning than the utterers of them
   were aware of. Events connected them with the rejection of the Jews, of
   which the same prophets spoke. Not only had the Gentiles a place on the
   outskirts of the people of God, gathering up the fragments of promises
   under the table;' they themselves were the spiritual Israel. When the
   prophets spoke of the Mount Sion, and all nations flowing to it, they
   were not expecting literally the restoration of the kingdom to Israel.
   They spoke of they knew not what--of something that had as yet no
   existence upon the earth. What that was, the vision on the way to
   Damascus, no less than the history of the Church and the world,
   revealed to the Apostle of the Gentiles.

   (3) Another characteristic of Hebrew prophecy is the transition from
   the nation to the individual. That is to say, first the nation becomes
   an individual; it is spoken of, thought of, dealt with, as a person, it
   makes the third' with God and the prophet. Almost a sort of drama is
   enacted between them, the argument of which is the mercy and justice of
   God; and the Jewish nation itself has many parts assigned to it.
   Sometimes she is the adulterous sister,' the wife of whoredoms,' who
   has gone astray with Chaldean and Egyptian lovers. In other passages,
   still retaining the same personal relation to God, the daughter of my
   people' is soothed and comforted; then a new vision rises before the
   prophet's mind--not the same with that of the Jewish people, but not
   wholly distinct from it, in which the suffering prophet himself, or
   Cyrus the prophet king, have a part--the vision of the servant of God,'
   the Saviour with dyed garments' from Bosra--he shall grow up before him
   as a tender plant;" he is led as a lamb to the slaughter' (Is. liii. 2,
   7; compare Jer. xi. 19). Yet there is a kind of glory even on earth in
   this image of gentleness and suffering: A bruised reed shall he not
   break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, until he hath brought
   forth judgement unto victory.' We feel it to be strange, and yet it is
   true. So we have sometimes seen the image of the kingdom of God among
   ourselves, not in noble churches or scenes of ecclesiastical power or
   splendour, but in the face of some child or feeble person, who, after
   overcoming agony, is about to depart and be with Christ.

   Analogies from Greek philosophy may seem far-fetched in reference to
   Hebrew prophecy, yet there are particular points in which subjects the
   most dissimilar receive a new light from one another. In the writings
   of Plato and Aristotle, and the philosophers who were their successors,
   moral truths gradually separate from politics, and the man is
   acknowledged to be different from the mere citizen: and there arises a
   sort of ideal of the individual, who has a responsibility to himself
   only. The growth of Hebrew prophecy is so different; its figures and
   modes of conception are so utterly unlike; there seems such a wide gulf
   between morality which almost excludes God, and religion which exists
   only in God, that at first sight we are unwilling to allow any
   similarity to exist between them. Yet an important point in both of
   them is really the same. For the transition from the nation to the
   individual is also the more perfect revelation of God himself, the
   change from the temporal to the spiritual, from the outward glories of
   Messiah's reign to the kingdom of God which is within. Prophets as well
   as apostles teach the near intimate personal relation of man to God.
   The prophet and psalmist, who is at one moment inspired with the
   feelings of a whole people, returns again to God to express the
   lowliest sorrows of the individual Christian. The thought of the Israel
   of God is latent in prophecy itself, not requiring a great nation or
   company of believers; but where one is' there is God present with him.

   There is another way also in which the individual takes the place of
   the nation in the purposes of God; a remnant shall be saved.' In the
   earlier books of the Old Testament, the whole people is bound up
   together for good or for evil. In the law especially, there is no trace
   that particular tribes or individuals are to be singled out for the
   favour of God. Even their great men are not so much individuals as
   representatives of the whole people. They serve God as a nation; as a
   nation they go astray. If, in the earlier times of Jewish history, we
   suppose an individual good man living amid an adulterous and crooked
   generation,' we can scarcely imagine the relation in which he would
   stand to the blessings and cursings of the law. Would the righteous
   perish with the wicked? That be far from thee, O Lord.' Yet prosperity,
   the blessing of the Old Testament,' was bound up with the existence of
   the nation. Gradually the germ of the new dispensation begins to unfold
   itself; the bands which held the nation together are broken in pieces;
   a fragment only is preserved, a branch, in the Apostle's language, cut
   off from the patriarchal stem, to be the beginning of another Israel.

   The passage quoted by St. Paul in the eleventh chapter of the Romans is
   the first indication of this change in God's mode of dealing with His
   people. The prophet Elijah wanders forth into the wilderness to lay
   before the Lord the iniquities of the people: The children of Israel
   have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy
   prophets with the sword.' But what,' we may ask with the Apostle, saith
   the answer of God to him?' Not They are corrupt, they are altogether
   become abominable,' but Yet I have seven thousand men who have not
   bowed the knee to Baal.' The whole people were not to be regarded as
   one; there were a few who still preserved, amid the general corruption,
   the worship of the true God.

   The marked manner in which the answer of God is introduced, the
   contrast of the still small voice' with the thunder, the storm, and the
   earthquake, the natural symbols of the presence of God in the law--the
   contradiction of the words spoken to the natural bent of the prophet's
   mind, and the greatness of Elijah's own character--all tend to stamp
   this passage as marking one of the epochs of prophecy. The solitude of
   the prophet and his separation in the mount of God,' from the places in
   which men ought to worship,' are not without meaning. There had not
   always been this proverb in the house of Israel;' but from this time
   onwards it is repeated again and again. We trace the thought of a
   remnant to be saved in captivity, or to return from captivity, through
   a long succession of prophecies--Hosea, Amos, Micah, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
   Ezekiel; --it is the text of almost all the prophets, passing, as a
   familiar word, from the Old Testament to the New. The voice uttered to
   Elijah was the beginning of this new Revelation.

   (4) Coincident with the promise of a remnant is the precept, I will
   have mercy and not sacrifice,' which, in modern language, opposes the
   moral to the ceremonial law. It is another and the greatest step onward
   towards the spiritual dispensation. Moral and religious truths hang
   together; no one can admit one of them in the highest sense, without
   admitting a principle which involves the rest. He who acknowledged that
   God was a God of mercy and not of sacrifice, could not long have
   supposed that He dealt with nations only, or that He raised men up for
   no other end but to be vessels of His wrath or monuments of His
   vengeance. For a time there might be things too hard for him,' clouds
   resting on his earthly tabernacle, when he saw the ungodly in such
   prosperity;' yet had he knowledge enough, as he went into the sanctuary
   of God,' and confessed himself to be a stranger and pilgrim upon the
   earth.'

   It is in the later prophets that the darkness begins to be dispelled
   and the ways of God justified to man. Ezekiel is above all others the
   teacher of this new commandment.' The familiar words, when the wicked
   man turneth away from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful
   and right, he shall save his soul alive,' are the theme of a great part
   of this wonderful book. Other prophets have more of poetical beauty, a
   deeper sense of Divine things, a tenderer feeling of the mercies of God
   to His people; none teach so simply this great moral lesson, to us the
   first of all lessons. On the eve of the captivity, and in the midst of
   it, when the hour of mercy is past, and no image is too loathsome to
   describe the iniquities of Israel, still the prophet does not forget
   that the Lord will not destroy the righteous with the wicked: Though
   Noah, Daniel, and Job were in the land, as I live, saith the Lord, they
   shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall deliver but their
   own souls by their righteousness' (xiv. 20). Yet, behold, therein shall
   be left a remnant; and they shall know that I have not done without
   cause all that I have' done, saith the Lord' (ver. 22, 23).

   It is observable that, in the Book of Ezekiel as well as of Jeremiah,
   this new principle on which God deals with mankind, is recognized as a
   contradiction to the rule by which he had formerly dealt with them. At
   the commencement of chap. xviii, as if with the intention of revoking
   the words of the second commandment, visiting the sins of the fathers
   upon the children,' it is said:--

   The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying,

   What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel,
   saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth
   are set on edge?

   As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to
   use this proverb in Israel.

   Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul
   of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.'

   Similar language occurs also in Jer. xxxi. 29, in a connexion which
   makes it still more remarkable, as the new truth is described as a part
   of that fuller revelation which God will give of himself, when He makes
   a new covenant with the house of Israel. And yet the same prophet, as
   if not at all times conscious of his own lesson, says also in his
   prayer to God (Lam. v. 7), Our fathers have sinned and are not, and we
   have borne their iniquities.' The truth which he felt was not one and
   the same always, but rather two opposite truths, like the Law and the
   Gospel, which, for a while, seemed to struggle with one another in the
   teaching of the prophet and the heart of man.

   And yet this opposition was not necessarily conscious to the prophet
   himself. Isaiah, who saw the whole nation going before to judgement,
   did not refrain from preaching the lessons, If ye be willing and
   obedient,' and Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
   his thoughts.' Ezekiel, the first thought and spirit of whose
   prophecies might be described in modern language as the responsibility
   of man, like Micaiah in the Book of Kings, seemed to see the false
   prophets inspired by Jehovah himself to their own destruction. As in
   the prophet, so in the Apostle, there was no sense that the two lessons
   were in any degree inconsistent with each other. It is an age of
   criticism and philosophy, which, in making the attempt to conceive the
   relation of God to the world in a more abstract way, has invented for
   itself the perplexity, or, may we venture to say, by the very fact of
   acknowledging it, has also found its solution. The intensity with which
   the prophet felt the truths that he revealed, the force with which he
   uttered them, the desire with which he yearned after their fulfilment,
   have passed from the earth; but the truths them- selves remain an
   everlasting possession. We seem to look upon them more calmly, and
   adjust them more truly. They no longer break through the world of sight
   with unequal power; they can never again be confused with the accidents
   of time and place. The history of the Jewish people has ceased to be
   the only tabernacle in which they are enshrined; they have an
   independent existence, and a light and order of their own.

ESSAY

    ON

CASUISTRY

  ROMANS XIV.

   RELIGION and morality seem often to become entangled in circumstances.
   The truth which came, not to bring peace upon earth, but a sword,'
   could not but give rise to many new and conflicting obligations. The
   kingdom of God had to adjust itself with the kingdoms of this world;
   though the children were free,' they could not escape the fulfilment of
   duties to their Jewish or Roman governors; in the bosom of a family
   there were duties too; in society there were many points of contact
   with the heathen. A new element of complexity had been introduced in
   all the relations between man and man, giving rise to many new
   questions, which might be termed, in the phraseology of modern times,
   cases of conscience.'

   Of these the one which most frequently recurs in the Epistles of St.
   Paul, is the question respecting meats and drinks, which appears to
   have agitated both the Roman and Corinthian Churches, as well as those
   of Jerusalem and Antioch, and probably; in a greater or less degree,
   every other Christian community in the days of the Apostle. The scruple
   which gave birth to it was not confined to Christianity; it was Eastern
   rather than Christian, and originated in a feeling into which entered,
   not only Oriental notions of physical purity and impurity, but also
   those of caste and of race. With other Eastern influences it spread
   towards the West, in the flux of all religions, exercising a peculiar
   power on the susceptible temper of mankind.

   The same tendency exhibited itself in various forms. In one form it was
   the scruple of those who ate herbs, while others had faith' to eat
   anything. The Essenes and Therapeutae among the Jews, and the
   Pythagoreans in the heathen world, had a similar feeling respecting the
   use of animal food. It was a natural association which led to such an
   abstinence. In the East, ever ready to connect, or rather incapable of
   separating, ideas of moral and physical impurity--where the heat of the
   climate rendered animal food unnecessary, if not positively
   unhealthful; where corruption rapidly infected dead organized matter;
   where, lastly, ancient tradition and ceremonies told of the sacredness
   of animals and the mysteriousness of animal life--nature and religion
   alike seemed to teach the same lesson, it was safer to abstain. It was
   the manner of such a scruple to propagate itself. He who revolted at
   animal food could not quietly sit by and see his neighbour partake of
   it. The ceremonialism of the age was the tradition of thousands of
   years, and passed by a sort of contagion from one race to another, from
   Paganism or Judaism to Christianity. How to deal with this second
   nature' was a practical difficulty among the first Christians. The
   Gospel was not a gospel according to the Essenes, and the church could
   not exclude those who held the scruples, neither could it be narrowed
   to them; it would not pass judgement on them at all. Hence the force of
   the Apostle's words: Him that is weak in the faith receive, not to the
   decision of his doubts.'

   There was another point in reference to which the same spirit of
   ceremonialism propagated itself, viz. meats offered to idols. Even if
   meat in general were innocent and a creature of God, it could hardly be
   a matter of indifference to partake of that which had been sacrificed
   to devils;' least of all, to sit at meat in the idol's temple. True,
   the idol was nothing in the world'--a block of stone, to which the
   words good or evil were misapplied; a graven image' which the workman
   made, putting his hand to the hammer,' as the old prophets described in
   their irony. And such is the Apostle's own feeling (1 Cor. viii. 4; x.
   19). But he has also the other feeling which he himself regards as not
   less true (1 Cor. x. 20), and which was more natural to the mind of the
   first believers. When they saw the worshippers of the idol revelling in
   impurity, they could not but suppose that a spirit of some kind was
   there. Their warfare, as the Apostle had told them, was not against
   flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
   the rulers of the darkness of this world.' Evil angels were among them;
   where would they more naturally take up their abode than around the
   altars and in the temples of the heathen? And if they had been
   completely free from superstition, and could have regarded the heathen
   religions which they saw enthroned over the world simply with contempt,
   still the question would have arisen, What connexion were they to have
   with them and with their worshippers? a question not easy to be
   answered in the bustle of Rome and Corinth, where every circumstance of
   daily life, every amusement, every political and legal right, was in
   some way bound up with the heathen religions. Were they to go out of
   the world? if not, what was to be their relation to those without?

   A third instance of the same ceremonialism so natural to that age, and
   to ourselves so strange and unmeaning, is illustrated by the words of
   the Jerusalem Christians to the Apostle--Thou wentest in unto men
   uncircumcised, and didst eat with them;' a scruple so strong that,
   probably, St. Peter himself was never entirely free from it, and at any
   rate yielded to the fear of it in others when withstood by St. Paul at
   Antioch. This scruple may be said in one sense to be hardly capable of
   an explanation, and in another not to need one. For, probably, nothing
   can give our minds any conception of the nature of the feeling, the
   intense hold which it exercised, the concentration which it was of
   every national and religious prejudice, the constraint which was
   required to get rid of it as a sort of horror naturalis in the minds of
   Jews; while, on the other hand, feelings at the present day not very
   dissimilar exist, not only in Eastern countries, but among ourselves.
   There is nothing strange in human nature being liable to them, or in
   their long lingering and often returning, even when reason and charity
   alike condemn them. We ourselves are not insensible to differences of
   race and colour, and may therefore be able partially to comprehend
   (allowing for the difference of East and West) what was the feeling of
   Jews and Jewish Christians towards men uncircumcised.

   On the last point St. Paul maintains but one language:--In Christ Jesus
   there is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision.' No compromise could
   be allowed here, without destroying the Gospel that he preached. But
   the other question of meats and drinks, when separated from that of
   circumcision, admitted of various answers and points of view.
   Accordingly there is an appearance of inconsistency in the modes in
   which the Apostle resolves it. All these modes have a use and interest
   for ourselves; though our difficulties are not the same as those of the
   early Christians, the words speak to us, so long as prudence, and
   faith, and charity are the guides of Christian life. It is
   characteristic of the Apostle that his answers run into one another, as
   though each of them to different individuals, and all in their turn,
   might present the solution of the difficulty.

   We may begin with 1 Cor. x. 25, which may be termed the rule of
   Christian prudence: Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat,
   asking no question for conscience sake.' That is to say: Buy food as
   other men do; perhaps what you purchase has come from the idol's
   temple, perhaps not. Do not encourage your conscience in raising
   scruples, life will become impossible if you do. One question involves
   another and another and another without end. The manly and the
   Christian way is to cut them short; both as tending to weaken the
   character and as inconsistent with the very nature of spiritual
   religion.'

   So we may venture to amplify the Apostle's precept, which breathes the
   same spirit of moderation as his decisions respecting celibacy and
   marriage. Among ourselves the remark is often made that extremes are
   practically untrue.' This is another way of putting the same
   lesson:--If I may not sit in the idol's temple, it may be plausibly
   argued, neither may I eat meats offered to idols; and if I may not eat
   meats offered to idols, then it logically follows that. I ought not to
   go into the market where idols' meat is sold. The Apostle snaps the
   chain of this misapplied logic: there must be a limit somewhere; we
   must not push consistency where it is practically impossible. A
   trifling scruple is raised to the level of a religious duty, and
   another and another, until religion is made up of scruples, and the
   light of life fades, and the ways of life narrow themselves.

   It is not hard to translate the Apostle's precept into the language of
   our time. Instances occur in politics, in theology, in our ordinary
   occupations, in which beyond a certain point consistency is impossible.
   Take for example the following: A person feels that he would be wrong
   in carrying on his business, or going to public amusements, on a
   Sunday. He says: If it be wrong for me to work, it is wrong to make the
   servants in my house work; or if it be wrong to go to public
   amusements, it is wrong to enjoy the recreation of walking on a Sunday.
   So it may be argued that, because slavery is wrong, therefore it is not
   right to purchase the produce of slavery, or that of which the produce
   of slavery is a part, and so on without end, until we are forced out of
   the world from a remote fear of contagion with evil. Or I am engaged in
   a business which may be in some degree deleterious to the health or
   injurious to the morals of those employed in it, or I trade in some
   articles of commerce which are unwholesome or dangerous, or I let a
   house or a ship to another whose employment is of this description.
   Numberless questions of the same kind relating to the profession of a
   clergyman, an advocate, or a soldier, have been pursued into endless
   consequences. Is the mind of any person so nicely balanced that every
   one of six hundred disputed propositions' is the representative of his
   exact belief? or can every word in a set form of prayer at all times
   reflect the feeling of those who read or follow it? There is no society
   to which we can belong, no common act of business or worship in which
   two or three are joined together, in which such difficulties are not
   liable to arise. Three editors conduct a newspaper, can it express
   equally the conviction of all the three? Three lawyers sign an opinion
   in common, is it the judgement of all or of one or two of them?
   High-minded men have often got themselves into a false position by
   regarding these questions in too abstract a way. The words of the
   Apostle are a practical answer to them which may be paraphrased thus:
   Do as other men do in a Christian country,' Conscience will say, He who
   is guilty of the least, is guilty of all.' In the Apostle's language it
   then becomes the strength of sin,' encouraging us to despair of all,
   because in that mixed condition of life in which God has placed us we
   cannot fulfil all.

   In accordance with the spirit of the same principle of doing as other
   men do, the Apostle further implies that believers are to accept the
   hospitality of the heathen (1 Cor. x. 27). But here a modification
   comes in, which may be termed the law of Christian charity or
   courtesy:--Avoid giving offence, or, as we might say, Do not defy
   opinion.' Eat what is set before you; but if a person sitting at meat
   pointedly says to you, This was offered to idols,' do not eat. All
   things are lawful, but all things are not expedient,' and this is one
   of the not-expedient class. There appears to be a sort of inconsistency
   in this advice, as there must always be inconsistency in the rules of
   practical life which are relative to circumstances. It might be said:
   We cannot do one thing at one time, and another thing at another; now
   be guided by another man's conscience, now by our own.' It might be
   retorted, Is not this the dissimulation which you blame in St. Peter?'
   To which it may be answered in turn: But a man may do one thing at one
   time, another thing at another time, "becoming to the Jews a Jew," if
   he do it in such a manner as to avoid the risk of misconstruction.' And
   this again admits of a retort: Is it possible to avoid misconstruction?
   Is it not better to dare to be ourselves, to act like ourselves, to
   speak like ourselves, to think like ourselves?' We seem to have lighted
   unawares on two varieties of human disposition; the one harmonizing and
   adapting itself to the perplexities of life, the other rebelling
   against them, and seeking to disentangle itself from them. Which side
   of this argument shall we take; neither or both? The Apostle appears to
   take both sides; for in the abrupt transition that follows, he
   immediately adds, Why is my liberty to be judged of another man's
   conscience? what right has another man to attack me for what I do in
   the innocency of my heart?' It is good advice to say, Regard the
   opinions of others;' and equally good advice to say, Do not regard the
   opinions of others.' We must balance between the two; and over all,
   adjusting the scales, is the law of Christian love.

   Both in 1 Cor. viii. and Rom. xiv. the Apostle adds another principle,
   which may be termed the law of individual conscience, which we must
   listen to in ourselves and regard in others. He that doubteth is
   damned; whatsoever is not of faith is sin.' All things are lawful to
   him who feels them to be lawful, but the conscience may be polluted by
   the most indifferent things. When we eat, we should remember that the
   consequence of following our example may be serious to others. For not
   only may our brother be offended at us, but also by our example be
   drawn into sin; that is, to do what, though indifferent in itself, is
   sin to him. And so the weak brother, for whom Christ died, may perish
   through our fault; that is, he may lose his peace and harmony of soul
   and conscience void of offence, and all through our heedlessness in
   doing some unnecessary thing, which were far better left undone.

   Cases may be readily imagined, in which, like the preceding, the rule
   of conduct here laid down by the Apostle would involve dissimulation.
   So many thousand scruples and opinions as there are in the world, we
   should have to go out of the world' to fulfil it honestly. All reserve,
   it may be argued, tends to break up the confidence between man and man;
   and there are times in which concealment of our opinions, even
   respecting things indifferent, would be treacherous and mischievous;
   there are times, too, in which things cease to be indifferent, and it
   is our duty to speak out respecting the false importance which they
   have acquired. But, after all qualifications of this kind have been
   made, the secondary duty yet remains, of consideration for others,
   which should form an element in our conduct. If truth is the first
   principle of our speech and action, the good of others should, at any
   rate, be the second. If any man (not see thee who hast knowledge
   sitting in the idol's temple, but) hear thee discoursing rashly of the
   Scriptures and the doctrines of the Church, shall not the faith of thy
   younger brother become confused? and his conscience being weak shall
   cease to discern between good and evil. And so thy weak brother shall
   perish for whom Christ died.'

   The Apostle adds a fourth principle, which may be termed the law of
   Christian freedom, as the last solution of the difficulty: Therefore,
   whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God.' From the
   perplexities of casuistry, and the conflicting rights of a man's own
   conscience and that of another, he falls back on the simple rule,
   Whatever you do, sanctify the act.' It cannot be said that all
   contradictory obligations vanish the moment we try to act with
   simplicity and truth; we cannot change the current of life and its
   circumstances by a wish or an intention; we cannot dispel that which is
   without, though we may clear that which is within. But we have taken
   the first step, and are in the way to solve the riddle. The insane
   scruple, the fixed idea, the ever-increasing doubt begins to pass away;
   the spirit of the child returns to us; the mind is again free, and the
   road of life open. Whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of
   God;' that is, determine to seek only the will of God, and you may have
   a larger measure of Christian liberty allowed to you; things, perhaps
   wrong in others, may be right for you.

   Questions of meats and drinks, of eating with washers or unwashen
   hands, and the like, have passed from the stage of religious ordinances
   to that of proprieties and decencies of life. The purifications of the
   law of Moses are no longer binding upon Christians. Nature herself
   teaches all things necessary for health and comfort. But the spirit of
   casuistry in every age finds fresh materials to employ itself upon,
   laying hold of some question of a new moon or a Sabbath, some fragment
   of antiquity, some inconsistency of custom, some subtlety of thought,
   some nicety of morality, analyzing and dividing the actions of daily
   life; separating the letter from the spirit, and words from things;
   winding its toils around the infirmities of the weak, and linking
   itself to the sensibility of the intellect.

   Out of this labyrinth of the soul the believer finds his way, by
   keeping his eye fixed on that landmark which the Apostle himself has
   set up: In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature.'

   There is no one probably, of any religious experience, who has not at
   times felt the power of a scrupulous conscience. In speaking of a
   scrupulous conscience, the sense of remorse for greater offences is not
   intended to be included. These may press more or less heavily on the
   soul; and the remembrance of them may ingrain itself, with different
   degrees of depth, on different temperaments; but whether deep or
   shallow, the sorrow for them cannot be brought under the head of
   scruples of conscience. There are many things in which we offend all,'
   about which there can be no mistake, the impression of which on our
   minds it would be fatal to weaken or do away. Nor is it to be denied
   that there may be customs almost universal among us which are so
   plainly repugnant to morality, that we can never be justified in
   acquiescing in them; or that individuals of clear head and strong will
   have been led on by feelings which other men would deride as
   conscientious scruples into an heroic struggle against evil. But quite
   independently of real sorrows for sin, or real protests against evil,
   most religious persons in the course of their lives have felt unreal
   scruples or difficulties, or exaggerated real but slight ones; they
   have abridged their Christian freedom, and thereby their means of doing
   good; they have cherished imaginary obligations, and artificially
   hedged themselves in a particular course of action. Honour and truth
   have seemed to be at stake about trifles light as air, or conscience
   has become a burden too heavy for them to bear in some doubtful matter
   of conduct. Scruples of this kind are ever liable to increase; as one
   vanishes, another appears; the circumstances of the world and of the
   Church, and the complication of modern society, have a tendency to
   create them. The very form in which they come is of itself sufficient
   to put us on our guard against them; for we can give no account of them
   to ourselves; they are seldom affected by the opinion of others; they
   are more often put down by the exercise of authority than by reasoning
   or judgement. They gain hold on the weaker sort of men, or on those not
   naturally weak, in moments of weakness. They often run counter to our
   wish or interest, and for this very reason acquire a kind of tenacity.
   They seem innocent, mistakes, at worst, on the safe side,
   characteristic of the ingenuousness of youth, or indicative of a heart
   uncorrupted by the world. But this is not so. Creatures as we are of
   circumstances, we cannot safely afford to give up things indifferent,
   means of usefulness, instruments of happiness to ourselves, which may
   affect our lives and those of our children to the latest posterity.
   There are few greater dangers in religion than the indulgence of such
   scruples, the consequences of which can rarely be seen until too late,
   and which affect the moral character of a man at least as much as his
   temporal interests.

   Strange as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that scruples about
   lesser matters almost always involve some dereliction of duty in
   greater or more obvious ones. A tender conscience is a conscience
   unequal to the struggles of life. At first sight it seems as if, when
   lesser duties were cared for, the greater would take care of
   themselves. But this is not the lesson which experience teaches. In our
   moral as in our physical nature, we are finite beings, capable only of
   a certain degree of tension, ever liable to suffer disorder and
   derangement, to be over-exercised in one part and weakened in another.
   No one can fix his mind intently on a trifling scruple or become
   absorbed in an eccentric fancy, without finding the great principles of
   truth and justice insensibly depart from him. lie has been looking
   through a microscope at life, and cannot take in its general scope. The
   moral proportions of things are lost to him; the question of a new moon
   or a Sabbath has taken the place of diligence or of honesty. There is
   no limit to the illusions which he may practise on himself. There are
   those, all whose interests and prejudices at once take the form of
   duties and scruples, partly from dishonesty, but also from weakness,
   and because that is the form in which they can with the best grace
   maintain them against other men, and conceal their true nature from
   themselves.

   Scruples are dangerous in another way, as they tend to drive men into a
   corner in which the performance of our duty becomes so difficult as to
   be almost impossible. A virtuous and religious life does not consist
   merely in abstaining from evil, but in doing what is good. It has to
   find opportunities and occasions for itself, without which it
   languishes. A man has a scruple about the choice of a profession; as a
   Christian, he believes war to be unlawful; in familiar. language, he
   has doubts respecting orders, difficulties about the law. Even the
   ordinary ways of conducting trade appear deficient to his nicer sense
   of honesty; or perhaps he has already entered on one of these lines of
   life, and finds it necessary to quit it. At last, there comes the
   difficulty of how he is to live.' There cannot be a greater mistake
   than to suppose that a good resolution is sufficient in such a case to
   carry a man through a long life.

   But even if we suppose the case of one who is endowed with every
   earthly good and instrument of prosperity, who can afford, as is
   sometimes said, to trifle with the opportunities of life, still the
   mental consequences will be hardly less injurious to him. For he who
   feels scruples about the ordinary enjoyments and occupations of his
   fellows, does so far cut himself off from his common nature. He is an
   isolated being, incapable of acting with his fellow-men. There are
   plants which, though the sun shine upon them, and the dews water them,
   peak and pine from some internal disorder, and appear to have no
   sympathy with the influences around them. So is the mind corroded by
   scruples of conscience. It cannot expand to sun or shower; it belongs
   not to the world of light; it has no intelligence of or harmony with
   mankind around. It is insensible to the great truth, that though we may
   not do evil that good may come, yet that good and evil, truth and
   falsehood, are bound together on earth, and that we cannot separate
   ourselves from them.

   It is one of the peculiar dangers of scruples of conscience, that the
   consequence of giving way to them is never felt at the time that they
   press upon us. When the mind is worried by a thought secretly working
   in it, and its trial becomes greater than it can bear, it is eager to
   take the plunge in life that may put it out of its misery; to throw
   aside a profession it may be, or to enter a new religious communion. We
   shall not be wrong in promising ourselves a few weeks of peace and
   placid enjoyment. The years that are to follow we are incapable of
   realizing; whether the weary spirit will require some fresh pasture,
   will invent for itself some new doubt; whether its change is a return
   to nature or not, it is impossible for us to anticipate. Whether it has
   in itself that hidden strength which, under every change of
   circumstances, is capable of bearing up, is a question which we are the
   least able to determine for ourselves. In general we may observe, that
   the weakest minds, and those least capable of enduring such
   consequences, are the most likely to indulge the scruples. We know
   beforehand the passionate character, hidden often under the mask of
   reserve, the active yet half-reasoning intellect, which falls under the
   power of such illusions.

   In the Apostolic Church cases of conscience' arose out of religious
   traditions, and what may be termed the ceremonial cast of the age; in
   modern times the most frequent source of them may be said to be the
   desire of logical or practical consistency, such as is irreconcilable
   with the mixed state of human affairs and the feebleness of the human
   intellect. There is no lever like the argument from consistency, with
   which to bring men over to our opinions. A particular system or view,
   Calvinism perhaps, or Catholicism, has taken possession of the mind.
   Shall we stop short of pushing its premises to their conclusions? Shall
   we stand in the midway, where we are liable to be overridden by the
   combatants on either side in the struggle? Shall we place ourselves
   between our reason and our affections; between our practical duties and
   our intellectual convictions? Logic would have us go forward, and take
   our stand at the most advanced point--we are there already, it is
   urged, if we were true to ourselves--but feeling, and habit, and common
   sense bid us stay where we are, unable to give an account of ourselves,
   yet convinced that we are right. We may listen to the one voice, we may
   listen also to the other. The true way of guiding either is to
   acknowledge both; to use them for a time against each other, until
   experience of life and of ourselves has taught us to harmonize them in
   a single principle.

   So, again, in daily life cases often occur, in which we must do as
   other men do, and act upon a general understanding, even though unable
   to reconcile a particular practice to the letter of truthfulness or
   even to our individual conscience. It is hard in such cases to lay down
   a definite rule. But in general we should be suspicious of any
   conscientious scruples in which other good men do not share. We shall
   do right to make a large allowance for the perplexities and
   entanglements of human things; we shall observe that persons of strong
   mind and will brush away our scruples; we shall consider that not he
   who has most, but he who has fewest scruples approaches most nearly the
   true Christian. The man whom we emphatically call honest,' able,'
   upright,' who is a religious as well as a sensible man, seems to have
   no room for them; from which we are led to infer that such scruples are
   seldom in the nature of things themselves, but arise out of some
   peculiarity or eccentricity in those who indulge them. That they are
   often akin to madness, is an observation not without instruction even
   to those whom God has blest with the full use of reason.

   So far we arrive at a general conclusion like St. Paul's:--Whether ye
   eat or drink, do all to the glory of God;' and, Blessed is he who
   condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.' Have the Spirit of
   truth, and the truth shall make you free;' and the entanglements of
   words and the perplexities of action will disappear. But there is
   Another way in which such difficulties have been resolved, which meets
   them in detail; viz., the practice of confession and the rules of
   casuistry, which are the guides of the confessor. When the spirit is
   disordered within us, it may be urged that we ought to go out of
   ourselves, and confess our sins one to another. But he who leads, and
   he who is led, alike require some rules for the examination of
   conscience, to quicken or moderate the sense of sin, to assist
   experience, to show men to themselves as they really are, neither
   better nor worse. Hence the necessity for casuistry.

   It is remarkable, that what is in idea so excellent that it may be
   almost described in St. Paul's language as holy, just, and good,'
   should have become a byword among mankind for hypocrisy and dishonesty.
   In popular estimation, no one is supposed to resort to casuistry, but
   with the view of evading a duty. The moral instincts of the world have
   risen up and condemned it. It is fairly put down by the universal
   voice, and shut up in the darkness of the tomes of the casuists. A kind
   of rude justice has been done upon the system, as in most cases of
   popular indignation, probably with some degree of injustice to the
   individuals who were its authors. Yet, hated as casuistry has
   deservedly been, it is fair also to admit that it has an element of
   truth which was the source of its influence. This element of truth is
   the acknowledgement of the difficulties which arise in the relations of
   a professing Christian world to the Church and to Christianity. How,
   without lowering the Gospel, to place it on a level with daily life is
   a hard question. It will be proper for us to consider the system from
   both sides--in its origin and in its perversion. Why it existed, and
   why it has failed, furnish a lesson in the history of the human mind of
   great interest and importance.

   The unseen power by which the systems of the casuists were brought into
   being, was the necessity of the Roman Catholic Church. Like the
   allegorical interpretation of Scripture, they formed a link between the
   present and the past. At the time of the Reformation the doctrines of
   the ancient, no less than of the Reformed, faith awakened into life.
   But they required to be put in a new form, to reconcile them to the
   moral sense of mankind. Luther ended the work of self-examination by
   casting all his sins on Christ. But the casuists could not thus meet
   the awakening of men's consciences and the fearful looking for of
   judgement. They had to deal with an altered world, in which
   nevertheless the spectres of the past, purgatory, penance, mortal sin,
   were again rising up; hallowed as they were by authority and antiquity
   they could not be cast aside; the preacher of the Counter-reformation
   could only explain them away. If he had placed distinctly before men's
   eyes, that for some one act of immorality or dishonesty they were in a
   state of mortal sin, the heart true to itself would have recoiled from
   such a doctrine, and the connexion between the Church and the world
   would have been for ever severed. And yet the doctrine was a part of
   ecclesiastical tradition; it could not be held, it could not be given
   up. The Jesuits escaped the dilemma by holding and evading it.

   So far it would not be untrue to say that casuistry had originated in
   an effort to reconcile the Roman Catholic faith with nature and
   experience. The Roman system was, if strictly carried out, horrible and
   impossible; a doctrine not, as it has been sometimes described, of
   salvation made easy, but of universal condemnation. From these fearful
   conclusions of logic the subtilty of the human intellect was now to
   save it. The analogy of law, as worked out by jurists and canonists,
   supplied the means. What was repugnant to human justice could not be
   agreeable to Divine. The scholastic philosophy, which had begun to die
   out and fade away before the light of classical learning, was to revive
   in a new form, no longer hovering between heaven and earth, out of the
   reach of experience, yet below the region of spiritual truth, but, as
   it seemed, firmly based in the life and actions of mankind. It was the
   same sort of wisdom which defined the numbers and order of the
   celestial hierarchy, which was now to be adapted to the infinite
   modifications of which the actions of men are capable.

   It is obvious that there are endless points of view in which the
   simplest duties may be regarded. Common sense says--A man is to be
   judged by his acts,' there can be no mistake about a lie,' and so on.
   The casuists proceed by a different road. Fixing the mind, not on the
   simplicity, but on the intricacy of human action, they study every
   point of view, and introduce every conceivable distinction. A first
   most obvious distinction is that of the intention and the act: ought
   the one to be separated from the other? The law itself seems to teach
   that this may hardly be; rather the intention is held to be that which
   gives form and colour to the act. Then the act by itself is nothing,
   and the intention by itself almost innocent. As we play between the two
   different points of view, the act and the intention together evanesce.
   But, secondly, as we consider the intention, must we not also consider
   the circumstances of the agent? For plainly a being deprived of free
   will cannot be responsible for his actions. Place the murderer in
   thought under the conditions of a necessary agent, and his actions are
   innocent; or under an imperfect necessity, and he loses half his guilt.
   Or suppose a man ignorant, or partly ignorant, of what is the teaching
   of the Church, or the law of the land--here another abstract point of
   view arises, leading us out of the region of common sense to difficult
   and equitable considerations, which may be determined fairly, but which
   we have the greatest motive to decide in favour of ourselves. Or again;
   try to conceive an act without reference to its consequences, or in
   reference to some single consequence, without regarding it as a
   violation of morality or of nature, or in reference solely to the
   individual conscience. Or imagine the will half consenting to, half
   withdrawing from its act; or acting by another, or in obedience to
   another, or with some good object, or under the influence of some
   imperfect obligation, or of opposite obligations. Even conscience
   itself may be at last played off against the plainest truths.

   By the aid of such distinctions the simplest principles of morality
   multiply to infinity. An instrument has been introduced of such
   subtilty and elasticity that it can accommodate the canons of the
   Church to any consciences, to any state of the world. Sin need no
   longer be confined to the dreadful distinction of moral and venial sin;
   it has lost its infinite and mysterious character; it has become a
   thing of degrees, to be aggravated or mitigated in idea, according to
   the expediency of the case or the pliability of the confessor. It seems
   difficult to perpetrate a perfect sin. No man need die of despair; in
   some page of the writings of the casuists will be found a difference
   suited to his case. And this without in any degree interfering with a
   single doctrine of the Church, or withdrawing one of its anathemas
   against heresy.

   The system of casuistry, destined to work such great results, in
   reconciling the Church to the world and to human nature, like a torn
   web needing to be knit together, may be regarded as a science or
   profession. It is a classification of human actions, made in one sense
   without any reference to practice. For nothing was further from the
   mind of the casuist than to inquire whether a particular distinction
   would have a good or bad effect, was liable to perversion or not. His
   object was only to make such distinctions as the human mind was capable
   of perceiving and acknowledging. As to the physiologist objects in
   themselves loathsome and disgusting may be of the deepest interest, so
   to the casuist the foulest and most loathsome vices of mankind are not
   matters of abhorrence, but of science, to be arranged and classified,
   just like any other varieties of human action. It is true that the
   study of the teacher was not supposed to be also open to the penitent.
   But it inevitably followed that the spirit of the teacher communicated
   itself to the taught. He could impart no high or exalted idea of
   morality or religion, who was measuring it out by inches, not deepening
   men's idea of sin, but attenuating it; mincing into nonsense' the first
   principles of right and wrong.

   The science was further complicated by the doctrine of probability,'
   which consisted in making anything approved or approvable that was
   confirmed by authority; even, as was said by some, of a single casuist.
   That could not be very wrong which a wise and good man had once thought
   to be right--a better than ourselves perhaps, surveying the
   circumstances calmly and impartially. Who would wish that the rule of
   his daily life should go beyond that of a saint and doctor of the
   Church? Who would require such a rule to be observed by another? Who
   would refuse another such an escape out of the labyrinth of human
   difficulties and perplexities? As in all the Jesuit distinctions, there
   was a kind of reasonableness in the theory of this; it did but go on
   the principle of cutting short scruples by the rule of common sense.

   And yet, what a door was here opened for the dishonesty of mankind! The
   science itself had dissected moral action until nothing of life or
   meaning remained in it. It had thrown aside, at the same time, the
   natural restraint which the moral sense itself exercises in determining
   such questions. And now for the application of this system, so
   difficult and complicated in itself, so incapable of receiving any
   check from the opinions of mankind, the authority not of the Church,
   but of individuals, was to be added as a new lever to overthrow the
   last remains of natural religion and morality.

   The marvels of this science are not yet ended. For the same changes
   admit of being rung upon speech as well as upon action, until truth and
   falsehood become alike impossible. Language itself dissolves before the
   decomposing power; oaths, like actions, vanish into air when separated
   from the intention of the speaker; the shield of custom protects
   falsehood. It would be a curious though needless task to follow the
   subject into further details. He who has read one page of the casuists
   has read all. There is nothing that is not right in some particular
   point of view--nothing that is not true under some previous
   supposition.

   Such a system may be left to refute itself. Those who have strayed so
   far away from truth and virtue are self-condemned. Yet it is not
   without interest to trace by what false lights of philosophy or
   religion good men, revolting themselves at the commission of evil, were
   led step by step to the unnatural result. We should expect to find that
   such a result originated not in any settled determination to corrupt
   the morals of mankind, but in an intellectual error; and it is
   suggestive of strange thoughts respecting our moral nature, that an
   intellectual error should have had the power to produce such
   consequences. Such appears to have been the fact. The conception of
   moral action on which the system depends. is as erroneous and imperfect
   as that of the scholastic philosophy respecting the nature of ideas.
   The immediate reduction of the error to practice through the agency of
   an order made the evil greater than that of other intellectual errors
   on moral and religious subjects, which, springing up in the brain of an
   individual, are often corrected and purified in the course of nature
   before they find their way into the common mind.

   1. Casuistry ignores the difference between thought and action. Actions
   are necessarily external. The spoken word constitutes the lie; the
   outward performance the crime. The Highest Wisdom, it is true, has
   identified the two: He that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath
   already committed adultery with her in his heart.' But this is not the
   rule by which we are to judge our past actions, but to guard our future
   ones. He who has thoughts of lust or passion is not innocent in the
   sight of God, and is liable to be carried on to perform the act on
   which he suffers himself to dwell. And, in looking forward, he will do
   well to remember this caution of Christ: but in looking backward, in
   thinking of others, in endeavouring to estimate the actual amount of
   guilt or trespass, if he begins by placing thought on the level of
   action, he will end by placing action on the level of thought. It would
   be a monstrous state of mind in which we regarded mere imagination of
   evil as the same with action; hatred as the same with murder; thoughts
   of impurity as the same with adultery. It is not so that we must learn
   Christ. Actions are one thing and thoughts another in the eye of
   conscience, no less than of the law of the land; of God as well as man.
   However important it may be to remember that the all-seeing eye of God
   tries the reins, it is no less important to remember also that morality
   consists in definite acts, capable of being seen and judged of by our
   fellow-creatures, impossible to escape ourselves.

   2. What may be termed the frame of casuistry was supplied by law, while
   the spirit is that of the scholastic philosophy. Neither afforded any
   general principle which might correct extravagancies in detail, or
   banish subtilties, or negative remote and unsafe inferences. But the
   application of the analogy of law to subjects of morality and religion
   was itself a figment which, at every step, led deeper into error. The
   object was to realize and define, in every possible stage, acts which
   did not admit of legal definition, either because they were not
   external, but only thoughts or suggestions of the mind, or because the
   external part of the action was not allowed to be regarded separately
   from the motives of the agent. The motive or intention which law takes
   no account of, except as indicating the nature of the act, becomes the
   principal subject of the casuist's art. Casuistry may be said to begin
   where law ends. It goes where law refuses to follow with legal rules
   and distinctions into the domain of morality. It weighs in the balance
   of precedent and authority the impalpable acts of a spiritual being.
   Law is a real science which has its roots in history, which grasps
   fact; seeking, in idea, to rest justice on truth only, and to reconcile
   the rights of individuals with the well-being of the whole. But
   casuistry is but the ghost or ape of a science; it has no history and
   no facts corresponding to it; it came into the world by the ingenuity
   of man; its object is to produce an artificial disposition of human
   affairs, at which nature rebels.

   3. The distinctions of the casuist are far from equalling the subtilty
   of human life, or the diversity of its conditions. It is quite true
   that actions the same in name are, in the scale of right and wrong, as
   different as can be imagined; varying with the age, temperament,
   education, circumstances of each individual. The casuist is not in
   fault for maintaining this difference, but for supposing that he can
   classify or distinguish them so as to give any conception of their
   innumerable shades and gradations. All his folios are but the weary
   effort to abstract or make a brief of the individuality of man. The
   very actions which he classifies change their meaning as he writes them
   down, like the words of a sentence torn away from their context. He is
   ever idealizing and creating distinctions, splitting straws, dividing
   hairs; yet any one who reflects on himself will idealize and
   distinguish further still, and think of his whole life in all its
   circumstances, with its sequence of thoughts and motives, and, withal,
   many excuses. But no one can extend this sort of idealism beyond
   himself; no insight of the confessor can make him clairvoyant of the
   penitent's soul. Know ourselves we sometimes truly may, but we cannot
   know others, and no other can know us. No other can know or understand
   us in the same wonderful or mysterious way; no other can be conscious
   of the spirit in which we have lived; no other can see us as a whole or
   get within. God has placed a veil of flesh between ourselves and other
   men, to screen the nakedness of our soul. Into the secret chamber He
   does not require that we should admit any other judge or counsellor but
   himself. Two eyes only are upon us--the eye of our own soul--the eye of
   God, and the one is the light of the other. That is the true light, on
   the which if a man look he will have a knowledge of himself, different
   in kind from that which the confessor extracts from the books of the
   casuists.

   4. There are many cases in which our first thoughts, or, to speak more
   correctly, our instinctive perceptions, are true and' right; in which
   it is not too much to say, that he who deliberates is lost. The very
   act of turning to a book, or referring to another, enfeebles our power
   of action. Works of art are produced we know not how, by some
   simultaneous movement of hand and thought, which seem to lend to each
   other force and meaning. So in moral action, the true view does not
   separate the intention from the act, or the act from the circumstances
   which surround it, but regards them as one and absolutely indivisible.
   In the performance of the act and in the judgement of it, the will and
   the execution, the hand and the thought are to be considered as one.
   Those who act most energetically, who in difficult circumstances judge
   the most truly, do not separately pass in review the rules, and
   principles, and counter principles of action, but grasp them at once,
   in a single instant. Those who act most truthfully, honestly, firmly,
   manfully, consistently, take least time to deliberate. Such should be
   the attitude of our minds in all questions of right and wrong, truth
   and falsehood; we may not inquire, but act.

   5. Casuistry not only renders us independent of our own convictions, it
   renders us independent also of the opinion of mankind in general. It
   puts the confessor in the place of ourselves, and in the place of the
   world. By making the actions of men matters of science, it cuts away
   the supports and safeguards which public opinion gives to morality; the
   confessor in the silence of the closet easily introduces principles
   from which the common sense or conscience of mankind would have shrunk
   back. Especially in matters of truth and falsehood, in the nice sense
   of honour shown in the unwillingness to get others within our power,
   his standard will probably fall short of that of the world at large.
   Public opinion, it is true, drives men's vices inwards; it teaches them
   to conceal their faults from others, and if possible from themselves,
   and this very concealment may sink them in despair, or cover them with
   self-deceit. And the soul--whose house is its castle'--has an enemy
   within, the strength of which may be often increased by communications
   from without. Yet the good of this privacy is on the whole greater than
   the evil. Not only is the outward aspect of society more decorous, and
   the confidence between man and man less liable to be impaired; the mere
   fact of men's sins being known to themselves and God only, and the
   support afforded even by the undeserved opinion of their fellows, are
   of themselves great helps to a moral and religious life. Many a one by
   being thought better than he was has become better; by being thought as
   bad or worse has become worse. To communicate our sins to those who
   have no claim to know them is of itself a diminution of our moral
   strength. It throws upon others what we ought to do for ourselves; it
   leads us to seek in the sympathy of others a strength which no sympathy
   can give. It is a greater trust than is right for us commonly to repose
   in our fellow-creatures; it places us in their power; it may make us
   their tools.

   To conclude, the errors and evils of casuistry may be summed up as
   follows:--It makes that abstract which is concrete, scientific which is
   contingent, artificial which is natural, positive which is moral,
   theoretical which is intuitive and immediate. It puts the parts in the
   place of the whole, exceptions in the place of rules, system in the
   place of experience, dependence in the place of responsibility,
   reflection in the place of conscience. It lowers the heavenly to the
   earthly, the principles of men to their practice, the tone of the
   preacher to the standard of ordinary life. It sends us to another for
   that which can only be found in ourselves. It leaves the highway of
   public opinion to wander in the labyrinths of an imaginary science; the
   light of the world for the darkness of the closet. It is to human
   nature what anatomy is to our bodily frame; instead of a moral and
   spiritual being, preserving only a body of death.'

ESSAY

    ON

NATURAL RELIGION

   THE revelation of righteousness by faith in the Epistle to the Romans
   is relative to a prior condemnation of Jew and Gentile, who are alike
   convicted of sin. If the world had not been sitting in darkness and the
   shadow of death, there would have been no need of the light. And yet
   this very darkness is a sort of contradiction, for it is the darkness
   of the soul, which, nevertheless, sees itself and God. Such darkness
   visible' St. Paul had felt in himself, and, passing from the individual
   to the world, he lifts up the veil partially, and lets the light of
   God's wrath shine upon the corruption of man. What he himself in the
   searchings of his own spirit had become conscious of was written in
   large letters' on the scene around. To all Israelites at least, the law
   stood in the same relation as it had once done to himself; it placed
   them in a state of reprobation. Without law they had not had sin,' and
   now, the only way to do away with sin is to do away the law itself.

   But, if sin is not imputed where there is no law,' it might seem as
   though the heathen could not be brought within the sphere of the same
   condemnation. Could we suppose men to be like animals, nourishing a
   blind life within the brain,' the seed that is not quickened except it
   die' would have no existence in them. Common sense tells us that all
   evil implies a knowledge of good, and that no man can be responsible
   for the worship of a false God who has no means of approach to the
   true. But this was not altogether the case of the Gentile; without the
   law sin was in the world;' as the Jew had the law, so the Gentile had
   the witness of God in creation. Nature was the Gentile's law,
   witnessing against his immoral and degraded state, leading him upward
   through the visible things to the unseen power of God. He knew God, as
   the Apostle four times repeats, and magnified Him not as God; so that
   he was without excuse, not only for his idolatry, but because he
   worshipped idols in the presence of God himself.

   Such is the train of thought which we perceive to be working in the
   Apostle's mind, and which leads him, in accordance with the general
   scope of the Epistle to the Romans, to speak of natural religion. In
   two passages in the Acts he dwells on the same subject. It was one that
   found a ready response in the age to which St. Paul preached.
   Reflections of a similar kind were not uncommon among the heathen
   themselves. If at any time in the history of mankind natural religion
   can be said to have had a real and independent existence, it was in the
   twilight of heathenism and Christianity. Seeking after God, if haply
   they might feel after him and find him,' is a touching description of
   the efforts of philosophy in its later period. That there were
   principles in Nature higher and purer than the creations of mythology
   was a reflection made by those who would have deemed the cross of
   Christ foolishness,' who mocked at the resurrection of the dead.' The
   Olympic heaven was no longer the air which men breathed, or the sky
   over their heads. The better mind of the world was turning from dumb
   idols.' Ideas about God and man were taking the place of the old
   heathen rites. Religions, like nations, met and mingled. East and West
   were learning of each other, giving and receiving spiritual and
   political elements; the objects of Gentile worship fading into a more
   distant and universal God; the Jew also travelling in thought into
   regions which his fathers knew not, and beginning to form just
   conceptions of the earth and its inhabitants,

   While we remain within the circle of Scripture language, or think of
   St. Paul as speaking only to the men of his own age in words that wore
   striking and appropriate to them, there is no difficulty in
   understanding his meaning. The Old Testament denounced idolatry as
   hateful to God. It was away from Him, out of His sight; except where it
   touched the fortunes of the Jewish people, hardly within the range
   either of His judgements or of His mercies. No Israelite, in the elder
   days of Jewish history, supposed the tribes round about, or the
   individuals who composed them, to be equally with himself the objects
   of God's care. The Apostle brings the heathen back before the judgement
   seat of God. He sees them sinking into the condition of the old
   Canaanitish nations. He regards this corruption of Nature as a
   consequence of their idolatry. They knew, or might have known, God, for
   creation witnesses of Him. This is the hinge of the Apostle's argument:
   If they had not known God they had not had sin;' but now they know Him,
   and sin in the light of knowledge. Without this consciousness of sin
   there would be no condemnation of the heathen, and therefore no need of
   justification for him--no parallelism or coherence between the previous
   states of Jew and Gentile, or between the two parts of the scheme of
   redemption.

   But here philosophy, bringing into contrast the Scriptural view of
   things and the merely historical or human one, asks the question, How
   far was it possible for the heathen to have seen God in Nature?' Could
   a man anticipate the true religion any more than he could anticipate
   discoveries in science or in art? Could he pierce the clouds of
   mythology, or lay aside language as it were a garment? Three or four in
   different ages, who have been the heralds of great religious
   revolutions, may have risen above their natural state under the
   influence of some divine impulse. But men in general do as others do;
   single persons in India or China do not dislocate themselves from the
   customs, traditions, prejudices, rites, in which they have been:
   brought up. The mind of a nation has its own structure, which receives
   and also idealizes in various degrees the forms of outward Nature.
   Religions, like languages, conform to this mental structure; they are
   prior to the thoughts of individuals; no one is responsible for them.
   Homer is not to blame for his conception of the Grecian gods; it is
   natural and adequate to his age. For no one in primitive times could
   disengage himself from that world of sense which grew to him and
   enveloped him; we might as well imagine that he could invent a new
   language, or change the form which he inherited from his race into some
   other type of humanity.

   The question here raised is one of the most important, as it is perhaps
   one that has been least considered, out of the many questions in which
   reason and faith, historical fact and religious belief, come into real
   or apparent conflict with each other. Volumes have been written on the
   connexion of geology with the Mosaic account of the creation--a
   question which is on the outskirts of the great difficulty--a sort of
   advanced post, at which theologians go out to meet the enemy. But we
   cannot refuse seriously to consider the other difficulty, which affects
   us much more nearly, and in the present day almost forces itself upon
   us, as the spirit of the ancient religions is more understood, and the
   forms of religion still existing among men become better known.

   It sometimes seems as if we lived in two, or rather many distinct
   worlds--the world of faith and the world of experience--the world of
   sacred and the world of profane history. Between them there is a gulf;
   it is not easy to pass from one to the other. They have a different set
   of words and ideas, which it would be bad taste to intermingle; and of
   how much is this significant? They present themselves to us at
   different times, and call up a different train of associations. When
   reading Scripture we think only of the heavens which are made by the
   word of God,' of the winds and waves obeying his will,' of the
   accomplishment of events in history by the interposition of His hand.
   But in the study of ethnology or geology, in the records of our own or
   past times, a curtain drops over the Divine presence; human motives
   take the place of spiritual agencies; effects are not without causes;
   interruptions of Nature repose in the idea of law. Race, climate,
   physical influences, states of the human intellect and of society, are
   among the chief subjects of ordinary history; in the Bible there is no
   allusion to them; to the inspired writer they have no existence. Were
   then different, then, in early ages, or does the sacred narrative show
   them to us under a different point of view? The being of whom Scripture
   gives one account, philosophy another--who has a share in Nature and a
   place in history. who partakes also of a hidden life, and is the
   subject of an unseen power--is he not the same? This is the difficulty
   of our times, which presses upon us more and more, both in speculation
   and practice, as different classes of ideas come into comparison with
   each other. The day has passed in which we could look upon man in one
   aspect only, without interruption or confusion from any other. And
   Scripture, which uses the language and ideas of the age in which it was
   written, is inevitably at variance with the new modes of speech, as
   well as with the real discoveries of later knowledge.

   Yet the Scriptures lead the way in subjecting the purely supernatural
   and spiritual view of human things to the laws of experience. The
   revocation in Ezekiel of the old proverb in the house of Israel,' is
   the assertion of a moral principle, and a return to fact and Nature.
   The words of our Saviour --Think ye that those eighteen on whom the
   tower of Siloam fell, were sinners above all the men who dwelt in
   Jerusalem?' and the parallel passage respecting the one born
   blind--Neither this man did sin, nor his parents,' are an enlargement
   of the religious belief of the time in accordance with experience. When
   it is said that faith is not to look for wonders; or the kingdom of God
   cometh not with observation,' and neither will they be persuaded though
   one rose from the dead,' here, too, is an elevation of the order of
   Nature over the miraculous and uncommon. The preference of charity to
   extraordinary gifts is another instance, in which the Spirit of Christ
   speaks by the lips of Paul, of a like tendency. And St. Paul himself,
   in recognizing a world without the Jewish, as responsible to God, and
   subject to His laws, is but carrying out, according to the knowledge of
   his age, the same principle which a wider experience of the world and
   of antiquity compels us to extend yet further to all time and to all
   mankind.

   It has been asked: How far, in forming a moral estimate of an
   individual, are we to consider his actions simply as good or evil; or
   how far are we to include in our estimate education, country, rank in
   life, physical constitution, and so forth?' Morality is rightly jealous
   of our resolving evil into the influence of circumstances: it will no
   more listen to the plea of temptation as the excuse for vice, than the
   law will hear of the same plea in mitigation of the penalty for crime.
   It requires that we should place ourselves within certain conditions
   before we pass judgement. Yet we cannot deny a higher point of view
   also--of him that judged not as a man judgeth,' in which we fear to
   follow only because of the limitation of our faculties. And in the case
   of a murderer or other great criminal, if we were suddenly made aware,
   when dwelling on the enormity of his crime, that he had been educated
   in vice and misery, that his act had not been unprovoked, perhaps that
   his physical constitution was such as made it nearly impossible for him
   to resist the provocation which was offered to him, the knowledge of
   these and similar circumstances would alter our estimate of the
   complexion of his guilt. We might think him guilty, but we should also
   think him unfortunate. Stern necessity might still require that the law
   should take its course, but we should feel pity as well as anger. We
   should view his conduct in a larger and more comprehensive way, and
   acknowledge that, had we been placed in the same circumstances, we
   might have been guilty of the same act.

   Now the difference between these two views of morality is analogous to
   the difference between the way in which St. Paul regards the heathen
   religions, and the way in which we ourselves regard them, in proportion
   as we become better acquainted with their true nature. St. Paul
   conceives idolatry separate from all the circumstances of time, of
   country, of physical or mental states by which it is accompanied, and
   in which it may be almost said to consist. He implies a deliberate
   knowledge of the good, and choice of the evil. He supposes each
   individual to contrast the truth of God with the error of false
   religions, and deliberately to reject God. He conceives all mankind,
   creatures as they are one of another,' and

   Moving all together if they move at all,'

   to be suddenly freed from the bond of nationality, from the customs and
   habits of thought of ages. The moral life which is proper to the
   individual, he breathes into the world collectively. Speaking not of
   the agents and their circumstances, but of their acts, and seeing these
   reflected in what may be termed in a figure the conscience, not of an
   individual but of mankind in general, he passes on all men everywhere
   the sentence of condemnation. We can hardly venture to say what would
   have been his judgement on the great names of Greek and Roman history,
   had he familiarly known them. He might have felt as we feel, that there
   is a certain impropriety in attempting to determine, with a Jesuit
   writer, or even in the spirit of love and admiration which the great
   Italian poet shows for them, the places of the philosophers and heroes
   of antiquity in the world to come. More in his own spirit, he would
   have spoken of them as a part of the mystery which was not then
   revealed as it now is.' But neither can we imagine how he could have
   become familiar with them at all without ceasing to be St. Paul.

   Acquainted as we are with Greek and Roman literature from within,
   lovers of its old heroic story, it is impossible for us to regard the
   religions of the heathen world in the single point of view which they
   presented to the first believers. It would be a vain attempt to try and
   divest ourselves of the feelings towards the great names of Greek and
   Roman history which a classical education has implanted in us; as
   little can we think of the deities of the heathen mythology in the
   spirit of a Christian of the first two centuries. Looking back from the
   vantage ground of ages, we see more clearly the proportions of
   heathenism and Christianity, as of other great forms or events of
   history, than was possible for contemporaries. Ancient authors are like
   the inhabitants of a valley who know nothing of the countries beyond:
   they have a narrow idea either of their own or other times; many
   notions are entertained by them respecting the past history of mankind
   which a wider prospect would have dispelled. The horizon of the sacred
   writers too is limited; they do not embrace the historical or other
   aspects of the state of man to which modern reflection has given rise;
   they are in the valley still, though with the light of the world'
   above. The Apostle sees the Athenians from Mars' Hill wholly given to
   idolatry:' to us, the same scene would have revealed wonders of art and
   beauty, the loss of which the civilized nations of Europe still seem
   with a degree of seriousness to lament. He thinks of the heathen
   religions in the spirit of one of the old prophets; to us they are
   subjects of philosophy also. He makes no distinction between their
   origin and their decline, the dreams of the childhood of the human race
   and the fierce and brutal lusts with which they afterwards became
   polluted; we note many differences between Homer and the corruption of
   later Greek life, between the rustic simplicity of the old Roman
   religion and the impurities of the age of Clodius or Tiberius. More and
   more, as they become better known to us, the original forms of all
   religions are seen to fall under the category of nature and less under
   that of mind, or free will. There is nothing to which they are so much
   akin as language, of which they are a sort of after-growth--in their
   fantastic creations the play or sport of the same faculty of speech;
   they seem to be also based on a spiritual affection, which is
   characteristic of man equally with the social ones. Religions, like
   languages, are inherent in all men everywhere, having a close sympathy
   or connexion with political and family life. It would be a shallow and
   imaginary explanation of them that they are corruptions of some
   primaeval revelation, or impostures framed by the persuasive arts of
   magicians or priests. There are many other respects in which our first
   impressions respecting the heathen world are changed by study and
   experience. There was more of true greatness in the conceptions of
   heathen legislators and philosophers than we readily admit, and more of
   nobility and disinterestedness in their character. The founders of the
   Eastern religions especially, although indistinctly seen by us, appear
   to be raised above the ordinary level of mortality. The laws of our own
   country are an inheritance partly bequeathed to us by a heathen nation;
   many of our philosophical and most of our political ideas are derived
   from a like source. What shall we say to these things? Are we not
   undergoing, on a wider scale and in a new way, the same change which
   the Fathers of Alexandria underwent, when they became aware that
   heathenism was not wholly evil, and that there was as much in Plato and
   Aristotle which was in harmony with the Gospel as of what was
   antagonistic to it.

   Among the many causes at present in existence which will influence the
   Church of the future,' none is likely to have greater power than our
   increasing knowledge of the religions of mankind. The study of them is
   the first step in the philosophical study of revelation itself. For
   Christianity or the Mosaic religion, standing alone, is hardly a
   subject for scientific inquiry: only when compared with other forms of
   faith do we perceive its true place in history, or its true relation to
   human nature. The glory of Christianity is not to be as unlike other
   religions as possible, but to be their perfection and fulfilment. Those
   religions are so many steps in the education of the human race. One
   above another, they rise or grow side by side, each nation, in many
   ages, contributing some partial ray of a divine light, some element of
   morality, some principle of social life, to the common stock of
   mankind. The thoughts of men, like the productions of Nature, do not
   endlessly diversify; they work themselves out in a few simple forms. In
   the fullness of time, philosophy appears, shaking off, yet partly
   retaining, the nationality and particularity of its heathen origin. Its
   top reaches to heaven,' but it has no root in the common life of man.
   At last, the, crown of all, the chief corner-stone of the building,
   when the impressions of Nature and the reflections of the mind upon
   itself have been exhausted, Christianity arises in the world, seeming
   to stand in the same relation to the inferior religions that man does
   to the inferior animals.

   When, instead of painting harsh contrasts between Christianity and
   other religions, we rather draw them together as nearly as truth will
   allow, many thoughts come into our minds about their relation to each
   other which are of great speculative interest as well as of practical
   importance. The joyful words of the Apostle: Is he the God of the Jews
   only, is he not also of the Gentiles?' have a new meaning for us. And
   this new application the Apostle himself may be regarded as having
   taught us, where he says: When the Gentiles which know not the law do
   by nature the things contained in the law, these not having the law are
   a law unto themselves.' There have been many schoolmasters to bring men
   to Christ, and not the law of Moses only. Ecclesiastical history
   enlarges its borders to take in the preparations for the Gospel, the
   anticipations of it, the parallels with it; collecting the scattered
   gleams of truth which may have revealed themselves even to single
   individuals in remote ages and countries. We are no longer interested
   in making out a case against the heathen religions in the spirit of
   party--the superiority of Christianity will appear sufficiently without
   that--we rather rejoice that, at sundry times and in divers manners, by
   ways more or less akin to the methods of human knowledge, God spake in
   time past to the fathers,' and that in the darkest ages, amid the most
   fanciful aberrations of mythology, He left not himself wholly without a
   witness between good and evil in the natural affections of mankind.

   Some facts also begin to appear, which have hitherto been unknown or
   concealed. They are of two kinds, relating partly to the origin or
   development of the Jewish or Christian religion; partly also
   independent of them, yet affording remarkable parallels both to their
   outward form and to their inner life. Christianity is seen to have
   partaken much more of the better mind of the Gentile world than the
   study of Scripture only would have led us to conjecture: it has
   received, too, many of its doctrinal terms from the language of
   philosophy. The Jewish religion is proved to have incorporated with
   itself some elements which were not of Jewish origin; and the Jewish
   history begins to be explained by the analogy of other nations. The
   most striking fact of the second kind is found in a part of the world
   which Christianity can be scarcely said to have touched, and is of a
   date some centuries anterior to it. That there is a faith [6] which has
   a greater number of worshippers than all sects of Christians put
   together, which originated in a reformation of society, tyrannized over
   by tradition, spoiled by philosophy, torn asunder by caste--which might
   be described, in the words of Scripture, as a preaching of the Gospel
   to the poor;' that this faith, besides its more general resemblance to
   Christianity, has its incarnation, its monks, its saints, its
   hierarchy, its canonical books, its miracles, its councils, the whole
   system being full blown' before the Christian era; that the founder of
   this religion descended from a throne to teach the lesson of equality
   among men--(there is no distinction of' Chinese or Hindoo, Brahmin or
   Sudra, such at least was the indirect consequence of his
   doctrine)--that, himself contented with nothing, he preached to his
   followers the virtues of poverty, self-denial, chastity, temperance,
   and that once, at least, he is described as taking upon himself the
   sins of mankind:'--these are facts which, when once known, are not
   easily forgotten; they seem to open an undiscovered world to us, and to
   cast a new light on Christianity itself. And it harrows us with fear
   and wonder,' to learn that this vast system, numerically the most
   universal or catholic of all religions, and, in many of its leading
   features, most like Christianity, is based, not on the hope of eternal
   life, but of complete annihilation.

   The Greek world presents another parallel with the Gospel, which is
   also independent of it; less striking, yet coming nearer home, and
   sometimes overlooked because it is general and obvious. That the
   political virtues of courage, patriotism, and the like, have been
   received by Christian nations from a classical source is commonly
   admitted. Let us ask now the question, Whence is the love of knowledge?
   who first taught men that the pursuit of truth was a religious duty?
   Doubtless the words of one greater than Socrates come into our minds:
   For this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that
   they might know the truth.' But the truth here spoken of is of another
   and more mysterious kind; not truth in the logical or speculative sense
   of the word, nor even in its ordinary use. The earnest inquiry after
   the nature of things, the devotion of a life to such an inquiry, the
   forsaking all other good in the hope of acquiring some fragment of true
   knowledge,--this is an instance of human virtue not to be found among
   the Jews, but among the Greeks. It is a phenomenon of religion, as well
   as of philosophy, that among the Greeks too there should have been
   those who, like the Jewish prophets, stood out from the world around
   them, who taught a lesson, like them, too exalted for the practice of
   mankind in general; who anticipated out of the order of nature the
   knowledge of future ages; whose very chance words and misunderstood
   modes of speech have moulded the minds of men in remote times and
   countries. And that these teachers of mankind, as they were finishing
   their course' in the decline of Paganism, like Jewish prophets, though
   unacquainted with Christianity, should have become almost Christian,
   preaching the truths which we sometimes hold to be foolishness to the
   Greek,' as when Epictetus spoke of humility, or Seneca told of a God
   who had made of one blood all nations of the earth,--is a sad and
   touching fact.

   But it is not only the better mind of heathenism in East or West that
   affords parallels with the Christian religion: the corruptions of
   Christianity, its debasement by secular influences, its temporary decay
   at particular times or places, receive many illustrations from similar
   phenomena in ancient times and heathen countries. The manner in which
   the Old Testament has taken the place of the New; the tendency to
   absorb the individual life in the outward church; the personification
   of the principle of separation from the world in monastic orders; the
   accumulation of wealth with the profession of poverty; the
   spiritualism, or childlike faith, of one age, and the rationalism or
   formalism of another; many of the minute controversial disputes which
   exist between Christians respecting doctrines both of natural and
   revealed religion;--all these errors or corruptions of Christianity
   admit of being compared with similar appearances either in Buddhism or
   Mahomedanism. Is not the half-believing half-sceptical attitude in
   which Socrates and others stood to the orthodox' pagan faith very
   similar to that in which philosophers, and in some countries educated
   men, generally have stood to established forms of Christianity? Is it
   only in Christian times that men have sought to consecrate art in the
   service of religion? Did not Paganism do so far more completely? or was
   it Plato only to whom moral ideas represented themselves in sensual
   forms? Has not the whole vocabulary of art, in modern times, become
   confused with that of morality? The modern historian of Greece and Rome
   draws our attention to other religious features in the ancient world,
   which are not without their counterpart in the modern,--old friends
   with new faces,'--which a few words are enough to suggest. The
   aristocratic character of Paganism, the influence which it exerted over
   women, its galvanic efforts to restore the past, the ridicule with
   which the sceptic assails its errors, and the manner in which the
   antiquarians Pausanias and Dionysius contemptuously reply; also the
   imperfect attempts at reconcilement of old and new, found in such
   writers as Plutarch, and the obscure sense of the real connexion of the
   Pagan worship with political and social life, the popularity of its
   temporary hierophants; its panics, wonders, oracles, mysteries,--these
   features make us aware that however unlike the true life of
   Christianity may have been even to the better mind of heathenism, the
   corruptions and weaknesses of Christianity have never been without a
   parallel under the sun.

   Those religions which possess sacred books furnish some other curious,
   though exaggerated, likenesses of the use which has been sometimes made
   of the Jewish or Christian Scriptures. No believer in organic or verbal
   inspiration has applied more high-sounding titles to the Bible than the
   Brahmin or Mussulman to the Koran or the Vedas. They have been loaded
   with commentaries--buried under the accumulations of tradition; no care
   has been thought too great of their words and letters, while the
   original meaning has been lost, and even the language in which they
   were written ceased to be understood. Every method of interpretation
   has been practised upon them; logic and mysticism have elicited every
   possible sense; the aid of miracles has been called in to resolve
   difficulties and reconcile contradictions. And still, notwithstanding
   the perverseness with which they are interpreted, these half-understood
   books exercise a mighty spell; single verses, misapplied words,
   disputed texts, have affected the social and political state of
   millions of mankind during a thousand or many thousand years. Even
   without reference to their contents, the mere name of these books has
   been a power in the Eastern world. Facts like these would be greatly
   misunderstood if they were supposed to reduce the Old and New Testament
   to the level of other sacred books, or Christianity to the level of
   other religions. But they may guard us against some forms of
   superstition which insensibly, almost innocently, spring up among
   Christians; and they reveal weaknesses of human nature, from which we
   can scarcely hope that our own age or country is exempt.

   Let us conclude this digression by summing up the use of such
   inquiries; as a touchstone and witness of Christian truth; as bearing
   on our relations with the heathens themselves.

   Christianity, in its way through the world, is ever taking up and
   incorporating with itself Jewish, secular, or even Gentile elements.
   And the use of the study of the heathen religions is just this: it
   teaches us to separate the externals or accidents of Christianity from
   its essence; its local, temporary type from its true spirit and life.
   These externals, which Christianity has in common with other religions
   of the East, may be useful, may be necessary, but they are not the
   truths which Christ came on earth to reveal. The fact of the possession
   of sacred books, and the claim which is made for them, that they are
   free from all error or imperfection, if admitted, would not distinguish
   the Christian from the Mahomedan faith. Most of the Eastern religions,
   again, have had vast hierarchies and dogmatic systems; neither is this
   a note of divinity. Also, they are witnessed to by signs and wonders;
   we are compelled to go further to find the characteristics of the
   Gospel of Christ. As the Apostle says: And yet I show you a more
   excellent way,'--not in the Scriptures, nor in the church, nor in a
   system of doctrines, nor in miracles, does Christianity consist, though
   some of these may be its necessary accompaniments or instruments, but
   in the life and teaching of Christ.

   The study of comparative theology' not only helps to distinguish the
   accidents from the essence of Christianity; it also affords a new kind
   of testimony to its truth; it shows what the world was aiming at
   through many cycles of human history--what the Gospel alone fulfilled.
   The Gentile religions, from being enemies, became witnesses of the
   Christian faith. They are no longer adverse positions held by the
   powers of evil, but outworks or buttresses, like the courts of the
   Temple on Mount Sion, covering the holy place. Granting that some of
   the doctrines and teachers of the heathen world were nearer the truth
   than we once supposed, such resemblances cause no alarm or uneasiness;
   we have no reason to fable that they are the fragments of some
   primaeval revelation. We look forwards, not backwards; to the end, not
   to the beginning; not to the garden of Eden, but to the life of Christ.
   There is no longer any need to maintain a thesis; we have the perfect
   freedom and real peace which is attained by the certainty that we know
   all, and that nothing is kept back. Such was the position of
   Christianity in former ages; it was on a level with the knowledge of
   mankind. But in later years unworthy fear has too often paralyzed its
   teachers instead of seeking to readjust its relations to the present
   state of history and science, they have clung in agony to the past. For
   the Gospel is the child of light; it lives in the light of this world;
   it has no shifts or concealments; there is no kind of knowledge which
   it needs to suppress; it allows us to see the good in all things; it
   does not forbid us to observe also the evil which, has incrusted upon
   itself. It is willing that we should look calmly and steadily at all
   the facts of the history of religion. It takes no offence at the
   remark, that it has drawn into itself the good of other religions; that
   the laws and institutions of the Roman Empire have supplied the outer
   form, and heathen philosophy some of the inner mechanism which was
   necessary to its growth in the world. No violence is done to its spirit
   by the enumeration of the causes which have led to its success. It
   permits us also to note, that while it has purified the civilization of
   the West, there are soils of earth on which it seems hardly capable of
   living without becoming corrupt or degenerate. Such knowledge is
   innocent and a creature of God.' And considering how much of the
   bitterness of Christians against one another arises from ignorance and
   a false conception of, the nature of religion, it is not chimerical to
   imagine that the historical study of religions may be a help to
   Christian charity. The least differences seem often to be the greatest;
   the perception of the greater differences makes the lesser
   insignificant. Living within the sphere of Christianity, it is good for
   us sometimes to place ourselves without; to turn away from the weak and
   beggarly elements' of worn-out controversies to contemplate the great
   phases of human existence. Looking at the religions of mankind,
   succeeding one another in a wonderful order, it is hard to, narrow our
   minds to party or sectarian views in our own age or country. Had it
   been known that a dispute about faith and works existed among
   Buddhists, would not this knowledge have modified the great question of
   the Reformation? Such studies have also a philosophical value as well
   as a Christian use. They may, perhaps, open to us a new page in the
   history of our own minds, as well as in the history of the human race.
   Mankind, in primitive times, seem at first sight very unlike ourselves:
   as we look upon them with sympathy and interest, a likeness begins to
   appear; in us too there is a piece of the primitive man; many of his
   wayward fancies are the caricatures of our errors or perplexities. If a
   clearer light is ever to be thrown either on the nature of religion or
   of the human mind, it will come, not from analyses of the individual or
   from inward experience, but from a study of the mental history of
   mankind, and especially of those ages in which human nature was fusile,
   still not yet cast in a mould, and rendered incapable of receiving new
   creations or impressions.

   The study of the religions of the world has also a bearing on the
   present condition of the heathen. We cannot act upon men unless we
   understand them; we cannot raise or elevate their moral character
   unless we are able to draw from its concealment the seed of good which
   they already contain. It is a remarkable fact, that Christianity,
   springing up in the East, should have conquered the whole western
   world, and that in the East itself it should have scarcely extended its
   border, or even retained its original hold. Westward the course of
   Christianity has taken its way;' and now it seems as if the two ends of
   the world would no longer meet; as if differences of degree had
   extended to differences of kind in human nature, and that we cannot
   pass from one species to another. Whichever way we look, difficulties
   appear such as had no existence in the first ages: either barbarism,
   paling in the presence of a superior race, so that it can hardly be
   kept alive to receive Christianity, or the mummy-like civilization of
   China, which seems as though it could never become instinct with a new
   life, or Brahminism, outlasting in its pride many conquerors of the
   soil, or the nobler form of Mahomedanism; the religion of the
   patriarchs, as it were, overliving itself, preaching to the sons of
   Ishmael the God of Abraham, who had not yet revealed himself as man.
   These great systems of religious belief have been subject to some
   internal changes in a shifting world: the effect produced upon them
   from without is as yet scarcely perceptible. The attempt to move them
   is like a conflict between man and nature. And in some places it seems
   as if the wave had receded again after its advance, and some
   conversions have been dearly bought, either by the violence of
   persecution or the corruption or accommodation of the truth. Each sect
   of Christians has been apt to lend itself to the illusion that the
   great organic differences of human nature might be bridged over, could
   the Gospel of Christ be preached to the heathen in that precise form in
   which it is received by themselves; if we could but land in remote
   countries, full armed in that particular system or way after which we
   in England worship the God of our Fathers.' And often the words have
   been repeated, sometimes in the spirit of delusion, sometimes in that
   of faith and love: Lift up your eyes, and behold the fields, that they
   are already white for harvest,' when it was but a small corner of the
   field that was beginning to whiten, a few ears only which were ready
   for the reapers to gather.

   And yet the command remains: Go forth and preach the Gospel to every
   creature.' Nor can any blessing be conceived greater than the spread of
   Christianity among heathen nations, nor any calling nobler or higher to
   which Christians can devote themselves. Why are we unable to fulfil
   this command in any effectual manner? Is it that the Gospel has had
   barriers set to it, and that the stream no longer overflows on the
   surrounding territory; that we have enough of this water for ourselves,
   but not enough for us and them? or that the example of nominal
   Christians, who are bent on their own trade or interest, destroys the
   lesson which has been preached by the ministers of religion? Yet the
   lives of believers did not prevent the spread of Christianity at
   Corinth and Ephesus. And it is hard to suppose that the religion which
   is true for ourselves has lost its vital power in the world.

   The truth seems to be, not that Christianity has lost its power, but
   that we are seeking to propagate Christianity under circumstances
   which, during the eighteen centuries of its existence, it has never yet
   encountered. Perhaps there may have been a want of zeal, or discretion,
   or education in the preachers; sometimes there may have been too great
   a desire to impress on the mind of the heathen some peculiar doctrine,
   instead of the more general lesson of righteousness, temperance,
   judgement to come.' But however this may be, there is no reason to
   believe that even if a saint or apostle could rise from the dead, he
   would produce by his preaching alone, without the use of other means,
   any wide or deep impression on India or China. To restore life to those
   countries is a vast and complex work, in which many agencies have to
   co-operate--political, industrial, social; and missionary efforts,
   though a blessed, are but a small part; and the Government is not the
   less Christian because it seeks to rule a heathen nation on principles
   of truth and justice only. Let us not measure this great work by the
   number of communicants or converts. Even when wholly detached from
   Christianity, the true spirit of Christianity may animate it. The
   extirpation of crime, the administration of justice, the punishment of
   falsehood, may be regarded, without a figure of speech, as the word of
   the Lord' to a weak and deceitful people. Lessons of purity and love
   too flow insensibly out of improvement in the relations of social life.
   It is the disciple of Christ, not Christ himself, who would forbid us
   to give these to the many, because we can only give the Gospel to a
   very few. For it is of the millions, not of the thousands, in India
   that we must first give an account. Our relations to the heathen are
   different from those of Christians in former ages, and our progress in
   their conversion slower. The success which attends our efforts may be
   disparagingly compared with that of Boniface or Augustine; but if we
   look a little closer, we shall see no reason to regret that Providence
   has placed in our hands other instruments for the spread of
   Christianity besides the zeal of heroes and martyrs. The power to
   convert multitudes by a look or a word has passed away; but God has
   given us another means of ameliorating the condition of mankind, by
   acting on their circumstances, which works extensively rather than
   intensively, and is in some respects safer and less liable to abuse.
   The mission is one of governments rather than of churches or
   individuals. And if, in carrying it out, we seem to lose sight of some
   of the distinctive marks of Christianity, let us not doubt that the
   increase of justice and mercy, the growing sense of truth, even the
   progress of industry, are in themselves so many steps towards the
   kingdom of heaven.

   In the direct preaching of the Gospel, no help can be greater than that
   which is gained from a knowledge of the heathen religions. The resident
   in heathen countries readily observes the surface of the world; he has
   no difficulty in learning the habits of the natives; he avoids
   irritating their fears or jealousies. It requires a greater effort to
   understand the mind of a people; to be able to rouse or calm them; to
   sympathize with them, and yet to rule them. But it is a higher and more
   commanding knowledge still to comprehend their religion, not only in
   its decline and corruption, but in its origin and idea,--to understand
   that which they misunderstand, to appeal to that which they reverence
   against themselves, to turn back the currents of thought and opinion
   which have flowed in their veins for thousands of years. Such is the
   kind of knowledge which St. Paul had when to the Jews he became as a
   Jew, that he might win some; which led him while placing the new and
   old in irreconcilable opposition, to bring forth the new out of the
   treasure-house of the old. No religion, at present existing in the
   world, stands in the same relation to Christianity that Judaism once
   did; there is no other religion which is prophetic or anticipatory of
   it. But neither is there any religion which does not contain some idea
   of truth, some notion of duty or obligation, some sense of dependence
   on God and brotherly love to man, some human feeling of home or
   country. As in the vast series of the animal creation, with its many
   omissions and interruptions, the eye of the naturalist sees a kind of
   continuity--some elements of the higher descending into the lower,
   rudiments of the lower appearing in the higher also--so the Christian
   philosopher, gazing on the different races and religions of mankind,
   seems to see in them a spiritual continuity, not without the thought
   crossing him that the God who has made of one blood all the nations of
   the earth may yet renew in them a common life, and that our increasing
   knowledge of the present and past history of the world, and the
   progress of civilization itself, may be the means which He has
   provided, working not always in the way which we expect--that his
   banished ones be not expelled from him.'

   § 2.

   Natural religion, in the sense in which St. Paul appeals to its
   witness, is confined within narrower limits. It is a feeling rather
   than a philosophy; and rests not on arguments, but on impressions of
   God in nature. The Apostle, in the first chapter of the Romans, does
   not reason from first causes or from final causes; abstractions like
   these would not have been understood by him. Neither is he taking an
   historical survey of the religions of mankind; he touches, in a word
   only, on those who changed the glory of God into the likeness of man,
   and birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things' (Rom. i. 23),
   as on the differences of nations, in Acts xviii. 26. More truly may we
   describe him in the language of the Psalmist, the very vacancy of which
   has a peculiar meaning: He lifts up his eyes to the hills from whence
   cometh his salvation.' He wishes to inspire other men with that
   consciousness of God in all things which he himself feels: in a dry and
   thirsty land where no water is,' he would raise their minds to think of
   Him who gave them rain from heaven and fruitful seasons;' in the city
   of Pericles and Phidias he bids them turn from gilded statues and
   temples formed with hands, to the God who made of one blood all the
   nations of the earth, who is not far from every one of us.' Yet it is
   observable that he also begins by connecting his own thoughts with
   theirs, quoting their own poets,' and taking occasion, from an
   inscription which he found in their streets, to declare the mystery
   which was once hidden, but now revealed.'

   The appeal to the witness of God in nature has passed from the Old
   Testament into the New; it is one of the many points which the Epistles
   of St. Paul and the Psalms and Prophets have in common. The invisible
   things from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
   understood by the things that are made,' is another way of saying, The
   heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his
   handywork.' Yet the conception of the Old Testament is not the same
   with that of the New: in the latter we seem to be more disengaged from
   the things of sense; the utterance of the former is more that of
   feeling, and less of reflection. One is the poetry of a primitive age,
   full of vivid immediate impressions; in the other nature is more
   distant--the freshness of the first vision of earth has passed away.
   The Deity himself, in the Hebrew Scriptures, has a visible form: as He
   appeared with the body of heaven in his clearness;' as He was seen by
   the prophet Ezekiel out of the midst of the fire and the whirlwind,
   full of eyes within and without, and the spirit of the living creature
   in the wheels.' But in the New Testament, No man hath seen God at any
   time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
   declared him.' And this difference leads to a further difference in His
   relation to His works. In what we term nature, the prophet beheld only
   the covering cherubim that veil the face of God: as He moves, earth
   moves to meet Him; He maketh the winds his angels,' the heavens also
   bow before him.' His voice, as the Psalmist says, is heard in the
   storm: The Highest gives his thunder; at thy chiding, O Lord, the
   foundations of the round world are discovered.' The wonders of creation
   are not ornaments or poetical figures, strewed over the pages of the
   Old Testament by the hand of the artist, but the frame in which it
   consists. And yet in this material garb the moral and spiritual nature
   of God is never lost sight of: in the conflict of the elements He is
   the free Lord over them; at His breath--the least exertion of His
   power--they come and flee away.' He is spirit, not light--a person, not
   an element or principle; though creating all things by His word, and
   existing without reference to them, yet also, in His condescension, the
   God of the Jewish nation, and of individuals who serve Him. The
   terrible imagery in which the Psalmist delights to array His power is
   not inconsistent with the gentlest feelings of love and trust, such as
   are also expressed in the passage just now quoted: I will love thee, O
   Lord, my strength.' God is in nature because He is near also to the cry
   of His servants. The heart of man expands in His presence; he fears to
   die lest he should be taken from it. There is nothing like this in any
   other religion in the world. No Greek or Roman ever had the
   consciousness of love towards his God. No other sacred books can show a
   passage displaying such a range of feeling as the eighteenth or
   twenty-ninth Psalm--so awful a conception of the majesty of God, so
   true and tender a sense of His righteousness and lovingkindness. It is
   the same God who wields nature, who also brought up Israel out of the
   land of Egypt; who, even though the mother desert her sucking child,'
   will not forget the work of his hands.'

   But the God of nature in the Old Testament is not the God of storms or
   of battles only, but of peace and repose. Sometimes a sort of
   confidence fills the breast of the Psalmist, even in that land of
   natural convulsions: He hath set the round world so fast that it cannot
   be moved.' At other times the same peace seems to diffuse itself over
   the scenes of daily life: The hills stand round about Jerusalem, even
   so is the Lord round about them that fear him.' He maketh me to lie
   down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.' Then
   again the Psalmist wonders at the contrast between man and the other
   glories of creation: When I consider the heavens, the work of thy
   hands, the moon and the stars, that thou hast ordained; what is man,
   that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest
   him?' Yet these glories' are the images also of a higher glory:
   Jerusalem itself is transfigured into a city in the. clouds, and the
   tabernacle and temple become the pavilion of God on high. And the dawn
   of day in the prophecies, as well as in the Epistles, is the light
   which is to shine for the healing of the nations.' There are other
   passages in which the thought of the relation of God to nature calls
   forth a sort of exulting irony, and the prophet speaks of God, not so
   much as governing the world, as looking down upon it and taking His
   pastime in it: It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the heavens,
   and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers;' or he measureth the
   waters in the hollow of his hand;' or he taketh up the isles as a very
   little thing:' the feeling of which may be compared with the more
   general language of St. Paul: We are the clay and he the potter.' The
   highest things on earth reach no farther than to suggest the reflection
   of their inferiority: Behold even the sun, and it shineth not; and the
   moon is not pure in his sight.'

   It is hard to say how far such meditations belong only to particular
   ages, or to particular temperaments in our own. Doubtless, the
   influence of natural scenery differs with difference of climate,
   pursuits, education. The God of the hills is not the God of the valleys
   also;' that is to say, the aspirations of the human heart are roused
   more by the singular and uncommon, than by the quiet landscape which
   presents itself in our own neighbourhood. The sailor has a different
   sense of the vastness of the great deep and the infinity of the heaven
   above, from what is possible to another. Dwellers in cities, no less
   than the inhabitants of the desert, gaze upon the stars with different
   feelings from those who see the ever-varying forms of the seasons. What
   impression is gathered, or what lesson conveyed, seems like matter of
   chance or fancy. The power of these sweet influences often passes away
   when language comes between us and them. Yet they are not mere dreams
   of our own creation. He who has lost, or has failed to acquire, this
   interest in the beauty of the world around, is without one of the
   greatest of earthly blessings. The voice of God in nature calls us away
   from selfish cares into the free air and the light of day. There, as in
   a world the face of which is not marred by human passion, we seem to
   feel that the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.'

   It is impossible that our own feeling towards nature in the present day
   can be the same with that of the Psalmist; neither is that of the
   Psalmist the same with that of the Apostle; while, in the Book of Job
   and Ecclesiastes we seem to catch the echo of a strain different from
   either. To us, God is not in the whirlwind nor in the storm, nor in the
   earthquake, but in the still small voice. Is it not for the attempt to
   bring God nearer to us in the works of nature that we can truly
   conceive Him to be, that a poet of our own age has been subject to the
   charge of pantheism? God has removed himself out of our sight, that He
   may give us a greater idea of the immensity of His power. Perhaps it is
   impossible for us to have the wider and the narrower conception of God
   at the same time. We cannot see Him equally in the accidents of the
   world, when we think of Him as identified with its laws. But there is
   another way into His presence through our own hearts. He has given us
   the more circuitous path of knowledge; He has not closed against us the
   door of faith. He has enabled us, not merely to gaze with the eye on
   the forms and colours of Nature, but in a measure also to understand
   its laws, to wander over space and time in the contemplation of its
   mechanism, and yet to return again to the meanest flower that
   breathes,' for thoughts such as the other wonders of earth and sky are
   unable to impart.

   It is a simpler, not a lower, lesson which we gather from the Apostle.
   First, he teaches that in Nature there is something to draw us from the
   visible to the invisible. The world to the Gentiles also had seemed
   full of innumerable deities; it is really full of the presence of Him
   who made it. Secondly, the Apostle teaches the universality of God's
   providence over the whole earth. He covered it with inhabitants, to
   whom He gave their times and places of abode, that they should seek the
   Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him.' They are one
   family, his offspring,' notwithstanding the varieties of race,
   language, religion. As God is one, even so man is one in a common human
   nature--in the universality of sin, no less than the universality of
   redemption. A third lesson is the connexion of immorality and idolatry.
   They who lower the nature of God lower the nature of min also. Greek
   philosophy fell short of these lessons. Often as Plato speaks of the
   myths and legends of the gods, he failed to perceive the immorality of
   a religion of sense. Still less had any Greek imagined a brotherhood of
   all mankind, or a dispensation of God reaching backwards and forwards
   over all time. Its limitation was an essential principle of Greek life;
   it was confined to a narrow spot of earth, and to small cities; it
   could not include others besides Greeks; its gods were not gods of the
   world, but of Greece.

   Aspects of Nature in different ages have changed before the eye of man;
   at times fruitful of many thoughts; at other times either unheeded or
   fading into insignificance in comparison of the inner world. When the
   Apostle spoke of the visible things which witness of the divine power
   and glory,' it was not the beauty of particular spots which he
   recalled; his eye was not satisfied with seeing the fairness of the
   country any more than the majesty of cities. He did not study the
   flittings of shadows on the hills, or even the movements of the stars
   in their courses. The plainest passages of the book of nature were,
   equally with the sublimest, the writing of a Divine hand. Neither was
   it upon scenes of earth that he was looking when he spoke of the whole
   creation groaning together until now.' Whatever associations of
   melancholy or pity may attach to places or states of the heavens, or to
   the condition of the inferior animals who seem to suffer for our sakes;
   it is not in these that the Apostle traces the indications of a ruined
   world, but in the misery and distraction of the heart of man. And the
   prospect on which he loves to dwell is not that of the promised land,
   as Moses surveyed it far and wide from the top of Pisgah, but the human
   race itself, the great family in heaven and earth, of which Christ is
   the head, reunited to the God who made it, when there shall be neither
   barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but all one in Christ,' the Apostle
   himself also waiting for the fuller manifestation of the sons of God,
   and sometimes carrying his thoughts yet further to that mysterious
   hour, when the Son shall be subject to him that put all things under
   him, that God may be all in all.'

   When thoughts like these fill the mind, there is little room for
   reflection on the world without. Even the missionary in modern times
   hardly cares to go out of his way to visit a picturesque country or the
   monuments of former ages. He is determined to know one thing only,
   Christ crucified.' Of the beauties of creation, his chief thought is
   that they are the work of God. He does not analyze them by rules of
   taste, or devise material out of them for literary discourse. The
   Apostle, too, in the abundance of his revelations, has an eye turned
   inward on another world. It is not that he is dead to Nature, but that
   it is out of his way; not as in the Old Testament, the veil or frame of
   the Divine presence, but only the background of human nature and of
   revelation. When speaking of the heathen, it comes readily into his
   thoughts; it never seems to occur to him in connexion with the work of
   Christ. He does not read mysteries in the leaves of the forest, or see
   the image of the cross in the forms of the tree, or find miracles of
   design in the complex structures of animal life. His thoughts
   respecting the works of God are simpler, and also deeper. The child and
   the philosopher alike hear a witness in the first chapter of the
   Romans, or in the discourse of the Apostle on Mars' Hill, or at Lystra,
   which the mystic fancies of Neoplatonism, and the modern evidences of
   natural theology, fail to convey to them.

   § 3.

   In the common use of language natural religion is opposed to revealed.
   That which men know, or seem to know, of themselves, which if the
   written word were to be destroyed would still remain, which existed
   prior to revelation, and which might be imagined to survive it, which
   may be described as general rather than special religion, as
   Christianity rationalized into morality, which speaks of God, but not
   of Christ--of nature, but not of grace--has been termed natural
   religion. Philosophical arguments for the being of a God are
   comprehended under the same term. It is also used to denote a supposed
   primitive or patriarchal religion, whether based on a primaeval
   revelation or not, from which the mythologies or idolatries of the
   heathen world are conceived to be offshoots.

   The line has been sometimes sharply drawn between natural and revealed
   religion; in other ages of the world, the two have been allowed to
   approximate, or be almost identified with each other. Natural religion
   has been often depressed with a view to the exaltation of revealed; the
   feebleness of the one seeming to involve a necessity for the other.
   Natural religion has sometimes been regarded as the invention of human
   reason; at other times, as the decaying sense of a primaeval
   revelation. Yet natural and revealed religion, in the sense in which it
   is attempted to oppose them, are contrasts rather of words than of
   ideas. For who can say where the one begins and the other ends? Who
   will determine how many elements of Scriptural truth enter into modern
   philosophy or the opinions of the world in general? Who can analyze how
   much, even in a Christian country, is really of heathen origin?
   Revealed religion is ever taking the form of the voice of Nature
   within; experience is ever modifying our application of the truths of
   Scripture. The ideal of Christian life is more easily distinguishable
   from the ideal of Greek and Roman, than the elements of opinion and
   belief which have come from a Christian source are from those which
   come from a secular or heathen one. Education itself tends to
   obliterate the distinction. The customs, laws, principles of a
   Christian nation may be regarded either as a compromise between the
   two, or as a harmony of them. We cannot separate the truths of
   Christianity from Jewish or heathen anticipations of them; nor can we
   say how far the common sense or morality of the present day is
   indirectly dependent on the Christian religion.

   And if, turning away from the complexity of human life in our own age
   to the beginning of things, we try to conceive revelation in its purity
   before it came into contact with other influences, or mingled in the
   great tide of political and social existence, we are still unable to
   distinguish between natural and revealed religion. Our difficulty is
   like the old Aristotelian question, how to draw the line between the
   moral and intellectual faculties. Let us imagine a first moment at
   which revelation came into the world; there must still have been some
   prior state which made revelation possible: in other words, revealed
   religion presupposes natural. The mind was not a tabula rasa, on which
   the characters of truth had to be inscribed; that is a mischievous
   notion, which only perplexes our knowledge of the origin of things,
   whether in individuals or in the race. If we say that this prior state
   is a Divine preparation for the giving of the Law of Moses, or the
   spread of Christianity, the difference becomes one of degree which
   admits of no sharp contrast. Revealed religion has already taken the
   place of natural, and natural religion extended itself into the
   province of revealed. Many persons who are fond of discovering traces
   of revelation in the religions of the Gentile world, resent the
   intrusion of natural elements into Scripture or Christianity. Natural
   religion they are willing to see identified with revealed, but not
   revealed with natural; all Nature may be a miracle, but miracles are
   not reducible to the course of Nature. But here is only a play between
   words which derive their meaning from contrast; the phenomena are the
   same, but we read them by a different light. And sometimes it may not
   be without advantage to lay aside the two modes of expression, and
   think only of that increasing purpose which through the ages ran.'
   Religious faith strikes its roots deeper into the past, and wider over
   the world, when it acknowledges Nature as well as Scripture.

   But although the opposition of natural and revealed religion is an
   opposition of abstractions, to which no facts really correspond, the
   term natural religion may be conveniently used to describe that aspect
   or point of view in which religion appears when separated from Judaism
   or Christianity. It will embrace all conceptions of religion or
   morality which are not consciously derived from the Old or New
   Testament. The favourite notion of a common or patriarchal religion
   need not be excluded. Natural religion, in this comprehensive sense,
   may be divided into two heads, which the ambiguity of the word nature
   has sometimes helped to confuse. First, (i.) the religion of nature
   before revelation, such as may be supposed to have existed among the
   patriarchs, or to exist still among primitive peoples, who have not yet
   been enlightened by Christianity, or debased by idolatry; such (ii.)
   more truly, as the religions of the Gentile world were and are.
   Secondly, the religion of nature in a Christian country; either the
   evidences of religion which are derived from a source independent of
   the written word, or the common sense of religion and morality, which
   affords a rule of life to those who are not the subjects of special
   Christian influences.

   i. Natural religion in the first sense is an idea and not a fact. The
   same tendency in man which has made him look fondly on a golden age,
   has made him look back also to a religion of nature. Like the memory of
   childhood, the thought of the past has a strange power over us;
   imagination lends it a glory which is not its own. What can be more
   natural than that the shepherd, wandering over the earth beneath the
   wide heavens, should ascend in thought to the throne of the Invisible?
   There is a refreshment to the fancy in thinking of the morning of the
   world's day, when the sun arose pure and bright, ere the clouds of
   error darkened the earth. Everywhere, as a fact, the first inhabitants
   of earth of whom history has left a memorial are sunk in helpless
   ignorance. Yet there must have been a time, it is conceived, of which
   there are no memorials, earlier still; when the Divine image was not
   yet lost, when men's wants were few and their hearts innocent, ere
   cities had taken the place of fields, or art of nature. The revelation
   of God to the first father of the human race must have spread itself in
   an ever-widening circle to his posterity. We pierce through one layer
   of superstition to another, in the hope of catching the light beyond,
   like children digging to find the sun in the bosom of the earth.

   The origin of an error so often illustrates the truth, that it is worth
   while to pause for an instant and consider the source of this fallacy,
   which in all ages has exerted a great influence on mankind, reproducing
   itself in many different forms among heathen as well as Christian
   writers. In technical language, it might be described as the fallacy of
   putting what is intelligible in the place of what is true. It is easy
   to draw an imaginary picture of a golden or pastoral age, such as
   poetry has always described it. The mode of thought is habitual and
   familiar, the phrases which delineate it are traditional, handed on
   from one set of poets to another, repeated by one school of theologians
   to the next. It is a different task to imagine the old world as it
   truly was, that is, as it appears to us, dimly yet certainly, by the
   unmistakable indications of language and of mythology. It is hard to
   picture scenes of external nature unlike what we have ever beheld: but
   it is harder far so to lay aside ourselves as to imagine an inner world
   unlike our own, forms of belief, not simply absurd, but indescribable
   and unintelligible to us. No one, probably, who has not realized the
   differences of the human mind in different ages and countries, either
   by contact with heathen nations or the study of old language and
   mythology, with the help of such a parallel as childhood offers to the
   infancy of the world, will be willing to admit them in their full
   extent.

   Instead of this difficult and laborious process, we readily conceive of
   man in the earliest stages of society as not different, but only less
   than we are. We suppose him deprived of the arts, unacquainted with the
   truths of Christianity, without the knowledge obtained from books, and.
   yet only unlike us in the simplicity of his tastes and habitudes. We
   generalize what we are ourselves, and drop out the particular
   circumstances and details of our lives, and then suppose Ourselves to
   have before us the dweller in Mesopotamia in the days of Abraham, or
   the patriarchs going down to gather corn in Egypt. This imaginary
   picture of a patriarchal religion has had such charms for some minds,
   that they have hoped to see it realized on the wreck of Christianity
   itself. They did not perceive that they were deluding themselves with a
   vacant dream which has never yet filled the heart of man.

   Philosophers have illustrated the origin of government by a picture of
   mankind meeting together in a large plain, to determine the rights of
   governors and subjects; in like manner we may assist imagination, by
   conceiving the multitude of men with their tribes, races, features,
   languages, convoked in the plains of the East, to hear from some
   inspired legislator as Moses, or from the voice of God himself, a
   revelation about God and nature, and their future destiny; such a
   revelation in the first day of the world's history as the day of
   judgement will be at the last. Let us fix our minds, not on the Giver
   of the revelation, but on the receivers of it. Must there not have been
   in them some common sense, or faculty, or feeling, which made them
   capable of receiving it? Must there not have been an apprehension which
   made it a revelation to them? Must they not all first have been of one
   language and one speech? And, what is implied by this, must they not
   all have had one mental structure, and received the same impressions
   from external objects, the same lesson from nature? Or, to put the
   hypothesis in another form, suppose that by some electric power the
   same truth could have been made to sound in the ears and flash before
   the eyes of all, would they not have gone their ways, one to tents,
   another to cities; one to be a tiller of the ground, another to be a
   feeder of sheep; one to be a huntsman, another to be a warrior; one to
   dwell in woods and forests, another in boundless plains; one in
   valleys, one on mountains, one beneath the liquid heaven of Greece and
   Asia, another in the murky regions of the north? And amid all this
   diversity of habits, occupations, scenes, climates, what common truth
   of religion could we expect to remain while man was man, the creature
   in a great degree of outward circumstances? Still less reason would
   there be to expect the preservation of a primaeval truth throughout the
   world, if we imagine the revelation made, not to the multitude of men,
   but to a single individual, and not committed to writing for above two
   thousand years.

   ii. The theory of a primitive tradition, common to all mankind, has
   only to be placed distinctly before the mind, to make us aware that it
   is the fabric of a vision. But, even if it were conceivable, it would
   be inconsistent with facts. Ancient history says nothing of a general
   religion, but of particular national ones; of received beliefs about
   places and persons, about animal life, about the sun, moon, and stars,
   about the Divine essence permeating the world, about gods in the
   likeness of men appearing in battles and directing the course of
   states, about the shades below, about sacrifices, purifications,
   initiations, magic, mysteries. These were the religions of nature,
   which in historical times have received from custom also a second
   nature. Early poetry shows us the same religions in a previous stage,
   while they are still growing, and fancy is freely playing around the
   gods of its own creation. Language and mythology carry us a step
   further back, into a mental world yet more distant and more unlike our
   own. That world is a prison of sense, in which outward objects take the
   place of ideas; in which morality is a fact of nature, and wisdom at
   one entrance quite shut out.' Human beings in that pre-historic age
   seem to have had only a kind of limited intelligence; they were the
   slaves, as we should say, of association. They were rooted in
   particular spots, or wandered up and down upon the earth, confusing
   themselves and God and nature, gazing timidly on the world around,
   starting at their very shadows, and seeing in all things a superhuman
   power at the mercy of which they were. They had no distinction of body
   and soul, mind and matter, physical and moral. Their conceptions were
   neither here nor there; neither sensible objects, nor symbols of the
   unseen. Their gods were very near; the neighbouring hill or passing
   stream, brute matter as we regard it, to them a divinity, because it
   seemed inspired with a life like their own. They could not have formed
   an idea of the whole earth, much less of the God who made it. Their
   mixed modes of thought, their figures of speech, which are not figures,
   their personifications of nature, their reflections of the individual
   upon the world, and of the world upon the individual, the omnipresence
   to them of the sensuous and visible, indicate an intellectual state
   which it is impossible for us, with our regular divisions of thought,
   even to conceive. We must raze from the table of the mind their
   language, ere they could become capable of a universal religion.

   But although we find no vestiges of a primaeval revelation, and cannot
   imagine how such a revelation could have been possible consistently
   with those indications of the state of man which language and mythology
   supply, it is true, nevertheless, that the primitive peoples of mankind
   have a religious principle common to all. Religion, rather than reason,
   is the faculty of man in the earliest stage of his existence. Reverence
   for powers above him is the first principle which raises the individual
   out of himself; the germ of political order, and probably also of
   social life. It is the higher necessity of nature, as hunger and the
   animal passions are the lower. The clay' falls before the rising dawn;
   it may stumble over stocks and stones; but it is struggling upwards
   into a higher day. The worshipper is drawn as by a magnet to some
   object out of himself. He is weak and must have a god; he has the
   feeling of a slave towards his master, of a child towards its parents,
   of the lower animals towards himself. The being whom he serves is, like
   himself, passionate and capricious; he sees him starting up everywhere
   in the unmeaning accidents of life. The good which he values himself he
   attributes to him; there is no proportion in his ideas; the great power
   of nature is the lord also of sheep and oxen. Sometimes, with childish
   joy, he invites the god to drink of his beverage or eat of his food; at
   other times, the orgies which he enacts before him, lead us seriously
   to ask the question whether religion may not in truth have been a kind
   of madness.' He propitiates him and is himself soothed and comforted;
   again he is at his mercy, and propitiates him again. So the dream of
   life is rounded to the poor human creature: incapable as he is of
   seeing his true Father, religion seems to exercise over him a fatal
   overpowering influence; the religion of nature we cannot call it, for
   that would of itself lead to a misconception, but the religion of the
   place in which he lives, of the objects which he sees, of the tribe to
   which he belongs, of the animal forms which range in the wilds around
   him, mingling strangely with the witness of his own spirit that there
   is in the world a being above him.

   Out of this troubled and perplexed state of the human fancy the great
   religions of the world arose, all of them in different degrees
   affording a rest to the mind, and reducing to rule and measure the
   wayward impulses of human nature. All of them had a history in
   antecedent ages; there is no stage in which they do not offer
   indications of an earlier religion which preceded them. Whether they
   came into being, like some geological formations, by slow deposits, or,
   like others, by the shock of an earthquake, that is, by some convulsion
   and settlement of the human mind, is a question which may be suggested,
   but cannot be answered. The Hindoo Pantheon, even in the antique form
   in which the world of deities is presented in the Vedas, implies a
   growth of fancy and ceremonial which may have continued for thousands
   of years. Probably at a much earlier period than we are able to trace
   them, religions, like languages, had their distinctive characters with
   corresponding differences in the first rude constitution of society. As
   in the ease of languages, it is a fair subject of inquiry, whether they
   do not all mount up to some elementary type in which they were more
   nearly allied to sense; a primaeval religion, in which we may imagine
   the influence of nature was analogous to the first impressions of the
   outward world on the infant's wandering eyesight, and the earliest
   worship may be compared with the first use of signs or stammering of
   speech. Such a religion we may conceive as springing from simple
   instinct; yet an instinct higher, even in its lowest degree, than the
   instinct of the animal creation; in which the fear of nature combined
   with the assertion of sway over it, which had already a law of
   progress, and was beginning to set bounds to the spiritual chaos. Of
   this aboriginal state we only entertain conjecture;' it is beyond the
   horizon, even when the eye is strained to the uttermost.

   But if the first origin of the heathen religions is in the clouds,
   their decline, though a phenomenon with which we are familiar in
   history, of which in some parts of the world we are living witnesses,
   is also obscure to us. The kind of knowledge that we have of them is
   like our knowledge of the ways of animals; we see and observe, but we
   cannot get inside them; we cannot think 4:n feel with their
   worshippers. Most or all of them are in a state of decay; they have
   lost their life or creative power; once adequate to the wants of man,
   they have ceased to be so for ages. Naturally we should imagine that
   the religion itself would pass away when its meaning was no longer
   understood; that with the spirit, the letter too would die; that when
   the circumstances of a nation changed, the rites of worship to which
   they had given birth would be forgotten. The reverse is the fact. Old
   age affords examples of habits which become insane and inveterate at a
   time when they have no longer an object; that is an image of the
   antiquity of religions. Modes of worship, rules of purification, set
   forms of words, cling with a greater tenacity when they have no meaning
   or purpose. The habit of a week or a month may be thrown off; not the
   habit of a thousand years. The hand of the past lies heavily on the
   present in all religions; in the East it is a yoke which has never been
   shaken off. Empire, freedom, among the educated classes belief may pass
   away, and yet the routine of ceremonial continues; the political glory
   of a religion may be set at the time when its power over the minds of
   men is most ineradicable.

   One of our first inquiries in reference to the elder religions of the
   world is how we may adjust them to our own moral and religious ideas.
   Moral elements seem at first sight to be wholly wanting in them. In the
   modern sense of the term, they are neither moral nor immoral, but
   natural; they have no idea of right and wrong, as distinct from the
   common opinion or feeling of their age and country. No action in Homer,
   however dishonourable or treacherous, calls forth moral reprobation.
   Neither gods nor men are expected to present any ideal of justice or
   virtue; their power or splendour may be the theme of the poet's verse,
   not their truth or goodness. The only principle on which the Homeric
   deities reward mortals, is in return for gifts and sacrifices, or from
   personal attachment. A later age made a step forwards in morality and
   backwards at the same time; it acquired clearer ideas of right and
   wrong, but found itself encumbered with conceptions of fate and
   destiny. The vengeance of the Eumenides has but a rude analogy with
   justice; the personal innocence of the victim whom the gods pursued is
   a part of the interest, in some instances of Greek tragedy. Higher and
   holier thoughts of the Divine nature appear in Pindar and Sophocles,
   and philosophy sought to make religion and mythology the vehicles of
   moral truth. But it was no part of their original meaning.

   Yet, in a lower sense, it is true that the heathen religions, even in
   their primitive form, are not destitute of morality. Their morality is
   unconscious morality, not man a law to himself,' but man bound by the
   will of a superior being.' Ideas of right and wrong have no place in
   them, yet the first step has been made from sense and appetite into the
   ideal world. He who denies himself something, who offers up a prayer,
   who practises a penance, performs an act, not of necessity, nor of
   choice, but of duty; he does not simply follow the dictates of passion,
   though he may not be able to give a reason for the performance of his
   act. He whose God comes first in his mind has an element within him
   which in a certain degree sanctifies his life by raising him above
   himself. He has some common interest with other men, some unity in
   which he is comprehended with them. There is a preparation for thoughts
   yet higher; he contrasts the permanence of divine and the fleeting
   nature of human things; while the generations of men pass away like
   leaves,' the form of his God is unchanging, and grows not old.

   Differences in modes of thought render it difficult for us to
   appreciate what spiritual elements lurked in disguise among the
   primitive peoples of mankind. Many allowances must-be made before we
   judge them by our own categories. They are not to be censured for
   indecency because they had symbols which to after ages became indecent
   and obscene. Neither were they mere fetish worshippers because they use
   sensuous expressions. Religion, like language, in early ages takes the
   form of sense, but that form of sense is also the embodiment of
   thought. The stream and the animal are not adored by man in heathen
   countries because they are destitute of life or reason, but because
   they seem to him full of mystery and power. It was with another feeling
   than that of a worshipper of matter that the native of the East first
   prostrated himself before the rising sun, in whose beams his nature
   seemed to revive, and his soul to be absorbed. The most childish
   superstitions are often nothing more than misunderstood relics of
   antiquity. There are the remains of fetishism in the charms and cures
   of Christian countries; no one regards the peasant who uses them as a
   fetish worshipper. Many other confusions have their parallel among
   ourselves; if we only knew it. For indeed our own ideas in religion, as
   in everything else, seem clearer to us than they really are, because
   they are our own. To expect the heathen religions to conform to other
   modes of thought, is as if the inhabitant of one country were to
   complain of the inhabitant of another for not speaking the same
   language with him. Our whole attitude towards nature is different from
   theirs: to us all is law;' to them it was all life and fancy,
   inconsecutive as a dream. Nothing is more deeply fixed to us than the
   dualism of body and soul, mind and matter; they knew of no such
   distinction. But we cannot infer from this a denial of the existence of
   mind or soul; because they use material images, it would be ridiculous
   to describe the Psalmist or the prophet Isaiah as materialists; whether
   in heathen poets or in the Jewish Scriptures, such language belongs to
   an intermediate state, which has not yet distinguished the spheres of
   the spiritual and the sensuous. Childhood has been often used as the
   figure of such a state, but the figure is only partially true, for the
   childhood of the human race is the childhood of grown up men, and in
   the child of the nineteenth century there is a piece also of the man of
   the nineteenth century. Less obvious differences in speech and thought
   are more fallacious. The word God' means something as dissimilar among
   ourselves and the Greeks as can possibly be imagined; even in Greek
   alone the difference of meaning can hardly be exaggerated. It includes
   beings as unlike each other as the muscular, eating and drinking
   deities of Homer, and the abstract Being of Parmenides, or the Platonic
   idea of good. All religions of the world use it, however different
   their conceptions of God may be--poly. theistic, pantheistic,
   monotheistic: it is universal, and also individual; or rather, from
   being universal, it has become individual, a logical process which has
   quickened and helped to develop the theological one. Other words, such
   as prayer, sacrifice, expiation, in like manner vary in meaning with
   the religion of which they are the expression. The Homeric sacrifice is
   but a feast of gods and men, destitute of any sacrificial import. Under
   expiations for sin are included two things which to us are distinct,
   atonement for moral guilt and accidental pollution. Similar ambiguities
   occur in the ideas of a future life. The sapless ghosts in Homer are
   neither souls nor bodies, but a sort of shadowy beings. A like
   uncertainty extends in the Eastern religions to some of the first
   principles of thought and being: whether the negative is not also a
   positive; whether the mind of man is not also God; whether this world
   is not another; whether privation of existence may not in some sense be
   existence still.

   These are a few of the differences for which we have to allow in a
   comparison of our own and other times and countries. We must say to
   ourselves, at every step, human nature in that age was unlike the human
   nature with which we are acquainted, in language, in modes of thought,
   in morality, in its conception of the world. Yet it was more like than
   these differences alone would lead us to suppose. The feelings of men
   draw nearer than their thoughts; their natural affections are more
   uniform than their religious systems. Marriage, burial, worship, are at
   least common to all nations. There never has been a time in which the
   human race was absolutely without social laws; in which there was no
   memory of the past; no reverence for a higher power. More defined
   religious ideas, where the understanding comes into play, grow more
   different; it is by comparison they are best explained; like natural
   phenomena, they derive their chief light from analogy with each other.
   Travelling in thought from China, by way of India, Persia, and Egypt,
   to the northern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, we distinguish a
   succession of stages in which the worship of nature is developed; in
   China as the rule or form of political life, almost grovelling on the
   level of sense; in India rising into regions of thought and fancy, and
   allowing a corresponding play in the institutions and character of the
   people; in Egypt wrapping itself in the mystery of antiquity, becoming
   the religion of death and of the past; in Persia divided between light
   and darkness, good and evil, the upper and the under world; in
   Phoenicia, fierce and licentious, imbued with the spirit of conquest
   and colonization. These are the primary strata of the religions of
   mankind, often shifting their position, and sometimes overlapping each
   other; they are distinguished from the secondary strata, as the
   religions of nations from the inspirations of individuals. Thrown into
   the form of abstraction, they express the various degrees of
   distinctness with which man realizes his own existence or that of a
   Divine Being and the relations between them. But they are also powers
   which have shaped the course of events in the world. The secret is
   contained in them, why one nation has been free, another a slave; why
   one nation has dwelt like ants upon a hillock, another has swept over
   the earth; why one nation has given up its life almost without a
   struggle, while another has been hewn limb from limb in the conflict
   with its conquerors. All these religions contributed to the polytheism
   of Greece; some elements derived from them being absorbed in the first
   origin of the Greek religion and language, others acting by later
   contact, some also by contrast.


   Nature through five cycles ran,

   And in the sixth she moulded man.'

   We may conclude this portion of our subject with a few remarks on the
   Greek and Roman religions, which have a peculiar interest to us for
   several reasons; first, because they have exercised a vast influence on
   modern Europe, the one through philosophy, the other through law, and
   both through literature and poetry; secondly, because, almost alone of
   the heathen religions, they came into contact with early Christianity;
   thirdly, because they are the religions of ancient, as Christianity is
   of modern civilization.

   The religion of Greece is remarkable for being a literature as well as
   a religion. Its deities are nameless' to us before Homer; to the Greek
   himself it began with the Olympic family. Whatever dim notions existed
   of chaos and primaeval night--of struggles for ascendency between the
   elder and younger gods, these fables are buried out of sight before
   Greek mythology begins. The Greek came forth at the dawn of day,
   himself a youth in the youth of the world, drinking in the life of
   nature at every pore. The form which his religion took was fixed by the
   Homeric poems, which may be regarded as standing in the same relation
   to the religion of Greece as sacred books to other forms of religion.
   It cannot be said that they aroused the conscience of men; the more the
   Homeric poems are considered, the more evident it becomes that they
   have no inner life of morality like Hebrew prophecy, no Divine presence
   of good slowly purging away the mist that fills the heart of man. What
   they implanted, what they preserved in the Greek nation, was not the
   sense of truth or right, but the power of conception and
   expression--harmonies of language and thought which enabled man to
   clothe his ideas in forms of everlasting beauty. They stamped the Greek
   world as the world of art; its religion became the genius of art. And
   more and more in successive generations, with the co-operation of some
   political causes, the hand of art impressed itself on religion; in
   poetry, in sculpture, in architecture, in festivals and dramatic
   contests, until in the artistic phase of human life the religious is
   absorbed. And the form of man, and the intellect of man, as if in
   sympathy with this artistic development, attained a symmetry and power
   of which the world has never seen the like.

   And yet the great riddle of existence was not answered: its deeper
   mysteries were not explored. The strife of man with himself was healed
   only superficially; there was beauty and proportion everywhere, but no
   true being.' The Jupiter Olympius of Phidias might seem worthy to
   preside over the Greek world which he summoned before him; the Olympic
   victor might stand godlike in the fullness of manly vigour; but where
   could the weak and mean appear? what place was found for the slave or
   captive? Could bereaved parents acquiesce in the sapless shades' of
   Homer, or the moral reflections of Thucydides? Was there not some
   deeper intellectual or spiritual want which man felt, some taste of
   immortality which he had sometimes experienced, which made him
   dissatisfied with his earthly state?

   No religion that failed to satisfy these cries of nature could become
   the religion of mankind. Greek art and Greek literature, losing
   something of their original refinement, spread themselves over the
   Roman world; except Christianity, they have become the richest treasure
   of modern Europe. But the religion of Greece never really grew in
   another soil, or beneath another heaven; it was local and national:
   dependent on the fine and subtle perceptions of the Greek race; though
   it amalgamated its deities with those of Egypt and Rome, its spirit
   never swayed mankind. It has a truer title to permanence and
   universality in the circumstance that it gave birth to philosophy.

   The Greek mind passed, almost unconsciously to itself, from polytheism
   to monotheism. While offering up worship to the Dorian Apollo,
   performing vows to Esculapius, panic-stricken about the mutilation of
   the Hermae, the Greek was also able to think of God as an idea, Theos
   not Zeus. In this generalized or abstract form the Deity presided over
   daily life. Not a century after Anaxagoras had introduced the
   distinction of mind and matter, it was the belief of all philosophic
   inquirers that God was mind, or the object of mind. The Homeric gods
   were beginning to be out of place; philosophy could not distinguish
   Apollo from Athene, or Leto from Here. Unlike the saints of the middle
   ages, they suggested no food for meditation; they were only beautiful
   forms, without individual character. By the side of religion and art,
   speculation had arisen and waxed strong, or rather it might be
   described as the inner life which sprang from their decay. The clouds
   of mythology hung around it; its youth was veiled in forms of sense; it
   was itself a new sort of poetry or religion. Gradually it threw off the
   garment of sense; it revealed a world of ideas. It is impossible for us
   to conceive the intensity of these ideas in their first freshness; they
   were not ideas, but gods, penetrating into the soul of the disciple,
   sinking into the mind of the human race; objects, not of speculation
   only, but of faith and love. To the old Greek religion, philosophy
   might be said to stand in a relation not wholly different from that
   which the New Testament bears to the Old; the one putting a spiritual
   world in the place of a temporal, the other an intellectual in the
   place of a sensuous; and to mankind in general it taught an everlasting
   lesson, not indeed that of the Gospel of Christ, but one in a lower
   degree necessary for man, enlarging the limits of the human mind
   itself, and providing the instruments of every kind of knowledge.

   What the religion of Greece was to philosophy and art, that the Roman
   religion may be said to have been to political and social life. It was
   the religion of the family; the religion also of the empire of the
   world. Beginning in rustic simplicity, the traces of which it ever
   afterwards retained, it grew with the power of the Roman state, and
   became one with its laws. No fancy or poetry moulded the forms of the
   Roman gods; they are wanting in character and hardly distinguishable
   from one another. Not what they were, but their worship, is the point
   of interest about them. Those inanimate beings occasionally said a
   patriotic word at some critical juncture of the Roman affairs, but they
   had no attributes or qualities; they are the mere impersonation of the
   needs of the state. They were easily identified in civilized and
   literary times with the Olympic deities, but the transformation was
   only superficial Greece never conquered the religion of its masters.
   Great as was the readiness in later times to admit the worship of
   foreign deities, endless as were the forms of private superstition,
   these intrusions never weakened or broke the legal hold of the Roman
   religion. It was truly the established' religion. It represented the
   greatness and power of Rome. The deification of the Emperor, though
   disagreeable to the more spiritual and intellectual feelings of that
   age of the world, was its natural development. While Rome lasted the
   Roman religion lasted; like some vast fabric which the destroyers of a
   great city are unable wholly to demolish, it continued, though in
   ruins, after the irruption of the Goths, and has exercised, through the
   medium of the civil law, a power over modern Europe.

   More interesting for us than the pursuit of this subject into further
   details is the inquiry, in what light the philosopher regarded the
   religious system within the circle of which he lived; the spirit of
   which animated Greek and Roman poetry, the observance of which was the
   bond of states. In the age of the Antonines, more than six hundred
   years had passed away since the Athenian people first became conscious
   of the contrariety of the two elements; and yet the wedge which
   philosophy had inserted in the world seemed to have made no impression
   on the deeply rooted customs of mankind. The ever-flowing stream of
   ideas as too feeble to overthrow the entrenchments of antiquity. The
   course of individuals might be turned by philosophy; it was not
   intended to reconstruct the world. It looked on and watched, seeming,
   in the absence of any real progress, to lose its original force.
   Paganism tolerated; it had nothing to fear. Socrates and Plato in an
   earlier, Seneca and Epictetus in a later age, acquiesced in this
   heathen world, unlike as it was to their own intellectual conceptions
   of a divine religion. No Greek or Roman philosopher was also a great
   reformer of religion. Some, like Socrates, were punctual in the
   observance of religious rites, paying their vows to the gods, fearful
   of offending against the letter as well as the spirit of divine
   commands; they thought it was hardly worth while to rationalize the
   Greek mythology, when there were so many things nearer home to do.
   Others, like the Epicureans, transferred the gods into a distant
   heaven, where they were no more heard of; some, like the Stoics, sought
   to awaken a deeper sense of moral responsibility. There were devout
   men, such as Plutarch, who thought with reverence of the past, seeking
   to improve the old heathen faith, and also lamenting its decline; there
   were scoffers, too, like Lucian, who found inexhaustible amusement in
   the religious follies of mankind. Others, like Herodotus in earlier
   ages, accepted with childlike faith the more serious aspect of
   heathenism, or contented themselves, like Thucydides, with ignoring it.
   The world, wholly given to idolatry,' was a strange inconsistent
   spectacle to those who were able to reflect, which was seen in many
   points of view. The various feelings with which different classes of
   men regarded the statues, temples, sacrifices, oracles, and festivals
   of the gods, with which they looked upon the conflict of religions
   meeting on the banks of the Tiber, are not exhausted in the
   epigrammatic formula of the modern historian: All the heathen religions
   were looked upon by the vulgar as equally true, by the philosopher as
   equally false, by the magistrate as equally useful.'

   Such was the later phase of the religion of nature, with which
   Christianity came into conflict. It had supplied some of the needs of
   men by assisting to build up the fabric of society and law. It had left
   room for others to find expression in philosophy or art. But it was a
   world divided against itself. It contained two nations or opinions
   struggling in its womb;' the nation or opinion of the many, and the
   nation or opinion of the few. It was bound together in the framework of
   law or custom, yet its morality fell below the natural feelings of
   mankind, and its religious spirit was confused and weakened by the
   admixture of foreign superstitions. It was a world of which it is not
   difficult to find traces that it was self-condemned. It might be
   compared to a fruit, the rind of which was hard and firm, while within
   it was soft and decaying. Within this outer rind or circle, for two
   centuries and a half, Christianity was working; at last it appeared
   without, itself the seed or kernel of a new organization. That when the
   conflict was over, and the world found itself Christian, many elements
   of the old religion still remained, and reasserted themselves in
   Christian forms; that the ghost of the dead Roman Empire' lingered
   about the grave thereof;' that Christianity accomplished only
   imperfectly what heathenism failed to do at all, is a result unlike
   pictures that are sometimes drawn, but sadly in accordance with what
   history teaches of mankind and of human nature.

   § 4.

   Natural religion is not only concerned with the history of the
   religions of nature, nor does it only reflect that light of the
   Gentiles' which philosophy imparted; it has to do with the present as
   well as with the past, with Christian as well as heathen countries.
   Revealed religion passes into natural, and natural religion exists side
   by side with revealed; there is a truth independent of Christianity;
   and the daily life of Christian men is very different from the life of
   Christ. This general or natural religion may be compared to a
   wide-spread lake, shallow and motionless, rather than to a living
   water--the overflowing of the Christian faith over a professing
   Christian world, the level of which may be at one time higher or lower;
   it is the religion of custom or prescription, or rather the unconscious
   influence of religion on the minds of men in general; it includes also
   the speculative idea of religion when taken off the Christian
   foundation. Natural religion, in this modern sense, has a relation both
   to philosophy and life. That is to say (1), it is a theory of religion
   which appeals to particular evidences for the being of a God, though
   resting, perhaps more safely, on the general conviction that this
   universal frame cannot want a mind.' But it has also a relation to life
   and practice (2), for it is the religion of the many; the average, as
   it may be termed, of religious feeling in a Christian land, the leaven
   of the Gospel hidden in the world. St. Paul speaks of those who knowing
   not the law are a law unto themselves.' Experience seems to show that
   something of the same kind must be acknowledged in Christian as well as
   in heathen countries; which may be conveniently considered under the
   head of natural religion.

   Arguments for the being of a God are of many kinds. There are arguments
   from final causes, and arguments from first causes, and arguments from
   ideas; logical forms, as they appear to be, in which different
   metaphysical schools mould their faith. Of the first sort the following
   may be taken as an instance:--A person walking on the seashore finds a
   watch or other piece of mechanism; he observes its parts, and their
   adaptation to each other; he sees the watch in motion, and comprehends
   the aim of the whole. In the formation of that senseless material he
   perceives that which satisfies him that it is the work of intelligence,
   or, in other words, the marks of design. And looking from the watch to
   the world around him, he seems to perceive innumerable ends, and
   innumerable actions tending to them, in the composition of the world
   itself, and in the structure of plants and animals. Advancing a step
   further, he asks himself the question, why he should not acknowledge
   the like marks of design in the moral world also; in passions and
   actions, and in the great end of life. Of all there is the same account
   to be given--the machine of the world,' of which God is the Maker.

   This is the celebrated argument from final causes for the being of a
   God, the most popular of the arguments of natural religion, partly
   because it admits of much ingenious illustration, and also because it
   is tangible and intelligible. Ideas of a Supreme Being must be given
   through something, for it is impossible that we should know Him as He
   is. And the truest representation that we can form of God is, in one
   sense, that which sets forth His nature most vividly; yet another
   condition must also be remembered, viz. that this representation ought
   not only to be the most distinct, but the highest and holiest possible.
   Because we cannot see Him as He is, that is no reason for attributing
   to Him the accidents of human personality. And, in using figures of
   speech, we are bound to explain to all who are capable of
   understanding, that we speak in a figure only, and to remind them that
   names by which we describe the being or attributes of God need a
   correction in the silence of thought. Even logical categories may give
   as false a notion of the Divine nature in our own age, as graven images
   in the days of the patriarchs. However legitimate or perhaps necessary
   the employment of them may be, we must place ourselves not below, but
   above them.

   (a) In the argument from final causes, the work of the Creator is
   compared to a work of art. Art is a poor figure of nature; it has no
   freedom or luxuriance. Between the highest work of art and the lowest
   animal or vegetable production, there is an interval which will never
   be spanned. The miracle of life derives no illustration from the
   handicraftsman putting his hand to the chisel, or anticipating in idea
   the form which he is about to carve. More truly might we reason, that
   what the artist is, the God of nature is not. For all the processes of
   nature are unlike the processes of art. If, instead of a watch, or some
   other piece of curious and exquisite workmanship, we think of a
   carpenter and a table, the force of the argument seems to vanish, and
   the illustration becomes inappropriate and unpleasing. The ingenuity
   and complexity of the structure, and not the mere appearance of design,
   makes the watch a natural image of the creation of the world.

   (b) But not only does the conception of the artist supply no worthy
   image of the Creator and His work; the idea of design which is given by
   it requires a further correction before it can be transferred to
   nature. The complication of the world around us is quite different from
   the complexity of the watch. It is not a regular and finite structure,
   but rather infinite in irregularity; which instead of design often
   exhibits absence of design, such as we cannot imagine any architect of
   the world contriving; the construction of which is far from appearing,
   even to our feeble intelligence, the best possible, though it, and all
   things in it, are very good. If we fix our minds on this very phrase
   the machine of the world,' we become aware that it is unmeaning to us.
   The watch is separated and isolated from other matter; dependent indeed
   on one or two general laws of nature, but otherwise cut off from things
   around. But nature, the more we consider it, the more does one part
   appear to be linked with another; there is no isolation here; the
   plants grow in the soil which has been preparing for them through a
   succession of geological eras, they are fed by the rain and nourished
   by light and air; the animals depend for their life on all inferior
   existences.

   (g) This difference between art and nature leads us to observe another
   defect in the argument from final causes--that, instead of putting the
   world together, it takes it to pieces. It fixes our minds on those
   parts of the world which exhibit marks of design, and withdraws us from
   those in which marks of design seem to fail. There are formations in
   nature, such as the hand, which have a kind of mechanical beauty, and
   show in a striking way, even to an uneducated person, the wonder and
   complexity of creation. In like manner we feel a momentary surprise in
   finding out, through the agency of a microscope, that the minutest
   creatures have their fibres, tissues, vessels. And yet the knowledge of
   this is but the most fragmentary and superficial knowledge of nature;
   it is the wonder in which philosophy begins, very different from the
   comprehension of this universal frame in all its complexity and in all
   its minuteness. And from this elementary notion of nature, we seek to
   form an idea of the Author of nature. As though God were in the animal
   frame and not also in the dust to which it turns; in the parts, and not
   equally in the whole; in the present world, and not also in the
   antecedent ages which have prepared for its existence.

   (d) Again, this teleological argument for the being of God gives an
   erroneous idea of the moral government of the world. For it leads us to
   suppose that all things are tending to some end; that there is no
   prodigality or waste, but that all things are, and are made, in the
   best way possible. Our faith must be tried to find a use for barren
   deserts, for venomous reptiles, for fierce wild beasts, nay, for the
   sins and miseries of mankind. Nor does there seem to be any resting
   place,' until the world and all things in it are admitted to have some
   end impressed upon them by the hand of God, but unseen to us.
   Experience is cast aside while our meditations lead us to conceive the
   world under this great form of a final cause. All that is in nature is
   best; all that is in human life is best. And yet every one knows
   instances in which nature seems to fail of its end--in which life has
   been cut down like a flower, and trampled under foot of man.

   (e) There is another way in which the argument from final causes is
   suggestive of an imperfect conception of the Divine Being. It presents
   God to us exclusively in one aspect, not as a man, much less as a
   spirit holding communion with our spirit, but only as an artist. We
   conceive of Him, as in the description of the poet, standing with
   compasses over sea and land, and designing the wondrous work. Does not
   the image tend to make the spiritual creation an accident of the
   material? For although it is possible, as Bishop Butler has shown, to
   apply the argument from final causes, as a figure of speech, to the
   habits and feelings, this adaptation is unnatural, and open even to
   greater objections than its application to the physical world. For how
   can we distinguish true final causes from false ones? how can we avoid
   confusing what ought to be with what is--the fact with the law?

   (z) If we look to the origin of the notion of a final cause, we shall
   feel still further indisposed to make it the category under which we
   sum up the working of the Divine Being in creation. As Aristotle, who
   probably first made a philosophical use of the term, says, it is
   transferred from mind to matter; in other words, it clothes facts in
   our ideas. Lord Bacon offers another warning against the employment of
   final causes in the service of religion; they are like the vestals
   consecrated to God, and are barren.' They are a figure of speech which
   adds nothing to our knowledge. When applied to the Creator, they are a
   figure of a figure; that is to say, the figurative conception of the
   artist embodied or idealized in his work, is made the image of the
   Divine Being. And no one really thinks of God in nature under this
   figure of human skill. As certainly as the man who found a watch or
   piece of mechanism on the seashore would conclude, here are marks of
   design, indications of an intelligent artist,' so certainly, if he came
   across the meanest or the highest of the works of nature, would he
   infer, this was not made by man, nor by any human art.' He sees in a
   moment that the seaweed beneath his feet is something different in kind
   from the productions of man. What should lead him to say, that in the
   same sense that man made the watch, God made the seaweed? For the
   seaweed grows by some power of life, and is subject to certain
   physiological laws, like all other vegetable or animal substances. But
   if we say that God created this life, or that where this life ends
   there His creative power begins, our analogy again fails, for God
   stands in a different relation to animal and vegetable life from what
   the artist does to the work of His hands. And, when we think further of
   God, as a Spirit without body, creating all things by His word, or
   rather by His thought, in an instant of time, to whom the plan and
   execution are all one, we become absolutely bewildered in the attempt
   to apply the image of the artist to the Creator of the world.

   These are some of the points in respect of which the argument from
   final causes falls short of that conception of the Divine nature which
   reason is adequate to form. It is the beginning of our knowledge of
   God, not the end. It is suited to the faculties of children rather than
   of those who are of full age. It belongs to a stage of metaphysical
   philosophy, in which abstract ideas were not made the subject of
   analysis; to a time when physical science had hardly learnt to conceive
   the world as a whole. It is a devout thought which may well arise in
   the grateful heart when contemplating the works of creation, but must
   not be allowed to impair that higher intellectual conception which we
   are able to form of a Creator, any more than it should be put in the
   place of the witness of God within.

   Another argument of the same nature for the being of a God is derived
   from first causes, and may be stated as follows:--All things that we
   see are the results or effects of causes, and these again the effects
   of other causes, and so on through an immense series. But somewhere or
   other this series must have a stop or limit; we cannot go back from
   cause to cause without end. Otherwise the series will have no basis on
   which to rest. Therefore there must be a first cause, that is, God.
   This argument is sometimes strengthened by the further supposition that
   the world must have had a beginning, whence it seems to follow, that it
   must have a cause external to itself which made it begin; a principle
   of rest, which is the source of motion to all other things, as ancient
   philosophy would have expressed it--hovering in this as in other
   speculations intermediate between the physical and metaphysical world.

   The difficulty about this argument is much the same as that respecting
   the preceding. So long as we conceive the world under the form of cause
   and effect, and suppose the first link in the chain to be the same with
   those that succeed it, the argument is necessary and natural; we cannot
   escape from it without violence to our reason. Our only doubt will
   probably be, whether we can pass from the notion of a first cause to
   that of an intelligent Creator. But when, instead of resting in the
   word cause,' we go on to the idea, or rather the variety of ideas which
   are signified by the word cause,' the argument begins to dissolve. When
   we say, God is the cause of the world,' in what sense of the word cause
   is this? Is it as life or mind is a pause, or the hammer or hand of the
   workman, or light or air, or any natural substance? Is it in that sense
   of the word cause, in which it is almost identified with the effect? or
   in that sense in which it is wholly external to it? Or when we
   endeavour to imagine or conceive a common cause of the world and all
   things in it, do we not perceive that we are using the word in none of
   these senses; but in a new one, to which life, or mind, or many other
   words, would be at least equally applicable? God is the life of the
   world.' That is a poor and somewhat unmeaning expression to indicate
   the relation of God to the world; yet life is a subtle and wonderful
   power, pervading all things, and in various degrees animating all
   things. God is the mind of the world.' That is still inadequate as an
   expression, even though mind can act where it is not, and its ways are
   past finding out. But when we say, God is the cause of the world,' that
   can be scarcely said to express more than that God stands in some
   relation to the world touching which we are unable to determine whether
   He is in the world or out of it, immanent' in the language of
   philosophy, or transcendent.'

   There are two sources from which these and similar proofs of the being
   of a God are derived: first, analogy; secondly, the logical necessity
   of the human mind. Analogy supplies an image, an illustration. It wins
   for us an imaginary world from the void and formless infinite. But
   whether it does more than this must depend wholly on the nature of the
   analogy. We cannot argue from the seen to the unseen, unless we
   previously know their relation to each other. We cannot say at random
   that another life is the double or parallel of this, and also the
   development of it; we cannot urge the temporary inequality of this
   world as a presumption of the final injustice of another. Who would
   think of arguing from the vegetable to the animal world, except in
   those points where he had already discovered a common principle? Who
   would reason that animal life must follow the laws of vegetation in
   those points which were peculiar to it? Yet many theological arguments
   have this fundamental weakness; they lean on faith for their own
   support; they lower the heavenly to the earthly, and may be used to
   prove anything.

   The other source of these and similar arguments is the logical
   necessity of the human mind. A first cause, a beginning, an infinite
   Being limiting our finite natures, is necessary to our conceptions. We
   have an idea of God, there must be something to correspond to our
   idea,' and so on. The flaw here is equally real, though not so
   apparent. While we dwell within the forms of the understanding and
   acknowledge their necessity, such arguments seem unanswerable. But once
   ask the question, Whence this necessity? was there not a time when the
   human mind felt no such necessity? is the necessity really satisfied?
   or is there not some further logical sequence in which I am involved
   which still remains unanswerable? the whole argument vanishes at once,
   as the chimera of a metaphysical age. The seventeenth and eighteenth
   centuries have been peculiarly fertile in such arguments; the belief in
   which, whether they have any value or not, must not be imposed upon us
   as an article of faith.

   If we say again, that our highest conception must have a true
   existence,' which is the well-known argument of Anselm and Des Cartes
   for the being of God, still this is no more than saying, in a technical
   or dialectical form, that we cannot imagine God without imagining that
   He is. Of no other conception can it be said that it involves
   existence; and hence no additional force is gained by such a mode of
   statement. The simple faith in a Divine Being is cumbered, not
   supported, by evidences derived from a metaphysical system which has
   passed away. It is a barren logic that elicits the more meagre
   conception of existence from the higher one of Divinity. Better for
   philosophy, as well as faith, to think of God at once and immediately
   as Perfect Being.'

   Arguments from first and final causes may be regarded as a kind of
   poetry of natural religion. There are some minds to whom it would be
   impossible to conceive of the relation of God to the world under any
   more abstract form. They, as well as all of us, may ponder in amazement
   on the infinite contrivances of creation. We are all agreed that none
   but a Divine power framed them. We differ only as to whether the Divine
   power is to be regarded as the hand that fashioned, or the intelligence
   that designed them, or an operation inconceivable to us which we dimly
   trace and feebly express in words.

   That which seems to underlie our conception both of first and final
   causes, is the idea of law which we see not broken or intercepted, or
   appearing only in particular spots of nature, but everywhere and in all
   things. All things do not equally exhibit marks of design, but all
   things are equally subject to the operation of law. The highest mark of
   intelligence pervades the whole; no one part is better than another; it
   is all very good.' The absence of design, if we like so to turn the
   phrase, is a part of the design. Even the less comely parts, like the
   plain spaces in a building, have elements of use and beauty. He who has
   ever thought in the most imperfect manner of the universe which modern
   science unveils, needs no evidence that the details of it are incapable
   of being framed by anything short of a Divine power. Art, and nature,
   and science, these three--the first giving us the conception of the
   relation of parts to a whole; the second, of endless variety and
   intricacy, such as no art has ever attained; the third, of uniform laws
   which amid all the changes of created things remain fixed as at the
   first, reaching even to the heavens--are the witnesses of the Creator
   in the external world.

   Nor can it weaken our belief in a Supreme Being, to observe that the
   same harmony and uniformity extend also to the actions of men. Why
   should it be thought a thing incredible that God should give law and
   order to the spiritual, no less than the natural creation? That human
   beings do not thrust or break their ranks;' that the life of nations,
   like that of plants or animals, has a regular growth; that the same
   strata or stages are observable in the religions, no less than the
   languages of mankind, as in the structure of the earth, are strange
   reasons for doubting the Providence of God. Perhaps it is even
   stranger, that those who do not doubt should eye with jealousy the
   accumulation of such facts. Do we really wish that our conceptions of
   God should only be on the level of the ignorant; adequate to the
   passing emotions of human feeling, but to reason inadequate? That
   Christianity is the confluence of many channels of human thought does
   not interfere with its Divine origin. It is not the less immediately
   the word of God because there have been preparations for it in all
   ages, and in many countries.

   The more we take out of the category of chance in the world either of
   nature or of mind, the more present evidence we have of the
   faithfulness of God. We do not need to have a chapter of accidents in
   life to enable us to realize the existence of a personal God, as though
   events which we can account for were not equally His work. Let not use
   or custom so prevail in our minds as to make this higher notion of God
   cheerless or uncomfortable to us. The rays of His presence may still
   warm us, as well as enlighten us. Surely He, in whom we live and move
   and have our being, is nearer to us than He would be if He interfered
   occasionally for our benefit.

   The curtain of the physical world is closing in upon us:' What does
   this mean but that the arms of His intelligence are embracing us on
   every side? We have no more fear of nature; for our knowledge of the
   laws of nature has cast out fear. We know Him as He shows himself in
   them, even as we are known of Him. Do we think to draw near to God by
   returning to that state in which nature seemed to be without law, when
   man cowered like the animals before the storm, and in the meteors of
   the skies and the motions of the heavenly bodies sought to read the
   purposes of God respecting himself? Or shall we rest in that stage of
   the knowledge of nature which was common to the heathen philosophers
   and to the Fathers of the Christian Church? or in that of two hundred
   years ago, ere the laws of the heavenly bodies were discovered? or of
   fifty years ago, before geology had established its truths on sure
   foundations? or of thirty years ago, ere the investigation of old
   language had revealed the earlier stages of the history of the human
   mind. At which of these resting-places shall we pause to renew the
   covenant between Reason and Faith? Rather at none of them, if the first
   condition of a true faith be the belief in all true knowledge.

   To trace our belief up to some primitive revelation, to entangle it in
   a labyrinth of proofs or analogies, will not infix it deeper or elevate
   its character. Why should we be willing to trust the convictions of the
   father of the human race rather than our own, the faith of primitive
   rather than of civilized times Or why should we use arguments about the
   Infinite Being, which, in proportion as they have force, reduce him to
   the level of the finite; and which seem to lose their force in
   proportion as we admit that God's ways are not as our ways, nor His
   thoughts as our thoughts? The belief is strong enough without those
   fictitious supports: it cannot be made stronger with them. While nature
   still presents to us its world of unexhausted wonders; while sin and
   sorrow lead us to walk by faith, and not by sight; while the soul of
   man departs this life not knowing whither it goes; so long will the
   belief endure of an Almighty Creator, from whom we came, to whom we
   return.

   Why, again, should we argue for the immortality of the soul from the
   analogy of the seed and the tree, or the state of human beings before
   and after birth, when the ground of proof in the one case is wanting in
   the other, namely, experience? Because the dead acorn may a century
   hence become a spreading oak, no one would infer that the corrupted
   remains of animals will rise to life in new forms. The error is not in
   the use of such illustrations as figures of speech, but in the
   allegation of them as proofs or evidences after the failure of the
   analogy is perceived. Perhaps it may be said that in popular discourse
   they pass unchallenged; it may be a point of honour that they should be
   maintained, because they are in Paley or Butler. But evidences for the
   many which are not evidences for the few are treacherous props to
   Christianity. They are always liable to come back to us detected, and
   to need some other fallacy for their support.

   Let it be considered, whether the evidences of religion should be
   separated from religion itself. The Gospel has a truth perfectly
   adapted to human nature; its origin and diffusion in the world have a
   history like any other history. But truth does not need evidences of
   the truth, nor does history separate the proof of facts from the facts
   themselves. It was only in the decline of philosophy the Greeks began
   to ask about the criterion of knowledge. What would be thought of an
   historian who should collect all the testimonies on one side of some
   disputed question, and insist on their reception as a political creed?
   Such evidences do not require the hand of some giant infidel to pull
   them down; they fall the moment they are touched. But the Christian
   faith is in its holy place, uninjured by the fall; the truths of the
   existence of God, or of the immortality of the soul, are not periled by
   the observation that some analogies on which they have been supposed to
   rest are no longer tenable. There is no use in attempting to prove by
   the misapplication of the methods of human knowledge, what we ought
   never to doubt.

   There are two things,' says a philosopher of the last century; of which
   it may be said, that the more we think of them, the more they fill the
   soul with awe and wonder--the starry heaven above, and the moral law
   within. I may not regard either as shrouded in darkness, or look for or
   guess at either in what is beyond, out of my sight. I see them right
   before me, and link them at once with the consciousness of my own
   existence. The former of the two begins with place, which I inhabit as
   a member of the outward world, and extends the connexion in which I
   stand with it into immeasurable space; in which are worlds upon worlds,
   and systems upon systems; and so on into the endless times of their
   revolutions, their beginning and continuance. The second begins with my
   invisible self; that is to say, my personality, and presents me in a
   world which has true infinity, but which the lower faculty of the soul
   can hardly scan; with which I know myself to be not only as in the
   world of sight, in an accidental connexion, but in a necessary and
   universal one. The first glance at innumerable worlds annihilates any
   importance which I may attach to myself as an animal structure; whilst
   the matter out of which it is made must again return to the earth
   (itself a mere point in the universe), after it has been endued, one
   knows not how, with the power of life for a little season. The second
   glance exalts me infinitely as an intelligent being, whose personality
   involves a moral law, which reveals in me a life distinct from that of
   the animals, independent of the world of sense. So much at least I may
   infer from the regular determination of my being by this law, which is
   itself infinite, free from the limitations and conditions of this
   present life.'

   So, in language somewhat technical, has Kant described two great
   principles of natural religion. There are two witnesses,' we may add in
   a later strain of reflection, of the being of God; the order of nature
   in the world, and the progress of the mind of man. He is not the order
   of nature, nor the progress of mind, nor both together; but that which
   is above and beyond them; of which they, even if conceived in a single
   instant, are but the external sign, the highest evidences of God which
   we can conceive, but not God himself. The first to the ancient world
   seemed to be the work of chance, or the personal operation of one or
   many Divine beings. We know it to be the result of laws endless in
   their complexity, and yet not the less admirable for their simplicity
   also. The second has been regarded, even in our own day, as a series of
   errors capriciously invented by the ingenuity of individual men. We
   know it to have a law of its own, a continuous order which cannot be
   inverted; not to be confounded with, yet not wholly separate from, the
   law of nature and the will of God. Shall we doubt the world to be the
   creation of a Divine power, only because it is more wonderful than
   could have been conceived by "them of old time;" or human reason to be
   in the image of God, because it too bears the marks of an overruling
   law or intelligence?'

   § 5.

   Natural religion, in the last sense in which we are to consider it,
   carries us into a region of thought more practical, and therefore more
   important, than any of the preceding; it comes home to us; it takes in
   those who are near and dear to us; even ourselves are not excluded from
   it. Under this name, or some other, we cannot refuse to consider a
   subject which involves the religious state of the greater portion of
   mankind, even in a Christian country. Every Sunday the ministers of
   religion set before us the ideal of Christian life; they repeat and
   expand the words of Christ and his Apostles; they speak of the approach
   of death, and of this world as a preparation for a better. It is good
   to be reminded of these things. But there is another aspect of
   Christianity which we must not ignore, the aspect under which
   experience shows it, in our homes and among our acquaintance, on the
   level of human things; the level of education, habit, and circumstances
   on which men are, and on which they will probably remain while they
   live. This latter phase of religion it is our duty to consider, and not
   narrow ourselves to the former only.

   It is characteristic of this subject that it is full of contradictions;
   we say one thing at one time about it, another thing at another. Our
   feelings respecting individuals are different in their lifetime, and
   after their death, as they are nearly related to us, or have no claims
   on our affections. Our acknowledgement of sin in the abstract is more
   willing and hearty than the recognition of particular sins in
   ourselves, or even in others. We readily admit that the world lieth in
   wickedness;' where the world is, or of whom it is made up, we are
   unable to define. Great men seem to be exempt from the religious
   judgement which we pass on our fellows; it does not occur to persons of
   taste to regard them under this aspect; we deal tenderly with them, and
   leave them to themselves and God. And sometimes we rest on outward
   signs of religion; at other times we guard ourselves and others against
   trusting to such signs. And commonly we are ready to acquiesce in the
   standard of those around us, thinking it a sort of impertinence to
   interfere with their religious concerns; at other times we go about the
   world as with a lantern, seeking for the image of Christ among men, and
   are zealous for the good of others, out of season or in season. We need
   not unravel further this tangled web of thoughts and feelings, which
   religion, and affection, and habit, and opinion weave. A few words will
   describe the fact out of which these contradictions arise. It is a side
   of the world from which we are apt to turn away, perhaps hoping to make
   things better by fancying them so, instead of looking at them as they
   really are.

   It is impossible not to observe that innumerable persons--shall we say
   the majority of mankind?--who have a belief in God and immortality,
   have nevertheless hardly any consciousness of the peculiar doctrines of
   the Gospel. They seem to live away from them in the routine of business
   or of society, the common life of all men,' not without a sense of
   right, and a rule of truth and honesty, yet insensible to what our
   Saviour meant by taking up the cross and following Him, or what St.
   Paul meant by being one with Christ.' They die without any great fear
   or lively faith; to the last more interested about concerns of this
   world than about the hope of another. In the Christian sense they are
   neither proud nor humble; they have seldom experienced the sense of
   sin, they have never felt keenly the need of forgiveness. Neither on
   the other hand do they value themselves on their good deeds, or expect
   to be saved by their own merits. Often they are men of high moral
   character; many of them have strong and disinterested attachments, and
   quick human sympathies; sometimes a stoical feeling of uprightness, or
   a peculiar sensitiveness to dishonour. It would be a mistake to say
   they are without religion. They join in its public acts; they are
   offended at profaneness or impiety; they are thankful for the blessings
   of life, and do not rebel against its misfortunes. Such persons meet us
   at every turn. They are those whom we know and associate with; honest
   in their dealings, respectable in their lives, decent in their
   conversation. The Scripture speaks to us of two classes represented by
   the Church and the world, the wheat and the tares, the sheep and the
   goats, the friends and enemies of God. We cannot say in which of these
   two divisions we should find a place for them.

   The picture is a true one, and, if we turn the light round, some of us
   may find in it a resemblance of ourselves no less than of other men.
   Others will include us in the same circle in which we are including
   them. What shall we say to such a state, common as it is to both us and
   them? The fact that we are considering is not the evil of the world,
   but the neutrality of the world, the indifference of the world, the
   inertness of the world. There are multitudes of men and women
   everywhere, who have no peculiarly Christian feelings, to whom, except
   for the indirect influence of Christian institutions, the life and
   death of Christ would have made no difference, and who have,
   nevertheless, the common sense of truth and right almost equally with
   true Christians. You cannot say of them there is none that doeth good;
   no, not one.' The other tone of St. Paul is more suitable, When the
   Gentiles that know not the law do by nature the things contained in the
   law, these not knowing the law are a law unto themselves.' So of what
   we commonly term the world, as opposed to those who make a profession
   of Christianity, we must not shrink from saying, When men of the world
   do by nature whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are
   lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, these not being conscious
   of the grace of God, do by nature what can only be done by His grace.'
   Why should we make them out worse than they are? We must cease to speak
   evil of them, ere they will judge fairly of the characters of religious
   men. That, with so little recognition of His personal relation to them,
   God does not cast them off, is a ground of hope rather than of fear--of
   thankfulness, not of regret.

   Many strange thoughts arise at the contemplation of this intermediate
   world, which some blindness, or hardness, or distance in nature,
   separates from the love of Christ. We ask ourselves what will become of
   them after death?' For what state of existence can this present life be
   a preparation?' Perhaps they will turn the question upon us; and we may
   answer for ourselves and them, that we throw ourselves on the mercy of
   God.' We cannot deny that in the sight of God they may condemn us;
   their moral worth may be more acceptable to Him than our Christian
   feeling. For we know that God is not like some earthly sovereign, who
   may be offended at the want of attention which we show to him. He can
   only estimate us always by our fulfilment of moral and Christian
   duties. When the balance is struck, it is most probable, nay, it is
   quite certain, that many who are first will be last, and the last
   first. And this transfer will take place, not only among those who are
   within the gates of the Christian Church, but from the world also into
   the Church. There may be some among us who have given the cup of cold
   water to a brother, not knowing it was the Lord.' Some again may be
   leading a life in their own family which is not far from the kingdom of
   heaven.' We do not say that for ourselves there is more than one way;
   that way is Christ. But, in the case of others, it is right that we
   should take into account their occupation, character, circumstances,
   the manner in which Christianity may have been presented to them, the
   intellectual or other difficulties which may have crossed their path.
   We shall think more of the unconscious Christianity of their lives,
   than of the profession of it on their lips. So that we seem almost
   compelled to be Christian and Unchristian at once: Christian in
   reference to the obligations of Christianity upon ourselves;
   Unchristian--if indeed it be not a higher kind of Christianity--in not
   judging those who are unlike ourselves by our own standard.

   Other oppositions have found their way into statements of Christian
   truth, which we shall sometimes do well to forget. Mankind are not
   simply divided into two classes; they pass insensibly from one to the
   other. The term world is itself ambiguous, meaning the world very near
   to us, and yet a long way off from us; which we contrast with the
   Church, and which we nevertheless feel to be one with the Church, and
   incapable of being separated. Sometimes the Church bears a high and
   noble witness against the world, and at other times, even to the
   religious mind, the balance seems to be even, and the world in its turn
   begins to bear witness against the Church. There are periods of history
   in which they both grow together. Little cause as there may be for
   congratulation in our present state, yet we cannot help tracing, in the
   last half-century, a striking amelioration in our own and some other
   countries, testified to by changes in laws and manners. Many reasons
   have been given for this change: the efforts of a few devoted men in
   the last, or the beginning of the present, century; a long peace;
   diffusion of education; increase of national wealth; changes in the
   principles of government; improvement in the lives of the ministers of
   religion. No one who has considered this problem will feel that he is
   altogether able to solve it. He cannot venture to say that the change
   springs from any bold aggression which the Church has made upon the
   vices of mankind; nor is it certain that any such effort would have
   produced the result. In the Apostle's language it must still remain a
   mystery why mankind collectively often become better;' and not less so,
   why, when deprived of all the means and influences of virtue and
   religion, they do not always become worse.' Even for evil, Nature, that
   is, the God of nature, has set limits; men do not corrupt themselves
   endlessly. Here, too, it is, Hitherto shalt thou go, but no further.'

   Reflections of this kind are not a mere speculation; they have a
   practical use. They show us the world as it is, neither lighted up with
   the aspirations of hope and faith, nor darkened beneath the shadow of
   God's wrath. They teach us to regard human nature in a larger and more
   kindly way, which is the first step towards amending and strengthening
   it. They make us think of the many as well as of the few; as ministers
   of the Gospel, warning us against preaching to the elect only, instead
   of seeking to do good to all men. They take us out of the straits and
   narrownesses of religion, into wider fields in which the analogy of
   faith is still our guide. They help us to reconcile nature with grace;
   they prevent our thinking that Christ came into the world for our sakes
   only, or that His words have no meaning when they are scattered beyond
   the limits of the Christian Church. They remind us that the moral state
   of mankind here, and their eternal state hereafter, are not wholly
   dependent on our poor efforts for their religious improvement; and that
   the average of men who seem often to be so careless about their own
   highest interest, are not when they pass away uncared for in His sight.

   Doubtless, the lives of individuals that rise above this average are
   the salt of the earth. They are not to be confounded with the many,
   because for these latter a place may be found in the counsels of
   Providence. Those who add the love of their fellow-creatures to the
   love of God, who make the love of truth the rule of both, bear the
   image of Christ until His coming again. And yet, probably, they would
   be the last persons to wish to distinguish themselves from their
   fellow-creatures. The Christian life makes all things kin; it does not
   stand out angular' against any part of mankind. And that humble spirit
   which the best of men have ever shown in reference to their brethren,
   is also the true spirit of the Church towards the world. If a tone of
   dogmatism and exclusiveness is unbecoming in individual Christians, is
   it not equally so in Christian communities? There is no need, because
   men will not listen to one motive, that we should not present them with
   another; there is no reason, because they will not hear the voice of
   the preacher, that they should be refused the blessings of education;
   or that we should cease to act upon their circumstances, because we
   cannot awaken the heart and conscience. We are too apt to view as
   hostile to religion that which only takes a form different from
   religion, as trade, or politics, or professional life. More truly may
   religious men regard the world, in its various phases, as in many
   points a witness against themselves. The exact appreciation of the good
   as well as the evil of the world is a link of communion with our
   fellow-men; may it not also be, too, with the body of Christ? There are
   lessons of which the world is the keeper no less than the Church.
   Especially have earnest and sincere Christians reason to reflect, if
   ever they see the moral sentiments of mankind directed against them.

   The God of peace rest upon you, is the concluding benediction of most
   of the Epistles. How can He rest upon us, who draw so many hard lines
   of demarcation between ourselves and other men; who oppose the Church
   and the world, Sundays and working days, revelation and science, the
   past and present, the life and state of which religion speaks and the
   life which we ordinarily lead? It is well that we should consider these
   lines of demarcation rather as representing aspects of our life than as
   corresponding to classes of mankind. It is well that we should
   acknowledge that one aspect of life or knowledge is as true as the
   other. Science and revelation touch one another: the past floats down
   in the present. We are all members of the same Christian world; we are
   all members of the same Christian Church. Who can bear to doubt this of
   themselves or of their family? What parent would think otherwise of his
   child?--what child of his parent? Religion holds before us an ideal
   which we are far from reaching; natural affection softens and relieves
   the characters of those we love; experience alone shows men what they
   truly are. All these three must so meet as to do violence to none. If,
   in the age of the Apostles, it seemed to be the duty of the believers
   to separate themselves from the world and take up a hostile position,
   not less marked in the present age is the duty of abolishing in a
   Christian country what has now become an artificial distinction, and
   seeking by every means in our power, by fairness, by truthfulness, by
   knowledge, by love unfeigned, by the absence of party and prejudice, by
   acknowledging the good in all things, to reconcile the Church to the
   world, the one half of our nature to the other; drawing the mind off
   from speculative difficulties, or matters of party and opinion, to that
   which almost all equally acknowledge and almost equally rest short
   of--the life of Christ.

ESSAY

    ON

RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH

   No doctrine in later times has been looked at so exclusively through
   the glass of controversy as that of justification. From being the
   simplest it has become the most difficult; the language of the heart
   has lost itself in a logical tangle. Differences have been drawn out as
   far as possible, and then taken back and reconciled. The extreme of one
   view has more than once produced a reaction in favour of the other.
   Many senses have been attributed to the same words, and simple
   statements carried out on both sides into endless conclusions. New
   formulas of conciliation have been put in the place of old-established
   phrases, and have soon died away, because they had no root in language
   or in the common sense or feeling of mankind. The difficulty of the
   subject has been increased by the different degrees of importance
   attached to it: while to some it is an articulus stantis aut cadentis
   ecclesiae, others have never been able to see in it more than a verbal
   dispute.

   This perplexity on the question of righteousness by faith is partly due
   to the character of the age in which it began to revive. Men felt at
   the Reformation the need of a spiritual religion, and could no longer
   endure the yoke which had been put upon their fathers. The heart
   rebelled against the burden of ordinances; it wanted to take a nearer
   way to reconciliation with God. But when the struggle was over, and
   individuals were seeking to impart to others the peace which they had
   found themselves, they had no simple or natural expression of their
   belief. They were alone in a world in which the human mind had been
   long enslaved. It was necessary for them to go down into the land of
   the enemy, and get their weapons sharpened before they could take up a
   position and fortify their camp.

   In other words, the Scholastic Logic had been for six centuries
   previous the great instrument of training the human mind; it had grown
   up with it, and become a part of it. Neither would it have been more
   possible for the Reformers to have laid it aside than to have laid
   aside the use of language itself. Around theology it lingers still,
   seeming reluctant to quit a territory which is peculiarly its own. No
   science has hitherto fallen so completely under its power; no other is
   equally unwilling to ask the meaning of terms; none has been so fertile
   in reasonings and consequences. The change of which Lord Bacon was the
   herald has hardly yet reached it; much less could the Reformation have
   anticipated the New Philosophy.

   The whole mental structure of that time rendered it necessary that the
   Reformers, no less than their opponents, should resort to the
   scholastic methods of argument. The difference between the two parties
   did not lie here. Perhaps it may be said with truth that the Reformers
   were even more schoolmen than their opponents, because they dealt more
   with abstract ideas, and were more concentrated on a single topic. The
   whole of Luther's teaching was summed up in a single article,
   Righteousness by Faith.' That was to him the Scriptural expression of a
   Spiritual religion. But this, according to the manner of that time,
   could not be left in the simple language of St. Paul. It was to be
   proved from Scripture first, then isolated by definition; then it might
   be safely drawn out into remote consequences.

   And yet, why was this? Why not repeat, with a slight alteration of the
   words rather than the meaning of the Apostle, Neither justification by
   faith nor justification by works, but a new creature'? Was there not
   yet a more excellent way' to oppose things to words--the life, and
   spirit, and freedom of the Gospel, to the deadness, and powerlessness,
   and slavery of the Roman Church? So it seems natural to us to reason,
   looking back after an interval of three centuries on the weary
   struggle; so absorbing to those who took part in it once, so distant
   now either to us or them. But so it could not be. The temper of the
   times, and the education of the Reformers themselves, made it necessary
   that one dogmatic system should be met by another. The scholastic
   divinity had become a charmed circle, and no man could venture out of
   it, though he might oppose or respond within it.

   And thus justification by faith, and justification by works, became the
   watchword of two parties. We may imagine ourselves at that point in the
   controversy when the Pelagian dispute had been long since hushed, and
   that respecting Predestination had not yet begun; when men were not
   differing about original sin, and had not begun to differ about the
   Divine decrees. What Luther sought for was to find a formula which
   expressed most fully the entire, unreserved, immediate dependence of
   the believer on Christ. What the Catholic sought for was so to modify
   this formula as not to throw dishonour on the Church by making religion
   a merely personal matter; or on the lives of holy men of old, who had
   wrought out their salvation by asceticism; or endanger morality by
   appearing to undervalue good works. It was agreed by all, that men are
   saved through Christ--[that men are saved] not of themselves, but of
   the grace of God, was equally agreed since the condemnation of Pelagius
   --that faith and works imply each other, was not disputed by either. A
   narrow space is left for the combat, which has to be carried on within
   the outworks of an earlier creed, in which, nevertheless, great
   subtlety of human thought and differences of character admit of being
   displayed.

   On this narrow ground the first question that naturally arises is, how
   faith is to be defined? is it to include love and holiness, or to be
   separated from them? If the former, it seems to lose its apprehensive
   dependent nature, and to be scarcely distinguishable from works; if the
   latter, the statement is too refined for the common sense of mankind;
   though made by Luther, it could scarcely be retained even by his
   immediate followers. Again, is it an act or a state? are we to figure
   it as a point, or as a line? Is the whole of our spiritual life
   anticipated in the beginning, or may faith no less than works,
   justification equally with sanctification, be conceived of as going on
   to perfection? Is justification an objective act of Divine mercy, or a
   subjective state of which the believer is conscious in himself? Is the
   righteousness of faith imputed or inherent, an attribution of the
   merits of Christ, or a renewal of the human heart itself? What is the
   test of a true faith? And is it possible for those who are possessed of
   it to fall away? How can we exclude the doctrine of human merit
   consistently with Divine justice? How do we account for the fact that
   some have this faith, and others are without it, this difference being
   apparently independent of their moral state? If faith comes by grace,
   is it imparted to few or to all? And in what relation does the whole
   doctrine stand to Predestinarianism on the one hand, and to the
   Catholic or Sacramental theory on the other?

   So at many points the doctrine of righteousness by faith touches the
   metaphysical questions of subject and object, of necessity and freedom,
   of habits and actions, and of human consciousness, like a magnet
   drawing to itself philosophy, as it has once drawn to itself the
   history of Europe. There were distinctions also of an earlier date,
   with which it had to struggle, of deeper moral import than their
   technical form would lead us to suppose, such as that of congruity and
   condignity, in which the analogy of Christianity is transferred to
   heathenism, and the doer of good works before justification is regarded
   as a shadow of the perfected believer. Neither must we omit to observe
   that, as the doctrine of justification by faith had a close connexion
   with the Pelagian controversy, carrying the decision of the Church a
   step further, making Divine Grace not only the source of human action,
   but also requiring the consciousness or assurance of grace in the
   believer himself: so it put forth its roots in another direction,
   attaching itself to Anselm as well as Augustine, and comprehending the
   idea of satisfaction; not now, as formerly, of Christ offered in the
   sacrifice of the mass, but of one sacrifice, once offered for the sins
   of men, whether considered as an expiation by suffering, or implying
   only a reconciliation between God and man, or a mere manifestation of
   the righteousness of God.

   Such is the whole question, striking deep, and spreading far and wide
   with its offshoots. It is not our intention to enter on the
   investigation of all these subjects, many of which are interesting as
   phases of thought in the history of the Church, but have no bearing on
   the interpretation of St. Paul's Epistles, and would be out of place
   here. Our inquiry will embrace two heads: (1) What did St. Paul mean by
   the expression righteousness of faith,' in that age ere controversies
   about his meaning arose? and (2) What do we mean by it, now that such
   controversies have died away, and the interest in them is retained only
   by the theological student, and the Church and the world are changed,
   and there is no more question of Jew or Gentile, circumcision or
   uncircumcision, and we do not become Christians, but are so from our
   birth? Many volumes are not required to explain the meaning of the
   Apostle; nor can the words of eternal life be other than few and simple
   to ourselves.

   There is one interpretation of the Epistles of St. Paul which is
   necessarily in some degree false; that is, the interpretation put upon
   them by later controversy. When the minds of men are absorbed in a
   particular circle of ideas they take possession of any stray verse,
   which becomes the centre of their world. They use the words of
   Scripture, but are incapable of seeing that they have another meaning
   and are used in a different connexion from that in which they employ
   them. Sometimes there is a degree of similarity in the application
   which tends to conceal the difference. Thus Luther and St. Paul both
   use the same term, justified by faith;' and the strength of the
   Reformer's words is the authority of St. Paul. Yet, observe how far
   this agreement is one of words: how far of things. For Luther is
   speaking solely of individuals, St. Paul also of nations; Luther of
   faith absolutely, St. Paul of faith as relative to the law. With St.
   Paul faith is the symbol of the universality of the Gospel. Luther
   excludes this or any analogous point of view. In St. Paul there is no
   opposition of faith and love; nor does he further determine
   righteousness by faith as meaning a faith in the blood or even in the
   death of Christ; nor does be suppose consciousness or assurance in the
   person justified. But all these are prominent features of the Lutheran
   doctrine. Once more: the faith of St. Paul has reference to the evil of
   the world of sight; which was soon to vanish away, that the world in
   which faith walks might be revealed; but no such allusion is implied in
   the language of the Reformer. Lastly: the change in the use of the
   substantive righteousness' to justification' is the indication of a
   wide difference between St. Paul and Luther; the natural, almost
   accidental, language of St. Paul having already passed into a technical
   formula.

   These contrasts make us feel that St. Paul can only be interpreted by
   himself, not from the systems of modern theologians, nor even from the
   writings of one who had so much in common with him as Luther. It is the
   spirit and feeling of St. Paul which Luther represents, not the meaning
   of his words. A touch of nature in both makes them kin.' And without
   bringing down one to the level of the other, we can imagine St. Paul
   returning that singular affection, almost like an attachment to a
   living friend, which the great Reformer felt towards the Apostle. But
   this personal attachment or resemblance in no way lessens the necessary
   difference between the preaching of Luther and of St. Paul, which arose
   in some degree perhaps from their individual character, but chiefly out
   of the different circumstances and modes of thought of their respective
   ages. At the Reformation we are at another stage of the human mind, in
   which system and logic and the abstractions of Aristotle have a kind of
   necessary force, when words have so completely taken the place of
   things, that the minutest distinctions appear to have an intrinsic
   value.

   It has been said (and the remark admits of a peculiar application to
   theology), that few persons know sufficient of things to be able to say
   whether disputes are merely verbal or not. Yet, on the other hand, it
   must be admitted that, whatever accidental advantage theology may
   derive from system and definition, mere accurate statements can never
   form the substance of our belief. No one doubts that Christianity could
   be in the fullest sense taught to a child or a savage, without any
   mention of justification or satisfaction or predestination. Why should
   we not receive the Gospel as little children?' Why should we not choose
   the poor man's part in the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven? Why
   elaborate doctrinal abstractions which are so subtle in their meaning
   as to be in great danger of being lost in their translation from one
   language to another? which are always running into consequences
   inconsistent with our moral nature, and the knowledge of God derived
   from it? which are not the prevailing usage of Scripture, but technical
   terms which we have gathered from one or two passages, and made the
   key-notes of our scale? The words satisfaction and predestination
   nowhere occur in Scripture; the word regeneration only twice, and but
   once in a sense at all similar to that which it bears among ourselves;
   the word justification twice only, and nowhere as a purely abstract
   term.

   But although language and logic have strangely transfigured the meaning
   of Scripture, we cannot venture to say that all theological
   controversies are questions of words. If from their winding mazes we
   seek to retrace our steps, we still find differences which have a deep
   foundation in the opposite tendencies of the human mind, and the
   corresponding division of the world itself. That men of one temper of
   mind adopt one expression rather than another may be partly an
   accident; but the adoption of an expression by persons of marked
   character makes the difference of words a reality also. That can
   scarcely be thought a matter of words which cut in sunder the Church,
   which overthrew princes, which made the line of demarcation between
   Jewish and Gentile Christians in the Apostolic age, and is so, in
   another sense, between Protestant and Catholic at the present day. And
   in a deeper way of reflection than this, if we turn from the Church to
   the individual, we seem to see around us opposite natures and
   characters, whose lives really exhibit a difference corresponding to
   that of which we are speaking. The one incline to morality, the other
   to religion; the one to the sacramental, the other to the spiritual;
   the one to multiplicity in outward ordinances, the other to simplicity;
   the one consider chiefly the means, the other the end; the one desire
   to dwell upon doctrinal statements, the other need only the name of
   Christ; the one turn to ascetic practices, to lead a good life, and to
   do good to others, the other to faith, humility, and dependence on God.
   We may sometimes find the opposite attributes combine with each other
   (there have ever been cross-divisions on this article of belief in the
   Christian world; the great body of the Reformed Churches, and a small
   minority of Roman Catholics before the Reformation, being on the one
   side; and the whole Roman Catholic Church since the Reformation, and a
   section of the Protestant Episcopalians, and some lesser communions, on
   the other); still, in general, the first of these characters answers to
   that doctrine which the Roman Church sums up in the formula of
   justification by works; the latter is that temper of mind which finds
   its natural dogmatic expression in the words We are justified by
   faith.'

   These latter words have been carried out of their original circle of
   ideas into a new one by the doctrines of the Reformation. They have
   become hardened, stiffened, sharpened by the exigencies of controversy,
   and torn from what may be termed their context in the Apostolical age.
   To that age we must return ere we can think in the Apostle's language.
   His conception of faith, although simpler than our own, has
   nevertheless a peculiar relation to his own day; it is at once wider,
   and also narrower, than the use of the word among ourselves--wider in
   that it is the symbol of the admission of the Gentiles into the Church,
   but narrower also in that it is the negative of the law. Faith is the
   proper technical term which excludes the law; being what the law is
   not, as the law is what faith is not. No middle term connects the two,
   or at least none which the Apostle admits, until he has first widened
   the breach between them to the uttermost. He does not say, Was not
   Abraham our father justified by works (as well as by faith), when he
   had offered up Isaac his son on the altar?' but only, What saith the
   Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for
   righteousness.'

   The Jewish conception of righteousness was the fulfilment of the
   Commandments. He who walked in all the precepts of the law blameless,
   like Daniel in the old Testament, or Joseph and Nathanael in the New,
   was righteous before God. What shall I do to inherit eternal life? Thou
   knowest the commandments. Do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not
   bear false witness. All these have I kept from my youth up.' This is a
   picture of Jewish righteousness as it presents itself in its most
   favourable light. But it was a righteousness which comprehended the
   observance of ceremonial details as well as moral precepts, which
   confused questions of a new moon or a sabbath with the weightier
   matters of common honesty or filial duty. It might be nothing more than
   an obedience to the law as such, losing itself on the surface of
   religion, in casuistical distinctions about meats and drinks, or vows
   or forms of oaths, or purifications, without any attempt to make clean
   that which is within. It might also pierce inward to the dividing
   asunder of the soul. Then was heard the voice of conscience crying, All
   these things cannot make the doers thereof perfect.' When every
   external obligation was fulfilled, the internal began. Actions must
   include thoughts and intentions--the Seventh Commandment extends to the
   adultery of the heart; in one word, the law must become a spirit.

   But to the mind of St. Paul the spirit presented itself not so much as
   a higher fulfilment of the law, but as antagonistic to it. From this
   point of view, it appeared not that man could never fulfil the law
   perfectly, but that he could never fulfil it at all. What God required
   was something different in kind from legal obedience. What man needed
   was a return to God and nature. He was burdened, straitened, shut out
   from the presence of his Father--a servant, not a son; to whom, in a
   spiritual sense, the heaven was become as iron, and the earth brass.
   The new righteousness must raise him above the burden of ordinances,
   and bring him into a living communion with God. It must be within, and
   not without him--written not on tables of stone, but on fleshy tables
   of the heart. But inward righteousness was no peculiar privilege of the
   Israelites; it belonged to all mankind. And the revelation of it, as it
   satisfied the need of the individual soul, vindicated also the ways of
   God to man; it showed God to be equal in justice and mercy to all
   mankind.

   As the symbol of this inward righteousness, St. Paul found an
   expression--righteousness by faith--derived from those passages in the
   Old Testament which spoke of Abraham being justified by faith. It was
   already in use among the Jews; but it was the Apostle who stamped it
   first with a permanent and universal import. The faith of St. Paul was
   not the faith of the Patriarchs only, who believed in the promises made
   to their descendants; it entered within the veil--out of the reach of
   ordinances--beyond the evil of this present life; it was the instrument
   of union with Christ, in whom all men were one; whom they were
   expecting to come from heaven. The Jewish nation itself was too far
   gone to be saved as a nation: individuals had a nearer way. The Lord
   was at hand; there was no time for a long life of laborious service. As
   at the last hour, when we have to teach men rather how to die than how
   to live, the Apostle could only say to those who would receive it,
   Believe; all things are possible to him that believes.'

   Such are some of the peculiar aspects of the Apostle's doctrine of
   righteousness by faith. To our own minds it has become a later stage or
   a particular form of the more general doctrine of salvation through
   Christ, of the grace of God to man, or of the still more general truth
   of spiritual religion. It is the connecting link by which we
   appropriate these to ourselves--the hand which we put out to apprehend
   the mercy of God. It was not so to the Apostle. To him grace and faith
   and the Spirit are not parts of a doctrinal system, but different
   expressions of the same truth. Beginning in the Spirit' is another way
   of saying Being justified by faith.' He uses them indiscriminately, and
   therefore we cannot suppose that he could have laid any stress on
   distinctions between them. Even the apparently precise antithesis of
   the prepositions en, dia varies in different passages. Only in
   reference to the law, faith, rather than grace, is the more correct and
   natural expression. It was Christ or not Christ, the Spirit or not the
   Spirit, faith and the law, that were the dividing principles: not
   Christ through faith, as opposed to Christ through works; or the Spirit
   as communicated through grace, to the Spirit as independent of grace.

   Illusive as are the distinctions of later controversies as guides to
   the interpretation of Scripture, there is another help, of which we can
   hardly avail ourselves too much--the interpretation of fact. To read
   the mind of the Apostle, we must read also the state of the world and
   the Church by which he was surrounded. Now, there are two great facts
   which correspond to the doctrine of righteousness by faith, which is
   also the doctrine of the universality of the Gospel: first, the vision
   which the Apostle saw on the way to Damascus; secondly, the actual
   conversion of the Gentiles by the preaching of the Apostle.
   Righteousness by faith, admission of the Gentiles, even the rejection
   and restoration of the Jews, are--himself under so many different
   points of view. The way by which God had led him was the way also by
   which he was leading other men. When he preached righteousness by
   faith, his conscience also bore him witness that this was the manner in
   which he had himself passed from darkness to light, from the burden of
   ordinances to the power of an endless life. In proclaiming the
   salvation of the Gentiles, he was interpreting the world as it was;
   their admission into the Church had already taken place before the eyes
   of all mankind; it was a purpose of God that was actually fulfilled,
   not waiting for some future revelation. Just as when doubts are raised
   respecting his Apostleship, he cut them short by the fact that he was
   an Apostle, and did the work of an Apostle; so, in adjusting the
   relations of Jew and Gentile, and justifying the ways of God, the
   facts, read aright, are the basis of the doctrine which he teaches. All
   that he further shows is, that these facts were in accordance with the
   Old Testament, with the words of the Prophets, and the dealings of God
   with the Jewish people. And the Apostles at Jerusalem, equally with
   himself, admitted the success of his mission as an evidence of its
   truth.

   But the faith which St. Paul preached was not merely the evidence of
   things not seen, in which the Gentiles also had part, nor only the
   reflection of the violence' of the world around him, which was taking
   the kingdom of heaven by force. The source, the hidden life, from which
   justification flows, in which it lives, is--Christ. It is true that we
   nowhere find in the Epistles the expression justification by Christ'
   exactly in the sense of modern theology. But, on the other hand, we are
   described as dead with Christ, we live with Him, we are members of His
   body, we follow Him in all the stages of His being. All this is another
   way of expressing We are justified by faith.' That which takes us out
   of ourselves and links us with Christ, which anticipates in an instant
   the rest of life, which is the door of every heavenly and spiritual
   relation, presenting us through a glass with the image of Christ
   crucified, is faith. The difference between our own mode of thinking
   and that of the Apostle is mainly this--that to him Christ is set forth
   more as in a picture, and less through the medium of ideas or figures
   of speech; and that while we conceive the Saviour more naturally as an
   object of faith, to St. Paul He is rather the indwelling power of life
   which is fashioned in him, the marks of whose body he bears, the
   measure of whose sufferings he fills up.

   When in the Gospel it is said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   thou shalt be saved,' this is substantially the same truth as We are
   justified by faith.' It is another way of expressing Therefore being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.' Yet we nay note two points of difference, as well as two of
   resemblance, in the manner in which the doctrine is set forth in the
   Gospel as compared with the manner of the Epistles of St. Paul. First,
   in the omission of any connexion between the doctrine of faith in
   Christ, and the admission of the Gentiles. The Saviour is within the
   borders of Israel; and accordingly little is said of the sheep not of
   this fold,' or the other husbandmen who shall take possession of the
   vineyard. Secondly, there is in the words of Christ no antagonism or
   opposition to the law, except so far as the law itself represented an
   imperfect or defective morality, or the perversions of the law had
   become inconsistent with every moral principle. Two points of
   resemblance have also to be remarked between the faith of the Gospels
   and of the Epistles. In the first place, both are accompanied by
   forgiveness of sins. As our Saviour to the disciple who affirms his
   belief says, Thy sins be forgiven thee;' so St. Paul, when seeking to
   describe, in the language of the Old Testament, the state of
   justification by faith, cites the words of David, Blessed is the man to
   whom the Lord will not impute sin.' Secondly, they have both a kind of
   absoluteness which raises them above earthly things. There is a sort of
   omnipotence attributed to faith, of which the believer is made a
   partaker. Whoso hath faith as a grain of mustard seed, and should say
   unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, it
   shall be done unto him,' is the language of our Lord. I can do all
   things through Christ that strengtheneth me,' are the words of St.
   Paul.

   Faith, in the view of the Apostle, has a further aspect, which is
   freedom. That quality in us which in reference to God and Christ is
   faith, in reference to ourselves and our fellow-men is Christian
   liberty. With this freedom Christ has made us free;' where the spirit
   of the Lord is, there is liberty.' It is the image also of the
   communion of the world to come. The Jerusalem that is above is free,'
   and the creature is waiting to be delivered into the glorious liberty
   of the children of God.' It applies to the Church as now no longer
   confined in the prison-house of the Jewish dispensation; to the grace
   of God, which is given irrespectively to all; to the individual, the
   power of whose will is now loosed; to the Gospel, as freedom from the
   law, setting the conscience at rest about questions of meats and
   drinks, and new moons and sabbaths; and, above all, to the freedom from
   the consciousness of sin: in all these senses the law of the spirit of
   life is also the law of freedom.

   In modern language, assurance has been deemed necessary to the
   definition of a true faith. There is a sense, too, in which final
   assurance entered into the conception of the faith of the Epistles.
   Looking at men from without, it was possible for them to fall away
   finally; it was possible also to fall without falling away; as St. John
   says, there is a sin unto death, and there is a sin not unto death. But
   looking inwards into their hearts and consciences, their salvation was
   not a matter of probability; they knew whom they had believed,' and
   were confident that He who had begun the good work in them would
   continue it unto the end. All calculations respecting the future were
   to them lost in the fact that they were already saved; to use a homely
   expression, they had no time to inquire whether the state to which they
   were called was permanent and final. The same intense faith which
   separated them from the present world, had already given them a place
   in the world to come. They had not to win the crown--it was already
   won: this life, when they thought of themselves in relation to Christ,
   was the next; as their union with Him seemed to them more true and real
   than the mere accidents of their temporal existence.

   A few words will briefly recapitulate the doctrine of righteousness by
   faith as gathered from the Epistles of St. Paul.

   Faith, then, according to the Apostle, is the spiritual principle
   whereby we go out of ourselves to hold communion with God and Christ;
   not like the faith of the Epistle to the Hebrews, clothing itself in
   the shadows of the law; but opposed to the law, and of a nature purely
   moral and spiritual. It frees man from the flesh, the law, the world,
   and from himself also; that is, from his sinful nature, which is the
   meeting of these three elements in his spiritual consciousness. And to
   be justified' is to pass into a new state; such as that of the
   Christian world when compared with the Jewish or Pagan; such as that
   which St. Paul had himself felt at the moment of his conversion; such
   as that which he reminds the Galatian converts they had experienced,
   before whose eyes Jesus Christ was evidently set forth crucified;' an
   inward or subjective state, to which the outward or objective act of
   calling, on God's part, through the preaching of the Apostle,
   corresponded; which, considered on a wider scale, was the acceptance of
   the Gentiles and of every one who feared God; corresponding in like
   manner to the eternal purpose of God; indicated in the case of the
   individual by his own inward assurance; in the case of the world at
   large, testified by the fact; accompanied in the first by the sense of
   peace and forgiveness, and implying to mankind generally the last final
   principle of the Divine Government--God concluded all under sin that he
   might have mercy upon all.'

   We acknowledge that there is a difference between the meaning of
   justification by faith to St. Paul and to ourselves. Eighteen hundred
   years cannot have passed away, leaving the world and the mind of man,
   or the use of language, the same as it was. Times have altered, and
   Christianity, partaking of the social and political progress of
   mankind, receiving, too, its own intellectual development, has
   inevitably lost its simplicity. The true use of philosophy is to
   restore this simplicity; to undo the perplexities which the love of
   system or past philosophies, or the imperfection of language or logic,
   have made; to lighten the burden which the traditions of ages have
   imposed upon us. To understand St. Paul we found it necessary to get
   rid of definitions and deductions, which might be compared to a mazy
   undergrowth of some noble forest, which we must clear away ere we can
   wander in its ranges. And it is necessary for ourselves also to return
   from theology to Scripture; to seek a truth to live and die in--not to
   be the subject of verbal disputes, which entangle the religious sense
   in scholastic refinements. The words of eternal life are few and
   simple, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.'

   Remaining, then, within the circle of the New Testament, which we
   receive as a rule of life for ourselves, no less than for the early
   Church, we must not ignore the great differences by which we are
   distinguished from those for whom it was written. Words of life and
   inspiration, heard by them with ravishment for the first time, are to
   us words of fixed and conventional meaning; they no longer express
   feelings of the heart, but ideas of the head. Nor is the difference
   less between the state of the world then and now; not only of the
   outward world in which we live, but of that inner world which we
   ourselves are. The law is dead to us, and we to the law; and the
   language of St. Paul is relative to what has passed away. The
   transitions of meaning in the use of the word law tend also to a
   corresponding variation in the meaning of faith. We are not looking for
   the immediate coming of Christ, and do not anticipate, in a single
   generation, the end of human things, or the history of a life in the
   moment of baptism or conversion. To us time and eternity have a fixed
   boundary, between them there is a gulf which we cannot pass; we do not
   mingle in our thoughts earth and heaven. Last of all, we are in a
   professing Christian world, in which religion, too, has become a sort
   of business; moreover, we see a long way off truths of which the first
   believers were eye-witnesses. Hence it has become difficult for us to
   conceive the simple force of such expressions as dead with Christ,' if
   ye then be risen with Christ,' which are repeated in prayers or
   sermons, but often convey no distinct impression to the minds of the
   hearers.

   The neglect of these differences between ourselves and the first
   disciples has sometimes led to a distortion of doctrine and a
   perversion of life; where words had nothing to correspond to them,
   views of human nature have been invented to suit the supposed meaning
   of St. Paul. Thus, for example, the notion of legal righteousness is
   indeed a fiction as applied to our own times. Nor, in truth, is the
   pride of human nature, or the tendency to rebel against the will of
   God, or to attach an undue value to good works, better founded. Men are
   evil in all sorts of ways: they deceive themselves and others; they
   walk by the opinion of others, and not by faith; they give way to their
   passions; they are imperious and oppressive to one another. But if we
   look closely, we perceive that most of their sins are not consciously
   against God; the pride of rank, or wealth, or power, or intellect, may
   be shown towards their brethren, but no man is proud towards God. No
   man does wrong for the sake of rebelling against God. The evil is not
   that men are bound under a curse by the ever-present consciousness of
   sin, but that sins pass unheeded by: not that they wantonly offend God,
   but that they know Him not. So, again, there may be a false sense of
   security towards God, as is sometimes observed on a death-bed, when
   mere physical weakness seems to incline the mind to patience and
   resignation; yet this more often manifests itself in a mistaken faith,
   than in a reliance on good works. Or, to take another instance, we are
   often surprised at the extent to which men who are not professors of
   religion seem to practise Christian virtues; yet their state, however
   we may regard it, has nothing in common with legal or
   self-righteousness.

   And besides theories of religion at variance with experience, which
   have always a kind of unsoundness, the attempt of men to apply
   Scripture to their own lives in the letter rather than in the spirit,
   has been very injurious in other ways to the faith of Christ. Persons
   have confused the accidental circumstances or language of the Apostolic
   times with the universal language of morality and truth. They have
   reduced human nature to very great straits; they have staked salvation
   upon the right use of a word; they have enlisted the noblest feelings
   of mankind in opposition to their Gospel.' They have become mystics in
   the attempt to follow the Apostles, who were not mystics. Narrowness in
   their own way of life has led to exclusiveness in their judgements on
   other men. The undue stress which they have laid on particular precepts
   or texts of Scripture has closed their minds against its general
   purpose; the rigidness of their own rules has rendered it impossible
   that they should grow freely to the stature of the perfect man.' They
   have ended in a verbal Christianity, which has preserved words when the
   meaning of them had changed, taking the form, while it quenched the
   life, of the Gospel.

   Leaving the peculiar and relative aspect of the Pauline doctrine, as
   well as the scholastic and traditional one, we have again to ask the
   meaning of justification by faith. We may divide the subject, first, as
   it may be considered in the abstract; and, secondly, as personal to
   ourselves.

   I. Our justification may be regarded as an act on God's part. It may be
   said that this act is continuous, and commensurate with our whole
   lives; that although known unto God are all his works from the
   beginning,' yet that, speaking as men, and translating what we term the
   acts of God into human language, we are ever being more and more
   justified, as in theological writers we are said also to be more and
   more sanctified. At first sight it seems that to deny this involves an
   absurdity; it may be thought a contradiction to maintain that we are
   justified at once, but sanctified all our life long. Yet perhaps this
   latter mode of statement is better than the other, because it presents
   two aspects of the truth instead of one only; it is also a nearer
   expression of the inward consciousness of the soul itself. For must we
   not admit that it is the unchangeable will of God that all mankind
   should be saved? Justification in the mind of the believer is the
   perception of this fact, which always was. It is not made more a fact
   by our knowing it for many years or our whole life. And this is the
   witness of experience. For he who is justified by faith does not go
   about doubting in himself or his future destiny, but trusting in God.
   From the first moment that he turns earnestly to God he believes that
   he is saved; not from any confidence in himself, but from an
   overpowering sense of the love of God and Christ.

   II. It is an old problem in philosophy, What is the beginning of our
   moral being? What is that prior principle which makes good actions
   produce good habits? Which of those actions raises us above the world
   of sight? Plato would have answered, the contemplation of the idea of
   good. Some of ourselves would answer, by the substitution of a
   conception of moral growth for the mechanical theory of habits. Leaving
   out of sight our relation to God, we can only say, that we are
   fearfully and wonderfully made, with powers which we are unable to
   analyze. It is a parallel difficulty in religion which is met by the
   doctrine of righteousness by faith. We grow up spiritually, we cannot
   tell how; not by outward acts, nor always by energetic effort, but
   stilly and silently, by the grace of God descending upon us, as the dew
   falls upon the earth. When a person is apprehensive and excited about
   his future state, straining every nerve, lest he should fall short of
   the requirements of God, overpowered with the memory of his past sins,
   that is not the temper of mind in which he can truly serve God, or work
   out his own salvation. Peace must go before as well as follow after; a
   peace, too, not to be found in the necessity of law (as philosophy has
   sometimes held), but in the sense of the love of God to His creatures.
   He has no right to this peace, and yet he has it; in the consciousness
   of his new state there is more than he can reasonably explain. At once
   and immediately the Gospel tells him that he is justified by faith,
   that his pardon is simultaneous with the moment of his belief, that he
   may go on his way rejoicing to fulfil the duties of life; for, in human
   language, God is no longer angry with him.

   III. Thus far, in the consideration of righteousness by faith, we have
   obtained two points of view, in which, though regarded in the abstract
   only, the truth of which these words are the symbol has still a
   meaning; first, as expressing the unchangeableness of the mercy of God;
   and, secondly, the mysteriousness of human action. As we approach
   nearer, we are unavoidably led to regard the gift of righteousness
   rather in reference to the subject than to the object, in relation to
   man rather than God. What quality, feeling, temper, habit in ourselves
   answers to it? It may be more or less conscious to us, more of a state
   and less of a feeling, showing itself rather in our lives than our
   lips. But for these differences we can make allowance. It is the same
   faith still, under various conditions and circumstances, and sometimes
   taking different names.

   IV. The expression righteousness by faith' indicates the personal
   character of salvation; it is not the tale of works that we do, but we
   ourselves who are accepted of God. Who can bear to think of his own
   actions as they are seen by the eye of the Almighty? Looking at their
   defective performance, or analyzing them into the secondary motives out
   of which they have sprung, do we seem to have any ground on which we
   can stand; is there anything which satisfies ourselves? Yet, knowing
   that our own works cannot abide the judgement of God, we know also that
   His love is not proportioned to them. He is a Person who deals with us
   as persons over whom He has an absolute right, who have nevertheless an
   endless value to Him. When He might exact all, He forgives all; the
   kingdom of heaven' is like not only to a Master taking account with his
   servants, but to a Father going out to meet his returning son. The
   symbol and mean of this personal relation of man to God is faith; and
   the righteousness which consists not in what we do, but in what we are,
   is the righteousness of faith.

   V. Faith may be spoken of, in the language of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, as the substance of things unseen. But what are the things
   unseen? Not only an invisible world ready to flash through the material
   at the appearance of Christ; not angels, or powers of darkness, or even
   God Himself sitting,' as the Old Testament described, on the circle of
   the heavens;' but the kingdom of truth and justice, the things that are
   within, of which God is the centre, and with which men everywhere by
   faith hold communion. Faith is the belief in the existence of this
   kingdom; that is, in the truth and justice and mercy of God, who
   disposes all things--not, perhaps, in our judgement for the greatest
   happiness of His creatures, but absolutely in accordance with our moral
   notions. And that this is not seen to be the case here, makes it a
   matter of faith that it will be so in some way that we do not at
   present comprehend. He that believes on God believes, first, that He
   is; and, secondly, that He is the Rewarder of them that seek Him.

   VI. Now, if we go on to ask what gives this assurance of the truth and
   justice of God, the answer is, the life and death of Christ, who is the
   Son of God, and the Revelation of God. We know what He himself has told
   us of God, and we cannot conceive perfect goodness separate from
   perfect truth; nay, this goodness itself is the only conception we can
   form of God, if we confess what the mere immensity of the material
   world tends to suggest, that the Almighty is not a natural or even a
   supernatural power, but a Being of whom the reason and conscience of
   man have a truer conception than imagination in its highest flights. He
   is not in the storm, nor in the thunder, nor in the earthquake, but in
   the still small voice.' And this image of God as He reveals himself in
   the heart of man is Christ in us the hope of glory;' Christ as He once
   was upon earth in His sufferings rather than His miracles--the image of
   goodness and truth and peace and love.

   We are on the edge of a theological difficulty; for who can deny that
   the image of that goodness may fade from the mind's eye after so many
   centuries, or that there are those who recognize the idea and may be
   unable to admit the fact? Can we say that this error of the head is
   also a corruption of the will? The lives of such unbelievers in the
   facts of Christianity would sometimes refute our explanation. And yet
   it is true that Providence has made our spiritual life dependent on the
   belief in certain truths, and those truths run up into matters of fact,
   with the belief in which they have ever been associated; it is true,
   also, that the most important moral consequences flow from unbelief. We
   grant the difficulty: no complete answer can be given to it on this
   side the grave. Doubtless God has provided a way that the sceptic no
   less than the believer shall receive his due; He does not need our
   timid counsels for the protection of the truth. If among those who have
   rejected the facts of the Gospel history some have been rash,
   hypercritical, inflated with the pride of intellect, or secretly
   alienated by sensuality from the faith of Christ there have been
   others, also, upon whom we may conceive to rest a portion of that
   blessing which comes to such as have not seen and yet have believed.'

   VII. In the Epistles of St. Paul, and yet more in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, the relation of Christ to mankind is expressed under figures
   of speech taken from the Mosaic dispensation: He is the Sacrifice for
   the sins of men, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the
   world;' the Antitype of all the types, the fulfilment in His own person
   of the Jewish law. Such words may give comfort to those who think of
   God under human imagery, but they seem to require explanation when we
   rise to the contemplation of Him as the God of truth, without parts or
   passions, who knows all things, and cannot be angry with any, or see
   them other than they truly are. What is indicated by them, to us who
   are dead to the law,' is, that God has manifested himself in Christ as
   the God of mercy; who is more ready to hear than we to pray; who has
   forgiven us almost before we ask Him; who has given us His only Son,
   and how will He not with Him also give us all things? They intimate, on
   God's part, that He is not extreme to mark what is done amiss; in human
   language, he is touched with the feeling of our infirmities:' on our
   part, that we say to God, Not of ourselves, but of thy grace and mercy,
   O Lord.' Not in the fullness of life and health, nor in the midst of
   business, nor in the schools of theology; but in the sick chamber,
   where are no more earthly interests, and in the hour of death, we have
   before us the living image of the truth of justification by faith, when
   man acknowledges, on the confines of another world, the
   unprofitableness of his own good deeds, and the goodness of God even in
   afflicting him, and his absolute reliance not on works of righteousness
   that he has done, but on the Divine mercy.

   VIII. A true faith has been sometimes defined to be not a faith in the
   unseen merely, or in God or Christ, but a personal assurance of
   salvation. Such a feeling may be only the veil of sensualism; it may be
   also the noble confidence of St. Paul. I am persuaded that neither
   death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
   present, nor things to come, nor height, nor death, nor any other
   creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in
   Christ Jesus our Lord.' It may be an emotion, resting on no other
   ground except that we believe; or, a conviction deeply rooted in our
   life and character. Scripture and reason alike seem to require this
   belief in our own salvation: and yet to assume that we are at the end
   of the race may make us lag in our course. Whatever danger there is in
   the doctrine of the Divine decrees, the danger is nearer home, and more
   liable to influence practice, when our faith takes the form of personal
   assurance. How, then, are we to escape from the dilemma, and have a
   rational confidence in the mercy of God?

   IX. This confidence must rest, first, on a sense of the truth and
   justice of God, rising above perplexities of fact in the world around
   us, or the tangle of metaphysical or theological difficulties. But
   although such a sense of the truth or justice of God is the beginning
   of our peace, yet a link of connexion is wanting before we can venture
   to apply to ourselves that which we acknowledge in the abstract. The
   justice of God may lead to our condemnation as well as to our
   justification. Are we then, in the language of the ancient tragedy, to
   say that no one can be counted happy before he dies, or that salvation
   is only granted when the end of our course is seen? Not so; the Gospel
   encourages us to regard ourselves as already saved; for we have
   communion with Christ and appropriate His work by faith. And this
   appropriation means nothing short of the renunciation of self and the
   taking up of the cross of Christ in daily life. Whether such an
   imitation or appropriation of Christ is illusive or real, a new mould
   of nature or only an outward and superficial impression, is a question
   not to be answered by any further theological distinction, but by an
   honest and good heart searching into itself. Then only, when we
   surrender ourselves into the hands of God, when we ask Him to show us
   to ourselves as we truly are, when we allow ourselves in no sin, when
   we attribute nothing to our own merits, when we test our faith, not by
   the sincerity of an hour, but of months and years, we learn the true
   meaning of that word in which, better than any other, the nature of
   righteousness by faith is summed up--peace.

   And now abideth faith, hope, and love, these three; but the greatest of
   these is love.' There seems to be a contradiction in love being the
   greatest,' when faith is the medium of acceptance. Love, according to
   some, is preferred to faith, because it reaches to another life; when
   faith and hope are swallowed up in sight, love remains still. Love,
   according to others, has the first place, because it is Divine as well
   as human; it is the love of God to man, as well as of man to God.
   Perhaps, the order of precedence is sufficiently explained by the
   occasion; to a Church torn by divisions the Apostle says, that the
   first of Christian graces is love.' Another thought, however, is
   suggested by these words, which has a bearing on our present subject.
   It is this, that in using the received terms of theology, we must also
   acknowledge their relative and transient character. Christian truth has
   many modes of statement; love is the more natural expression to St.
   John, faith to St. Paul. The indwelling of Christ or of the Spirit of
   God, grace, faith, hope, love, are not parts of a system, but powers or
   aspects of the Christian life. Human minds are different, and the same
   mind is not the same at different times; and the best of men nowadays
   have but a feeble consciousness of spiritual truths. We ought not to
   dim that consciousness by insisting on a single formula; and therefore
   while speaking of faith as the instrument of justification, because
   faith indicates the apprehensive, dependent character of the believer's
   relation to Christ, we are bound also to deny that the Gospel is
   contained in any word, or the Christian life inseparably linked to any
   one quality. We must acknowledge the imperfection of language and
   thought, and seek rather to describe than to define the work of God in
   the soul, which has as many forms as the tempers, capacities,
   circumstances, and accidents of our nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

ESSAY

    ON

THE LAW AS THE STRENGTH OF SIN

   The strength of sin is the law.'--1 Cor. xv. 56.

   THESE words occur parenthetically in the fifteenth chapter of the First
   Epistle to the Corinthians. They may be regarded as a summary of the
   seventh chapter of the Romans. The thought contained in them is also
   the undercurrent of several other passages in the Epistles of St. Paul,
   as, for example, Rom. v. 20; xiv. 22, 23; Gal. ii. 17-21; Col. ii. 14.
   The Apostle is speaking of that prior state out of which he passed into
   the liberty of the Gospel. When he asked himself what preceded Christ
   in his own life and in the dispensations of Providence, what he had
   once felt within warring against his soul, what ho saw without
   contending against the cross, the answer to all was given in the same
   word, the Law.'

   But the singular description of the law as the strength of sin goes
   further, and has a deeper meaning; for it seems to make the law the
   cause of sin. Here is the difficulty. The law may have been
   defective--adapted, as we should say, to a different state of society,
   enforcing in some passages the morality of a half-civilized age, such
   as could never render the practisers thereof perfect, powerless to
   create a new life either in the Jewish nation collectively, or in the
   individuals who composed the nation; yet this imperfection and
   unprofitableness' of the law are not what the Apostle means by the
   strength of sin. If we say, in the words of James, quoted in the Acts,
   that it was a burden too heavy for men to bear, still language like
   this falls short of the paradox, as it appears to us, of St. Paul.
   There is no trace that the law was regarded by him as given because of
   the hardness of men's hearts,' as our Saviour says; or that he is
   speaking of the law as corrupted by the Pharisee, or overlaid by Jewish
   traditions. The Apostle is not contrasting, as we are apt to do, Moses
   and the prophets with the additions of those who sat in Moses' seat.
   The same law which is holy, and good, and just, is also the strength of
   sin.

   There is another kind of language used respecting the law in Scripture
   which is very familiar, and seems to be as natural to our preconceived
   notions as the passage which we are now considering is irreconcilable
   with them. The law is described as the preparation of the Gospel; the
   first volume of the book, the other half of Divine Revelation. It is
   the veil on the face of Moses which obscured the excess of light, as
   the Apostle himself says in the Epistle to the Corinthians; or the
   schoolmaster to bring men to Christ, as in the Galatians; or the shadow
   of good things to come, as in the Hebrews. But all these figures of
   speech can only be cited here to point out how different the conception
   in them is from that which is implied in such words as The strength of
   sin is the law.' In these latter we have not the light shining more and
   more unto the perfect day, but the light and darkness; that is, the
   Gospel and the law opposed, as it were two hemispheres, dividing time
   and the world and the human heart.

   Nor, again, if we consider the law in its immediate workings on the
   mind, as it might seem to be struggling within for mastery over the
   Gospel, as we may imagine Catholicism and Protestantism in the mind of
   Luther or of a modern convert, do we make a nearer approach to the
   solution of our difficulty. Even Luther, when denouncing the Pope as
   Antichrist, would not have spoken of the Catholic faith as the strength
   of sin. Still less would he have one instant described it as holy,
   just, and good,' and in the next as deceiving and slaying him. The
   struggle between one religion and another, or, even without any
   conflict of creeds, between hope and despair, may trouble the
   conscience, may enfeeble the will, may darken the intellect; still no
   sober-minded man would think of attributing his sins to having passed
   through such a struggle.

   Once more, parallels from heathen authors, such as Nitimur in vetitum
   semper,' and the witness of the heart against itself, that it is evil
   continually,' have been quoted in illustration of the verse placed at
   the beginning of this Essay. The aphorisms alluded to are really
   metaphorical expressions, intended by satirists and moralists to state
   forcibly that men are prone to err, not that law is provocative or the
   cause of sin. Mankind offend in various ways, and from different
   motives--ambition, vanity, selfishness, passion--but not simply from
   the desire to break the law, or to offend nod. So, again, as we
   multiply laws, we may seem to multiply offences: the real truth is,
   that as offences multiply the laws multiply also. To break the law for
   the sake of doing so, is not crime or sin, but madness. Nor, again,
   will it do to speak of the perversity of the human will--of men like
   children, doing a thing because, as we say in familiar language, they
   are told not to do it. This perversity consists simply in knowing the
   better and choosing the worse, in passion prevailing over reason. The
   better is not the cause of their choosing the worse, nor is reason
   answerable for the dictates of passion, which would be the parallel
   required.

   All these, then, we must regard as half-explanations, which fail to
   reach the Apostle's meaning. When we ask what he can mean by saying
   that the law is the strength of sin,' it is no answer to reply, that
   the law was imperfect or transient, that it could not take away sin,
   that it had been made of none effect by tradition, that its ceremonial
   observances were hypocritical and unmeaning; or that we, too, use
   certain metaphorical expressions, which, however different in sense,
   have a sound not unlike the words of the Apostle. We require an
   explanation that goes deeper, which does not pare away the force of the
   expression, such as can be gathered only from the Apostle himself, and
   the writings of his time. The point of view from which we regard things
   may begin to turn round; to understand the meaning of the law, we may
   have to place ourselves within the circle of its influences; to
   understand the nature of sin, we may be compelled to imagine ourselves
   in the very act of sinning: this inversion of our ordinary modes of
   thought may be the only means of attaining the true and natural sense
   of the Apostle's words.

   We are commencing an inquiry which lacks the sustaining interest of
   controversy, the data of which are metaphysical reasonings and points
   of view which cannot be even imagined without a considerable effort of
   mind, and which there will be the more indisposition to admit, as they
   run counter to the popular belief that the Bible is a book easily and
   superficially intelligible. Such feelings are natural; we are jealous
   of those who wrap up in mystery the Word of life, who carry us into an
   atmosphere which none else can breathe. We cannot be too jealous of
   Kant or Fichte, Schelling or Hegel, finding their way into the
   interpretation of Scripture. As jealous should we be also of any
   patristic or other system which draws away its words from their natural
   meaning. Still the Scripture has difficulties not brought but found
   there, a few words respecting which will pave the way for the inquiry
   on which we are entering.

   The Bible is at once the easiest and the hardest of books. The easiest,
   in that it gives us plain rules for moral and religious duties which he
   that runs can read, an example that every one can follow, a work that
   any body may do. But it is the hardest also, in that it is fragmentary,
   written in a dead language, and referring to times and actions of which
   in general we have no other record, and, above all, using modes of
   thought and often relating to spiritual states, which amongst ourselves
   have long ceased to exist, or the influence of institutions which have
   passed away. Who can supply the external form of the primitive Church
   of the first century, whether in its ritual or discipline, from the
   brief allusions of the Gospels and Epistles? Who can imagine the mind
   of the first believers, as they sat with their lamps lighted and their
   loins girded,' waiting for the reappearance of the Lord? Who describe
   the prophesyings or speaking with tongues, or interpretation of
   tongues? Who knows the spirit of a man who consciously recognizes in
   his ordinary life the inward workings of a Divine power? The first
   solution of such difficulties is to admit them, to acknowledge that the
   world in which we live is not the world of the first century, and that
   the first Christians were not like ourselves.

   Nor is this difficulty less, but greater, in reference to words which
   are common to us and to them, which are used by both with a certain
   degree of similarity, and with a sort of analogy to other words which
   puts us off our guard, and prevents our perceiving the real change of
   meaning. Such is the case with the words church, priest, sacrifice, and
   in general with words taken from the Mosaic dispensation; above all,
   with the word law.' Does not common sense teach us that whatever St.
   Paul meant by law, he must have meant something hard to us to
   understand, to whom the law has no existence, who are Europeans, not
   Orientals? to whom the law of the land is no longer the immediate
   direct law of God, and who can form no idea of the entanglements and
   perplexities which the attempt to adapt the law of Mount Sinai to an
   altered world must have caused to the Jew? Is it not certain that
   whenever we use the word law' in its theological acceptation, we shall
   give it a meaning somewhat different from that of the Apostle? We
   cannot help doing so. Probably we may sum it up under the epithet moral
   or ceremonial,' or raise the question to which of these the Apostle
   refers, forgetting that they are distinctions which belong to us, but
   do not belong to him. The study of a few pages of the Mischna, which
   mounts up nearly to the time of the Apostles, would reveal to us how
   very far our dim indefinite notion of the law' falls short of that
   intense life and power and sacredness which were attributed to it by a
   Jew of the first century; as well as how little conception he had of
   the fundamental distinctions which theologians have introduced
   respecting it.

   But the consideration of these difficulties does not terminate with
   themselves; they lead us to a higher idea of Scripture; they compel us
   to adapt ourselves to Scripture, instead of adapting Scripture to
   ourselves. In the ordinary study of the sacred volume, the chief
   difficulty is the accurate perception of the connexion. The words lie
   smoothly on the page; the road is trite and worn. Only just here and
   there we stumble over an impediment; as it were a stone lying not
   loose, but deeply embedded in the soil; which is the indication of a
   world below just appearing on the surface. Such are many passages in
   the Epistles of St. Paul. There is much that we really understand, much
   that we appear to understand, which has, indeed, a deceitful congruity
   with words and thoughts of our own day. Some passages remain
   intractable. From these latter we obtain the pure ore; here, if
   anywhere, are traces of the peculiar state and feelings of the Church
   of the Apostles, such as no after age could invent, or even understand.
   It is to these we turn, not for a rule of conduct, but for the inner
   life of Apostles and Churches; rejecting nothing as designedly strange
   or mysterious, satisfied with no explanation that does violence to the
   language, not suffering our minds to be diverted from the point of the
   difficulty, comparing one difficulty with another; seeking the answer,
   not in ourselves and in the controversies of our own day, but in the
   Scripture and the habits of thought of the age; collecting every
   association that beam upon it, and gathering up each fragment that
   remains. that nothing be lost; at the same time acknowledging how
   defective our knowledge really is, not merely in that general sense in
   which all human knowledge is feeble and insufficient, but in the
   particular one of our actual ignorance of the facts and persons and
   ways of thought of the age in which the Gospel came into the world.

   The subject of the present Essay is suggestive of the following
   questions:--What did St. Paul mean by the law, and what by sin?' Is the
   Apostle speaking from the experience of his own heart and the feelings
   of his age and country, or making an objective statement for mankind in
   general, of what all men do or ought to feel?' Is there anything in his
   circumstances, as a convert from the law to the Gospel, that gives the
   words a peculiar force?' And lastly, we may inquire what application
   may be made of them to ourselves: whether, now that the law is dead to
   us, and we to the law,' the analogy of faith suggests anything, either
   in our social state or in our physical constitution or our speculative
   views, which stands in the same relation to us that the law did to the
   first converts?

   First, then, as has been elsewhere remarked, the law includes in itself
   different and contradictory aspects. It is at once the letter of the
   book of the law, and the image of law in general. It is alive, and yet
   dead; it is holy, just, and good, and yet the law of sin and death. It
   is without and within at the same time; a power like that of conscience
   is ascribed to it, and yet he who is under its power feels that he is
   reaching towards something without him which can never become a part of
   his being. In its effect on individuals it may be likened to a sword
   entering into the soul, which can never knit together with flesh and
   blood. In relation to the world at large, it is a prison in which men
   are shut up. As the Jewish nation is regarded also as an individual; as
   the kingdom of heaven is sometimes outward and temporal, sometimes
   inward and spiritual, used in reference either to the spread of the
   Gospel, or the second coming of Christ; as the parables of Christ admit
   of a similar double reference; in like manner, the law has its double
   senses.' It is national and individual at once; the law given on Mount
   Sinai, and also a rule of conduct. It is the schoolmaster unto Christ,
   and yet the great enemy of the Gospel; added to make men transgress,
   and yet affording the first knowledge of truth and holiness; applying
   to the whole people and to the world of the past, and also to each
   living man; though a law, and therefore concerned with actions only,
   terrible to the heart and conscience, requiring men to perform all
   things, and enabling them to accomplish nothing.

   This ambiguity in the use of the word law' first occurs in the Old
   Testament itself. In the prophecies and psalms, as well as in the
   writings of St. Paul, the law is in a great measure ideal. When the
   Psalmist spoke of meditating in the law of the Lord,' he was not
   thinking of the five books of Moses. The law which he delighted to
   contemplate was not written down (as well might we imagine that the
   Platonic idea was a treatise on philosophy); it was the will of God,
   the truth of God, the justice and holiness of God. In later ages the
   same feelings began to gather around the volume of the law itself. The
   law was ideal still; but with this idealism were combined the reference
   to its words, and the literal enforcement of its precepts. That it was
   the law of God was a solemn thought to those who violated the least of
   its commandments; and yet its commandments were often such as in a
   changed world it was impossible to obey. It needed interpreters before
   it could be translated into the language of daily life. Such a law
   could have little hold on practice; but it had the greatest on ideas.
   It was the body of truth, the framework of learning and education, the
   only and ultimate appeal in all controversies. Even its entire disuse
   did not prevent the Rabbis from discussing with animosity nice
   questions of minute detail. In Alexandria especially, which was far
   removed from Jerusalem and the scenes of Jewish history, such an
   idealizing tendency was carried to the uttermost. Whether there was a
   temple or not, whether there were sacrifices or not, whether there were
   feasts or not, mattered little; there was the idea of a temple, the
   idea of feasts, the idea of sacrifices. Whether the Messiah actually
   came or not mattered little, while he was discernible to the mystic in
   every page of the law. The Jewish religion was beginning to rest on a
   new basis which, however visionary it may seem to us, could not be
   shaken any more than the clouds of heaven, even though one stone were
   not left upon another.

   This idealizing tendency of his age we cannot help tracing in St. Paul
   himself. As to the Jew of Alexandria the law became an ideal rule of
   truth and right, so to St. Paul after his conversion it became an ideal
   form of evil. As there were many Antichrists, so also there were many
   laws, and none of them absolutely fallen away from their Divine
   original. In one point of view, the fault was all with the law; in
   another point of view, it was all with human nature; the law ideal and
   the law actual, the law as it came from God and the law in its
   consequences to man, are ever crossing each other. It was the nature of
   the law to be good and evil at once; evil, because it was good; like
   the pillar of cloud and fire, which was its image, light by night and
   darkness by day--light and darkness in successive instants.

   But, as the law seems to admit of a wider range of meaning than we
   should at first sight have attributed to it, so also the word sin' has
   a more extended sense than our own use of it implies. Sin with us is a
   definite act or state. Any crime or vice considered in reference to God
   may be termed sin; or, according to another use of it, which is more
   general and abstract, sin is the inherent defect of human nature, or
   that evil state in which, even without particular faults or vices, we
   live. None of these senses includes that peculiar aspect in which it is
   regarded by St. Paul. Sin is with him inseparable from the
   consciousness of sin. It is not only the principle of evil, working
   blindly in the human heart, but the principle of discord and
   dissolution piercing asunder the soul and spirit. He who has felt its
   power most is not the perpetrator of the greatest crimes, a Caligula or
   Nero; but he who has suffered most deeply from the spiritual combat,
   who has fallen into the abyss of despair, who has the sentence of death
   in himself, who is wringing his hands and crying aloud in his agony, O
   wretched man that I am!' Sin is not simply evil, but intermediate
   between evil and good, implying always the presence of God within,
   light revealing darkness, life in the corruption of death; it is the
   soul reflecting upon itself in the moment of commission of sin. If we
   are surprised at St. Paul regarding the law--holy, just, and good as it
   was--as almost sin, we must remember that sin itself, if the expression
   may be excused, as a spiritual state, has a good element in it. It is
   the voice of despair praying to God, Who shall deliver me from the body
   of this death!' It approximates to the law at the very instant in which
   it is repelled from it.

   There are physical states in which the body is exquisitely sensitive to
   pain, which are not the sign of health, but of disease. So also there
   are mental states in which the sense of sin and evil, and the need of
   forgiveness, press upon us with an unusual heaviness. Such is the state
   which the Scriptures describe by the words, they were pricked to the
   heart,' when whole multitudes m sympathy with each other felt the need
   of a change, and in the extremity of their suffering were saved,
   looking on the Lord Jesus. No such spiritual agonies occur in the daily
   life of all men. Crimes and vices and horrid acts there are, but not
   that of which the Apostle speaks. That which he sums up in a moment of
   time, which may be compared to the last struggle when we are upon the
   confines of two worlds, of which we are so intensely conscious that it
   is impossible for us permanently to retain the consciousness of it, is
   Sin.'

   As there could be no sin if we were wholly unconscious of it, as
   children or animals are in a state of innocence, as the heathen world
   we ourselves regard as less guilty or responsible than those who have a
   clearer light in the dispensation of the Gospel, so in a certain point
   of view sin may be regarded as the consciousness of sin. It is this
   latter which makes sin to be what it is, which distinguishes it from
   crime or vice, which links it with our personality. The first state
   described by the Roman satirist--

   At stupet hic vitio et fibris increvit opimum
   Pingue; caret culpâ; nescit quid perdat,'--

   is the reverse of what the Apostle means by the life of sin. In
   ordinary language, vices, regarded in reference to God, are termed
   sins; and we attempt to arouse the child or the savage to a right sense
   of his unconscious acts by so terming them. But, in the Apostle's
   language, consciousness is presupposed in the sin itself; not reflected
   on it from without. That which gives it the nature of sin is
   conscientia peccati. As Socrates, a little inverting the ordinary view
   and common language of mankind, declared all virtue to be knowledge; so
   the language of St. Paul implies all sin to be the knowledge of sin.
   Conscientia peccati peccatum ipsum est.

   It is at this point the law enters, not to heal the wounded soul, but
   to enlarge its wound. The law came in that the offence might abound.
   Whatever dim notion of right and wrong pre-existed; whatever sense of
   physical impurity may have followed, in the language of the Book of
   Job, one born in sin; whatever terror the outpouring of the vials of
   God's wrath, in the natural world, may have infused into the soul--all
   this was heightened and defined by the law of God. In comparison with
   this second state, it might be said of the previous one, Sin is not
   imputed where there is no law,' and man was alive without the law once;
   but when the law came, sin revived, and he died.' The soul condemned
   itself, it was condemned by the law, it is in the last stage of decay
   and dissolution.

   If from the Apostle's ideal point of view we regard the law, not as the
   tables given on Mount Sinai, or the books of Moses, but as the law
   written on the heart, the difficulty is, not how we are to identify the
   law with the consciousness of sin, but how we are to distinguish them.
   They are different aspects of the same thing, related to each other as
   positive and negative, two poles of human nature turned towards God, or
   away from Him. In the language of metaphysical philosophy, we say that
   the subject is identical with the object;' in the same way sin implies
   the law. The law written on the heart, when considered in reference to
   the subject, is simply the conscience. The conscience, in like manner,
   when conceived of objectively, as words written down in a book, as a
   rule of life which we are to obey, becomes the law. For the sake of
   clearness we may express the whole in a sort of formula. Sin = the
   consciousness of sin = the law.' From this last conclusion the Apostle
   only stops short from the remembrance of the Divine original of the
   law, and the sense that what made it evil to him was the fact that it
   was in its own nature good.

   Wide, then, as might at first have seemed to be the interval between
   the law and sin, we see that they have their meeting point in the
   conscience. Yet their opposition and identity have a still further
   groundwork or reflection in the personal character and life of the
   Apostle.

   I. The spiritual combat, in the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the
   Romans, which terminates with the words, O wretched man that I am! who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God, through
   Jesus Christ our Lord,' is the description, in a figure, of the
   Apostle's journey to Damascus. Almost in a moment he passed from
   darkness to light. Nothing could be more different or contrasted than
   his after life and his former life. In his own language he might be
   described as cut in two by the sword of the Spirit; his present and
   previous states were like good and evil, light and darkness, life and
   death. It accords with what we know of human feelings, that this
   previous state should have a kind of terror for him, and should be
   presented to his mind, not as it appeared at the time when he thought,
   verily, that he ought to do many things against Jesus of Nazareth,' but
   as it afterwards seemed, when he counted himself to be the least of the
   Apostles, because twenty years before he had persecuted the Church of
   God; when he was amazed at the goodness of God in rescuing the chief of
   sinners. The life which he had once led was the law.' He thought of it,
   indeed, sometimes as the inspired word, the language of which he was
   beginning to invest with a new meaning; but more often as an ideal form
   of evil, the chain by which he had been bound, the prison in which he
   was shut up. And long after his conversion the shadow of the law seemed
   to follow him at a distance, and threatened to overcast his heaven;
   when, with a sort of inconsistency for one assured of the crown,' he
   speaks of the trouble of spirit which overcame him, and of the sentence
   of death in himself.

   II. In another way the Apostle's personal history gives a peculiar
   aspect to his view of the law. On every occasion, at every turn of his
   life, on his first return to Jerusalem, when preaching the Gospel in
   Asia and Greece, in the great struggle between Jewish and Gentile
   Christians--his persecutors were the Jews, his great enemy the law. Is
   it surprising that this enmity should have been idealized by him? that
   the law within and the law without should have blended in one? that his
   own remembrances of the past should be identified with that spirit of
   hatred and fanaticism which he saw around him? Not only when he looked
   back to his past life, and the weak and beggarly elements' to which he
   had been in bondage, but also when he saw the demoniac spirit which,
   under the name of Judaism, arrayed itself against the truth, might he
   repeat the words--the strength of sin is the law.' And, placing these
   words side by side with other expressions of the Apostle's, such as, We
   wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
   against powers, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places,' we
   can understand how heretics of the second century, who regarded the law
   and the Old Testament as the work of an evil principle, were induced to
   attach themselves specially to St. Paul.

   III. The Gospel of St. Paul was a spirit, not a law; it nowhere
   enjoined the observance of feasts and sacrifices, and new moons and
   Sabbaths, but was rather antagonistic to them; it was heedless of
   externals of any kind, except as matter of expediency and charity. It
   was a Gospel which knew of no distinction of nations or persons; in
   which all men had the offer of grace, mercy, and peace from the Lord
   Jesus Christ;' which denounced the oldness of the letter; which
   contrasted the tables of stone with fleshy tables of the heart;' which
   figured Christ taking the handwriting of ordinances and nailing them to
   His cross; which put faith in the place of works, and even prohibited
   circumcision. Such a Gospel was in extreme antagonism to the law. Their
   original relation was forgotten; the opposition between them insensibly
   passed into an opposition of good and evil. And yet a new relation
   sprang up also. For the law, too, witnessed against itself; and, to the
   Apostle interpreting its words after the manner of his age, became the
   allegory of the Gospel.

   IV. Once more: it may be observed (see note on the Imputation of the
   Sin of Adam), that the place which the law occupies in the teaching of
   St. Paul is analogous to that which the doctrine of original sin holds
   in later writings. It represents the state of wrath and bondage out of
   which men pass into the liberty of the children of God. It is the state
   of nature to the Jew; it is also a law of sin to him; he cannot help
   sinning, and this very impotency is the extremity of guilt and despair.
   Similar expressions respecting original sin are sometimes used among
   ourselves; though not wholly parallel, they may nevertheless assist in
   shadowing forth the Apostle's meaning.

   V. It is not, however, to the life of the Apostle, or to the circle of
   theological doctrines, that we need confine ourselves for illustration
   of the words, the strength of sin is the law.' Morality also shows us
   many ways in which good and evil meet together, and truth and error
   seem inseparable from each other. We cannot do any thing good without
   some evil consequences indirectly flowing from it; we cannot express
   any truth without involving ourselves in some degree of error, or
   occasionally conveying an impression to others wholly erroneous. Human
   characters and human ideas are always mixed and limited; good and truth
   ever drag evil and error in their train. Good itself may be regarded as
   making evil to be what it is, if, as we say, they are relative terms,
   and the disappearance of the one would involve the disappearance of the
   other. And there are many things, in which not only may the old adage
   be applied--Corruptio optimi pessima,' but in which the greatest good
   is seen to be linked with the worst evil, as, for example, the holiest
   affections with the grossest sensualities, or a noble ambition with
   crime and unscrupulousness; even religion seems sometimes to have a
   dark side, and readily to ally itself with immorality or with cruelty.

   Plato's kingdom of evil (Rep. I.) is not unlike the state into which
   the Jewish people passed during the last few years before the taking of
   the city. Of both it might be said, in St. Paul's language, the law is
   the strength of sin.' A kingdom of pure evil, as the Greek philosopher
   observed, there could not be; it needs some principle of good to be the
   minister of evil; it can only be half wicked, or it would destroy
   itself. We may say the same of the Jewish people. Without the law it
   never could have presented an equally signal example either of sin or
   of vengeance. The nation, like other nations, would have yielded
   quietly to the power of Rome; it would have died the death of all men.'
   But the spirit which said, We have a law, and by our law he ought to
   die,' recoiled upon itself; the intense fanaticism which prevented men
   from seeing the image of love and goodness in that Divine form, bound
   together for destruction a whole people, to make them a monument to
   after ages of a religion that has outlived itself.

   VI. The law and the Gospel may be opposed, according to a modern
   distinction, as positive and moral. Moral precepts are distinguished
   from positive, as precepts the reasons of which we see from those the
   reasons of which we do not see.' Moral precepts may be regarded as the
   more general, while positive precepts fill up the details of the
   general principle, and apply it to circumstances. Every positive
   precept involves not merely a moral obligation to obey it so far as it
   is just, but a moral law, which is its ultimate basis. It will often
   happen that what was at first just and right may in the course of ages
   become arbitrary and tyrannical, if the enforcement of it continue
   after the reason for it has ceased. Or, as it may be expressed more
   generally, the positive is ever tending to become moral, and the moral
   to become positive; the positive to become moral, in so far as that
   which was at first a mere external command has acquired such authority,
   and so adapted itself to the hearts of men, as to have an internal
   witness to it, as in the case of the fourth commandment; the moral to
   become positive, where a law has outlived itself, and the state of
   society to which it was adapted and the feelings on which it rested
   have passed away.

   The latter was the case with the Jewish law. It had once been moral,
   and it had become positive. Doubtless, for the minutest details, the
   colours of the sanctuary, the victims offered in sacrifice, there had
   once been reasons; but they had been long since forgotten, and if
   remembered would have been unintelligible. New reasons might be given
   for them; the oldness of the letter might be made to teach a new lesson
   after the lapse of a thousand years; but in general the law was felt to
   be a burden that neither they nor their fathers were able to bear.'
   Side by side with it another religion had sprung up, the religion of
   the prophets first, and of the zealots afterwards; religions most
   different indeed from each other, yet equally different from the law;
   in the first of which the voice of God in man seemed to cry aloud
   against sacrifice and offering, and to proclaim the only true offering,
   to do justice and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God; while in
   the second of them the national faith took the form of a fanatical
   patriotism. And yet the law still remained as a body of death, with its
   endless routine of ceremonial, its numberless disputes, its obsolete
   commands, never suffering the worshipper to be free, and enforcing its
   least detail with the curses of the book of the law and the terrors of
   Mount Sinai.

   Much of this burden would have been taken off, had there existed among
   the Jews the distinction which is familiar to ourselves of a moral and
   ceremonial law. They would then have distinguished between the
   weightier matters of the law and the tithe of mint, anise, and cumin.'
   Such distinctions are great peace-makers;' they mediate between the
   present and the past. But in Judaism all was regarded as alike of
   Divine authority, all subjected the transgressor to the same penalty.
   He who offended in one point was guilty of all;' the least penalty was,
   in a figure, death,' and there was no more for the greatest offences.
   The infringement of any positive command tortured the conscience with a
   fearful looking for of judgement; the deepest moral guilt could do no
   more. Such a religion could only end in hypocrisy and inhumanity, in
   verily believing that the law demanded His death, in whom only the law
   was fulfilled.'

   Let us imagine, in contrast with this, the Gospel with its
   spiritualizing humanizing influences, soothing the soul of man, the
   source of joy, and love, and peace. It is a supernatural power, with
   which the elements themselves bear witness, endowed with a fullness of
   life, and imparting life to all who receive it. It is not a law to
   which the will must submit, but an inward principle which goes before
   the will; it is also a moral principle to which the heart and
   conscience instantly assent, which gives just what we want, and seems
   to set us right with the world, with ourselves, and with God. Yet, in a
   figure, it is a law also; but in a very different sense from that of
   Moses: a law within, and not without us; a law of the Spirit of life,
   not of death; of freedom, not of slavery; of blessing, not of cursing;
   of mercy, not of vengeance: a law which can be obeyed, not one to
   which, while it exacts punishment, obedience is impossible. When we
   look upon this picture, and upon that, is it strange that one who was
   filled with the mind of Christ should have regarded the law as the
   strength of sin ?

   Of what has been said, the sum is as follows:--When St. Paul speaks of
   the law as the strength of sin,' he uses the term law partly for law in
   general, but more especially for the burden of the Jewish law on the
   conscience; when he speaks of sin, he means chiefly the consciousness
   of sin, of which it may be truly said, Where there is no law, there is
   no transgression; and sin is not imputed where there is no law.'
   Thirdly, he speaks of the law from his own spiritual experience of
   fears within, and of fightings without;' and from a knowledge of his
   own countrymen, who please not God, but are contrary to all men.'
   Fourthly, he conceives the law as an ideal form of evil, analogous to
   original sin in the language of a later theology. Lastly, if there be
   anything apparently contradictory or to us unintelligible in his manner
   of speaking of the law, we must attribute this to the modes of thought
   of his age, which blended many things that are to us separate. Had St.
   Paul distinguished between the law and conscience, or between the law
   and morality, or between the moral and ceremonial portions of the law
   itself, or between the law in its first origin and in the practice of
   his own age, he would perhaps have confined the law to a good sense, or
   restricted its use to the books of Moses, and not have spoken of it in
   one verse as holy, just, and good,' and in the next as being the means
   of deceiving and slaying him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In another sense than that in which the Apostle employs the words, the
   law is dead to us, and we to the law.' The lapse of ages has but
   deepened the chasm which separates Judaism from Christianity. Between
   us and them there is a gulf fixed, so that few are they who pass from
   them to us, nor do any go from us to them. The question remains, What
   application is it possible for us to make of that which has preceded?
   Is there anything in the world around standing in the same relation to
   us that the law did to the contemporaries of St. Paul?

   One answer that might be given is, the Roman Catholic Church.' The
   experience of Luther seems indeed not unlike that struggle which St.
   Paul describes. But whatever resemblance may be found between Romanism
   and the ancient Jewish religion--whether in their ceremonial or
   sacrificial character, or in the circumstance of their both resting on
   outward and visible institutions, and so limiting the worship of Spirit
   and truth--it cannot be said that Romanism stands in the same relation
   to us individually that the law did to the Apostle St. Paul. The real
   parallels are more general, though less obvious. The law St. Paul
   describes as without us, but not in that sense in which an object of
   sense is without us: though without us it exercises an inward power; it
   drives men to despair; it paralyzes human nature; it causes evil by its
   very justice and holiness. It is like a barrier which we cannot pass; a
   chain wherewith a nation is bound together; a rule which is not adapted
   to human feelings, but which guides them into subjection to itself.

   It has been already remarked that a general parallel to the law as the
   strength of sin' is to be found in that strange blending of good and
   evil, of truth and error, which is the condition of our earthly
   existence. But there seem also to be cases in which the parallel is yet
   closer; in which good is not only the accidental cause of evil, but the
   limiting principle which prevents man from working out to the uttermost
   his individual and spiritual nature. In some degree, for example,
   society may exercise the same tyranny over us, and its conventions be
   stumbling-blocks to us of the same kind as the law to the
   contemporaries of St. Paul; or, in another way, the thought of self and
   the remembrance of our past life may deceive and slay us.' As in the
   description of the seventh chapter of the Romans--It was I, and it was
   not I; and who can deliver me from the influence of education and the
   power of my former self?' Or faith and reason, reason and faith may
   seem mutually to limit each other, and to make the same opposition in
   speculation that the law and the flesh did to the Apostle in practice.
   Or, to seek the difficulty on a lower level, while fully assured of the
   truths of the gospel, we may seem to be excluded from them by our
   mental or bodily constitution, which no influences of the Spirit or
   power of habit may be capable of changing.

   1. The society even of a Christian country--and the same remark applies
   equally to a Church--is only to a certain extent based upon Christian
   principle. It rests neither on the view that all mankind are evil, nor
   that they are all good, but on certain motives, supposed to be strong
   enough to bind mankind together; on institutions handed down from
   former generations; on tacit compacts between opposing parties and
   opinions. Every government must tolerate, and therefore must to a
   certain degree sanction, contending forms of faith. Even in reference
   to those more general principles of truth and justice which, in theory
   at least, equally belong to all religions, the government is limited by
   expediency, and seeks only to enforce them so far as is required for
   the preservation of society. Hence arises a necessary opposition
   between the moral principles of the individual and the political
   principles of a state. A good man may be sensitive for his faith,
   zealous for the honour of God, and for every moral and spiritual good;
   the statesman has to begin by considering the conditions of human
   society. Aristotle raises a famous question, whether the good citizen
   is the good man? We have rather to raise the question, whether the good
   man is the good citizen? If matter's of state are to be determined by
   abstract principles of morality and religion--if, for the want of such
   principles, whole nations are to be consigned to the vengeance of
   heaven--if the rule is to be not my kingdom is not of this world,' but,
   we ought to obey God rather than man'--there is nothing left but to
   supersede civil society, and found a religious one in its stead.

   It is no imaginary spectre that we are raising, but one that acts
   powerfully on the minds of religious men. Is it not commonly said by
   many, that the government is unchristian, that the legislature is
   unchristian, that all governments and all legislatures are the enemies
   of Christ and His Church? Herein to them is the fixed evil of the
   world; not in vice, or in war, or in injustice, or in falsehood; but
   simply in the fact that the constitution of their country conforms to
   the laws of human society. It is not necessary to suppose that they
   will succeed in carrying out their principles, or that a civilized
   nation will place its liberties in the keeping of a religious party.
   But, without succeeding, they do a great deal of harm to themselves and
   to the world. For they draw the mind away from the simple truths of the
   Gospel to manifestations of opinion and party spirit; they waste their
   own power to do good; some passing topic of theological controversy
   drains their life. We may not do evil that good may come,' they say;
   and what is morally wrong cannot be politically right;' and with this
   misapplied syllogism of the conscience' they would make it impossible,
   in the mixed state of human affairs, to act at all, either for good or
   evil. He who seriously believes that not for our actual sins, but for
   some legislative measure of doubtful expediency, the wrath of God is
   hanging over his country, is in so unreal a state of mind as to be
   scarcely capable of discerning the real evils by which we are
   surrounded. The remedies of practical ills sink into insignificance
   compared with some point in which the interests of religion appear to
   be, but are not, concerned.

   But it is not only in the political world that imaginary forms of evil
   present themselves, and we are haunted by ideas which can never be
   carried out in practice; the difficulty comes nearer home to most of us
   in our social life. If governments and nations appear unchristian, the
   appearance of society itself is in a certain point of view still more
   unchristian. Suppose a person acquainted with the real state of the
   world in which we live and move, and neither morosely depreciating nor
   unduly exalting human nature, to turn to the image of the Christian
   Church in the New Testament, how great would the difference appear How
   would the blessing of poverty contrast with the real, even the moral
   advantages of wealth! the family of love, with distinctions of ranks!
   the spiritual, almost supernatural, society of the first Christians,
   with our world of fashion, of business, of pleasure! the community of
   goods, with our meagre charity to others! the prohibition of going to
   law before the heathen, with our endless litigation before judges of
   all religions! the cross of Christ, with our ordinary life! How little
   does the world in which we live seem to be designed for the tabernacle
   of immortal souls! How large a portion of mankind, even in a civilized
   country, appears to be sacrificed to the rest, and to be without the
   means of moral and religious improvement! How fixed, and steadfast, and
   regular do dealings of money and business appear! how transient and
   passing are religious objects! Then, again, consider how society,
   sometimes in self-defence, sets a false stamp on good and evil; as in
   the excessive punishment of the errors of women, compared with Christ's
   conduct to the woman who was a sinner. Or when men are acknowledged to
   be in the sight of God equal, how strange it seems that one should heap
   up money for another, and be dependent on him for his daily life.
   Susceptible minds, attaching themselves, some to one point some to
   another, may carry such reflections very far, until society itself
   appears evil, and they desire some primitive patriarchal mode of life.
   They are tired of conventionalities; they want, as they say, to make
   the Gospel a reality; to place all men on a religious, social, and
   political equality. In this, as in the last case, they are kicking
   against the pricks;' what they want is a society which has not the very
   elements of a social state; they do not perceive that the cause of the
   evil is human nature itself, which will not cohere without mixed
   motives and received forms and distinctions, and that Providence has
   been pleased to rest the world on a firmer basis than is supplied by
   the fleeting emotions of philanthropy, viz. self-interest. We are not,
   indeed, to sit with our arms folded, and acquiesce in human evil. But
   we must separate the accidents from the essence of this evil: questions
   of taste, things indifferent, or customary, or necessary, from the
   weightier matters of oppression, falsehood, vice. The ills of society
   are to be struggled against in such a manner as not to violate the
   conditions of society; the precepts of Scripture are to be applied, but
   not without distinctions of times and countries; Christian duties are
   to be enforced, but not identified with political principles. To see
   the world--not as it ought to be, but as it is--to be on a level with
   the circumstances in which God has placed them, to renounce the remote
   and impossible for what is possible and in their reach; above all, to
   begin within--these are the limits which enthusiasts should set to
   their aspirations after social good. It is a weary thing to be all our
   life long warring against the elements, or, like the slaves of some
   eastern lord, using our hands in a work which can only be accomplished
   by levers and machines. The physician of society should aid nature
   instead of fighting against it; he must let the world alone as much as
   he can; to a certain degree, he will even accept things as they are in
   the hope of bettering them.

   II. Mere weakness of character will sometimes afford an illustration of
   the Apostle's words. If there are some whose days are bound each to
   each by natural piety,' there are others on whom the same continuous
   power is exercised for evil as well as good; they are unable to throw
   off their former self; the sins of their youth lie heavy on them; the
   influence of opinions which they have ceased to hold discolours their
   minds. Or it may be that their weakness takes a different form, viz.
   that of clinging to some favourite resolve, or of yielding to some
   fixed idea which gets dominion over them, and becomes the limit of all
   their ideas. A common instance of this may be found in the use made by
   many persons of conscience. Whatever they wish or fancy, whatever
   course of action they are led to by some influence obvious to others,
   though unobserved by themselves, immediately assumes the necessary and
   stereotyped form of the conscientious fulfilment of a duty. To every
   suggestion of what is right and reasonable, they reply only with the
   words--their consciences will not allow it.' They do what they think
   right; they do not observe that they never seem to themselves to do
   otherwise. No voice of authority, no opinion of others, weighs with
   them when put in the scale against the dictates of what they term
   conscience. As they get older, their narrow ideas of right acquire a
   greater tenacity; the world is going on, and they are as they were. A
   deadening influence lies on their moral nature, the peculiarity of
   which is, that, like the law, it assumes the appearance of good,
   differing from the law only in being unconscious. Conscience, one may
   say, putting their own character into the form of a truth or
   commandment, has deceived and slain them.'

   Another form of conscience yet more closely resembles the principle
   described in the seventh chapter of the Romans. There is a state in
   which man is powerless to act, and is, nevertheless, clairvoyant of all
   the good and evil of his own nature. He places the good and evil
   principle before him, and is ever oscillating between them. He traces
   the labyrinth of conflicting principles in the world, and is yet
   further perplexed and entangled. He is sensitive to every breath of
   feeling, and incapable of the performance of any duty. Or take another
   example; it sometimes happens that the remembrance of past suffering,
   or the consciousness of sin, may so weigh a man down as fairly to
   paralyze his moral power. He is distracted between what he is and what
   he was; old habits and vices, and the new character which is being
   fashioned in him. Sometimes the balance seems to hang equal; he feels
   the earnest wish and desire to do rightly, but cannot hope to find
   pleasure and satisfaction in a good life; he desires heartily to
   repent, but can never think it possible that God should forgive. It is
   I, and it is not I, but sin that dwelleth in me.' I have, and have
   never ceased to have, the wish for better things, even amid haunts of
   infamy and vice.' In such language, even now, though with less fervour
   than in the first spiritual chaos of the affections,' does the soul cry
   out to God--O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
   body of this death?

   III. There is some danger of speculative difficulties presenting the
   same hindrance and stumbling-block to our own generation, that the law
   is described as doing to the contemporaries of St. Paul. As the law was
   holy, just, and good, so many of these difficulties are true, and have
   real grounds: all of them, except in cases where they spring from
   hatred and opposition to the Gospel, are at least innocent. And yet, by
   undermining received opinions, by increasing vanity and egotism,
   instead of strengthening the will and fixing the principles, their
   promulgation may become a temporary source of evil; so that, in the
   words of the Apostle, it may be said of them that, taking occasion by
   the truth, they deceive and slay men. What then? is the law sin? is
   honest inquiry wrong? God forbid! it is we ourselves who are incapable
   of receiving the results of inquiry; who will not believe unless we
   see; who demand a proof that we cannot have; who begin with appeals to
   authority, and tradition, and consequences, and, when dissatisfied with
   these, imagine that there is no other foundation on which life can
   repose but the loose and sandy structure of our individual opinions.
   Persons often load their belief in the hope of strengthening it; they
   escape doubt by assuming certainty. Or they believe under an
   hypothesis;' their worldly interests lead them to acquiesce; their
   higher intellectual convictions rebel. Opinions, hardly won from study
   and experience, are found to be at variance with early education, or
   natural temperament. Opposite tendencies grow together in the mind;
   appearing and reappearing at intervals. Life becomes a patchwork of new
   and old cloth, or like a garment which changes colour in the sun.

   It is true that the generation to which we belong has difficulties to
   contend with, perhaps greater than those of any former age; and
   certainly different from them. Some of those difficulties arise out of
   the opposition of reason and faith; the critical inquiries of which the
   Old and New Testament have been the subject, are a trouble to many; the
   circumstance that, while the Bible is the word of life for all men,
   such inquiries are open only to the few, increases the irritation. The
   habit of mind which has been formed in the study of Greek or Roman
   history may be warned off the sacred territory, but cannot really be
   prevented from trespassing; still more impossible is it to keep the
   level of knowledge at one point in Germany, at another in England.
   Geology, ethnology, historical and metaphysical criticism, assail in
   succession not the Scriptures themselves, but notions and beliefs which
   in the minds of many good men are bound up with them. The eternal
   strain to keep theology where it is while the world is going on,
   specious reconcilements, political or ecclesiastical exigencies, recent
   attempts to revive the past, and the reaction to which they have given
   birth, the contrast that everywhere arises of old and new, all add to
   the confusion. Probably no other age has been to the same extent the
   subject of cross and contradictory influences. What can be more unlike
   than the tone of sermons and of newspapers? or the ideas of men on art,
   politics, and religion, now, and half a generation ago? The thoughts of
   a few original minds, like wedges, pierce into all received and
   conventional opinions and are almost equally removed from either. The
   destruction of shams,' that is, the realization of things as they are
   amid all the conventions of thought and speech and action, is also an
   element of unsettlement. The excess of self-reflection, again, is not
   favourable to strength or simplicity of character. Every one seems to
   be employed in decomposing the world, human nature, and himself. The
   discovery is made that good and evil are mixed in a far more subtle way
   than at first sight would have appeared possible; and that even
   extremes of both meet in the same person. The mere analysis of moral
   and religious truth, the fact that we know the origin of many things
   which the last generation received on authority, is held by some to
   destroy their sacredness. Lastly, there are those who feel that all the
   doubts of sceptics put together, fall short of that great doubt which
   has insinuated itself into their minds, from the contemplation of
   mankind--saying one thing and doing another.

   It is foolish to lament over these things; it would be still more
   foolish to denounce them. They are the mental trials of the age and
   country in which God has placed us. If they seem at times to exercise a
   weakening or unsettling influence, may we not hope that increasing love
   of truth, deeper knowledge of ourselves and other men, will, in the
   end, simplify and not perplex the path of life. We may leave off in
   mature years where we began in youth, and receive not only the kingdom
   of God, but the world also, as little children.' The analysis of moral
   and religious truth may correct its errors without destroying its
   obligations. Experience of the illusions of religious feeling at a
   particular time should lead us to place religion on a foundation which
   is independent of feeling. Because the Scripture is no longer held to
   be a book of geology or ethnology, or a supernatural revelation of
   historical facts, it will not cease to be the law of our lives,
   exercising an influence over us, different in kind from the ideas of
   philosophical systems, or the aspirations of poetry or romance. Because
   the world (of which we are a part) is hypocritical and deceitful, and
   individuals go about dissecting their neighbours' motives and lives,
   that is a reason for cherishing a simple and manly temper of mind,
   which does not love men the less because it knows human nature more;
   which pierces the secrets of the heart, not by any process of anatomy,
   but by the light of an eye from which the mists of selfishness are
   dispersed.

   IV. The relation in which science stands to us may seem to bear but a
   remote resemblance to that in which the law stood to the Apostle St.
   Paul. Yet the analogy is not fanciful, but real. Traces of physical
   laws are discernible everywhere in the world around us; in ourselves
   also, whose souls are knit together with our bodies, whose bodies are a
   part of the material creation. It seems as if nature came so close to
   us as to leave no room for the motion of our will: instead of the
   inexhaustible grace of God enabling us to say, in the language of the
   Apostle, I can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me,' we
   become more and more the slaves of our own physical constitution. Our
   state is growing like that of a person whose mind is over sensitive to
   the nervous emotions of his own bodily frame. And as the
   self-consciousness becomes stronger and the contrast between faith and
   experience more vivid, there arises a conflict between the spirit and
   the flesh, nature and grace, not unlike that of which the Apostle
   speaks. No one who, instead of hanging to the past, will look forward
   to the future, can expect that natural science should stand in the same
   attitude towards revelation fifty years hence as at present. The faith
   of mankind varies from age to age; it is weaker, or it may be stronger,
   at one time than at another. But that which never varies or turns
   aside, which is always going on and cannot be driven back, is knowledge
   based on the sure ground of observation and experiment, the regular
   progress of which is itself matter of observation. The stage at which
   the few have arrived is already far in advance of the many, and if
   there were nothing remaining to be discovered, still the diffusion of
   the knowledge that we have, without new addition, would exert a great
   influence on religious and social life. Still greater is the indirect
   influence which science exercises through the medium of the arts. In
   one century a single invention has changed the face of Europe; three or
   four such inventions might produce a gulf between us and the future far
   greater than the interval which separates ancient from modern
   civilization. Doubtless God has provided a way that the thought of Him
   should not be banished from the hearts of men. And habit, and opinion,
   and prescription may last our time,' and many motives may conspire to
   keep our minds off the coming change. But if ever our present knowledge
   of geology, of languages, of the races and religions of mankind, of the
   human frame itself, shall be regarded as the starting-point of a goal
   which has been almost reached, supposing too the progress of science to
   be accompanied by a corresponding development of the mechanical arts,
   we can hardly anticipate, from what we already see, the new relation
   that will then arise between reason and faith. Perhaps the very
   opposition between them may have died away. At any rate experience
   shows that religion is not stationary when all other things are moving
   onward.

   Changes of this kind pass gradually over the world; the mind of man is
   not suddenly thrown into a state for which it is unprepared. No one has
   more doubts than he can carry; the way of life is not found to stop and
   come to an end in the midst of a volcano, or on the edge of a
   precipice. Dangers occur, not from the disclosure of any new, or
   hitherto unobserved, facts, for which, as for all other blessings, we
   have reason to be thankful to God; but from our concealment or denial
   of them, from the belief that we can make them other than they are;
   from the fancy that some a priori notion, some undefined word, some
   intensity of personal conviction, is the weapon with which they are to
   be met. New facts, whether bearing on Scripture, or on religion
   generally, or on morality, are sure to win their way; the tide refuses
   to recede at any man's bidding. And there are not wanting signs that
   the increase of secular knowledge is beginning to be met by a
   corresponding progress in religious ideas. Controversies are dying out;
   the lines of party are fading into one another; niceties of doctrine
   are laid aside. The opinions respecting the inspiration of Scripture,
   which are held in the present day by good and able men, are not those
   of fifty years ago; a change may be observed on many points, a reserve
   on still more. Formulas of reconciliation have sprung up: the Bible is
   not a book of science,' the inspired writers were not taught
   supernaturally what they could have learned from ordinary sources,'
   resting-places in the argument at which travellers are the more ready
   to halt, because they do not perceive that they are only temporary. For
   there is no real resting-place but in the entire faith, that all true
   knowledge is a revelation of the will of God. In the case of the poor
   and suffering, we often teach resignation to the accidents of life; it
   is not less plainly a duty of religious men, to submit to the progress
   of knowledge. That is a new kind of resignation, in which many
   Christians have to school themselves. When the difficulty may seem, in
   anticipation, to be greatest, they will find, with the Apostle, that
   there is a way out: The truth has made them free.'

ESSAY

    ON

THE OLD TESTAMENT

  ROMANS IV.

   Eni'ka d' an epistre'pse pro`s ku'rion, periaireitai to` ka'lumma.--2
   Cor. iii. 16.

   THUS we have reached another stage in the development of the great
   theme. The new commandment has become old; faith is taught in the Book
   of the Law. Abraham had faith in God, and it was counted to him for
   righteousness.' David spoke of the forgiveness of sins in the very
   spirit of the Gospel. The Old Testament is not dead, but alive again.
   It refers not to the past, but to the present. The truths which we
   daily feel, are written in its pages. There are the consciousness of
   sin and the sense of acceptance. There is the veiled remembrance of a
   former world, which is also the veiled image of a future one.

   To us the Old and New Testaments are two books, or two parts of the
   same book, which fit into one another, and can never be separated or
   torn asunder. They are double one against the other, and the New
   Testament is the revelation of the Old. To the first believers it was
   otherwise: as yet there was no New Testament; nor is there any trace
   that the authors of the New Testament ever expected their own writings
   to be placed on a level with the Old. We can scarcely imagine what
   would have been the feeling of St. Paul, could he have foreseen that
   later ages would look not to the faith of Abraham in the law, but to
   the Epistle to the Romans, as the highest authority on the doctrine of
   justification by faith; or that they would have regarded the allegory
   of Hagar and Sarah, in the Epistle to the Galatians, as a difficulty to
   be resolved by the inspiration of the Apostle. Neither he who wrote,
   nor those to whom he wrote, could ever have thought that words which
   were meant for a particular Church were to give life also to all
   mankind; and that the Epistles in which they occurred were one day to
   be placed on a level with the Books of Moses themselves.

   But if the writings of the New Testament were regarded by the
   contemporaries of the Apostle in a manner different from that of later
   ages, there was a difference, which it is far more difficult for us to
   appreciate, in their manner of reading the Old Testament. To them it
   was not half, but the whole, needing nothing to be added to it or to
   counteract it, but containing everything in itself. It seemed to come
   home to them; to be meant specially for their age; to be understood by
   them, as its words had never been understood before. Did not their
   hearts burn within them?' as the Apostles expounded to them the Psalms
   and Prophets. The manner of this exposition was that of the age in
   which they lived. They brought to the understanding of it, not a
   knowledge of the volume of the New Testament, but the mind of Christ.
   Sometimes they found the lesson which they sought in the plain language
   of Scripture; at other times, coming round to the same lesson by the
   paths of allegory, or seeming even in the sound of a word to catch an
   echo of the Redeemer's name. Various as are the writings of the Old
   Testament, composed by such numerous authors, at so many different
   times, so diverse in style and subject, in them all they read only--the
   truth of Christ. They read without distinctions of moral and
   ceremonial, type and antitype, history and prophecy, without inquiries
   into the original meaning or connexion of passages, without theories of
   the relation of the Old and New Testaments. Whatever contrast existed
   was of another kind, not of the parts of a book, but of the law and
   faith; of the earlier and later dispensations. The words of the book
   were all equally for their instruction; the whole volume lighted up
   with new meaning.

   What was then joined cannot now be divided or put asunder. The New
   Testament will never be unclothed of the Old. No one in later ages can
   place himself in the position of the heathen convert who learnt the
   name of Christ first, afterwards the Law and the Prophets. Such
   instances were probably rare even in the first days of the Christian
   Church. No one can easily imagine the manner in which St. Paul himself
   sets the Law over against the Gospel, and at the same time translates
   one into the language of the other. Time has closed up the rent which
   the law made in the heart of man; and the superficial resemblances on
   which the Apostle sometimes dwells, have not the same force to us which
   they had to his contemporaries. But a real unity remains to ourselves
   as well as to the Apostle, the unity not of the letter, but of the
   spirit, like the unity of life or of a human soul, which lasts on amid
   the changes of our being. The Old Testament and the New do not dovetail
   into one another like the parts of an indenture; it is a higher figure
   than this, which is needed to describe the continuity of the Divine
   work. Or rather, the simple fact is above all figures, and can receive
   no addition from philosophical notions of design, or the observation of
   minute coincidences. What we term the Old and New dispensation is the
   increasing revelation of God, amid the accidents of human history:
   first, in himself; secondly, in Ms Son, gathering not one nation only,
   but all mankind into His family. It is the vision of God himself, true
   and just, and remembering mercy in one age of the world; not ceasing to
   be true and just, but softening also into human gentleness, and love,
   and forgiveness, and making His dwelling in the human heart in another.
   The wind, and the earthquake, and the fire pass by first, and after
   that the still small voice.' This is the great fulfilment of the Law
   and the Prophets in the Gospel. No other religion has anything like it.
   And the use of language, and systems of theology, and the necessity of
   giving ideas through something,' and the prayers and thoughts of
   eighteen hundred years, have formed another connexion between the Old
   and New Testament, more accidental and outward, and also more intricate
   and complex, which is incapable of being accurately drawn out, and
   ought not to be imposed as an article of faith; which yet seems to many
   to supply a want in human nature, and gives expression to feelings
   which would otherwise be unuttered.

   It is not natural, nor perhaps possible, to us to cease to use the
   figures in which holy men of old' spoke of that which belonged to their
   peace. But it is well that we should sometimes remind ourselves, that
   all these things are a shadow, but the body is of Christ.' Framed as
   our minds are, we are ever tending to confuse that which is accidental
   with that which is essential, to substitute the language of imagery for
   the severity of our moral ideas, to entangle Divine truths in the state
   of society in which they came into the world or in the ways of thought
   of a particular age. All these things are a shadow;' that is to say,
   not only the temple and tabernacle, and the victim laid on the altar,
   and the atonement offered once a year for the sins of the nation; but
   the conceptions which later ages express by these words, so far as
   anything human or outward or figurative mingles with them, so far as
   they cloud the Divine nature with human passions, so far as they imply,
   or seem to imply, anything at variance with our notions of truth and
   right, are as much, or even more a shadow than that outward image which
   belonged to the elder dispensation. The same Lord who compared the
   scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven to a householder who brought
   forth out of his treasure things new and old, said also in a figure,
   that new cloth must not be put on an old garment' or new wine into old
   bottles.'

ESSAY

    ON THE

IMPUTATION OF THE SIN OF ADAM

  ROMANS V.

   THAT so many opposite systems of Theology seek their authority in
   Scripture is a fair proof that Scripture is different from them all.
   That is to say, Scripture often contains in germ what is capable of
   being drawn to either side; it is indistinct, where they are distinct;
   it presents two lights, where they present only one; it speaks
   inwardly, while they clothe themselves in the forms of human knowledge.
   That indistinct, intermediate, inward point of view at which the truth
   exists but in germ, they have on both sides tended to extinguish and
   suppress. Passing allusions, figures of speech, rhetorical oppositions,
   have been made the foundation of doctrinal statements, which are like a
   part of the human mind itself, and seem as if they could never be
   uprooted, without uprooting the very sentiment of religion. Systems of
   this kind exercise a constraining power, which makes it difficult for
   us to see anything in Scripture but themselves.

   For example, how slender is the foundation in the New Testament for the
   doctrine of Adam's sin being imputed to his posterity--two passages in
   St. Paul at most, and these of uncertain interpretation. The little
   cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, has covered the heavens. To reduce
   such subjects to their proper proportions, we should consider:--first,
   what space they occupy in Scripture; secondly, how far the language
   used respecting them is literal or figurative; thirdly, whether they
   agree with the more general truths of Scripture and our moral sense, or
   are not rather repugnant thereto;' fourthly, whether their origin may
   not be prior to Christianity, or traceable in the after history of the
   Church; fifthly, whether the words of Scripture may not be confused
   with logical inferences which are appended to them; sixthly, in the
   case of this and of some other doctrines, whether even poetry has not
   lent its aid to stamp them in our minds in a more definite and
   therefore different form from that in which the Apostles taught them;
   lastly, how far in our own day they are anything more than words.

   The two passages alluded to are Rom. v. 12-21; 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22;
   45-49, in both of which parallels are drawn between Adam and Christ. In
   both the sin of Adam is spoken of, or seems to be spoken of, as the
   source of death to man: As by one man's transgression sin entered into
   the world, and death by sin,' and As in Adam all die.' Such words
   appear plain at first sight; that is to say, we find in them what we
   bring to them: let us see what considerations modify their meaning. If
   we accept the Pelagian view of the passage, which refers the death of
   each man to actual sin, there is an end of the controversy. But it does
   not equally follow that, if what is termed the received interpretation
   is given to the words, the doctrine which it has been attempted to
   ground upon them would have any real foundation.

   We will suppose, then, that no reference is contained in either passage
   to actual sin.' In some other sense than this mankind are identified
   with Adam's transgression. But the question still remains, whether
   Adam's sin and death are merely the type of the sin and death of his
   posterity, or, more than this, the cause. The first explanation quite
   satisfies the meaning of the words, As in Adam all die;' the second
   seems to be required by the parallel passage in the Romans: As by one
   man sin came into the world,' and As by one man many were made
   sinners,' if taken literally.

   The question involves the more general one, whether the use of language
   by St. Paul makes it necessary that we should take his words literally
   in this passage. Is he speaking of Adam's sin being the cause of sin
   and death to his posterity, in any other sense than he spoke of Abraham
   being a father of circumcision to the uncircumcised? (chap. iv.) Yet no
   one has ever thought of basing a doctrine on these words. Or is he
   speaking of all men dying in Adam in any other sense than he says in 2
   Cor. v. 15, that if one died for all, then all died? Yet in this latter
   passage, while Christ died literally, it was only in a figure that all
   died. May he be arguing in the same way as when he infers from the word
   seed' being used in the singular, that thy seed is Christ'? Or, if we
   confine ourselves to the passage under consideration--Is the
   righteousness of Christ there imputed to believers, independently of
   their own inward holiness? and if so, should the sin of Adam be imputed
   independently of the actual sins of men?

   I. A very slight difference in the mode of expression would make it
   impossible for us to attribute to St. Paul the doctrine of the
   imputation of the sin of Adam. But we have seen before how varied, and
   how different from our own, are his modes of thought and language.
   Compare i. 4; iv. 25. To him, it was but a slight transition, from the
   identification of Adam with the sins of all mankind, to the
   representation of the sin of Adam as the cause of those sins. To us,
   there is the greatest difference between the two statements. To him, it
   was one among many figures of the same kind, to oppose the first and
   second Adam, as elsewhere he opposes the old and new man. With us, this
   figure has been singled out to be made the foundation of a most exact
   statement of doctrine. We do not remark that there is not even the
   appearance of attributing Adam's sin to his posterity, in any part of
   the Apostle's writings in which he is not drawing a parallel between
   Adam and Christ.

   II. The Apostle is not speaking of Adam as fallen from a state of
   innocence. He could scarcely have said, The first man is of the earth,
   earthy,' if he had had in his mind that Adam had previously existed in
   a pure and perfect state. He is only drawing a parallel between Adam
   and Christ. The moment we leave this parallel, all is uncertain and
   undetermined. What was the nature of that innocent life? or of the act
   of Adam which forfeited it? and how was the effect of that act
   communicated to his posterity? The minds of men in different ages of
   the world have strayed into these and similar inquiries. Difficulties
   about fate, predestination, and free-will' (not food for angels'
   thoughts) cross our path in the garden of Eden itself. But neither the
   Old or New Testament give any answer to them. Imagination has possessed
   itself of the vacant spot, and been busy, as it often is, in proportion
   to the slenderness of knowledge.

   III. There are other elements of St. Paul's teaching, which are either
   inconsistent with the imputation of Adam's sin to his posterity, or at
   any rate are so prominent as to make such a doctrine if held by him
   comparatively unimportant. According to St. Paul, it is not the act of
   Adam, but the law that

   Brought sin into the world and all our woe.'

   And the law is almost equivalent to the knowledge of sin.' But original
   sin is, or may be, wholly unconscious--the fault of nature in the
   infant equally with the man. Not so the sin of which St. Paul speaks,
   which is inseparable from consciousness, as he says himself: I was
   alive without the law once,' that is, before I came to the
   consciousness of sin.

   IV. It will be admitted that we ought to feel still greater reluctance
   to press the statement of the Apostle to its strict logical
   consequences, if we find that the language which he here uses is that
   of his age and country. Prom the circumstance of our first reading the
   doctrine of the imputation of Adam's sin to his posterity in the
   Epistles of St. Paul, we can hardly persuade ourselves that this is not
   its original source. The incidental manner in which it is alluded to
   might indeed lead us to suppose that it would scarcely have been
   intelligible, had it not been also an opinion of his time. But if this
   inference should seem doubtful, there is direct evidence to show that
   the Jews connected sin and death, and the sins and death of mankind,
   with the sin of Adam, in the same way as the Apostle. The earliest
   trace of such a doctrine is found in the apocryphal Book of Wisdom, ii.
   24: But God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of
   his own eternity. Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death
   into the world; and they that do hold of his side do find it.' And
   Eccles. xxv. 24: Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through
   her we all die.' It was a further refinement of some of their teachers,
   that when Adam sinned the whole world sinned; because, at that time,
   Adam was the whole world, or because the soul of Adam comprehended the
   souls of all, so that Adam's sin conveyed a hereditary taint to his
   posterity. It was a confusion of a half physical, half logical or
   metaphysical notion, arising in the minds of men who had not yet learnt
   the lesson of our Saviour--That which is from without defileth not a
   man.' That human nature or philosophy sometimes rose up against such
   inventions is certainly true; but it seems to be on the whole admitted,
   that the doctrine of Augustine is in substance generally agreed to by
   the Rabbis, and that there is no trace of their having derived it from
   the writings of St. Paul. Compare the passages quoted in Fritzsche,
   vol. i. pp. 293-296, and Schoettgen.

   But not only is the connexion of sin and death with each other, and
   with the sin of Adam, found in the Rabbinical writings; the type and
   antitype of the first and second Adam are also contained in them. In
   reading the first chapters of Genesis, the Jews made a distinction
   between the higher Adam, who was the light of the world, and had
   control over all things, who was mystically referred to where it is
   said, they two shall be one flesh;' and the inferior Adam, who was Lord
   only of the creation; who had the breath of life,' but not the living
   soul.' (Schoettgen, i. 512-514, 670-673.) By some, indeed, the latter
   seems to have been identified with the Messiah. By Philo, on the other
   hand, the logos is identified with the protos Adam, who is without sex,
   while the anthropos choikos is created afterwards by the help of the
   angels (De Creat. Mund. p. 30). It is not the object of this statement
   to reconcile these variations, but merely to indicate, first, that the
   idea of a first and second Adam was familiar to the Jews in the time of
   St. Paul, and that one or other of them was regarded by them as the
   Word and the Messiah.

   V. A slighter, though not less real foundation of the doctrine has been
   what may be termed the logical symmetry of the imputation of the
   righteousness of Christ and of the sin of Adam. The latter half is the
   correlative of the former; they mutually support each other. We place
   the first and second Adam in juxtaposition, and seem to see a fitness
   or reason in the one standing in the same relation to the fallen as the
   other to the saved.

   VI. It is hardly necessary to ask the further question, what meaning we
   can attach to the imputation of sin and guilt which are not our own,
   and of which we are unconscious. God can never see us other than we
   really are, or judge us without reference to all our circumstances and
   antecedents. If we can hardly suppose that He would allow a fiction of
   mercy to be interposed between ourselves and Him, still less can we
   imagine that He would interpose a fiction of vengeance. If He requires
   holiness before He will save, much more, may we say in the Apostle's
   form of speech, will He require sin before He dooms us to perdition.
   Nor can anything be in spirit more contrary to the living consciousness
   of sin of which the Apostle everywhere speaks, than the conception of
   sin as dead unconscious evil, originating in the act of an individual
   man, in the world before the flood.

   VII. A small part of the train of consequences which have been drawn
   out by divines can be made to hang even upon the letter of the
   Apostle's words, though we should not take into account the general
   temper and spirit of his writings. Logical inferences often help to
   fill up the aching void in our knowledge of the spiritual world. They
   seem necessary; in time they receive a new support from habit and
   tradition. They hide away and conceal the nature of the original
   premisses. They may be likened to the superstructure of a building
   which the foundation has not strength to bear; or, rather, perhaps,
   when compared to the serious efforts of human thought, to the plaything
   of the child who places one brick upon another in wondering suspense,
   until the whole totters and falls, or his childish fancy pleases itself
   with throwing it down. So, to apply these remarks to our present
   subject, we are contented to repeat the simple words of the Apostle, As
   in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.' Perhaps we
   may not be able to recall all the associations which they conveyed to
   his mind. But neither are we willing to affirm his meaning to be that
   the sin of one man was the cause of other men's sins, or that God
   condemned one part of the human race for a fault not their own, because
   He was going to save another part; or that original sin, as some say,
   or the guilt of original sin, as is the opinion of others, is washed
   away in baptism. There is a terrible explicitness in such language
   touching the realities of a future life which makes us shrink from
   trusting our own faculties amid far-off deductions like these. We feel
   that we are undermining, not strengthening, the foundations of the
   Gospel. We fear to take upon ourselves a burden which neither we nor
   our fathers are able to bear.' Instead of receiving such statements
   only to explain them away, or keep them out of sight, it is better to
   answer boldly in the words of the Apostle, God forbid! for how shall
   God judge the world.'

   On the whole, then, we are led to infer that in the Augustinian
   interpretation of this passage, even if it agree with the letter of the
   text, too little regard has been paid to the extent to which St. Paul
   uses figurative language, and to the manner of his age in
   interpretations of the Old Testament. The difficulty of supposing him
   to be allegorizing the narrative of Genesis is slight, in comparison
   with the difficulty of supposing him to countenance a doctrine at
   variance with our first notions of the moral nature of God.

   But when the figure is dropped, and allowance is made for the manner of
   the age, the question once more returns upon us--What is the Apostle's
   meaning?' He is arguing, we see, kat' anthropon, and taking his stand
   on the received opinions of his time. Do we imagine that his object is
   no other than to set the seal of his authority on these traditional
   beliefs? The whole analogy, not merely of the writings of St. Paul, but
   of the entire New Testament, would lead us to suppose that his object
   was not to reassert them, but to teach, through them, a new and nobler
   lesson. The Jewish Rabbis would have spoken of the first and second
   Adam; but which of them would have made the application of the figure
   to all mankind? Which of them would have breathed the quickening Spirit
   into the dry bones? The figure of the Apostle bears the impress of his
   own age and country; the interpretation of the figure is for every age,
   and for the whole world. A figure of speech it remains still, an
   allegory after the manner of that age and country, but yet with no
   uncertain or ambiguous signification. It means that God hath made of
   one blood all the nations of the earth;' and that he hath concluded all
   under sin, that he may have mercy upon all.' It means a truth deep yet
   simple--the fact which we recognize in ourselves and trace everywhere
   around us--that we are one in a common evil nature, which, if it be not
   derived from the sin of Adam, exists as really as if it were. It means
   that we shall be made one in Christ, by the grace of God, in a measure
   here, more fully and perfectly in another world. It means that Christ
   is the natural head of the human race, the author of its spiritual
   life. It shows Him to us as He enters within the veil, in form as a
   man, the first fruits of them which sleep.' It is a sign or intimation
   which guides our thoughts in another direction also, beyond the world
   of which religion speaks, to observe what science tells us of the
   interdependence of soul and body--what history tells of the chain of
   lives and events. It leads us to reflect on ourselves not as isolated,
   independent beings;--not such as we appear to be to our own narrow
   consciousness; but as we truly are--the creatures of antecedents which
   we can never know, fashioned by circumstances over which we have no
   control. The infant, coming into existence in a wonderful manner,
   inherits something, not from its parents only, but from the first
   beginning of the human race. He too is born into a family of which God
   in Christ is the Father. There is enough here to meditate upon--a
   mystery since the world was'--without the weak and beggarly' elements
   of Rabbinical lore. We may not encumber St. Paul with the things which
   he destroyed.'

ESSAY

    ON

ATONEMENT AND SATISFACTION

   Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not . . . Then said I, Lo, I come
   to do thy will, O God.'--Ps. xl. 6-8.

   THE doctrine of the Atonement has often been explained in a way at
   which our moral feelings revolt. God is represented as angry with us
   for what we never did; He is ready to inflict a disproportionate
   punishment on us for what we are; He is satisfied by the sufferings of
   His Son in our stead. The sin of Adam is first imputed to us; then the
   righteousness of Christ. The imperfection of human law is transferred
   to the Divine; or rather a figment of law which has no real existence.
   The death of Christ is also explained by the analogy of the ancient
   rite of sacrifice. He is a victim laid upon the altar to appease the
   wrath of God. The institutions and ceremonies of the Mosaical religion
   are applied to Him. He is further said to bear the infinite punishment
   of infinite sin. When He had suffered or paid the penalty, God is
   described as granting Him the salvation of mankind in return.

   I shall endeavour to show, 1. that these conceptions of the work of
   Christ have no foundation in Scripture; 2. that their growth may be
   traced in ecclesiastical history; 3. that the only sacrifice,
   atonement, or satisfaction, with which the Christian has to do, is a
   moral and spiritual one; not the pouring out of blood upon the earth,
   but the living sacrifice to do thy will, O God;' in which the believer
   has part as, well as his Lord; about the meaning of which there can be
   no more question in our day than there was in the first ages.

   § 1.

   It is difficult to concentrate the authority of Scripture on points of
   controversy. For Scripture is not doctrine but teaching; it arises
   naturally out of the circumstances of the writers; it is not intended
   to meet the intellectual refinements of modern times. The words of our
   Saviour, My kingdom is not of this world,' admit of a wide application,
   to systems of knowledge, as well as to systems of government and
   politics. The bread of life' is not an elaborate theology. The
   revelation which Scripture makes to us of the will of God, does not
   turn upon the exact use of language. (Lo, O man, he hath showed thee
   what he required of thee; to do justly and to love mercy, and to walk
   humbly with thy God.') The books of Scripture were written by different
   authors, and in different ages of the world; we cannot, therefore,
   apply them with the minuteness and precision of a legal treatise. The
   Old Testament is not on all points the same with the New; for Moses
   allowed of some things for the hardness of their hearts;' nor the Law
   with the Prophets, for there were proverbs in the house of Israel' that
   were reversed; nor does the Gospel, which is simple and universal, in
   all respects agree with the Epistles which have reference to the
   particular state of the first converts; nor is the teaching of St.
   James, who admits works as a coefficient with faith in the
   justification of man, absolutely identical with that of St. Paul, who
   asserts righteousness by faith only; nor is the character of all the
   Epistles of St. Paul, written as they were at different times amid the
   changing scenes of life, precisely the same; nor does he himself claim
   an equal authority for all his precepts. No theory of inspiration can
   obliterate these differences; or rather none can be true which does not
   admit them. The neglect of them reduces the books of Scripture to an
   unmeaning unity, and effectually seals up their true sense. But if we
   acknowledge this natural diversity of form, this perfect humanity of
   Scripture, we must, at any rate in some general way, adjust the
   relation of the different parts to one another before we apply its
   words to the establishment of any doctrine.

   Nor again is the citation of a single text sufficient to prove a
   doctrine; nor must consequences be added on, which are not found in
   Scripture, nor figures of speech reasoned about, as though they
   conveyed exact notions. An accidental similarity of expression is not
   to be admitted as an authority; nor, a mystical allusion, which has
   been gathered from Scripture, according to some method which in other
   writings the laws of language and logic would not justify. When engaged
   in controversy with Roman Catholics, about the doctrine of purgatory,
   or transubstantiation, or the authority of the successors of St. Peter,
   we are willing to admit these principles. They are equally true when
   the subject of inquiry is the atoning work of Christ. We must also
   distinguish the application of a passage in religious discourse from
   its original meaning. The more obvious explanation which is received in
   our own day, or by our own branch of the Church, will sometimes have to
   be set aside for one more difficult, because less familiar, which is
   drawn from the context. Nor is it allowable to bar an interpretation of
   Scripture from a regard to doctrinal consequences. Further, it is
   necessary that we should make allowance for the manner in which ideas
   were represented in the ages at which the books of Scripture were
   written which cannot be so lively to us as to contemporaries. Nor can
   we deny that texts may be quoted on both sides of a controversy, as for
   example, in the controversy respecting predestination. For in
   religious, as in other differences, there is often truth on both sides.

   The drift of the preceding remarks is not to show that there is any
   ambiguity or uncertainty in the witness of Scripture to the great
   truths of morality and religion. Nay, rather the universal voice of the
   Old Testament and the New proclaims that there is one God of infinite
   justice, goodness, and truth: and the writers of the New Testament
   agree in declaring that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Saviour of
   the world. There can never, by any possibility, be a doubt that our
   Lord and St. Paul taught the doctrine of a future life, and of a
   judgement, at which men would give an account of the deeds done in the
   body. It is no matter for regret that the essentials of the Gospel are
   within the reach of a child's understanding. But this clearness of
   Scripture about the great truths of religion does not extend to the
   distinctions and developments of theological systems; it rather seems
   to contrast with them. It is one thing to say that Christ is the
   Saviour of the world,' or that we are reconciled to God through
   Christ,' and another thing to affirm that the Levitical or heathen
   sacrifices typified the death of Christ; or that the death of Christ
   has a sacrificial import, and is an atonement or satisfaction for the
   sins of men. The latter positions involve great moral and intellectual
   difficulties; many things have to be considered, before we can allow
   that the phraseology of Scripture is to be caught up and applied in
   this way. For we may easily dress up in the externals of the New
   Testament a doctrine which is really at variance with the Spirit of
   Christ and His Apostles, and we may impart to this doctrine, by the
   help of living tradition, that is to say, custom and religious use, a
   sacredness yet greater than is derived from such a fallacious
   application of Scripture language. It happens almost unavoidably (and
   our only chance of guarding against the illusion is to be aware of it)
   that we are more under the influence of rhetoric in theology than in
   other branches of knowledge; our minds are so constituted that what we
   often hear we are ready to believe, especially when it falls in with
   previous convictions or wants. But he who desires to know whether the
   statements above referred to have any real objective foundation in the
   New Testament, will carefully weigh the following
   considerations:--Whether there is any reason for interpreting the New
   Testament by the analogy of the Old? Whether the sacrificial
   expressions which occur in the New Testament, and on which the question
   chiefly turns, are to be interpreted spiritually or literally? Whether
   the use of such expressions may not be a figurative mode of the time,
   which did not necessarily recall the thing signified any more than the
   popular use of the term Sacrifice' among ourselves? He will consider
   further whether this language is employed vaguely, or definitely?
   Whether it is the chief manner of expressing the work of Christ, or one
   among many? Whether it is found to occur equally in every part of the
   New Testament; for example, in the Gospels, as well as in the Epistles?
   Whether the more frequent occurrence of it in particular books, as for
   instance, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, may not be explained by the
   peculiar object or circumstances of the writer? Whether other figures
   of speech, such as death, life, resurrection with Christ, are not
   equally frequent, which have never yet been made the foundation of any
   doctrine? Lastly, whether this language of sacrifice is not applied to
   the believer as well as to his Lord, and whether the believer is not
   spoken of as sharing the sufferings of his Lord?

   I. All Christians agree that there is a connexion between the Old
   Testament and the New: Novum Testamentum in vetere latet; Vetus
   Testamentum in novo patet:' I am not come to destroy the law and the
   prophets, but to fulfil.' But, respecting the nature of the revelation
   or fulfilment which is implied in these expressions, they are not
   equally agreed. Some conceive the Old and New Testaments to be double
   one against the other;' the one being the type, and the other the
   antitype, the ceremonies of the Law, and the symbols and imagery of the
   Prophets, supplying to them the forms of thought and religious ideas of
   the Gospel. Even the history of the Jewish people has been sometimes
   thought to be an anticipation or parallel of the history of the
   Christian world; many accidental circumstances in the narrative of
   Scripture being likewise taken as an example of the Christian life. The
   relation between the Old and New Testaments has been regarded by others
   from a different point of view, as a continuous one, which may be
   described under some image of growth or development; the facts and
   ideas of the one leading on to the facts and ideas of the other; and
   the two together forming one record of the increasing purpose which
   through the ages ran.' This continuity, however, is broken at one
   point, and the parts separate and reunite like ancient and modern
   civilization, though the connexion is nearer, and of another kind; the
   Messiah, in whom the hopes of the Jewish people centre, being the
   first-born of a new creation, the Son of Man and the Son of God. It is
   necessary, moreover, to distinguish the connexion of fact from that of
   language and idea; because the Old Testament is not only the
   preparation for the New, but also the figure and expression of it.
   Those who hold the first of these two views, viz. the reduplication of
   the Old Testament in the New, rest their opinion chiefly on two
   grounds. First, it seems incredible to them, and repugnant to their
   conception of a Divine revelation, that the great apparatus of rites
   and ceremonies, with which, even at this distance of time, they are
   intimately acquainted, should have no inner and symbolical meaning;
   that the Jewish nation for many ages should have carried with it a load
   of forms only; that the words of Moses which they still hear read in
   the synagogue every sabbath-day,' and which they often read in their
   own households, should relate only to matters of outward observance;
   just as they are unwilling to believe that the prophecies, which they
   also read, have no reference to the historical events of modern times.
   And, secondly, they are swayed by the authority of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, the writer of which has made the Old Testament the allegory of
   the New.

   It will be considered hereafter what is to be said in answer to the
   last of these arguments. The first is perhaps sufficiently answered by
   the analogy of other ancient religions. It would be ridiculous to
   assume a spiritual meaning in the Homeric rites and sacrifices;
   although they may be different in other respects, have we any more
   reason for inferring such a meaning in the Mosaic? Admitting the
   application which is made of a few of them by the author of the Epistle
   to the Hebrews to be their original intention, the great mass would
   still remain unexplained, and yet they are all alike contained in the
   same Revelation. It may seem natural to us to suppose that God taught
   His people like children by the help of outward objects. But no a
   priori supposition of this kind, no fancy, however natural, of a
   symmetry or coincidence which may be traced between the Old Testament
   and the New, nor the frequent repetition of such a theory in many
   forms, is an answer to the fact. That fact is the silence of the Old
   Testament itself. If the sacrifices of the Mosaical religion were
   really symbolical of the death of Christ, how can it be accounted for
   that no trace of this symbolism appears in the books of Moses
   themselves? that prophets and righteous men of old never gave this
   interpretation to them? that the lawgiver is intent only on the sign,
   and says nothing of the thing signified? No other book is ever supposed
   to teach truths about which it is wholly silent. We do not imagine the
   Iliad and Odyssey to be a revelation of the Platonic or Socratic
   philosophy. The circumstances that these poems received this or some
   other allegorical explanation from a school of Alexandrian critics,
   does not incline us to believe that such an explanation is a part of
   their original meaning. The human mind does not work in this occult
   manner; language was not really given men to conceal their thoughts;
   plain precepts or statements do not contain hidden mysteries.

   It may be said that the Levitical rites and offerings had a meaning,
   not for the Jews, but for us, on whom the ends of the world are come.'
   Moses, David, Isaiah were unacquainted with this meaning; it was
   reserved for those who lived after the event to which they referred had
   taken place to discover it. Such an afterthought may be natural to us,
   who are ever tracing a literary or mystical connexion between the Old
   Testament and the New; it would have been very strange to us, had we
   lived in the ages before the coming of Christ. It is incredible that
   God should have instituted rites and ceremonies, which were to be
   observed as forms by a whole people throughout their history, to teach
   mankind fifteen hundred years afterwards, uncertainly and in a figure,
   a lesson which Christ taught plainly and without a figure. Such an
   assumption confuses the application of Scripture with its original
   meaning; the use of language in the New Testament with the facts of the
   Old. Further, it does away with all certainty in the interpretation of
   Scripture. If we can introduce the New Testament into the Old, we may
   with equal right introduce Tradition or Church History into the New.

   The question here raised has a very important bearing on the use of the
   figures of atonement and sacrifice in the New Testament. For if it
   could be shown that the sacrifices which were offered up in the
   Levitical worship were anticipatory only; that the law too declared
   itself to be a shadow of good things to come;' that Moses had himself
   spoken of the reproach of Christ;' in that case the slightest allusion
   in the New Testament to the customs or words of the law would have a
   peculiar interest. We should be justified in referring to them as
   explanatory of the work of Christ, in studying the Levitical
   distinctions respecting offerings with a more than antiquarian
   interest, in disputing about purifying' and modes of expiation. But if
   not; if, in short, we are only reflecting the present on the past, or
   perhaps confusing both together, and interpreting Christianity by
   Judaism, and Judaism by Christianity; then the sacrificial language of
   the New Testament loses its depth and significance, or rather acquires
   a higher, that is, a spiritual one.

   II. Of such an explanation, if it had really existed when the Mosaic
   religion was still a national form of worship, traces would occur in
   the writings of the Psalmists and the Prophets; for these furnish a
   connecting link between the Old Testament and the New. But this is not
   the case; the Prophets are, for the most part, unconscious of the law,
   or silent respecting its obligations.

   In many places, their independence of the Mosaical religion passes into
   a kind of opposition to it. The inward and spiritual truth asserts
   itself, not as an explanation of the ceremonial observance, but in
   defiance of it. The undergrowth of morality' is putting forth shoots in
   spite of the deadness of the ceremonial hull. Isaiah i. 13: Bring no
   more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons
   and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is
   iniquity, even the solemn meeting.' Micah vi. 6: Wherewith shall I come
   before the Lord, or bow myself before the high God? shall I come before
   him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be
   pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of
   oil?' Psalm l. 10: All the beasts of the forests are mine, and so are
   the cattle upon a thousand hills: If I were hungry I would not tell
   thee.' We cannot doubt that in passages like these we are bursting the
   bonds of the Levitical or ceremonial dispensation.

   The spirit of prophecy, speaking by Isaiah, does not say I will have
   mercy as well as sacrifice,' but I will have mercy and not (or rather
   than) sacrifice.' In the words of the Psalmist, Sacrifice and offering
   thou wouldest not; Then said I, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God;' The
   sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:' or again, A bruised reed shall
   he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench; he shall bring
   forth judgement unto truth:' or again, according to the image both of
   Isaiah and Jeremiah (Isa. liii. 7; Jer. xi. 19), which seems to have
   passed before the vision of John the Baptist (John i. 36), He is
   brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers
   is dumb.' These are the points at which the Old and New Testaments most
   nearly touch, the (tupoi) types or ensamples of the one which we find
   in the other, the pre-notions or preparations with which we pass from
   Moses and the Prophets to the Gospel of Christ.

   III. It is hard to imagine that there can be any truer expression of
   the Gospel than the words of Christ himself, or that any truth omitted
   by Him is essential to the Gospel. The disciple is not above his
   master, nor the servant greater than his lord.' The philosophy of Plato
   was not better understood by his followers than by himself, nor can we
   allow that the Gospel is to be interpreted by the Epistles, or that the
   Sermon on the Mount is only half Christian and needs the fuller
   inspiration or revelation of St. Paul or the author of the Epistle to
   the Hebrews. There is no trace in the words of our Saviour of any
   omission or imperfection; there is no indication in the Epistles of any
   intention to complete or perfect them. How strange would it have seemed
   in the Apostle St. Paul, who thought himself unworthy to be called an
   Apostle because he persecuted the Church of God,' to find that his own
   words were preferred in after ages to those of Christ himself!

   There is no study of theology which is likely to exercise a more
   elevating influence on the individual, or a more healing one on
   divisions of opinion, than the study of the words of Christ himself.
   The heart is its own witness to them; all Christian sects acknowledge
   them; they seem to escape or rise above the region or atmosphere of
   controversy. The form in which they exhibit the Gospel to us is the
   simplest and also the deepest; they are more free from details than any
   other part of Scripture, and they are absolutely independent of
   personal and national influences. In them is contained the expression
   of the inner life, of mankind, and of the Church; there, too, the
   individual beholds, as in a glass, the image of a goodness which is not
   of this world. To rank their authority below that of Apostles and
   Evangelists is to give up the best hope of reuniting Christendom in
   itself, and of making Christianity a universal religion.

   And Christ himself hardly even in a figure uses the word sacrifice;'
   never with the least reference to His own life or death. There are many
   ways in which our Lord describes His relation to His Father and to
   mankind. His disciples are to be one with Him, even as He is one with
   the Father; whatsoever things He seeth the Father do He doeth. He says,
   I am the resurrection and the life;' or, I am the way, the truth, and
   the life;' and, No man cometh unto the Father but by me;' and again,
   Whatsoever things ye shall ask in my name shall be given you;' and once
   again, I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
   comforter.' Most of His words are simple, like a man talking to his
   friends;' and their impressiveness and beauty partly flow from this
   simplicity. He speaks of His decease too which he should accomplish at
   Jerusalem,' but not in sacrificial language. And now I go my way to him
   that sent me;' and Greater love bath no man than this, that a man lay
   down his life for his friends.' Once indeed He says, The bread that I
   give is my flesh, which I give for the salvation of the world;' to
   which He himself adds, The words that I speak unto you they are spirit
   and they are truth,' a commentary which should be applied not only to
   these but to all other figurative expressions which occur in the New
   Testament. In the words of institution of the Lord's supper, He also
   speaks of His death as in some way connected with the remission of
   sins. But among all the figures of speech under which He describes His
   work in the world,--the vine, the good shepherd, the door, the light of
   the world, the bread of life, the water of life, the corner stone, the
   temple,--none contains any sacrificial allusion.

   The parables of Christ have a natural and ethical character. They are
   only esoteric in as far as the hardness or worldliness of men's hearts
   prevents their understanding or receiving them. There is a danger of
   our making them mean too much rather than too little, that is, of
   winning a false interest for them by applying them mystically or taking
   them as a thesis for dialectical or rhetorical exercise. For example,
   if we say that the guest who came to the marriage supper without a
   wedding-garment represents a person clothed in his own righteousness
   instead of the righteousness of Christ, that is an explanation of which
   there is not a trace in the words of the parable itself. That is an
   illustration of the manner in which we are not to gather doctrines from
   Scripture. For there is nothing which we may not in this way
   superinduce on the plainest lessons of our Saviour.

   Reading the parables, then, simply and naturally, we find in them no
   indication of the doctrine of atonement or satisfaction. They form a
   very large portion of the sayings which have been recorded of our
   Saviour while He was on earth; and they teach a great number of
   separate lessons. But there is no hint contained in them of that view
   of the death of Christ which is sometimes regarded as the centre of the
   Gospel. There is no difficulty in the nature of things' which prevents
   the father going out to meet the prodigal son. No other condition is
   required of the justification of the publican except the true sense of
   his own unworthiness. The work of those labourers who toiled for one
   hour only in the vineyard is not supplemented by the merits and deserts
   of another. The reward for the cup of cold water is not denied to those
   who are unaware that He to whom it is given is the Lord. The parables
   of the Good Samaritan, of the Fig-tree, of the Talents, do not
   recognize the distinction of faith and works. Other sayings and doings
   of our Lord while He was on earth implied the same unconsciousness or
   neglect of the refinements of later ages. The power of the Son of Man
   to forgive sins is not dependent on the satisfaction which He is to
   offer for them. The Sermon on the Mount, which is the extension of the
   law to thought as well as action, and the two great commandments in
   which the law is summed up, are equally the expression of the Gospel.
   The mind of Christ is in its own place, far away from the oppositions
   of modern theology. Like that of the prophets, His relation to the law
   of Moses is one of neutrality; He has another lesson to teach which
   comes immediately from God. The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses'
   seat--' or, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts--' or, Which
   of you hath an ox or an ass--' or, Ye fools, did not he that made that
   which is without make that which is within.' He does not say, Behold in
   me the true Sacrifice;' or, I that speak unto you am the victim and
   priest.' He has nothing to do with legal and ceremonial observances.
   There is a sort of natural irony with which He regards the world around
   Him. It was as though He would not have touched the least of the
   Levitical commandments; and yet not one stone was to be left upon
   another' as the indirect effect of His teaching. So that it would be
   equally true: I am not come to destroy the law but to fulfil;' and
   Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up again.' My
   kingdom is not of this world,' yet it shall subdue the kingdoms of this
   world; and, the Prince of Peace will not bring peace on earth, but a
   sword.'

   There is a mystery in the life and death of Christ; that is to say,
   there is more than we know or are perhaps capable of knowing. The
   relation in which He stood both to His Father and to mankind is
   imperfectly revealed to us; we do not fully understand what may be
   termed in a figure His inner mind or consciousness. Expressions occur
   which are like flashes of this inner self, and seem to come from
   another world. There are also mixed modes which blend earth and heaven.
   There are circumstances in our Lord's life, too, of a similar nature,
   such as the transfiguration, or the agony in the garden, of which the
   Scripture records only the outward fact. Least of all do we pretend to
   fathom the import of His death. He died for us, in the language of the
   Gospels, in the same sense that He lived for us; He bore our sins' in
   the same sense that He bore our diseases' (Matt. viii. 17). He died by
   the hands of sinners as a malefactor, the innocent for the guilty,
   Jesus instead of Barabbas, because it was necessary that one man should
   die for that nation, and not for that nation only;' as a righteous man
   laying down his life for his friends, as a hero to save his country, as
   a martyr to bear witness to the truth. He died as the Son of God, free
   to lay down His life; confident that He would have power to take it
   again. More than this is meant; and more than human speech can tell.
   But we do not fill up the void of our knowledge by drawing out figures
   of speech into consequences at variance with the attributes of God. No
   external mode of describing or picturing the work of Christ realizes
   its inward nature. Neither will the reproduction of our own feelings in
   a doctrinal form supply any objective support or ground of the
   Christian faith.

   IV. Two of the General Epistles and two of the Epistles of St. Paul
   have no bearing on our present subject. These are the Epistles of St.
   James and St. Jude, and the two Epistles to the Thessalonians. Their
   silence, like that of the Gospels, is at least a negative proof that
   the doctrine of Sacrifice or Satisfaction is not a central truth of
   Christianity. The remainder of the New Testament will be sufficiently
   considered under two heads: first, the remaining Epistles of St. Paul;
   and, secondly, the Epistle to the Hebrews. The difficulties which arise
   respecting these are the same as the difficulties which apply in a less
   degree to one or two passages in the Epistles of St. Peter and St.
   John, and in the book of Revelation.

   It is not to be denied that the language of Sacrifice and Substitution
   occurs in the Epistles of St. Paul. Instances of the former are
   furnished by Rom. iii. 23, 25; 1 Cor. v. 7: of the latter by Gal. ii.
   20; iii. 13.

   Rom. iii. 23-25: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of
   God; being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that
   is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
   through faith by his blood, to declare his righteousness.'

   1 Cor. v. 7: Christ our passover is sacrificed [for us]; therefore let
   us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of
   malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
   truth.'

   These two passages are a fair example of a few others. About the
   translation and explanation of the first of them interpreters differ.
   But the differences are not such as to affect our present question. For
   that question is a general one, viz. whether these, and similar
   sacrificial expressions, are passing figures of speech, or appointed
   signs or symbols of the death of Christ. On which it may be observed:--

   First: That these expressions are not the peculiar or characteristic
   modes in which the Apostle describes the relation of the believer to
   his Lord. For one instance of the use of sacrificial language, five or
   six might be cited of the language of identity or communion, in which
   the believer is described as one with his Lord in all the stages of His
   life and death. But this language is really inconsistent with the
   other. For if Christ is one with the believer, He cannot be regarded
   strictly as a victim who takes his place. And the stage of Christ's
   being which coincides, and is specially connected by the Apostle, with
   the justification of man, is not His death, but His resurrection (Rom.
   iv. 25).

   Secondly: These sacrificial expressions, as also the vicarious ones of
   which we shall hereafter speak, belong to the religious language of the
   age. They are found in Philo; and the Old Testament itself had already
   given them a spiritual or figurative application. There is no more
   reason to suppose that the word sacrifice' suggested the actual rite in
   the Apostolic age than in our own. It was a solemn religious idea, not
   a fact. The Apostles at Jerusalem saw the smoke of the daily sacrifice;
   the Apostle St. Paul beheld victims blazing on many altars in heathen
   cities (he regarded them as the tables of devils). But there is no
   reason to suppose that they led him to think of Christ, or that the
   bleeding form on the altar suggested the sufferings of his Lord.

   Therefore, thirdly, We shall only be led into error by attempting to
   explain the application of the word to Christ from the original meaning
   of the thing. That is a question of Jewish or classical archaeology,
   which would receive a different answer in different ages and countries.
   Many motives or instincts may be traced in the worship of the first
   children of men. The need of giving or getting rid of something; the
   desire to fulfil an obligation or expiate a crime; the consecration of
   a part that the rest may be holy; the Homeric feast of gods and men, of
   the living with the dead; the mystery of animal nature, of which the
   blood was the symbol; the substitution, in a few instances, of the less
   for the greater; in later ages, custom adhering to the old rituals when
   the meaning of them has passed away;--these seem to be true
   explanations of the ancient sacrifices. (Human sacrifices, such as
   those of the old Mexican peoples, or the traditional ones in
   pre-historic Greece, may be left out of consideration, as they appear
   to spring from such monstrous and cruel perversion of human nature.)
   But these explanations have nothing to do with our present subject. We
   may throw an imaginary light back upon them (for it is always easier to
   represent former ages like our own than to realize them as they truly
   were); they will not assist us in comprehending the import of the death
   of Christ, or the nature of the Christian religion. They are in the
   highest degree opposed to it, at the other end of the scale of human
   development, as the weak and beggarly elements' of sense and fear to
   the spirit whereby we cry, Abba, Father; almost, may we not say, as the
   instinct of animals to the reasoning faculties of man. For sacrifice is
   not, like prayer, one of the highest, but one of the lowest acts of
   religious worship. It is the antiquity, not the religious import of the
   rite, which first gave it a sacredness. In modern times, the
   associations which are conveyed by the word are as far from the
   original idea as those of the cross itself. The death of Christ is not
   a sacrifice in the ancient sense (any more than the cross is to
   Christians the symbol of infamy); but what we mean by the word
   sacrifice' is the death of Christ.

   Fourthly: This sacrificial language is not used with any definiteness
   or precision. The figure varies in different passages; Christ is the
   Paschal Lamb, or the Lamb without spot, as well as the sin-offering;
   the priest as well as the sacrifice. It is applied not only to Christ,
   but to the believer who is to present his body a living sacrifice; and
   the offering of which St. Paul speaks in one passage is the offering up
   of the Gentiles.' Again, this language is everywhere broken by moral
   and spiritual applications into which it dissolves and melts away. When
   we read of sacrifice,' or purification,' or redemption,' these words
   isolated may for an instant carry our thoughts back to the Levitical
   ritual. But when we restore them to their context, a sacrifice which is
   a spiritual sacrifice,' or a spiritual and mental service,' a
   purification which is a purging from dead works to serve the living
   God,' a redemption by the blood of Christ from your vain conversation
   received by tradition from your fathers'--we see that the association
   offers no real help; it is no paradox to say that we should rather
   forget than remember it. All this tends to show that these figures of
   speech are not the eternal symbols of the Christian faith, but shadows
   only which lightly come and go, and ought not to be fixed by
   definitions, or made the foundation of doctrinal systems.

   Fifthly: Nor is any such use of them made by any of the writers of the
   New Testament. It is true that St. Paul occasionally, and the author of
   the Epistle to the Hebrews much more frequently, use sacrificial
   language. But they do not pursue the figure into details or
   consequences; they do not draw it out in logical form. Still less do
   they inquire, as modern theologians have done, into the objective or
   transcendental relation in which the sacrifice of Christ stood to the
   will of the Father. St. Paul says, We thus judge that if one died, then
   all died, and he died for all, that they which live shall not
   henceforth live to themselves, but unto him which died for them and
   rose again.' But words like these are far indeed from expressing a
   doctrine of atonement or satisfaction.

   Lastly: The extent to which the Apostle employs figurative language in
   general, may be taken as a measure of the force of the figure in
   particular, expressions. Now there is no mode of speaking of spiritual
   things more natural to him than the image of death. Of the meaning of
   this word, in all languages, it may be said that there can be no doubt.
   Yet no one supposes that the sense which the Apostle gives to it is
   other than a spiritual one. The reason is, that the word has never been
   made the foundation of any doctrine. But the circumstance that the term
   sacrifice' has passed into the language of theology, does not really
   circumscribe or define it. It is a figure of speech still, which is no
   more to be interpreted by the Mosaic sacrifices than spiritual death by
   physical. Let us consider again other expressions of St. Paul: I bear
   in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.' Who hath taken the handwriting
   of ordinances that was against us, and nailed it to his cross.' Filling
   up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for
   his body's sake, which is the church.' The occurrence of these and many
   similar expressions is a sufficient indication that the writer in whom
   they occur is not to be interpreted in a dry or literal manner.

   Another class of expressions, which may be termed the language of
   substitution or vicarious suffering, are also occasionally found in St.
   Paul. Two examples of them, both of which occur in the Epistle to the
   Galatians, will indicate their general character.

   Gal. ii. 20: I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
   I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh,
   I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
   for me.' iii. 13: Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,
   being made a curse for us.'

   This use of language seems to originate in what was termed before the
   language of identity. First, I am crucified with Christ,' and secondly,
   Not I, but Christ liveth in me.' The believer, according to St. Paul,
   follows Christ until he becomes like Him. And this likeness is so
   complete and entire, that all that he was or might have been is
   attributed to Christ, and all that Christ is, is attributed to him.
   With such life and fervour does St. Paul paint the intimacy of the
   union between the believer and Christ: They two are One Spirit.' To
   build on such expressions a doctrinal system is the error of rhetoric
   turned logic.' The truth of feeling which is experienced by a few is
   not to be handed over to the head as a form of doctrine for the many.

   The same remark applies to another class of passages, in which Christ
   is described as dying for us,' or for our sins.' Upon which it may be
   further observed, first, that in these passages the preposition used is
   not anti but huper and, secondly, that Christ is spoken of as living
   and rising again, as well as dying, for us; whence we infer that He
   died for us in the same sense that He lived for us. Of what is meant,
   perhaps the nearest conception we can form is furnished by the example
   of a good man taking upon himself, or, as we say, identifying himself
   with, the troubles and sorrows of others. Christ himself has sanctioned
   the comparison of a love which lays down life for a friend. Let us
   think of one as sensitive to moral evil as the gentlest of mankind to
   physical suffering; of one whose love identified Him with the whole
   human race as strongly as the souls of men are ever knit together by
   individual affections.

   Many of the preceding observations apply equally to the Epistle to the
   Hebrews and to the Epistles of St. Paul. But the Epistle to the Hebrews
   has features peculiar to itself. It is a more complete transfiguration
   of the law, which St. Paul, on the other hand, applies by way of
   illustration, and in fragments only. It has the interest of an
   allegory, and, in some respects, admits of a comparison with the book
   of Revelation. It is full of sacrificial allusions, derived, however,
   not from the actual rite, but from the description of it in the books
   of Moses. Probably at Jerusalem, or the vicinity of the actual temple,
   it would not have been written.

   From this source chiefly, and not from the Epistles of St. Paul, the
   language of sacrifice has passed into the theology and sermons of
   modern times. The Epistle to the Hebrews affords a greater apparent
   foundation for the popular or Calvinistical doctrines of atonement and
   satisfaction, but not perhaps a greater real one. For it is not the
   mere use of the terms sacrifice' or blood,' but the sense in which they
   were used, that must be considered. It is a fallacy, though a natural
   one, to confuse the image with the thing signified, like mistaking the
   colour of a substance for its true nature.

   Long passages might be quoted from the Epistle to the Hebrews, which
   describe the work of Christ in sacrificial language. Some of the most
   striking verses are the following:--ix. 11-14: Christ being come an
   high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect
   tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
   neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he
   entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption
   for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
   heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the
   flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
   Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
   dead works to serve the living God.' x. 12: This man, after he had
   offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of
   God.'

   That these and similar passages have only a deceitful resemblance to
   the language of those theologians who regard the propitiatory sacrifice
   of Christ as the central truth of the Gospel, is manifest from the
   following considerations:--

   1. The great number and variety of the figures. Christ is Joshua, who
   gives the people rest (iv. 8); Melchisedec, to whom Abraham paid tithes
   (v. 6, vii. 6): the high priest going into the most holy place after he
   had offered sacrifice, which sacrifice He himself is, passing through
   the veil, which is His flesh.

   2. The inconsistency of the figures: an inconsistency partly arising
   from their ceasing to be figures and passing into moral notions, as in
   chap. ix. 14: the blood of Christ, who offered himself without spot to
   God, shall purge your conscience from dead works;' partly from the
   confusion of two or more figures, as in the verse following: And for
   this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,' where the idea of
   sacrifice forms a transition to that of death and a testament, and the
   idea of a testament blends with that of a covenant.

   3. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews dwells on the outward
   circumstance of the shedding of the blood of Christ. St. Paul in the
   Epistle to the Galatians makes another application of the Old
   Testament, describing our Lord as enduring the curse which befell One
   who hanged on a tree.' Imagine for an instant that this latter had been
   literally the mode of our Lord's death. The figure of the Epistle to
   the Hebrews would cease to have any meaning; yet no one supposes that
   there would have been any essential difference in the work of Christ.

   4. The atoning sacrifice of which modern theology speaks, is said to be
   the great object of faith. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews
   also speaks of faith, but no such expression as faith in the blood, or
   sacrifice, or death of Christ is made use of by him, or is found
   anywhere else in Scripture. The faith of the patriarchs is not faith in
   the peculiar sense of the term, but the faith of those who confess that
   they are strangers and pilgrims,' and endure seeing him that is
   invisible.'

   Lastly: The Jewish Alexandrian character of the Epistle must be
   admitted as an element of the inquiry. It interprets the Old Testament
   after a manner then current in the world, which we must either continue
   to apply or admit that it was relative to that age and country. It
   makes statements which we can only accept in a figure, as, for example,
   in chap. xi, that Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches
   than the treasures of Egypt.' It uses language in double senses, as,
   for instance, the two meanings of diatheke and of he prote in chap.
   viii. 13; ix. 1; and the connexion which it establishes between the Old
   Testament and the New, is a verbal or mystical one, not a connexion
   between the temple and offerings at Jerusalem and the offering up of
   Christ, but between the ancient ritual and the tabernacle described in
   the book of the law.

   Such were the instruments which the author of this great Epistle
   (whoever he may have been) employed, after the manner of his age and
   country, to impart the truths of the Gospel in a figure to those who
   esteemed this sort of figurative knowledge as a kind of perfection
   (Heb. vi. 1). Ideas must be given through something; ' nor could
   mankind in those days, any more than our own, receive the truth except
   in modes of thought that were natural to them: The author of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews is writing to those who lived and moved in the
   atmosphere, as it may be termed, of Alexandrian Judaism. Therefore he
   uses the figures of the law, but he also guards against their literal
   acceptation. Christ is a priest, but a priest for ever after the order
   of Melchisedec; He is a sacrifice, but He is also the end of
   sacrifices, and the sacrifice which He offers is the negation of
   sacrifices, to do thy will, O God.' Everywhere he has a how much more,'
   how much greater,' for the new dispensation in comparison with the old.
   He raises the Old Testament to the New, first by drawing forth the
   spirit of the New Testament from the Old, and secondly by applying the
   words of the Old Testament in a higher sense than they at first had.
   The former of these two methods of interpretation is moral and
   universal, the latter local and temporary. But if we who are not Jews
   like the persons to whom the Epistle to the Hebrews is addressed, and
   who are taught by education to receive words in their natural and prima
   facie meaning, linger around the figure instead of looking forward to
   the thing signified, we do indeed make Christ the minister' of the
   Mosaic religion. For there is a Judaism not only of outward ceremonies
   or ecclesiastical hierarchies, or temporal rewards and punishments, but
   of ideas also, which impedes the worship of spirit and truth.

   The sum of what has been said is as follows:--

   Firstly: That our Lord never describes His own work in the language of
   atonement or sacrifice.

   Secondly: That this language is a figure of speech borrowed from the
   Old Testament, yet not to be explained by the analogy of the Levitical
   sacrifices; occasionally found in the writings of St. Paul; more
   frequently in the Epistle to the Hebrews; applied to the believer at
   least equally with his Lord, and indicating by the variety and
   uncertainty with which it is used that it is not the expression of any
   objective relation in which the work of Christ stands to His Father,
   but only a mode of speaking common at a time when the rites and
   ceremonies of the Jewish law were passing away and beginning to receive
   a spiritual meaning.

   Thirdly: That nothing is signified by this language, or at least
   nothing essential, beyond what is implied in the teaching of our Lord
   himself. For it cannot be supposed that there is any truer account of
   Christianity than is to be found in the words of Christ.

   § 2.

   Theology sprang up in the first ages independently of Scripture. This
   independence continued afterwards; it has never been wholly lost. There
   is a tradition of the nineteenth century, as well as of the fourth or
   fourteenth, which comes between them. The mystical interpretation of
   Scripture has further parted them; to which may be added the power of
   system: doctrines when framed into a whole cease to draw their
   inspiration from the text. Logic has expressed the thoughts of many
   hearts' with a seeming necessity of form; this form of reasoning has
   led to new inferences. Many words and formulas have also acquired a
   sacredness from their occurrence in liturgies and articles, or the
   frequent use of them in religious discourse. The true interest of the
   theologian is to restore these formulas to their connexion in
   Scripture, and to their place in ecclesiastical history. The standard
   of Christian truth is not a logical clearness or sequence, but the
   simplicity of the mind of Christ.

   The history of theology is the history of the intellectual life of the
   Christian Church. All bodies of Christians, Protestant as well as
   Catholic, have tended to imagine that they are in the same stage of
   religious development as the first believers. But the Church has not
   stood still any more than the world; we may trace the progress of
   doctrine as well as the growth of philosophical opinion. The thoughts
   of men do not pass away without leaving an impress, in religion, any
   more than in politics or literature. The form of more than one article
   of faith in our own day is assignable to the effort of mind of some
   great thinker of the Nicene or mediaeval times. The received
   interpretation of texts of Scripture may not unfrequently be referred
   to the application of them first made in periods of controversy.
   Neither is it possible in any reformation of the Church to return
   exactly to the point whence the divergence began. The pattern of
   Apostolical order may be restored in externals; but the threads of the
   dialectical process are in the mind itself, and cannot be disposed of
   at once. It seems to be the nature of theology that while it is easy to
   add one definition of doctrine to another, it is hard to withdraw from
   any which have been once received. To believe too much is held to be
   safer than to believe too little, and the human intellect finds a more
   natural exercise in raising the superstructure than in examining the
   foundations. On the other hand, it is instructive to observe that there
   has always been an under-current in theology, the course of which has
   turned towards morality, and not away from it. There is a higher sense
   of truth and right now than in the Nicene Church--after than before the
   Reformation. The laity in all Churches have moderated the extremes of
   the clergy. There may also be remarked a silent correction in men's
   minds of statements which have not ceased to appear in theological
   writings.

   The study of the doctrinal development of the Christian Church has many
   uses. First, it helps us to separate the history of a doctrine from its
   truth, and indirectly also the meaning of Scripture from the new
   reading of it, which has been given in many instances by theological
   controversy. It takes us away from the passing movement, and out of our
   own particular corner into a world in Which we see religion on a larger
   scale and in truer proportions. It enables us to interpret one age to
   another, to understand our present theological position by its
   antecedents in the past; and perhaps to bind all together in the spirit
   of charity. Half the intolerance of opinion among Christians arises
   from ignorance; in history as in life, when we know others we get to
   like them. Logic too ceases to take us by force and make us believe.
   There is a pathetic interest and a kind of mystery in the long
   continuance and intensity of erroneous ideas on behalf of which men
   have been ready to die, which nevertheless were no better than the
   dreams or fancies of children. When we make allowance for differences
   in modes of thought, for the state of knowledge, and the conditions of
   the ecclesiastical society, we see that individuals have not been
   altogether responsible for their opinions; that the world has been
   bound together under the influence of the past; moreover, good men of
   all persuasions have been probably nearer to one another than they
   supposed, in doctrine as well as in life. It is the attempt to preserve
   or revive erroneous opinions in the present age, not their existence in
   former ages, that is to be reprobated. Lastly, the study of the history
   of doctrine is the end of controversy. For it is above controversy, of
   which it traces the growth, clearing away that part which is verbal
   only, and teaching us to understand that other part which is fixed in
   the deeper differences of human nature.

   The history of the doctrine of the atonement may be conveniently
   divided into four periods of unequal length, each of which is marked by
   some peculiar features. First, the Patristic period, extending to the
   time of Anselm, in which the doctrine had not attained to a perfect or
   complete form, but each one applied for himself the language of
   Scripture. Secondly, the Scholastic period, beginning with Anselm, who
   may be said to have defined anew the conceptions of the Christian world
   respecting the work of Christ, and including the great schoolmen who
   were his successors. Thirdly, the century of the Reformation, embracing
   what may be termed the after-thoughts of Protestantism, when men began
   to reason in that new sphere of religious thought which had been called
   into existence in the great struggle. Fragments of the great banquet'
   of the schoolmen survive throughout the period, and have floated down
   the stream of time to our own age. Fourthly, the last hundred years,
   during which the doctrine of the atonement has received a new
   development from the influences of German philosophy [7] , as well as
   from the speculations of English and American writers.

   1. The characteristics of the first period may be summed up as follows.
   All the Fathers agreed that man was reconciled to God through Christ,
   and received in the Gospel a new and divine life. Most of them also
   spoke of the death of Christ as a ransom or sacrifice. When we remember
   that in the first age of the Church the New Testament was exclusively
   taught through the Old, and that many of the first, teachers, who were
   unacquainted with our present Gospels, had passed their lives in the
   study of the Old Testament Scriptures, we shall not wonder at the early
   diffusion of this sort of language. Almost every application of the
   types of the law which has been made since, is already found in the
   writings of Justin Martyr. Nor indeed, on general grounds, is there any
   reason why we should feel surprise at such a tendency in the first
   ages. For in all Churches, and at all times of the world's history, the
   Old Testament has tended to take the place of the New; the law of the
   Gospel; the handmaid has become the mistress; and the development of
   the Christian priesthood has developed also the idea of a Christian
   sacrifice.

   The peculiarity of the primitive doctrine did not lie here, but in the
   relation in which the work of Christ was supposed to stand to the
   powers of evil. In the first ages we are beset with shadows of an under
   world, which hover on the confines of Christianity, From Origen
   downwards, with some traces of an earlier opinion of the same kind,
   perhaps of Gnostic origin, it was a prevailing though not quite
   universal belief among the Fathers, that the death of Christ was a
   satisfaction, not to God, but to the devil. Man, by having sinned,
   passed into the power of the evil one, who acquired a real right over
   him which could not be taken away without compensation. Christ offered
   himself as this compensation, which the devil eagerly accepted, as
   worth more than all mankind. But the deceiver was in turn deceived;
   thinking to triumph over the humanity, he was himself triumphed over by
   the Divinity of Christ. This theory was characteristically expressed
   under some such image as the following: that the devil snatching at the
   bait of human flesh, was hooked by the Divine nature, and forced to
   disgorge what he had already swallowed.' It is common in some form to
   Origen, Augustine, Ambrose, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory the Great,
   Isidore of Seville, and much later writers; and there are indications
   of it in Irenaeus (Adv. Haer. v. i. 1). The meaning of this transaction
   with the devil it is hardly possible to explain consistently. For a
   real possession of the soul of Christ was not thought of: an imaginary
   one is only an illusion. In either case the absolute right which is
   assigned to the devil over man, and which requires this satisfaction,
   is as repugnant to our moral and religious ideas, as the notion that
   the right could be satisfied by a deception. This strange fancy seems
   to be a reflection or anticipation of Manicheism within the Church. The
   world, which had been hitherto a kingdom of evil, of which the devil
   was the lord, was to be exorcised and taken out of his power by the
   death of Christ.

   But the mythical fancy of the transaction with the devil was not the
   whole, nor even the leading conception, which the Fathers had of the
   import of the death of Christ. It was the negative, not the positive,
   side of the doctrine of redemption which they thus expressed; nobler
   thoughts also filled their minds. Origen regards the death of Christ as
   a payment to the devil, yet also as an offering to God; this offering
   took place not on earth only, but also in heaven; God is the high
   priest who offered. Another aspect of the doctrine of the atonement is
   presented by the same Father, under the Neo-Platonist form of the logos
   (word), who reunites with God, not only man, but all intelligences.
   Irenaeus speaks, in language more human and more like St. Paul, of
   Christ coming to save all, and therefore passing through all the ages
   of man; becoming an infant among infants, a little one among little
   ones, a young man among young men, an elder with the aged (?), that
   each in turn might be sanctified, until He reached death, that He
   should be the first-born from the dead' (ii. 22, 147). The great Latin
   Father, though he believed equally with Origen in the right and power
   of the devil over man, delights also to bring forward the moral aspect
   of the work of Christ. The entire life of Christ,' he says, was an
   instruction in morals' (De Ver. Rel. c. 16). He died in order that no
   man might be afraid of death' (De Fide et Symbolo, c. 5). The love
   which He displayed in his death constrains us to love Him and each
   other in return' (De Cat. Rud. c. 4). Like St. Paul, Augustine
   contrasts the second Adam with the first, the man of righteousness with
   the man of sin (De Ver. Relig. c. 26). Lastly, he places the real
   nature of redemption in the manifestation of the God-man.

   Another connexion between ancient and modern theology is supplied by
   the writings of Athanasius. The view taken by Athanasius of the atoning
   work of Christ has two characteristic features: First, it is based upon
   the doctrine of the Trinity;--God only can reconcile man with God.
   Secondly, it rests on the idea of a debt which is paid, not to the
   devil, but to God. This debt is also due to death, who has a sort of
   right over Christ, like the right of the devil in the former scheme. If
   it be asked in what this view differs from that of Anselm, the answer
   seems to be, chiefly in the circumstance that it is stated with less
   distinctness: it is a form, not the form, which Athanasius gave to the
   doctrine. In the conception of the death of Christ as a debt, he is
   followed, however, by several of the Greek Fathers. Rhetoric delighted
   to represent the debt as more than paid; the payment was even as the
   ocean to a drop in comparison with the sins of men' (Chrys. on Rom.
   Hom. x. 17). It is pleasing further to remark that a kind of
   latitudinarianism was allowed by the Fathers themselves. Gregory of
   Nazianzen (Orat. xxxiii. p. 536) numbers speculations about the
   sufferings of Christ among those things on which it is useful to have
   correct ideas, but not dangerous to be mistaken. On the whole the
   doctrine of the Fathers of the first four centuries may be said to
   oscillate between two points of view, which are brought out with
   different degrees of clearness. 1. The atonement was effected by the
   death of Christ; which was a satisfaction to the devil, and an offering
   to God: 2. The atonement was effected by the union in Christ of the
   Divine and human nature in the logos,' or word of God. That neither
   view is embodied in any creed is a proof that the doctrine of atonement
   was not, in the first centuries, what modern writers often make it, the
   corner-stone of the Christian faith.

   An interval of more than 700 years separates Athanasius from Anselm.
   One eminent name occurs during this interval, that of Scotus Erigena,
   whose conception of the atonement is the co-eternal unity of all things
   with God; the participation in this unity had been lost by man, not in
   time, but in eternity, and was restored in the person of Christ
   likewise from eternity. The views of Erigena present some remarkable
   coincidences with very recent speculations; in the middle ages he
   stands alone, at the end, not at the beginning, of a great period;--he
   is the last of the Platonists, not the first of the schoolmen. He had
   consequently little influence on the centuries which followed. Those
   centuries gradually assumed a peculiar character; and received in after
   times another name, scholastic, as opposed to patristic. The intellect
   was beginning to display a new power; men were asking, not exactly for
   a reason of the faith that was in them, but for a clearer conception
   and definition of it. The Aristotelian philosophy furnished
   distinctions which were applied with a more than Aristotelian precision
   to statements of doctrine. Logic took the place of rhetoric; the school
   of the Church; figures of speech became abstract ideas. Theology was
   exhibited under a new aspect, as a distinct object or reality of
   thought. Questions on which Scripture was silent, on which councils and
   Popes would themselves pronounce no decision, were raised and answered
   within a narrow sphere by the activity of the human mind itself. The
   words sacrifice,' satisfaction,' ransom,' could no longer be used
   indefinitely; it was necessary to determine further to whom and for
   what the satisfaction was made, and to solve the new difficulties which
   thereupon arose in the effort to gain clearer and more connected ideas.

   2. It was a true feeling of Anselm that the old doctrine of
   satisfaction contained an unchristian element in attributing to the
   devil a right independent of God. That man should be delivered over to
   Satan may be just; it is a misrepresentation to say that Satan had any
   right over man. Therefore no right of the devil is satisfied by the
   death of Christ. He who had the real right is God, who has been robbed
   of His honour; to whom is, indeed, owing on the part of man an infinite
   debt. For sin is in its nature infinite; the world has no compensation
   for that which a good man would not do in exchange for the world (Cur
   Deus Homo, i. 21). God only can satisfy himself. The human nature of
   Christ enables Him to incur, the infinity of his Divine nature to pay,
   this debt (ii. 6, 7). This payment of the debt, however, is not the
   salvation of mankind, but only the condition of salvation; a link is
   still wanting in the work of grace. The two parties are. equalized; the
   honour of which God was robbed is returned, but man has no claim for
   any further favour. This further favour, however, is indirectly a
   result of the death of Christ. For the payment of the debt by the Son
   partakes of the nature of a gift which must needs have a recompense
   (ii. 20) from the Father, which recompense cannot be conferred on
   himself, and is therefore made at His request to man. The doctrine
   ultimately rests on two reasons or grounds; the first a noble one, that
   it must be far from God to suffer any rational creature to perish
   entirely (Cur Deus Homo, i. 4, ii. 4); the second a trifling one, viz.
   that God, having created the angels in a perfect number, it was
   necessary that man, saved through Christ, should fill up that original
   number, which was impaired by their fall. And as Anselm, in the spirit
   of St. Paul, though not quite consistently with his own argument,
   declares, the mercy of God was shown in the number of the saved
   exceeding the number of the lost (Cur Deus Homo, i. 16, 18).

   This theory, which is contained in the remarkable treatise Cur Deus
   Homo, is consecutively reasoned throughout; yet the least reasons seem
   often sufficient to satisfy the author. While it escapes one difficulty
   it involves several others; though conceived in a nobler and more
   Christian spirit than any previous view of the work of Christ, it
   involves more distinctly the hideous consequence of punishing the
   innocent for the guilty. It is based upon analogies, symmetries,
   numerical fitnesses; yet under these logical fancies is contained a
   true and pure feeling of the relation of man to God. The notion of
   satisfaction or payment of a debt, on the other hand, is absolutely
   groundless, and seems only to result from a certain logical position
   which the human mind has arbitrarily assumed. The scheme implies
   further two apparently contradictory notions; one, a necessity in the
   nature of things for this and no other means of redemption; the other,
   the free will of God in choosing the salvation of man. Anselm
   endeavours to escape from this difficulty by substituting the
   conception of a moral for that of a metaphysical necessity (ii. 5). God
   chose the necessity and Christ chose the fulfilment of His Father's
   commands. But the necessity by which the death of Christ is justified
   is thus reduced to a figure of speech. Lastly, the subjective side of
   the doctrine, which afterwards became the great question of the
   Reformation, the question, that is, in what way the death of Christ is
   to be apprehended by the believer, is hardly if at all touched upon by
   Anselm.

   No progress was made during the four centuries which intervened between
   Anselm and the Reformation, towards the attainment of clearer ideas
   respecting the relations of God and man. The view of Anselm did not,
   however, at once or universally prevail; it has probably exercised a
   greater influence since the Reformation (being the basis of what may be
   termed the evangelical doctrine of the atonement) than in earlier ages.
   The spirit of the older theology was too congenial to those ages
   quickly to pass away. Bernard and others continued to maintain the
   right of the devil: a view not wholly obsolete in our own day. The two
   great masters of the schools agreed in denying the necessity on which
   the theory of Anselm was founded. They differed from Anselm also
   respecting the conception of an infinite satisfaction; Thomas Aquinas
   distinguishing the infinite' Divine merit, and abundant' human
   satisfaction; while Duns Scotus rejected the notion of infinity
   altogether, declaring that the scheme of redemption might have been
   equally accomplished by the death of an angel or a righteous man.
   Abelard, at an earlier period, attached special importance to the moral
   aspect of the work of Christ; he denied the right of the devil, and
   declared the love of Christ to be the redeeming principle, because it
   calls forth the love of man. Peter Lombard also, who retained, like
   Bernard, the old view of the right of the devil, agreed with Abelard in
   giving a moral character to the work of redemption.

   3. The doctrines of the Reformed as well as of the Catholic Church were
   expressed in the language of the scholastic theology. But the logic
   which the Catholic party had employed in defining and distinguishing
   the body of truth already received, the teachers of the Reformation
   used to express the subjective feelings of the human soul. Theology
   made a transition, such as we may observe at one or two epochs in the
   history of philosophy, from the object to the subject. Hence, the
   doctrine of atonement or satisfaction became subordinate to the
   doctrine of justification. The reformers begin, not with ideas, but
   with the consciousness of sin; with immediate human interests, not with
   speculative difficulties; not with mere abstractions, but with a great
   struggle; without were fightings, within were fears.' As of Socrates
   and philosophy, so it may be also said truly of Luther in a certain
   sense, that he brought down the work of redemption from heaven to
   earth.' The great question with him was, how we might be freed from the
   punishment and guilt of sin,' and the answer was, through the
   appropriation of the merits of Christ. All that man was or might have
   been, Christ became, and was; all that Christ did or was, attached or
   was imputed to man: as God, he paid the infinite penalty; as man, he
   fulfilled the law. The first made redemption possible, the second
   perfected it. The first was termed in the language of that age, the
   obedientia passiva,' the second, the obedientia activa.'

   In this scheme the doctrine of satisfaction is far from being prominent
   or necessary; it is a remnant of an older theology which was retained
   by the Reformers and prevented their giving a purely moral character to
   the work of Christ. There were differences among them respecting the
   two kinds of obedience; some regarding the obedientia passiva' as the
   cause or condition of the obedientia activa,' while others laid no
   stress on the distinction. But all the great chiefs of the Reformation
   agreed in the fiction of imputed righteousness. Little had been said in
   earlier times of a doctrine of imputation. But now the Bible was
   reopened and read over again in one light only, justification by faith
   and not by works.' The human mind seemed to seize with a kind of
   avidity on any distinction which took it out of itself, and at the same
   time freed it from the burden of ecclesiastical tyranny. Figures of
   speech in which Christ was said to die for man or for the sins of man
   were understood in as crude and literal a sense as the Catholic Church
   had attempted to gain from the words of the institution of the
   Eucharist. Imputation and substitution among Protestant divines began
   to be formulas as strictly imposed as transubstantiation with their
   opponents. To Luther, Christ was not only the Holy One who died for the
   sins of men, but the sinner himself on whom the vials of Divine wrath
   were poured out. And seeing in the Epistles to the Galatians and Romans
   the power which the law exercised in that age of the world over Jewish
   or half-Jewish Christians, he transferred the state which the Apostle
   there describes to his own age, and imagined that the burden under
   which he himself had groaned was the same law of which St. Paul spoke,
   which Christ first fulfilled in His own person and then abolished for
   ever.

   It was not unnatural that in the middle ages, when morality had no free
   or independent development, the doctrine of the atonement should have
   been drawn out on the analogy of law. Nor is there any reason why we
   should feel surprised that, with the revival of the study of Scripture
   at the Reformation, the Mosaic law should have exercised a great
   influence over the ideas of Protestants. More singular, yet an
   analogous phenomenon, is the attempt of Grotius to conceive the work of
   Christ by the help of the principles of political justice. All men are
   under the influence of their own education or profession, and they are
   apt to conceive truths which are really of a different or higher kind
   under some form derived from it; they require such a degree or kind of
   evidence as their minds are accustomed to, and political or legal
   principles have often been held a sufficient foundation for moral
   truth.

   The theory of the celebrated jurist proceeds from the conception of God
   as governor of the universe. As such, He may forgive sins just as any
   other ruler may remit the punishment of offences against positive law.
   But although the ruler possesses the power to remit sins, and there is
   nothing in the nature of justice which would prevent his doing so, yet
   he has also a duty, which is to uphold his own authority and that of
   the laws. To do so, he must enforce punishment for the breach of them.
   This punishment, however, may attach not to the offender, but to the
   offence. Such a distinction is not unknown to the law itself. We may
   apply this to the work of Christ. There was no difficulty in the nature
   of things which prevented God from freely pardoning the sins of men;
   the power of doing so was vested in His hands as governor of the world.
   But it was inexpedient that He should exercise this power without first
   making an example. This was effected by the death of Christ. It pleased
   God to act according to the pedantic rules of earthly jurisprudence. It
   is useless to criticize such a theory further; almost all theologians
   have agreed in reprobating it; it adopts the analogy of law, and
   violates its first principles by considering a moral or legal act
   without reference to the agent. The reason which Grotius assigns for
   the death of Christ is altogether trivial.

   4. Later theories on the doctrine of the atonement may be divided into
   two classes, English and German, logical and metaphysical; those which
   proceed chiefly by logical inference, and those which connect the
   conception of the atonement with speculative philosophy.

   Earlier English writers were chiefly employed in defining the work of
   Christ; later ones have been most occupied with the attempt to soften
   or moderate the more repulsive features of the older statements; the
   former have a dogmatical, the latter an apologetical character. The
   nature of the sufferings of Christ, whether they were penal or only
   quasi penal, whether they were physical or mental, greater in degree
   than human sufferings, or different in kind; in what more precisely the
   compensation offered by Christ truly consisted; the nature of the
   obedience of Christ, whether to God or the law, and the connexion of
   the whole question with that of the Divine decrees:--these were among
   the principal subjects discussed by the great Presbyterian divines of
   the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Continuing in the same line
   of thought as their predecessors, they seem to have been unconscious of
   the difficulties to which the eyes of a later generation have opened.

   But at last the question has arisen within, as well as without, the
   Church of England: How the ideas of expiation, or satisfaction, or
   sacrifice, or imputation, are reconcilable with the moral and spiritual
   nature either of God or man?' Some there are who answer from analogy,
   and cite instances of vicarious suffering which appear in the disorder
   of the world around us. But analogy is a broken reed; of use, indeed,
   in pointing out the way where its intimations can be verified, but
   useless when applied to the unseen world in which the eye of
   observation no longer follows. Others affirm revelation or inspiration
   to be above criticism, and, in disregard alike of Church history and of
   Scripture, assume their own view of the doctrine of the atonement to be
   a revealed or inspired truth. They do not see that they are cutting off
   the branch of the tree on which they are themselves sitting. For, if
   the doctrine of the atonement cannot be criticized, neither can it be
   determined what is the doctrine of the atonement; nor, on the same
   principles, can any true religion be distinguished from any false one,
   or any truth of religion from any error. It is suicidal in theology to
   refuse the appeal to a moral criterion. Others add a distinction of
   things above reason and things contrary to reason; a favourite
   theological weapon, which has, however, no edge or force, so long as it
   remains a generality. Others, in like manner, support their view of the
   doctrine of the atonement by a theory of accommodation, which also
   loses itself in ambiguity. For it is not determined whether, by
   accommodation to the human faculties, is meant the natural
   subjectiveness of knowledge, or some other limitation which applies to
   theology only. Others regard the death of Christ, not as an atonement
   or satisfaction to God, but as a manifestation of His righteousness, a
   theory which agrees with that of Grotius in its general character, when
   the latter is stripped of its technicalities. This theory is the shadow
   or surface of that of satisfaction; the human analogy equally fails;
   the punishment of the innocent for the guilty is not more unjust than
   the punishment of the innocent as an example to the guilty. Lastly,
   there are some who would read the doctrine of the atonement in the
   light of Divine love only;' the object of the sufferings and death of
   Christ being to draw men's hearts to God by the vision of redeeming
   love (compare Abelard), and the sufferings themselves being the natural
   result of the passage of the Saviour through a world of sin and shame.
   Of these explanations the last seems to do the least violence to our
   moral feelings. Yet it would surely be better to renounce any attempt
   at inquiry into the objective relations of God and man, than to rest
   the greatest fact in the history of mankind on so slender a ground as
   the necessity for arousing the love of God in the human heart, in this
   and no other way.

   German theology during the last hundred years has proceeded by a
   different path; it has delighted to recognize the doctrine of the
   atonement as the centre of religion, and also of philosophy. This
   tendency is first observable in the writings of Kant, and may be traced
   through the schools of his successors, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, as
   well as in the works of the two philosophical theologians Daub and
   Schleiermacher. These great thinkers all use the language of orthodoxy;
   it cannot be said, however, that the views of any of them agree with
   the teaching of the patristic or mediaeval Church, or of the Reformers,
   or of the simpler expressions of Scripture. Yet they often bring into
   new meaning and prominence texts on this subject which have been pushed
   aside by the regular current of theology. The difficulties which they
   all alike experience are two: first, how to give a moral meaning to the
   idea of atonement; secondly, how to connect the idea with the
   historical fact.

   According to Kant, the atonement consists in the sacrifice of the
   individual; a sacrifice in which the sin of the old man is ever being
   compensated by the sorrows and virtues of the new. This atonement, or
   reconcilement of man with God, consists in an endless progress towards
   a reconcilement which is never absolutely completed in this life, and
   yet, by the continual increase of good and diminution of evil, is a
   sufficient groundwork of hope and peace. Perfect reconcilement would
   consist in the perfect obedience of a free agent to the law of duty or
   righteousness. For this Kant substitutes the ideal of the Son of God.
   The participation in this ideal of humanity is an aspect of the
   reconcilement. In a certain sense, in the sight of God, that is, and in
   the wish and resolution of the individual, the change from the old to
   the new is not gradual, but sudden: the end is imputed or anticipated
   in the beginning. So Kant rationalizes' the ordinary Lutheran doctrine
   of justification; unconscious, as in other parts of his philosophy, of
   the influence which existing systems are exercising over him. Man goes
   out of himself to grasp at a reflection which is still--himself. The
   mystical is banished only to return again in an arbitrary and
   imaginative form--a phenomenon which we may often observe in
   speculation as well as in the characters of individuals.

   Schleiermacher's view of the doctrine of the atonement is almost
   equally different from that of Kant who preceded him, and of Hegel and
   others who were his contemporaries or successors: it is hardly more
   like the popular theories. Reconciliation with God he conceives as a
   participation in the Divine nature. Of this participation the Church,
   through the Spirit, is the medium; the individual is redeemed and
   consoled by communion with his fellow-men. If in the terminology of
   philosophy we ask which is the objective, which the subjective part of
   the work of redemption, the answer of Schleiermacher seems to be that
   the subjective redemption of the individual is the consciousness of
   union with God; and the objective part, which corresponds to this
   consciousness, is the existence of the Church, which derives its life
   from the Spirit of God, and is also the depository of the truth of
   Christ. The same criticism, however, applies to this as to the
   preceding conception of the atonement, viz. that it has no real
   historical basis. The objective truth is nothing more than the
   subjective feeling or opinion which prevails in a particular Church.
   Schleiermacher deduces the historical from the ideal, and regards the
   ideal as existing only in the communion of Christians. But the truth of
   a fact is not proved by the truth of an idea. And the personal relation
   of the believer to Christ, instead of being immediate, is limited (as
   in the Catholic system) by the existence of the Church.

   Later philosophers have conceived of the reconciliation of man with God
   as a reconciliation of God with himself. The infinite must evolve the
   finite from itself; yet the true infinite consists in the return of the
   finite to the infinite. By slow degrees, and in many stages of
   morality, of religion, and of knowledge, does the individual, according
   to Fichte, lay aside isolation and selfishness, gaining in strength and
   freedom by the negation of freedom, until he rises into the region of
   the divine and absolute. This is reconcilement with God; a half
   Christian, half Platonic notion, which it is not easy to identify
   either with the subjective feeling of the individual, or with the
   historical fact. Daub has also translated the language of Scripture and
   of the Church into metaphysical speculation. According to this thinker,
   atonement is the realization of the unity of man with God, which is
   also the unity of God with himself. Deus Deum cum mundo conjunctum Deo
   manifestat.' Perhaps this is as near an approach as philosophy can make
   to a true expression of the words, That they all may be one, as thou
   Father art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.' Yet
   the metaphysical truth is a distant and indistinct representation of
   the mind of Christ which is expressed in these words. Its defect is
   exhibited in the image under which Fichte described it--the absolute
   unity of light; in other words, God, like the being of the Eleatics, is
   a pure abstraction, and returning into himself is an abstraction still.

   It is characteristic of Schelling's system that he conceives the nature
   of God, not as abstraction, but as energy or action. The finite and
   manifold are not annihilated in the infinite; they are the revelation
   of the infinite. Man is the son of God; of this truth Christ is the
   highest expression and the eternal idea. But in the world this
   revelation or incarnation of God is ever going on; the light is
   struggling with darkness, the spirit with nature, the universal with
   the particular. That victory which was achieved in the person of Christ
   is not yet final in individuals or in history. Each person, each age,
   carries on the same conflict between good and evil, the triumphant end
   of which is anticipated in the life and death of Christ.

   Hegel, beginning with the doctrine of a Trinity, regards the atonement
   as the eternal reconciliation of the finite and the infinite in the
   bosom of God himself. The Son goes forth from the Father, as the world
   or finite being, to exist in a difference which is done away and lost
   in the absoluteness of God. Here the question arises, how individuals
   become partakers of this reconciliation? The answer is, by the finite
   receiving the revelation of God. The consciousness of God in man is
   developed, first, in the worship of nature; secondly, in the
   manifestation of Christ; thirdly, in the faith of the Church that God
   and man are one, of which faith the Holy Spirit is the source. The
   death of Christ is the separation of this truth from the elements of
   nature and sense. Hegelian divines have given this doctrine a more
   Pantheistic or more Christian aspect; they have, in some instances,
   studiously adopted orthodox language; they have laid more or less
   stress on the historical facts. But they have done little as yet to
   make it intelligible to the world at large; they have acquired for it
   no fixed place in history, and no hold upon life.

   Englishmen, especially, feel a national dislike at the things which
   accompany salvation' being perplexed with philosophical theories. They
   find it easier to caricature than to understand Hegel; they prefer the
   most unintelligible expressions with which they are familiar to great
   thoughts which are strange to them. No man of sense really supposes
   that Hegel or Schelling is so absurd as they may be made to look in an
   uncouth English translation, or as they unavoidably appear to many in a
   brief summary of their tenets. Yet it may be doubted whether this
   philosophy can ever have much connexion with the Christian life. It
   seems to reflect at too great a distance what ought to be very near to
   us. It is metaphysical, not practical; it creates an atmosphere in
   which it is difficult to breathe; it is useful as supplying a light or
   law by which to arrange the world, rather than as a principle of action
   or warmth. Man is a microcosm, and we do not feel quite certain whether
   the whole system is not the mind itself turned inside out, and
   magnified in enormous proportions. Whatever interest it may arouse in
   speculative natures (and it is certainly of great value to a few), it
   will hardly find a home or welcome in England.

   § 3.

   The silence of our Lord in the Gospels respecting any doctrine of
   atonement and sacrifice, the variety of expressions which occur in
   other parts of the New Testament, the fluctuation and uncertainty both
   of the Church and individuals on this subject in after ages, incline us
   to agree with Gregory Nazianzen, that the death of Christ is one of
   those points of faith about which it is not dangerous to be mistaken.'
   And the sense of the imperfection of language and the illusions to
   which we are subject from the influence of past ideas, the
   consciousness that doctrinal perplexities arise chiefly from our
   transgression of the limits of actual knowledge, will lead us to desire
   a very simple statement of the work of Christ; a statement, however, in
   accordance with our moral ideas, and one which will not shift and alter
   with the metaphysical schools of the age; one, moreover, which runs no
   risk of being overthrown by an increasing study of the Old Testament or
   of ecclesiastical history. Endless theories there have been (of which
   the preceding sketch contains only a small portion), and many more
   there will be as time goes on, like mystery plays, or sacred dramas (to
   adapt Lord Bacon's image), which have passed before the Church and the
   world. To add another would increase the confusion: it is ridiculous to
   think of settling a disputed point of theology unless by some new
   method. That other method can only be a method of agreement; little
   progress has been made hitherto by the method of difference. It is not
   reasonable, but extremely unreasonable, that the most sacred of all
   books should be the only one respecting the interpretation of which
   there is no certainty; that religion alone should be able to perpetuate
   the enmities of past ages; that the influence of words and names, which
   secular knowledge has long shaken off, should still intercept the
   natural love of Christians towards one another and their Lord. On our
   present subject there is no difficulty in finding a basis of
   reconciliation; the way opens when logical projections are removed, and
   we look at the truth in what may be rightly termed a more primitive and
   Apostolical manner. For all, or almost all, Christians would agree that
   in some sense or other we are reconciled to God through Christ; whether
   by the atonement and satisfaction which He made to God for us, or by
   His manifestation of the justice of God or love of God in the world, by
   the passive obedience of His death or the active obedience of His life,
   by the imputation of His righteousness to us or by our identity and
   communion with Him, or likeness to Him, or love of Him; in some one of
   these senses, which easily pass into each other, all would join in
   saying that He is the way, the truth, and the life.' And had the human
   mind the same power of holding fast points of agreement as of
   discerning differences, there would be an end of the controversy.

   The statements of Scripture respecting the work of Christ are very
   simple, and may be used without involving us in the determination of
   these differences. We can live and die in the language of St. Paul and
   St. John; there is nothing there repugnant to our moral sense. We have
   a yet higher authority in the words of Christ himself. Only in
   repeating and elucidating these statements, we must remember that
   Scripture phraseology is of two kinds, simple and figurative, and that
   the first is the interpretation of the second. We must not bring the
   New Testament into bondage to the Old, but ennoble and transfigure the
   Old by the New.

   First; the death of Christ may be described as a sacrifice. But what
   sacrifice? Not the blood of bulls and of goats, nor the ashes of an
   heifer sprinking the unclean,' but the living sacrifice to do thy will,
   O God.' It is a sacrifice which is the negation of sacrifice; Christ
   the end of the law to them that believe.' Peradventure, in a heathen
   country, to put an end to the rite of sacrifice some one would even
   dare to die;' that expresses the relation in which the offering on
   Mount Calvary stands to the Levitical offerings. It is the death of
   what is outward and local, the life of what is inward and spiritual: I,
   if I be lifted up from the earth, shall draw all men after me;' and
   Neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem shall ye worship the,
   Father.' It is the offering up of the old world on the cross; the law
   with its handwriting of ordinances, the former man with his affections
   and lusts, the body of sin with its remembrances of past sin. It is the
   New Testament revealed in the blood of Christ, the Gospel of freedom,
   which draws men together in the communion of one spirit, as in St.
   Paul's time without respect of persons and nations, so in our own day
   without regard to the divisions of Christendom. In the place of
   Churches, priesthoods, ceremonials, systems, it puts a moral and
   spiritual principle which works with them, not necessarily in
   opposition to them, but beside or within them, to renew life in the
   individual soul.

   Again, the death of Christ may be described as a ransom. It is not that
   God needs some payment which He must receive before He will set the
   captives free. The ransom is not a human ransom, any more than the
   sacrifice is a Levitical sacrifice. Rightly to comprehend the nature of
   this Divine ransom, we must begin with that question of the Apostle:
   Know ye not that whose servants ye yield yourselves to obey, his
   servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of
   obedience unto righteousness? There are those who will reply: We were
   never in bondage at any time.' To whom Christ answers: Whosoever
   committeth sin is the servant of sin' and, If the Son shall make you
   free, ye shall be free indeed.' Ransom is deliverance to the captive.'
   There are mixed modes here also, as in the use of the term
   sacrifice--the word has a temporary allusive reference to a Mosaical
   figure of speech. That secondary allusive reference we are constrained
   to drop, because it is unessential; and also because it immediately
   involves further questions--a ransom to whom? for what?--about which
   Scripture is silent, to which reason refuses to answer.

   Thirdly, the death of Christ is spoken of as a death for us, or for our
   sins. The ambiguous use of the preposition for,' combined with the
   figure of sacrifice, has tended to introduce the idea of substitution;
   when the real meaning is not in our stead,' but only in behalf of,' or
   because of us.' It is a great assumption, or an unfair deduction, from
   such expressions, to say that Christ takes our place, or that the
   Father in looking at the sinner sees only Christ. Christ died for us in
   no other sense than He lived or rose again for us. Scripture affords no
   hint of His taking our place in His death in any other way than He did
   also in His life. He himself speaks of His decease which He should
   accomplish at Jerusalem,' quite simply: greater love hath no man than
   this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' The words of
   Caiaphas, It is expedient that one man should die for this nation,' and
   the comment of the Evangelist, and not for that nation only, but that
   he should gather together in one the children of God that are scattered
   abroad,' afford a measure of the meaning of such expressions. Here,
   too, there are mixed modes which seem to be inextricably blended in the
   language of Scripture, and which theology has not always distinguished.
   For the thing signified is, partly, that Christ died for our sakes,
   partly that He died by the hands of sinners, partly that He died with a
   perfect and Divine sympathy for human evil and suffering. But this
   ambiguity (which we may silently correct or explain) need not prevent
   our joining in words which, more perhaps than any others, have been
   consecrated by religious use to express the love and affection of
   Christians towards their Lord.

   Now suppose some one who is aware of the plastic and accommodating
   nature of language to observe, that in what has been written of late
   years on the doctrine of the atonement he has noticed an effort made to
   win for words new senses, and that some of the preceding remarks are
   liable to this charge; he may be answered, first, that those new senses
   are really a recovery of old ones (for the writers of the New
   Testament, though they use the language of the time, everywhere give it
   a moral meaning); and, secondly, that in addition to the modes of
   conception already mentioned, the Scripture has others which are not
   open to his objection. And those who, admitting the innocence and
   Scriptural character of the expressions already referred to, may yet
   fear their abuse, and therefore desire to have them excluded from
   articles of faith (just as many Protestants, though aware that the
   religious use of images is not idolatry, may not wish to see them in
   churches)--such persons may find a sufficient expression of the work of
   Christ in other modes of speech which the Apostle also uses. (1)
   Instead of the language of sacrifice, or ransom, or substitution, they
   may prefer that of communion or identity. (2) Or they may interpret the
   death of Christ by His life, and connect the bleeding form on Mount
   Calvary with the image of Him who went about doing good. Or (3) they
   may look inward at their own souls, and read there, inseparable from
   the sense of their own unworthiness, the assurance that God will not
   desert the work of His hands, of which assurance the death of Christ is
   the outward witness to them. There are other ways, also, of conceiving
   the redemption of man which avoid controversy, any of which is a
   sufficient stay of the Christian life. For the kingdom of God is not
   this or that statement, or definition of opinion, but righteousness,
   and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. And the cross of Christ is to be
   taken up and borne; not to be turned into words, or made a theme of
   philosophical speculation.

   1. Everywhere St. Paul speaks of the Christian as one with Christ. He
   is united with Him, not in His death only, but in all the stages of His
   existence; living with Him, suffering with Him, crucified with Him,
   buried with Him, rising again with Him, renewed in His image, glorified
   together with Him; these are the expressions by which this union is
   denoted. There is something meant by this language which goes beyond
   the experience of ordinary Christians, something, perhaps, more
   mystical than in these latter days of the world most persons seem to be
   capable of feeling, yet the main thing signified is the same for all
   ages, the knowledge and love of Christ, by which men pass out of
   themselves to make their will His and His theirs, the consciousness of
   Him in their thoughts and actions, communion with Him, and trust in
   Him. Of every act of kindness or good which they do to others His life
   is the type; of every act of devotion or self-denial His death is the
   type; of every act of faith His resurrection is the type. And often
   they walk with Him on earth, not in a figure only, and find Him near
   them, not in a figure only, in the valley of death. They experience
   from Him the same kind of support as from the sympathy and communion of
   an earthly friend. That friend is also a Divine power. In proportion as
   they become like Him, they are reconciled to God through Him; they pass
   with Him into the relationship of sons of God. There is enough here for
   faith to think of, without sullying the mirror of God's justice, or
   overclouding His truth. We need not suppose that God ever sees us other
   than we really are, or attributes to us what we never did. Doctrinal
   statements, in which the nature of the work of Christ is most exactly
   defined, cannot really afford the same support as the simple conviction
   of His love.

   Again (2), the import of the death of Christ may be interpreted by His
   life. No theological speculation can throw an equal light on it. From
   the other side we cannot see it, but only from this. Now the life of
   Christ is the life of One who knew no sin, on whom the shadow of evil
   never passed; who went about doing good; who had not where to lay His
   head; whose condition was in all respects the reverse of earthly and
   human greatness; who also had a sort of infinite sympathy or communion
   with all men everywhere; whom, nevertheless, His own nation betrayed to
   a shameful death. It is the life of One who came to bear witness of the
   truth, who knew what was in man, and never, spared to rebuke him, yet
   condemned him not; himself without sin, yet One to whom all men would
   soonest have gone to confess and receive forgiveness of sin. It is the
   life of One who was in constant communion with God as well as man; who
   was the inhabitant of another world while outwardly in this. It is the
   life of One in whom we see balanced and united the separate gifts and
   graces of which we catch glimpses only in the lives of His followers.
   It is a life which is mysterious to us, which we forbear to praise, in
   the earthly sense, because it is above praise, being the most perfect
   image and embodiment that we can conceive of Divine goodness.

   And the death of Christ is the fulfilment and consummation of His life,
   the greatest moral act ever done in this world, the highest
   manifestation of perfect love, the centre in which the rays of love
   converge and meet, the extremest abnegation or annihilation of self. It
   is the death of One who seals with His blood the witness of the truth
   which He came into the world to teach, which therefore confirms our
   faith in Him as well as animates our love. It is the death of One, who
   says at the last hour, Of them that thou gavest me, I have not lost
   one'--of One who, having come forth from God, and having finished the
   work which He came into the world to do, returns to God. It is a death
   in which all the separate gifts of heroes and martyrs are united in a
   Divine excellence--of One who most perfectly foresaw all things that
   were coming upon Him--who felt all, and shrank not--of One who, in the
   hour of death, set the example to His followers of praying for His
   enemies. It is a death which, more even than His life, is singular and
   mysterious, in which nevertheless we all are partakers--in which there
   was the thought and consciousness of man kind to the end of time, which
   has also the power of drawing to itself the thoughts of men to the end
   of time.

   Lastly, there is a true Christian feeling in many other ways of
   regarding the salvation of man, of which the heart is its own witness,
   which yet admit, still less than the preceding, of logical rule and
   precision. He who is conscious of his own infirmity and sinfulness, is
   ready to confess that he needs reconciliation with God. He has no proud
   thoughts: he knows that he is saved not of himself, it is the gift of
   God;' the better he is, the more he feels, in the language of
   Scripture, that he is an unprofitable servant.' Sometimes he imagines
   the Father coming out to meet him, when he is yet a long way off,' as
   in the parable of the Prodigal Son; at other times the burden of sin
   lies heavy on him; he seems to need more support--he can approach God
   only through Christ. All men are not the same; one has more of the
   strength of reason in his religion; another more of the tenderness of
   feeling. With some, faith partakes of the nature of a pure and
   spiritual morality; there are others who have gone through the struggle
   of St. Paul or Luther, and attain rest only in casting all on Christ.
   One will live after the pattern of the Sermon on the Mount, or the
   Epistle of St. James. Another finds a deep consolation and meaning in a
   closer union with Christ; he will put on Christ,' he will hide himself
   in Christ; he will experience in his own person the truth of those
   words of the Apostle, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live;
   yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.' But if he have the spirit of
   moderation that there was in St. Paul, he will not stereotype these
   true, though often passing feelings, in any formula of substitution or
   satisfaction; still less will be draw out formulas of this sort into
   remote consequences. Such logical idealism is of another age; it is
   neither faith nor philosophy in this. Least of all will he judge others
   by the circumstance of their admitting or refusing to admit the
   expression of his individual feelings as an eternal truth. He shrinks
   from asserting his own righteousness; he is equally unwilling to affirm
   that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to him. He is looking for
   forgiveness of sins, not because Christ has satisfied the wrath of God,
   but because God can show mercy without satisfaction: he may have no
   right to acquittal, he dare not say, God has no right to acquit. Yet
   again, he is very far from imagining that the most merciful God will
   indiscriminately forgive; or that the weakness of human emotions,
   groaning out at the last hour a few accustomed phrases, is a sufficient
   ground of confidence and hope. He knows that the only external evidence
   of forgiveness is the fact, that he has ceased to do evil; no other is
   possible. Having Christ near as a friend and a brother, and making the
   Christian life his great aim, he is no longer under the dominion of a
   conventional theology. He will not be distracted by its phrases from
   communion with his fellowmen. He can never fall into that confusion of
   head and heart, which elevates matters of opinion into practical
   principles. Difficulties and doubts diminish with him, as he himself
   grows more like Christ, not because he forcibly suppresses them, but
   because they become unimportant in comparison with purity, and
   holiness, and love. Enough of truth for him seems to radiate from the
   person of the Saviour. He thinks more and more of the human nature of
   Christ as the expression of the Divine. He has found the way of
   life--that way is not an easy way--but neither is it beset by the
   imaginary perplexities with which a false use of the intellect in
   religion has often surrounded it.

   It seems to be an opinion which is gaining ground among thoughtful and
   religious men, that in theology, the less we define the better.
   Definite statements respecting the relation of Christ either to God or
   man are only figures of speech; they do not really pierce the clouds
   which round our little life.' When we multiply words we do not multiply
   ideas; we are still within the circle of our own minds. No greater
   calamity has ever befallen the Christian Church than the determination
   of some uncertain things which are beyond the sphere of human
   knowledge. A true instinct prevents our entangling the faith of Christ
   with the philosophy of the day; the philosophy of past ages is a still
   more imperfect exponent of it. Neither is it of any avail to assume
   revelation or inspiration as a sort of shield, or Catholicon, under
   which the weak points of theology may receive protection. For what is
   revealed or what inspired cannot be answered a priori; the meaning of
   the word Revelation must be determined by the fact, not the fact by the
   word.

   If our Saviour were to come again to earth, which of all the theories
   of atonement and sacrifice would he sanction with His authority?
   Perhaps none of them, yet perhaps all may be consistent with a true
   service of Him. The question has no answer. But it suggests the thought
   that we shrink from bringing controversy into His presence. The same
   kind of lesson may be gathered from the consideration of theological
   differences in the face of death. Who, as he draws near to Christ, will
   not feel himself drawn towards his theological opponents? At the end of
   life, when a man looks back calmly, he is most likely to find that he
   exaggerated in some things; that he mistook party spirit for a love of
   truth. Perhaps, he had not sufficient consideration for others, or
   stated the truth itself in a manner which was calculated to give
   offence. In the heat of the struggle, let us at least pause to imagine
   polemical disputes as they will appear a year, two years, three years
   hence; it may be, dead and gone--certainly more truly seen than in the
   hour of controversy. For the truths about which we are disputing cannot
   partake of the passing stir; they do not change even with the greater
   revolutions of human things. They are in eternity; and the image of
   them on earth is not the movement on the surface of the waters, but the
   depths of the silent sea. Lastly, as a measure of the value of such
   disputes, which above all other interests seem to have for a time the
   power of absorbing men's minds and rousing their passions, we may carry
   our thoughts onwards to the invisible world, and there behold, as in a
   glass, the great theological teachers of past ages, who have
   anathematized each other in their lives, resting together in the
   communion of the same Lord.

ESSAY

    ON

PREDESTINATION AND FREE WILL

   THE difficulty of necessity and free will is not peculiar to
   Christianity. It enters into all religions at a certain stage of their
   progress; it reappears in philosophy and is a question not only of
   speculation but of life. Wherever man touches nature, wherever the
   stream of thought which flows within, meets and comes into conflict
   with scientific laws, reflecting on the actions of an individual in
   relation to his antecedents, considering the balance of human actions
   in many individuals; when we pass into the wider field of history, and
   trace the influence of circumstances on the course of events, the
   sequence of nations and states of society, the physical causes that lie
   behind all; in the region of philosophy, as we follow the order of
   human thoughts, and observe the seeming freedom and real limitation of
   ideas and systems; lastly in that higher world of which religion speaks
   to us, when we conceive man as a finite being, who has the witness in
   himself of his own dependence on God, whom theology too has made the
   subject of many theories of grace, new forms appear of that famous
   controversy which the last century discussed under the name of
   necessity and free will.

   I shall at present pursue no further the train of reflections which are
   thus suggested. My first object is to clear the way for the
   consideration of the subject within the limits of Scripture. Some
   preliminary obstacles offer themselves, arising out of the opposition
   which the human mind everywhere admits in the statement of this
   question. These will be first examined. We may afterwards return to the
   modern aspects of the contradiction and of the reconcilement.

   § 1.

   In the relations of God and man, good and evil, finite and infinite,
   there is much that must ever be mysterious. Nor can any one exaggerate
   the weakness and feebleness of the human mind in the attempt to seek
   for such knowledge. But although we acknowledge the feebleness of man's
   brain and the vastness of the subject, we should also draw a
   distinction between the original difficulty of our own ignorance, and
   the puzzles and embarrassments which false philosophy or false theology
   have introduced. The impotence of our faculties is not a reason for
   acquiescing in a metaphysical fiction. Philosophy has no right to veil
   herself in mystery at the point where she is lost in a confusion of
   words. That we know little is the real mystery; not that we are caught
   in dilemmas or surrounded by contradictions. These contradictions are
   involved in the slightest as well as in the most serious of our
   actions, which is a proof of their really trifling nature. They confuse
   the mind but not things. To trace the steps by which mere abstractions
   have acquired this perplexing and constraining power, though it cannot
   meet the original defect, yet may perhaps assist us to understand the
   misunderstanding, and to regard the question of predestination and free
   will in a simpler and more natural light.

   A subject which claims to be raised above the rules and requirements of
   logic, must give a reason for the exemption, and must itself furnish
   some other test of truth to which it is ready to conform. The reason is
   that logic is inapplicable to the discussion of a question which begins
   with a contradiction in terms: it can only work out the opposite
   aspects or principles of such a question on one side or the other, but
   is inadequate to that more comprehensive conception of the subject
   which embraces both. We often speak of language as an imperfect
   instrument for the expression of thought. Logic is even more imperfect;
   it is wanting in the plastic and multiform character of language, yet
   deceives us by the appearance of a straight rule and necessary
   principle. Questions respecting the relation of God and man, necessity
   and free will, the finite and the infinite--perhaps every question
   which has two opposite poles of fact and idea--are beyond the sphere of
   its art. But if not logic, some other test must be found of our
   theories or reasonings, on these and the like metaphysical subjects.
   This can only be their agreement with facts, which we shall the more
   readily admit if the new form of expression or statement of them be a
   real assistance to our powers of thought and action.

   The difficulties raised respecting necessity and free will partake, for
   the most part, of the same nature as the old fallacies respecting
   motion and space of Zeno and the Eleatics, and have their solvitur
   ambulando' as well. This is the answer of Bishop Butler, who aims only
   at a practical solution. But as it is no use to say to the lame man,
   rise up and walk,' without a crutch or helping hand, so it is no use to
   offer these practical solutions to a mind already entangled in
   speculative perplexities. It retorts upon you--I cannot walk: if my
   outward actions seem like other men's; if I do not throw myself from a
   precipice, or take away the life of another under the fatal influence
   of the doctrine of necessity, yet the course of thought within me is
   different. I look upon the world with other eyes, and slowly and
   gradually, differences in thought must beget differences also in
   action.' But if the mind, which is bound by this chain, could be shown
   that it was a slave only to its own abstract ideas--that it was below
   where it ought to be above them--that, considering all the many minds
   of men as one mind, it could trace the fiction--this world of
   abstractions would gradually disappear, and not merely in a Christian,
   but in a philosophical sense, it would receive the kingdom of Heaven as
   a little child, seeking rather for some new figure under which
   conflicting notions might be represented, than remaining in suspense
   between them. It may be as surprising to a future generation that the
   nineteenth century should have been under the influence of the illusion
   of necessity and free will, or that it should have proposed the law of
   contradiction as an ultimate test of truth, as it is to ourselves that
   former ages have been subjected to the fictions of essence, substance,
   and the like.

   The notion that no idea can be composed of two contradictory
   conceptions, seems to arise out of the analogy of the sensible world.
   It would be an absurdity to suppose that an object should be white and
   black at the same time; that a captive should be in chains and not in
   chains at the same time, and so on. But there is no absurdity in
   supposing that the mental analysis even of a matter of fact or an
   outward object should involve us in contradictions. Objects, considered
   in their most abstract point of view, may be said to contain a positive
   and a negative element: everything is and is not; is in itself, and is
   not, in relation to other things. Our conceptions of motion, of
   becoming, or of beginning, in like manner involve a contradiction. The
   old puzzles of the Eleatics are merely an exemplification of the same
   difficulty. There are objections, it has been said, against a vacuum,
   objections against a plenum, though we need not add, with the writer
   who makes the remark, Yet one of these must be true.' How a new
   substance can be formed by chemical combination out of two other
   substances may seem also to involve a contradiction, e. g. water is and
   is not oxygen and hydrogen. Life, in like manner, has been defined as a
   state in which every end is a means, and every means an end. And if we
   turn to any moral or political subject, we are perpetually coming
   across different and opposing lines of argument, and constantly in
   danger of passing from one sphere to another; of applying, for example,
   moral or theological principles to politics, and political principles
   to theology. Men form to themselves first one system, then many, as
   they term them different, but in reality opposite to each other. Just
   as that nebulous mass, out of which the heavens have been imagined to
   be formed, at last, with its circling motion, subsides into rings, and
   embodies the stars moving in their courses,' so also in the world of
   mind there are so many different orbits which never cross or touch each
   other, and yet which must be conceived of as the colours of the
   rainbow, the result of a single natural phenomenon.

   It is at first sight strange that some of these contradictions should
   seem so trivial to us, while others assume the appearance of a high
   mystery. In physics or mathematics we scarcely think of them, though
   speculative minds may sometimes be led by them to seek for higher
   expressions, or to embrace both sides of the contradiction in some
   conception of flux or transition, reciprocal action, process by
   antagonism, the Hegelian vibration of moments, or the like. In common
   life we acquiesce in the contradiction almost unconsciously, merely
   remarking on the difference of men's views, or the possibility of
   saying something on either side of a question. But in religion the
   difficulty appears of greater importance, partly from our being much
   more under the influence of language in theology than in subjects which
   we can at once bring to the test of fact and experiment, and partly
   also from our being more subject to our own natural constitution, which
   leads us to one or the other horn of the dilemma, instead of placing us
   between or above both. As in heathen times it was natural to think of
   extraordinary phenomena, such as thunder and lightning, as the work of
   gods rather than as arising from physical causes, so it is still to the
   religious mind to consider the bewilderments and entanglements which it
   has itself made as a proof of the unsearchableness of the Divine
   nature.

   The immoveableness of these abstractions from within will further
   incline us to consider the metaphysical contradiction of necessity and
   free will in the only rational way; that is, historically.' To say that
   we have ideas of fate or freedom which are innate, is to assume what is
   at once disproved by a reference to history. In the East and West, in
   India and in Greece, in Christian as well as heathen times, whenever
   men have been sufficiently enlightened to form a distinct conception of
   a single Divine power or overruling law, the question arises, How is
   the individual related to this law? The first answer to this question
   is Pantheism; in which the individual, dropping his proper qualities,
   abstracts himself into an invisible being, indistinguishable from the
   Divine. God overpowers man; the inner life absorbs the outer; the ideal
   world is too much for this. The second answer, which the East has also
   given to this question, is Fatalism; in which, without abstraction, the
   individual identifies himself, soul and body, in deed as well as
   thought, with the Divine will. The first is the religion of
   contemplation; the second, of action. Only in the last, as the world
   itself alters, the sense of the overruling power weakens; and faith in
   the Divine will, as in Mahometan countries at the present day, shows
   itself, not in a fanatical energy, but in passive compliance and
   resignation.

   The gradual emergence of the opposition is more clearly traceable in
   the Old Testament Scriptures or in Greek poetry or philosophy. The
   Israelites are distinguished from all other Eastern nations--certainly
   from all contemporary with their early history--by their distinct
   recognition of the unity and personality of God. God, who is the
   Creator and Lord of the whole earth, is also in a peculiar sense the
   God of the Jewish people whom He deals with according to His own good
   pleasure, which is also a law of truth and right. He is not so much the
   Author of good as the Author of all things, without whom nothing either
   good or evil can happen; not only the permitter of evil, but in a few
   instances, in the excess of His power, the cause of it also. With this
   universal attribute He combines another, the Lord our God, who brought
   us out of the land of bondage.' The people have one heart and one soul
   with which they worship God and have dealings with Him. Only a few
   individuals among them, as Moses or Joshua, draw near separately to
   Him. In the earliest ages they do not pray each one for himself. There
   is a great difference in this respect between the relation of man to
   God which is expressed in the Psalms and in the Pentateuch. In the
   later Psalms, certainly, and even in some of those ascribed to David,
   there is an immediate personal intercourse between God and His
   servants. At length in the books of Job and Ecclesiastes, the human
   spirit begins to strive with God, and to ask not only, how can man be
   just before God? but also, how can God be justified to man? There was a
   time when the thought of this could never have entered into their
   minds; in which they were only, as children with a father, doing evil,
   and punished, and returning once more to the arms of His wisdom and
   goodness. The childhood of their nation passed away, and the
   remembrance of what God had done for their fathers was forgotten;
   religion became the religion of individuals, of Simeon and Anna, of
   Joseph and Mary. On the one hand, there was the proud claim of those
   who said, We have Abraham to our Father;' on the other hand, the
   regretful feeling that God was casting off Israel,' which St. Paul in
   the manner of the Old Testament rebukes with the words, Who art thou, O
   man?' and We are the clay, and He the potter.'

   We may briefly trace the progress of a parallel struggle in Grecian
   mythology. It presents itself, however, in another form, beginning with
   the Fates weaving the web of life, or the Furies pursuing the guilty,
   and ending in the pure abstraction of necessity or nature. Many changes
   of feeling may be observed between the earlier and later of these two
   extremes. The Fate of poetry is not like that of philosophy, the chain
   by which the world is held together; but an ever-living power or
   curse--sometimes just, sometimes arbitrary--specially punishing impiety
   towards the Gods or violations of nature. In Homer, it represents also
   a determination already fixed, or an ill irremediable by man; in one
   aspect it is the folly which leaves no place for repentance.' In Pindar
   it receives a nobler form, Law the king of all.' In the tragedians, it
   has a peculiar interest, giving a kind of measured and regular movement
   to the whole action of the play. The consciousness that man is not his
   own master, had deepened in the course of ages; there had grown up in
   the mind a sentiment of overruling law. It was this half-religious,
   half-philosophical feeling, which Greek tragedy embodied; whence it
   derived not only dramatic irony or contrast of the real and seeming,
   but also its characteristic feature--repose. The same reflective tone
   is observable in the Epic' historian of the Persian war; who delights
   to tell, not (like a modern narrator) of the necessary connexion of
   causes and effects, but of effects without causes, due only to the will
   of Heaven. A sadder note is heard at intervals of the feebleness and
   nothingness of man; pan estin anthropos sumphore. In Thucydides, (who
   was separated from Herodotus by an interval of about twenty years) the
   sadness remains, but the religious element has vanished. Man is no
   longer in the toils of destiny, but he is still feeble and helpless.
   Fortune and human enterprise divide the empire of life.

   Such conceptions of fate belong to Paganism, and have little in common
   with that higher idea of Divine predestination of which the New
   Testament speaks. The Fate of Greek philosophy is different from
   either. The earlier schools expressed their sense of an all-pervading
   law in rude, mythological figures. In time this passed away, and the
   conceptions of chance, of nature, and necessity became matters of
   philosophical inquiry. By the Sophists first the question was
   discussed, whether man is the cause of his own actions; the mode in
   which they treated of the subject being to identify the good with the
   voluntary, and the evil with the involuntary. It is this phase of the
   question which is alone considered by Aristotle. In the chain of the
   Stoics the doctrine has arrived at a further stage, in which human
   action has become a part of the course of the world. How the free will
   of man was to be reconciled either with Divine power, or Divine
   foreknowledge, was a difficulty pressed upon the Stoical philosopher
   equally as upon the metaphysicians of the last century; and was met by
   various devices, such as that of the confatalism of Chrysippus, which
   may be described as a sort of identity of fate and freedom, or of an
   action and its conditions.

   Our inquiry has been thus far confined to an attempt to show, first,
   that the question of predestination cannot be considered according to
   the common rules of logic; secondly, that the contradictions which are
   involved in this question, are of the same kind as many other contrasts
   of ideas; and, thirdly, that the modern conception of necessity was the
   growth of ages, whether its true origin is to be sought in the
   Scriptures, or in the Greek philosophy. or both. If only we could throw
   ourselves back to a prior state of the world, and know no other modes
   of thought than those which existed in the infancy of the human mind,
   the opposition would cease to have any meaning for us; and thus the
   further reflection is suggested, that if ever we become fully conscious
   that the words which we use respecting it are words only, it will again
   become unmeaning. Historically we know when it arose, and whence it
   came. Already we are able to consider the subject in a simpler way,
   whether presented to us (1) in connexion with the statements of
   Scripture, or (2) as a subject of theology and philosophy.

   § 2.

   Two kinds of predestination may be distinguished in the writings of St.
   Paul, as well as in some parts of the Old Testament. First, the
   predestination of nations; secondly, of individuals. The former of
   these may be said to flow out of the latter, God choosing at once the
   patriarchs and their descendants. As the author of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews expresses it, By faith Abraham offered up Isaac; and therefore
   sprang there of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of
   heaven in multitude.' The life of the patriarchs was the type or shadow
   of the history of their posterity, for evil as well as good. Simeon and
   Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations;
   Joseph is a goodly bough;' Moab and Ammon are children of whoredom;
   Ishmael is a wild man, and so on. There is also the feeling that
   whatever extraordinary thing happens in Jewish history is God's doing,
   not of works nor even of faith, but of grace and choice: He took David
   from the sheep-folds, and set him over His people Israel.' So that a
   double principle is discernible: first, absolute election; and,
   secondly, the fulfilment of the promises made to the fathers, or the
   visitation of their sins upon the children.

   The notion of freedom is essentially connected with that of
   individuality. No one is truly free who has not that inner circle of
   thoughts and actions in which he is wholly himself and independent of
   the will of others. A slave, for example, may be in this sense free,
   even while in the service of his lord; constraint can apply only to his
   outward acts, not to his inward nature. But if, in the language of
   Aristotle, he were a natural slave, whose life seemed to himself
   defective and imperfect, who had no thoughts or feelings of his own,
   but only instincts and impulses, we could no more call him free than a
   domestic animal which attaches itself to a master. So, in that stage of
   society in which the state is all in all, the idea of the individual
   has a feeble existence. In the language of philosophy the whole is
   free, and the parts are determined by the whole. So the theocracy of
   the Old Testament seems to swallow up its members. The Jewish
   commonwealth is governed by God himself; this of itself interferes with
   the personal relation in which He stands to the individuals who compose
   it. Through the law only, in the congregation, at the great feasts,
   through their common ancestors, the people draw near to God; they do
   not venture to think severally of their separate and independent
   connexion with Him. They stand or fall together; they go astray or
   return to Him as one man. It is this which makes so much of their
   history directly applicable to the struggle of Christian life.
   Religion, which to the believer in Christ is an individual principle,
   is with them a national one.

   The idea of a chosen people passes from the Old Testament into the New.
   As the Jews had been predestined in the one, so it appeared to the
   Apostle St. Paul that the Gentiles were predestined in the other. In
   the Old Testament he observed two sorts of predestination; first, that
   more general one, in which all who were circumcised were partakers of
   the privilege--which was applicable to all Israelites as the children
   of Abraham; secondly, the more particular one, in reference to which he
   says, All are not Israel who are of Israel.' To the eye of faith all
   Israel were saved;' and yet within Israel, there was another Israel
   chosen in a more special sense. The analogy of this double
   predestination the Apostle transfers to the Christian society. All
   alike were holy, even those of whom he speaks in the strongest terms of
   reprobation. The Church, like Israel of old, presents to the Apostle's
   mind the conception of a definite body, consisting of those who are
   sealed by baptism and have received the first fruits of the Spirit.'
   They are elect according to the foreknowledge or predisposition of God;
   sealed by God unto the day of redemption; a peculiar people, a royal
   priesthood, taken alike from Jews and Gentiles. The Apostle speaks of
   their election as of some external fact. The elect of God have an
   offence among them not even named among the Gentiles, they abuse the
   gifts of the Spirit, they partake in the idol's temple, they profane
   the body and blood of Christ. And yet, as the Israelites of old, they
   bear on their foreheads the mark that they are God's people, and are
   described as chosen saints,' sanctified in Christ Jesus.'

   Again, the Apostle argues respecting Israel itself, Hath God cast off
   his people whom he foreknew?' or rather, whom He before appointed. They
   are in the position of their fathers when they sinned against Him. If
   we read their history we shall see, that what happened to them in old
   times is happening to them now; and yet in the Old Testament as well as
   the New the overruling design was not their condemnation but their
   salvation--God concluded all under sin that he might have mercy upon
   all.' They stumbled and rose again then; they will stumble and rise
   again now. Their predestination from the beginning is a proof that they
   cannot be finally cast off; beloved as they have been for their
   father's sakes, and the children of so many promises. There is a
   providence which, in spite of all contrary appearance, in spite of the
   acceptance of the Gentiles, or rather so much the more in consequence
   of it, makes all things work together for good to the chosen people.

   In this alternation of hopes and fears, in which hope finally prevails
   over fear, the Apostle speaks in the strongest language of the right of
   God to do what He will with His own; if any doctrine could be
   established by particular passages of Scripture, Calvinism would rest
   immoveable on the ninth chapter of the Romans. It seemed to him no more
   unjust that God should reject than that He should accept the
   Israelites; if, at that present time He cut them short in
   righteousness, and narrowed the circle of election, He had done the
   same with the patriarchs. He had said of old, Jacob have I loved, and
   Esau have I hated:' and this preference, as the Apostle observes, was
   shown before either could have committed actual sin. In the same spirit
   He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I
   will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.' And to Pharaoh,
   For this cause have I raised thee up.' Human nature, it is true, rebels
   at this, and says, Why does he yet find fault?' To which the Apostle
   only replies, Shall the thing formed say unto him that formed it, Why
   hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay?' Some
   of the expressions which have become the most objectionable watchwords
   of predestinarian theology, such as vessels of wrath and vessels of
   mercy,' are in fact taken from the same passage in the Epistle to the
   Romans.

   It is answered by the opponents of Calvinism, that the Apostle is here
   speaking not of individual but of national predestination. From the
   teaching of the Old Testament respecting the election of the Jewish
   people we can infer nothing respecting the Divine economy about
   persons. To which in turn it may be replied, that if we admit the
   principle that the free choice of nations is not inconsistent with
   Divine justice, we cannot refuse to admit the free choice of persons
   also. A little more or a little less of the doctrine cannot make it
   more or less reconcilable with the perfect justice of God. Nor can we
   argue that the election of nations is a part of the Old Testament
   dispensation, which has no place in the New; because the Apostle speaks
   of election according to the purpose of God as a principle which was at
   that time being manifested in the acceptance of the Gentiles.

   Yet the distinction is a sound one if stated a little differently, that
   is to say, if we consider that the predestination of Christians is only
   the continuance of the Old Testament in the New. It is the feeling of a
   religious Israelite respecting his race; this the Apostle enlarges to
   comprehend the Gentiles. As the temporal Israel becomes the spiritual
   Israel, the chosen people are transfigured into the elect. Why this is
   so is only a part of the more general question, why the New Testament
   was given through the Old?' It was natural it should be so given;
   humanly speaking, it could not have been otherwise. The Gospel would
   have been unmeaning, if it had been tossed into the world' separated
   from all human antecedents; if the heaven of its clearness had been
   beyond the breath of every human feeling. Neither is there any more
   untruthfulness in St. Paul's requiring us to recognize the goodness of
   God in the election of some and the rejection of others, than in
   humility or any act of devotion. The untruth lies not in the devout
   feeling, but in the logical statement. When we humble ourselves before
   God, we may know, as a matter of common sense, that we are not worse
   than others; but this, however true (Father, I thank thee I am not as
   other men'), is not the temper in which we kneel before Him. So in
   these passages, St. Paul is speaking, not from a general consideration
   of the Divine nature, but with the heart and feelings of an Israelite.
   Could the question have been brought before him in another form--could
   we have been asked whether God, according to His own pleasure, chose
   out individual souls, so that some could not fail of being saved while
   others were necessarily lost--could he have been asked whether Christ
   died for all or for the chosen few--whether, in short, God was sincere
   in his offer of salvation--can we doubt that to such suggestions he
   would have replied in his own words, God forbid! for how shall God
   judge the world?'

   It has been said that the great error in the treatment of this subject
   consists in taking chap. ix. separated from chaps. x. xi. We may say
   more generally, in taking parts of Scripture without the whole, or in
   interpreting either apart from history and experience. In considering
   the question of predestination, we must not forget that at least
   one-half of Scripture tells not of what God does, but of what man ought
   to do; not of grace and pardon only, but of holiness. If, in speaking
   of election, St. Paul seems at times to use language which implies the
   irrespective election of the Jews as a nation; yet, on the other hand,
   what immediately follows shows us that conditions were understood
   throughout, and that, although we may not challenge the right of God to
   do what He would with His own, yet that in all His dealings with them
   the dispensation was but the effect of their conduct. And although the
   Apostle is speaking chiefly of national predestination, with respect to
   which the election of God is asserted by him in the most unconditional
   terms; yet, as if he were already anticipating the application of his
   doctrine to the individual, he speaks of human causes for the rejection
   of Israel; because they sought not righteousness by the way of faith;'
   because they stumble at the rock of offence.' God accepted and rejected
   Israel of His own good pleasure; and yet it was by their own fault. How
   are we to reconcile these conflicting statements? They do not need
   reconciliation; they are but the two opposite expressions of a
   religious mind, which says at one moment, Let me try to do right,' and
   at another, God alone can make me do right.' The two feelings may
   involve a logical contradiction, and yet exist together in fact and in
   the religious experience of mankind.

   In the Old Testament the only election of individuals is that of the
   great leaders or chiefs, who are identified with the nation. But in the
   New Testament, where religion has become a personal and individual
   matter, it follows that election must also be of persons. The Jewish
   nation knew, or seemed to know, one fact, that they were the chosen
   people. They saw, also, eminent men raised up by the hand of God to be
   the deliverers of His servants. It is not in this historical' way that
   the Christian becomes conscious of his individual election. From
   within, not from without, he is made aware of the purpose of God
   respecting himself. Living in close and intimate union with God, having
   the mind of the Spirit and knowing the things of the Spirit, he begins
   to consider with St. Paul, When it pleased God, who separated me from
   my mother's womb, to reveal his Son in me.' His whole life seems a sort
   of miracle to him; supernatural, and beyond other men's in the gifts of
   grace which he has received. If he asks himself, Whence was this to
   me?' he finds no other answer but that God gave them because he had a
   favour unto him.' He recalls the hour of his conversion, when, in a
   moment, he was changed from darkness to light, and from the power of
   Satan unto God. Or, perhaps, the dealings of God with him have been
   insensible, yet not the less real; like a child, he cannot remember the
   time when he first began to trust the love of his parent. How can he
   separate himself from that love or refuse to believe that He who began
   the good work will also accomplish it unto the end? At which step in
   the ladder of God's mercy will he stop? Whom he did foreknow, them he
   did predestinate; whom he did predestinate, them he also called; whom
   he called, them he justified; whom he justified, them he also
   glorified.'

   A religious mind feels the difference between saying, God chose me; I
   cannot tell why; not for any good that I have done; and I am persuaded
   that he will keep me unto the end;' and saying, God chooses men quite
   irrespective of their actions, and predestines them to eternal
   salvation;' and yet more, if we add the other half of the doctrine, God
   refuses men quite irrespective of their actions, and they become
   reprobates, predestined to everlasting damnation.' Could we be willing
   to return to that stage of the doctrine which St. Paul taught, without
   comparing contradictory statements or drawing out logical
   conclusions--could we be content to rest our belief, as some of the
   greatest, even of Calvinistic divines have done, on fact and
   experience, theology would be no longer at variance with morality.

   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that
   worketh in you both to do and to will of his good pleasure,' is the
   language of Scripture, adjusting the opposite aspects of this question.
   The Arminian would say, Work out your own. salvation;' the Calvinist,
   God worketh in you both to do and to will of his good pleasure.'
   However contradictory it may sound, the Scripture unites both; work out
   your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh
   in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.

   § 3.

   I. We have been considering the question thus far within the limits of
   Scripture. But it has also a wider range. The primary relations of the
   will of man to the will of God are independent of the Christian
   revelation. Natural religion, that is to say, the Greek seeking after
   wisdom, the Indian wandering in the expanse of his own dreamlike
   consciousness, the Jew repeating to himself that he is Abraham's seed;
   each in their several ways at different stages of the world's history
   have asked the question, How is the freedom of the human will
   consistent with the infinity and omnipotence of God?' These attributes
   admit of a further analysis into the power of God and the knowledge of
   God. And hence arises a second form of the inquiry, How is the freedom
   of the human will reconcilable with Divine omniscience or
   foreknowledge?' To which the Christian system adds a third question,
   How is the freedom of the human will reconcilable with that more
   immediate presence of God in the soul which is termed by theologians
   Divine grace?'

   (1) God is everywhere; man is nowhere. Infinity exists continuously in
   every point of time; it fills every particle of space. Or rather, these
   very ideas of time and space are figures of speech, for they have a
   here' and a there,' a future and a past--which no effort of human
   imagination can transcend. But in God there is no future and no past,
   neither here nor there;' He is all and in all. Where, then, is room for
   man? in what open place is he permitted to live and move and have his
   being?

   God is the cause of all things; without Him nothing is made that is
   made. He is in history, in nature, in the heart of man. The world
   itself is the work of His power; the least particulars of human life
   are ordained by Him. Are not two sparrows sold for one farthing, and
   yet your heavenly Father feedeth them;' and the hairs of your head are
   all numbered.' Is there any point at which this Divine causalty can
   stop? at which the empire of law ceases? at which the human will is set
   free?

   The answer is the fact; not the fact of consciousness as it is
   sometimes termed, that we are free agents, which it is impossible to
   see or verify; but the visible tangible fact that we have a place in
   the order of nature, and walk about on the earth, and are ourselves
   causes drawing effects after them. Does any advocate of freedom mean
   more than this? Or any believer in necessity less? No one can deny of
   himself the restrictions which he observes to be true of others; nor
   can any one doubt that there exists in others the same consciousness of
   freedom and responsibility which he has himself. But if so, all these
   things are as they were before; we need not differ about the unseen
   foundation whether of necessity or free will, spirit or body, mind or
   matter, upon which the edifice of human life is to be reared. Just as
   the theory of the ideality of matter leaves the world where it
   was--they do not build houses in the air who imagine Bishop Berkeley to
   have dissolved the solid elements into sensations of the mind--so the
   doctrine of necessity or predestination leaves morality and religion
   unassailed, unless it intrude itself as a motive on the sphere of human
   action.

   It is remarkable that the belief in predestination, both in modern and
   in ancient times, among Mahometans as well as Christians, has been the
   animating principle of nations and bodies of men, equally, perhaps more
   than of individuals. It is characteristic of certain countries, and has
   often arisen from sympathy in a common cause. Yet it cannot be said to
   have been without a personal influence also. It has led to a view of
   religion in which man has been too much depressed to form a true
   conception of God himself. For it is not to be supposed that the lower
   we sink human nature in the scale of being, the higher we raise the
   Author of being; worthy notions of God imply worthy notions of man
   also.

   God is infinite.' But in what sense? Am I to conceive a space without
   limit, such as I behold in the immeasurable ether, and apply this
   viewless form to the thought of the Almighty? Any one will admit that
   here would be a figure of speech. Yet few of us free our notions of
   infinity from the imagery of place. It is this association which gives
   them their positive, exclusive character. But conceive of infinity as
   mere negation, denying of God the limits which are imposed upon finite
   beings, meaning only that God is not a man or comprehensible by man,
   without any suggestion of universal space, and the exclusiveness
   disappears; there is room for the creature side by side with the
   Creator. Or again, press the idea of the infinite to its utmost extent,
   till it is alone in the universe, or rather is the universe itself, in
   this heaven of abstraction, nevertheless, a cloud begins to appear; a
   limitation casts its shadow over the formless void. Infinite is finite
   because it is infinite. That is to say, because infinity includes all
   things, it is incapable of creating what is external to itself. Deny
   infinity in this sense, and the being to whom it is attributed receives
   a new power; God is greater by being finite than by being infinite.
   Proceeding in the same train of thought, we may observe that the word
   finite is the symbol, to our own minds as to the Greek, of strength and
   reality and truth. It cannot be these which we intend to deny of the
   Divine Being. Lastly, when we have freed our minds from associations of
   place and from those other solemn associations which naturally occur to
   us from its application to the Almighty, are we sure that we intend
   anything more by the Infinite' than mere vacancy, the indefinite,' the
   word not?'

   It is useful to point out the ambiguities and perplexities of such
   terms. Logic is not to puzzle us with inferences about words which she
   clothes in mystery; at any rate, before moving a step she should
   explain their meaning. She must admit that the infinite overreaches
   itself in denying the existence of the finite, and that there are some
   limitations,' such as the impossibility of evil or falsehood, which are
   of the essence of the Divine nature. She must inquire whether it be
   conceivable to reach a further infinite, in which the opposition to the
   finite is denied, which may be a worthier image of the Divine Being.
   She must acknowledge that negative ideas, while they have often a kind
   of solemnity and mystery, are the shallowest and most trifling of all
   our ideas.

   So far the will may be free unless we persist in an idea of the Divine
   which logic and not reason erroneously requires, and which is the
   negative not only of freedom but of all other existence but its own.
   More serious consequences may seem to flow from the attribute of
   omnipotence. For if God is the Author of all things, must it not be as
   a mode of Divine operation that man acts? We can get no further than a
   doctrine of emanation or derivation. Again, we are caught unwittingly
   in the toils of an illogical' logic. For why should we assume that
   because God is omnipotent He cannot make beings independent of himself?
   A figure of speech is not generally a good argument; but in this
   instance it is a sufficient one, what is needed being not an answer but
   only an image or mode of conception. (For in theology and philosophy it
   constantly happens that while logic is working out antinomies, language
   fails to supply an expression of the intermediate truth.) The carpenter
   makes a chair, which exists detached from its maker; the mechanician
   constructs a watch, which is wound up and goes by the action of a
   spring or lever; he can frame yet more complex instruments, in which
   power is treasured up for other men to use. The greater the skill of
   the artificer the more perfect and independent the work. Shall we say
   of God only that He is unable to separate His creations from himself?
   That man can produce works of imagination which live for ages after he
   is committed to the dust; nay, that in the way of nature he can bring
   into existence another being endowed with life and consciousness to
   perpetuate His name? But that God cannot remove a little space to
   contemplate His works? He must needs be present in all their movements,
   according to the antiquated error of natural philosophers, that no body
   can act where it is not.'

   (2) Yet although the freedom of the will may be consistent with the
   infinity and omnipotence of God, when rightly understood and separated
   from logical consequences, it may be thought to be really interfered
   with by the Divine omniscience. God knows all things; our thoughts are
   His before they are our own; what I am doing at this moment was
   certainly foreseen by Him; what He certainly foresaw yesterday, or a
   thousand years ago, or from everlasting, how can I avoid doing at this
   time? To-day He sees the future course of my life. Can I make or unmake
   what is already within the circle of His knowledge? The imperfect
   judgement of my fellow-creatures gives me no disquietude--they may
   condemn me, and I may reverse their opinion. But the fact that the
   unerring judgement of God has foreseen my doom renders me alike
   indifferent to good and evil.'

   What shall we say to this? First, that the distinction between Divine
   and human judgements is only partially true. For as God sees with
   absolute unerringness, so a wise man who is acquainted with the
   character and circumstances of others may foretell and assure their
   future life with a great degree of certainty. He may perceive
   intuitively their strength and weakness, and prophesy their success or
   failure. Now, here it is observable, that the fact of our knowing the
   probable course of action which another will pursue has nothing to do
   with the action itself. It does not exercise the smallest constraint on
   him; it does not produce the slightest feeling of constraint. Imagine
   ourselves acquainted with the habits of some animal; as we open the
   door of the enclosure in which it is kept, we know that it will run up
   to or away from us; it will show signs of pleasure or irritation. No
   one supposes that its actions, whatever they are, depend on our
   knowledge of them. Let us take another example, which is at the other
   end of the scale of freedom and intelligence. Conceive a veteran
   statesman casting his eye over the map of Europe, and foretelling the
   parts which nations or individuals would take in some coming struggle,
   who thinks the events when they come to pass are the consequences of
   the prediction? Every one is able to distinguish the causes of the
   events from the knowledge which foretells them.

   There are degrees in human knowledge or foreknowledge proceeding from
   the lowest probability, through increasing certainty, up to absolute
   demonstration. But as faint presumptions do not affect the future, nor
   great probability, so neither does scientific demonstration. Many
   natural laws cannot be known more certainly than they are; but we do
   not therefore confuse the fact with our knowledge of the fact. The time
   of the rising of the sun, or of the ebb and flow of the tide, are
   foretold and acted upon without the least hesitation. Yet no one has
   imagined that these or any other natural phenomena are affected by our
   previous calculations about them.

   Why, then, should we impose on ourselves the illusion that the unerring
   certainty of Divine knowledge is a limit or shackle on human actions?
   The foreknowledge which we possess ourselves in no way produces the
   facts which we foresee; the circumstance that we foresee them in
   distant time has no more to do with them than if we saw them in distant
   space. So, once more, we return from the dominion of ideas and trains
   of speculative consequences to rest in experience. God sits upon the
   circle of the heavens, present, past, and future in a figure open
   before Him, and sees the inhabitants of the earth like grasshoppers,
   coming and going, to and fro, doing or not doing their appointed work:
   His knowledge of them is not the cause of their actions. So might we
   ourselves look down upon some wide prospect without disturbing the
   peaceful toils of the villagers who are beneath. They do not slacken or
   hasten their business because we are looking at them. In like manner
   God may look upon mankind without thereby interfering with the human
   will or influencing in any degree the actions of men.

   (3) But the difficulty with which Christianity surrounds, or rather
   seems to surround us, winds yet closer; it rests also on the Christian
   consciousness. The doctrine of grace may be expressed in the language
   of St. Paul: I can do nothing as of myself, but my sufficiency is of
   God:' that which is truly self, which is peculiarly self, is yet in
   another point of view not self but God. He who has sought most
   earnestly to fulfil the will of God refers his efforts to something
   beyond himself; he is humble and simple, seeming to fear that he will
   lose the good that he has, when he makes it his own.

   This is the mind of Christ which is formally expressed in theology by
   theories of grace. Theories of grace have commonly started from the
   transgression of Adam and the corruption of human nature in his
   posterity. Into the origin of sin it is not necessary for us to
   inquire; we may limit ourselves to the fact. All men are very far gone
   from original righteousness, they can only return to God by His grace
   preventing them; that is to say, anticipating and co-operating with the
   motions of their will. (1) God wills that some should be saved, whom He
   elects without reference to their deserts; (2) God wills that some
   should be saved, and implants in them the mind of salvation; (3) God
   calls all men, but chooses some out of those whom He calls; (4) God
   chooses all alike, and shows no preference to any; (5) God calls all
   men, even in the heathen world, and some hear His voice, not knowing
   whom they obey. Such are the possible gradations of the question of
   election. In the first of them grace is a specific quality distinct
   from holiness or moral virtue; in the second it is identical with
   holiness and moral virtue, according to a narrow conception of them
   which denies their existence in those who have not received a Divine
   call; in the third an attempt is made to reconcile justice to all men
   with favour to some; in the fourth the justice of God extends equally
   to all Christian men; in the fifth we pass the boundaries of the
   Christian world and expression is given to the thought of the Apostle,
   Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but that in
   every nation he that feareth God is accepted of him.'

   All these theories of grace affect at various points the freedom of the
   will, the first seeming wholly to deny it, while all the others attempt
   some real or apparent reconcilement of morality and religion. The
   fourth and fifth meet the difficulties arising out of our ideas of the
   justice of God, but fall into others derived from experience and fact.
   Can we say that all Christians, nominal and real, nay, that the most
   degraded persons among the heathen, are equally the subjects of Divine
   grace? Then grace is something unintelligible; it is a word only, to
   which there is no corresponding idea. Again, how upon any of these
   theories is grace distinguishable from the better consciousness of the
   individual himself? Can any one pretend to say where grace ends and the
   movement of the will begins? Did any one ever recognize in himself
   those lines of demarcation of which theology sometimes speaks?

   These are difficulties in which we are involved by oppositions of
   knowledge falsely so called.' The answer to them is simple--a return to
   fact and nature. When, instead of reading our own hearts, we seek, in
   accordance with a preconceived theory, to determine the proportions of
   the divine and human--to distinguish grace and virtue, the word of God
   and man--we know not where we are, the difficulty becomes insuperable,
   we have involved ourselves in artificial meshes, and are bound hand and
   foot. But when we look by the light of conscience and Scripture on the
   facts of human nature, the difficulty of itself disappears. No one
   doubts that he is capable of choosing between good and evil, and that
   in making this choice he may be supported, if he will, by a power more
   than earthly. The movement of that Divine power is not independent of
   the movement of his own will, but coincident and identical with it.
   Grace and virtue, conscience and the Spirit of God, are not different
   from each other, but in harmony. If no man can do what is right without
   the aid of the Spirit, then every one who does what is right has the
   aid of the Spirit.

   Part of the difficulty originates in the fact that the Scripture
   regards Christian truth from a Divine aspect, God working in you,'
   while ordinary language, even among religious men in modern times,
   deals rather with human states or feelings. Philosophy has a third way
   of speaking which is different from either. Two or more sets of words
   and ideas are used which gradually acquire a seemingly distinct
   meaning; at last comes the question--in what relation they stand to one
   another? The Epistles speak of grace and faith at the same time that
   heathen moralists told of virtue and wisdom, and the two streams of
   language have flowed on without uniting even at our own day. The
   question arises, first, whether grace is anything more than the
   objective name of faith and love; and again, whether these two latter
   are capable of being distinguished from virtue and truth? Is that which
   St. Paul called faith absolutely different from that which Seneca
   termed virtue or morality? Is not virtue, pros theon, faith? Is faith
   anything without virtue? But if so, they are not opposed at all, or
   opposed only as part and whole. Christianity is not the negative of the
   religions of nature or the heathen; it includes and purifies them.

   Instead, then, of arranging in a sort of theological diagram the
   relations of the human will to Divine grace, we deny the possibility of
   separating them. In various degrees, in many ways, more or less
   consciously in different cases, the Spirit of God is working in the
   soul of man. It is an erroneous mode of speaking, according to which
   the free agency of man is represented as in conflict with the Divine
   will. For the freedom of man in the higher sense is the grace of God;
   and in the lower sense (of mere choice) is not inconsistent with it.
   The real opposition is not between freedom and predestination, which
   are imperfect and in some degree misleading expressions of the same
   truth, but between good and evil.

   II. Passing out of the sphere of religion, we have now to examine the
   question of free agency within the narrower limits of the mind itself.
   It will confirm the line of argument hitherto taken, if it be found
   that here too we are subject to the illusions of language and the
   oppositions of logic.

   (1) Every effect has a cause; every cause an effect. The drop of rain,
   the ray of light does not descend at random on the earth. In the
   natural world though we are far from understanding all the causes of
   phenomena, we are certain from that part which we know, of their
   existence in that part which we do not know. In the human mind we
   perceive the action of many physical causes; we are therefore led to
   infer, that only our ignorance of physiology prevents our perceiving
   the absolute interdependence of body and soul. So indissolubly are
   cause and effect bound together, that there is a mental impossibility
   in conceiving them apart. Where, then in the endless chain of causes
   and effect can the human will be inserted, or how is the insertion of
   the will, as one cause out of many, consistent with the absolute
   freedom which we ascribe to it?

   The author of the Critic of pure Reason is willing to accept such a
   statement as has been just made, and yet believes himself to have found
   out of time and space, independent of the laws of cause and effect, a
   transcendental freedom. Our separate acts are determined by previous
   causes; our whole life is a continuous effect,' yet in spite of this
   mechanical sequence, freedom is the overruling law which gives the form
   to human action. It is not necessary to analyze the steps by which Kant
   arrived at this paradoxical conclusion. Only by adjusting the glass so
   as to exclude from the sight everything but the perplexities of
   previous philosophers, can we conceive how a great intellect could have
   been led to imagine the idea of a freedom from which the notion of time
   is abstracted, of which nevertheless we are conscious in time. For what
   is that freedom which does not apply to our individual acts, hardly
   even to our lives as a whole, like a point which has neither length nor
   breadth, wanting both continuity and succession?

   Scepticism proceeds by a different path in reference to our ideas of
   cause and effect; it challenges their validity, it denies the necessity
   of the connexion, or even doubts the ideas themselves. There was a time
   when the world was startled out of its propriety at this verbal puzzle,
   and half believed itself a sceptic. Now we know that no innovation in
   the use of words or in forms of thought can make any impression on
   solid facts. Nature and religion, and human life remain the same, even
   to one who entirely renounces the common conceptions of cause and
   effect.

   The sceptic of the last century, instead of attempting to invalidate
   the connexion of fact which we express by the terms cause and effect,
   should rather have attacked language as unequal to the subtlety of
   nature.' Facts must be described in some way, and therefore words must
   be used, but always in philosophy with a latent consciousness of their
   inadequacy and imperfection. The very phrase, cause and effect,' has a
   dire influence in disguising from us the complexity of causes and
   effects. It is too abstract to answer to anything in the concrete. It
   tends to isolate in idea some one antecedent or condition from all the
   rest. And the relation which we deem invariable is really a most
   various one. Its apparent necessity is only the necessity of relative
   terms. Every cause has an effect, in the same sense that every father
   has a son. But while in the latter case the relation is always the
   same, the manifold application of the terms, cause and effect, to the
   most different phenomena has led to an ambiguity in their use. Our
   first impression is, that a cause is one thing and an effect another,
   but soon we find them doubling up, or melting into one. The circulation
   of the blood is not the cause of life, in the same sense that a blow
   with the hammer may be the cause of death; nor is virtue the cause of
   happiness, in precisely the same sense that the circulation of the
   blood is the cause of life. Everywhere, as we ascend in the scale of
   creation, from mechanics to chemistry, from chemistry to physiology and
   human action, the relative notion is more difficult and subtle, the
   cause becoming inextricably involved with the effect, and the effect
   with the cause, every means being an end, and every end a means.'

   Hence, no one who examines our ideas of cause and effect will believe
   that they impose any limit on the will; they are an imperfect mode in
   which the mind imagines the sequence of nature or moral actions; being
   no generalization from experience, but a play of words only. The chain
   which we are wearing is loose, and when shaken will drop off. External
   circumstances are not the cause of which the will is the effect;
   neither is the will the cause of which circumstances are the effect.
   But the phenomenon intended to be described by the words cause and
   effect' is itself the will, whose motions are analyzed in language
   borrowed from physical nature.

   The same explanation applies to another formula: the strongest motive.'
   The will of every man is said to be only determined by the strongest
   motive: what is this but another imaginary analysis of the will itself?
   For the motive is a part of the will, and the strongest motive is
   nothing more than the motive which I choose. Nor is it true as a fact
   that we are always thus determined. For the greater proportion of human
   actions have no distinct motives; the mind does not stand like the
   schoolmen's ass, pondering between opposite alternatives. Mind and
   will, and the sequence of cause and effect, and the force of motives,
   are different ways of speaking of the same mental phenomena.

   So readily are we deceived by language, so easily do we fall under the
   power of imaginary reasonings. The author of the Novum Organum has put
   men upon their guard against the illusions of words in the study of the
   natural sciences. It is true that many distinctions may be drawn
   between the knowledge of nature, the facts of which are for the most
   part visible and tangible, and morality and religion, which run up into
   the unseen. But is it therefore to be supposed that language, which is
   the source of half the exploded fallacies of chemistry and physiology,
   is an adequate or exact expression of moral and spiritual truths? It is
   probable that its analysis of human nature is really as erring and
   inaccurate as its description of physical phenomena, though the error
   may be more difficult of detection. Those inexact natures' or
   substances of which Bacon speaks exist in moral philosophy as in
   physics; their names are not heat, moisture, form, matter and the like,
   but necessity, free will, predestination, grace, motive, cause, which
   rest upon nothing and yet become the foundation-stones of many systems.
   Logic, too, has its parallels, and conjugates, and differences of kind,
   which in life and reality are only differences of degree, and remote
   inferences lending an apparent weight to the principle on which they
   really drag, which spread themselves over every field of thought and
   are hardly corrected by their inconsistency with the commonest facts.

   III. Difficulties of this class belong to the last generation rather
   than to the present; they are seldom discussed now by philosophical
   writers. Philosophy in our own age is occupied in another way. Her
   foundation is experience, which alone she interrogates respecting the
   limits of human action. How far is man a free agent? is the question
   still before us. But it is to be considered from without rather than
   from within, as it appears to others or ourselves in the case of
   others, and not with reference to our internal consciousness of our own
   actions.

   The conclusions of philosophers would have met with more favour at the
   hands of preachers and moralists, had they confined themselves to the
   fact. Indeed, they would have been irresistible, like the conclusions
   of natural science, for who can resist evidence that any one may verify
   for himself? But the taint of language has clung to them; the imperfect
   expression of manifest truths has greatly hindered the general
   acceptance of them even among the most educated. It was not understood
   that those who spoke of necessity meant nothing which was really
   inconsistent with free will; when they assumed a power of calculating
   human actions, it was not perceived that all of us are every day guilty
   of this imaginary impiety. The words, character, habit, force of
   circumstances, temperament and constitution imply all that is really
   involved in the idea that human action is subject to uniform laws.
   Neither is it to be denied that expressions have been used equally
   repugnant to fact and morality; instead of regularity, and order, and
   law, which convey a beneficent idea, necessity has been set up as a
   constraining power tending to destroy, if not really destroying, the
   accountability of man. History, too, has received an impress of
   fatalism, which has doubtless affected our estimate of the good and
   evil of the agents who have been regarded as not really responsible for
   actions which the march of events forced upon them.

   According to a common way of considering this subject, the domain of
   necessity is extending every day, and liberty is already confined to a
   small territory not yet reclaimed by scientific inquiry. Mind and body
   are in closer contact; there is increasing evidence of the
   interdependence of the mental and nervous powers. It is probable, or
   rather certain, that every act of the mind has a cause and effect in
   the body, that every act of the body has a cause and effect in the
   mind. Given the circumstances, parentage, education, temperament of
   each individual; we may calculate, with an approximation to accuracy,
   his probable course of life. Persons are engaged every day in making
   such observations; and whatever uncertainty there may be in the
   determination of the future of any single individual, this uncertainty
   is eliminated when the inquiry is extended to many individuals or to a
   whole class. We have as good data for supposing that a fixed proportion
   of a million persons in a country will commit murder or theft as that a
   fixed proportion will die without reaching a particular age and of this
   or that disease under given circumstances. And it so happens that we
   have the power of testing this order or uniformity in the most trifling
   of human actions. Nor can we doubt that were it worth while to make an
   abstract of human life, arranging under heads the least minutiae of
   action, all that we say and do would be found to conform to numerical
   laws.

   So, again, history is passing into the domain of philosophy. Nations,
   like individuals, are moulded by circumstances; in their first rise,
   and ever after in their course, they are dependent on country and
   climate, like plants or animals, embodying the qualities which have
   dropped upon them from surrounding influences in national temperament;
   in their later stages seeming to react upon these causes, and coming
   under a new kind of law, as the earth discloses its hidden treasures,
   or the genius of man calls forth into life and action the powers which
   are dormant in matter. Nature, which is, in other words, the aggregate
   of all these causes, stamps nations and societies, and creates in them
   a mind, that is to say, ideas of order, of religion, of conquest, which
   they maintain, often unimpaired by the changes in their physical
   condition. She infuses among the mass a few great intellects, according
   to some law unknown to us, to instrument this lower world.' Here is a
   new power which is partially separated from the former, and yet
   combines with it in national existence, like body and soul in the
   existence of man. Partly isolated from their age and nation, partly
   also identified with them, it is a curious observation respecting great
   men that while they seem to have more play and freedom than others, in
   themselves they are often more enthralled, being haunted with the sense
   of a destiny which controls them. The heirs of all the ages' who have
   subjected nature to the dominion of science are also nature's subjects;
   the conquerors who have poured over the earth have only continued some
   wave or tendency in the history of the times which preceded them. From
   the thin vapour which first floated, as some believe, in the azure
   vault, up to that miracle of complexity which we call man, and again
   from man the individual to the whole human race, with its languages and
   religions, and other national characteristics, and backwards to the
   beginning of human history, in the works of mind too as well as in the
   material universe, there is not always development, but order, and
   uniformity, and law.

   It is a matter of some importance in what way this connexion or order
   of nature is to be expressed. For although words cannot alter facts,
   the right use of them greatly affects the readiness with which facts
   are admitted or received. Now the world may be variously imagined as a
   vast machine, as an animal or living being, as a body endowed with a
   rational or divine soul. All these figures of speech, and the
   associations to which they give rise, have an insensible influence on
   our ideas. The representation of the world as a machine is a more
   favourite one, in modern times, than the representation of it as a
   living being; and with mechanism is associated the notion of necessity.
   Yet the machine is, after all, a mere barren unity, which gives no
   conception of the endless fertility of natural or of moral life. So,
   again, when we speak of a soul of the world,' there is no real
   resemblance to a human soul; there is no centre in which this mundane
   life or soul has its seat, no individuality such as characterizes the
   soul of man. But the use of the word invariably recalls thoughts of
   Pantheism:

     deum namque ire per omnes terrasque tractusque maris, coelumque
     profundum.'

   So the term law' carries with it an association, partly of compulsion,
   partly of that narrower and more circumscribed notion of law, in which
   it is applied to chemistry or mechanics. So again the word necessity'
   itself always has a suggestion of external force.

   All such language has a degree of error, because it introduces some
   analogy which belongs to another sphere of thought. But when, laying
   aside language, we consider facts only, no appearance of external
   compulsion arises, whether in nature, or in history, or in life. The
   lowest, and therefore the simplest idea, that we are capable of forming
   of physical necessity, is of the stone falling to the ground. No one
   imagines human action to be necessary in any such sense as this. If
   this be our idea of necessity, the meaning of the term must be enlarged
   when it is applied to man. If any one speaks of human action as the
   result of necessary laws, to avoid misunderstanding, we may ask at the
   outset of the controversy, In what degree necessary?' And this brings
   us to an idea which is perhaps the readiest solution of the apparent
   perplexity--that of degrees of necessity. For, although it is true,
   that to the eye of a superior or divine being the actions of men would
   seem to be the subject of laws quite as much as the falling stone, yet
   these laws are of a far higher or more delicate sort; we may figure
   them to ourselves truly, as allowing human nature play and room within
   certain limits, as regulating only and not constraining the freedom of
   its movements.

   How degrees of necessity are possible may be illustrated as follows:
   The strongest or narrowest necessity which we ever see in experience is
   that of some very simple mechanical fact, such as is furnished by the
   law of attraction. A greater necessity than this is only an
   abstraction; as, for example, the necessity by which two and two make
   four, or the three angles of a triangle equal two right angles. But any
   relation between objects which are seen is of a much feebler and less
   absolute kind; the strongest which we have ever observed is that of a
   smaller body to a larger. The physiology even of plants opens to our
   minds freer and nobler ideas of law. The tree with its fibres and sap,
   drawing its nourishment from many sources, light, air, moisture, earth,
   is a complex structure: rooted to one particular spot, no one would
   think of ascribing to it free agency, yet as little should we think of
   binding it fast in the chains of a merely mechanical necessity. Animal
   life partaking with man of locomotion is often termed free; its sphere
   is narrowed only by instinct; indeed the highest grade of irrational
   being can hardly be said, in point of freedom, to differ from the
   lowest type of the human species. And in man himself are many degrees
   of necessity or freedom, from the child who is subject to its
   instincts, or the drunkard who is the slave of his passions, up to the
   philosopher comprehending at a glance the wonders of heaven and earth,
   the freeman whom the truth makes free,' or the Christian devoting
   himself to God, whose freedom is obedience to a law;' that law being
   the law of the Spirit of life,' as the Apostle expresses it; respecting
   which, nevertheless, according to another mode of speaking (so various
   is language on this subject), necessity is laid upon him.' And between
   these two extremes are many half freedoms, or imperfect necessities:
   one man is under the influence of habit, another of prejudice, a third
   is the creature of some superior will; of a fourth it is said, that it
   was impossible for him to act otherwise;' a fifth does by effort what
   to another is spontaneous; while in the case of all, allowance is made
   for education, temperament, and the like.

   The idea of necessity has already begun to expand; it is no longer the
   negative of freedom, they almost touch. For freedom, too, is subject to
   limitation; the freedom of the human will is not the freedom of the
   infinite, but of the finite. It does not pretend to escape from the
   conditions of human life. No man in his senses imagines that he can fly
   into the air, or walk through the earth; he does not fancy that his
   limbs will move with the expedition of thought. He is aware that he has
   a less, or it may be a greater, power than others. He learns from
   experience to take his own measure. But this limited or measured
   freedom is another form of enlarged necessity. Beginning with an
   imaginary freedom, we may reduce it within the bounds of experience;
   beginning with an abstract necessity, we may accommodate it to the
   facts of human life.

   Attention has been lately called to the phenomena (already noticed) of
   the uniformity of human actions. The observation of this uniformity has
   caused a sort of momentary disturbance in the moral ideas of some
   persons, who seem unable to get rid of the illusion, that nature
   compels a certain number of individuals to act in a particular way, for
   the sake of keeping up the average. Their error is, that they confuse
   the law, which is only the expression of the fact, with the cause; it
   is as though they affirmed the universal to necessitate the particular.
   The same uniformity appears equally in matters of chance. Ten thousand
   throws of the dice, ceteris paribus, will give about the same number of
   twos, threes, sixes; what compulsion was there here? So ten thousand
   human lives will give a nearly equal number of forgeries, thefts, or
   other extraordinary actions. Neither is there compulsion here; it is
   the simple fact. It may be said, Why is the number uniform? In the
   first place, it is not uniform, that is to say, it is in our power to
   alter the proportions of crime by altering its circumstances. And this
   change of circumstances is not separable from the act of the legislator
   or private individual by which it may be accomplished, which is in turn
   suggested by other circumstances. The will or the intellect of man
   still holds its place as the centre of a moving world. But, secondly,
   the imaginary power of this uniform number affects no one in
   particular; it is not required that A, B, C, should commit a crime or
   transmit an undirected letter, to enable us to fill up a tabular
   statement. The fact exhibited in the tabular statement is the result of
   all the movements of all the wills of the ten thousand persons who are
   made the subject of analysis.

   It is possible to conceive great variations in such tables; it is
   possible, that is, to imagine, without any change of circumstances, a
   thousand persons executed in France during one year for political
   offences, and none the next. But the world in which this phenomenon was
   observed would be a very different sort of world from that in which we
   live. It would be a world in which nations, like individuals, went
   mad;' in which there was no habit, no custom; almost, we may say, no
   social or political life. Men must be no longer different, and so
   compensating one another by their excellencies and deficiencies, but
   all in the same extreme; as if the waves of the sea in a storm instead
   of returning to their level were to remain on high. The mere statement
   of such a speculation is enough to prove its absurdity. And, perhaps,
   no better way could be found of disabusing the mind of the objections
   which appear to be entertained to the fact of the uniformity of human
   actions, than a distinct effort to imagine the disorder of the world
   which would arise out of the opposite principle.

   But the advocate of free will may again return to the charge, with an
   appeal to consciousness. Your freedom,' he will say, is but half
   freedom, but I have that within which assures me of an absolute
   freedom, without which I should be deprived of what I call
   responsibility.' No man has seen facts of consciousness, and therefore
   it is at any rate fair that before they are received they shall be
   subjected to analysis. We may look at an outward object which is called
   a table; no one would in this case demand an examination into the human
   faculties before he admitted the existence of the table. But inward
   facts are of another sort; that they really exist, may admit of doubt;
   that they exist in the particular form attributed to them, or in any
   particular form, is a matter very difficult to prove. Nothing is easier
   than to insinuate a mere opinion, under the disguise of a fact of
   consciousness.

   Consciousness tells, or seems to tell, of an absolute freedom; and this
   is supposed to be a sufficient witness of the existence of such a
   freedom. But does consciousness tell also of the conditions under which
   this freedom can be exercised? Does it remind us that we are finite
   beings? Does it present to one his bodily, to another his mental
   constitution? Is it identical with self-knowledge? No one imagines
   this. To what then is it the witness? To a dim and unreal notion of
   freedom, which is as different from the actual fact as dreaming is from
   acting. No doubt the human mind has or seems to have a boundless power,
   as of thinking so also of willing. But this imaginary power, going as
   it does far beyond experience, varying too in youth and age, greatest
   often in idea when it is really least, cannot be adduced as a witness
   for what is inconsistent with experience.

   The question, How is it possible for us to be finite beings, and yet to
   possess this consciousness of freedom which has no limit? may be partly
   answered by another question: How is it possible for us to acquire any
   ideas which transcend experience? The answer is, only, that the mind
   has the power of- forming such ideas; it can conceive a beauty,
   goodness, truth, which has no existence on earth. The conception,
   however, is subject to this law, that the greater the idealization the
   less the individuality. In like manner that imperfect freedom which we
   enjoy as finite beings is magnified by us into an absolute idea of
   freedom, which seems to be infinite because it drops out of sight the
   limits with which nature in fact everywhere surrounds us; and also
   because it is the abstraction of self, of which we can never be
   deprived, and which we conceive to be acting still when all the
   conditions of action are removed.

   Freedom is absolute in another sense, as the correlative of obligation.
   Men entertain some one, some another, idea of right, but all are bound
   to act according to that idea. The standard may be relative to their
   own circumstances, but the duty is absolute; and the power is also
   absolute of refusing the evil and choosing the good, under any possible
   contingency. It is a matter (not only of consciousness but) of fact,
   that we have such a power, quite as much as the facts of statistics, to
   which it is sometimes opposed, or rather, to speak more correctly, is
   one of them. And when we make abstraction of this power, that is, when
   we think of it by itself, there arises also the conception of an
   absolute freedom.

   So singularly is human nature constituted, looking from without on the
   actions of men as they are, witnessing inwardly to a higher law. You
   ought to do so; you have the power to do so,' is consistent with the
   fact, that in practice you fail to do so. It may be possible for us to
   unite both these aspects of human nature, yet experience seems to show
   that we commonly look first at one and then at the other. The inward
   vision tells us the law of duty and the will of God; the outward
   contemplation of ourselves and others shows the trials to which we are
   most subject. Any transposition of these two points of view is fatal to
   morality. For the proud man to say, I inherited pride from my
   ancestors;' or for the licentious man to say, It is in the blood;' for
   the weak man to say, I am weak, and will not strive;' for any to find
   the excuses of their vices in their physical temperament or external
   circumstances, is the corruption of their nature.

   Yet this external aspect of human affairs has a moral use. It is a duty
   to look at the consequences of actions, as well as at actions
   themselves; the knowledge of our own temperament, or strength, or
   health, is a part also of the knowledge of self. We have need of the
   wise man's warning, about age which will not be defied' in our moral
   any more than in our physical constitution. In youth, also, there are
   many things outward and indifferent, which cannot but exercise a moral
   influence on after life. Often opportunities of virtue have to be made,
   as well as virtuous efforts; there are forms of evil, too, against
   which we struggle in vain by mere exertions of the will He who trusts
   only to a moral or religious impulse, is apt to have aspirations, which
   never realize themselves in action. His moral nature may be compared to
   a spirit without a body, fluttering about in the world, but unable to
   comprehend or grasp any good.

   Yet more, in dealing with classes of men, we seem to find that we have
   greater power to shape their circumstances than immediately to affect
   their wills. The voice of the preacher passes into the air; the members
   of his congregation are like persons beholding their natural face in a
   glass;' they go their way, forgetting their own likeness. And often the
   result of a long life of ministerial work has been the conversion of
   two or three individuals. The power which is exerted in such a case may
   be compared to the unaided use of the hand, while mechanical appliances
   are neglected. Or to turn to another field of labour, in which the
   direct influence of Christianity has been hitherto small, may not the
   reason why the result of missions is often disappointing be found in
   the circumstance, that we have done little to improve the political or
   industrial state of those among whom our missionaries are sent? We have
   thought of the souls of men, and of the Spirit of God influencing them,
   in too naked a way; instead of attending to the complexity of human
   nature, and the manner in which God has ever revealed himself in the
   history of mankind.

   The great lesson, which Christians have to learn in the present day, is
   to know the world as it is; that is to say, to know themselves as they
   are; human life as it is; nature as it is; history as it is. Such
   knowledge is also a power, to fulfil the will of God and to contribute
   to the happiness of man. It is a resting-place in speculation, and a
   new beginning in practice. Such knowledge is the true reconcilement of
   the opposition of necessity and free will. Not that spurious
   reconcilement which places necessity in one sphere of thought, freedom
   in another; nor that pride of freedom which is ready to take up arms
   against plain facts; nor yet that demonstration of necessity in which
   logic, equally careless of facts, has bound fast the intellect of man.
   The whole question, when freed from the illusions of language, is
   resolvable into experience. Imagination cannot conquer for us more than
   that degree of freedom which we truly have; the tyranny of science
   cannot impose upon us any law or limit to which we are not really
   subject; theology cannot alter the real relations of God and man. The
   facts of human nature and of Christianity remain the same, whether we
   describe them by the word necessity' or freedom,' in the phraseology of
   Lord Bacon and Locke, or in that of Calvin and Augustine.

  THE END.
