Tauler

    By

  John Greenleaf Whittier


   TAULER, the preacher, walked, one autumn day,

   Without the walls of Strasburg, by the Rhine,

   Pondering the solemn Miracle of Life;

   As one who, wandering in a starless night,

   Feels, momently, the jar of unseen waves,

   And hears the thunder of an unknown sea,

   Breaking along an unimagined shore.


   And as he walked he prayed. Even the same

   Old prayer with which, for half-a-score of years,

   Morning, and noon, and evening, lip and heart

   Had groaned: "Have pity upon me, Lord!

   Thou seest, while teaching others, I am blind.

   Send me a man who can direct my steps!"


   Then, as he mused, he heard along his path

   A sound as of an old man's staff among

   The dry, dead linden-leaves; and, looking up,

   He saw a stranger, weak, and poor, and old.

   "Peace be unto thee, father!" Tauler said,

   "God give thee a good day!" The old man raised

   Slowly his calm blue eyes." I thank thee, son;

   But all my days are good, and none are ill."

   Wondering thereat, the preacher spake again,

   "God give thee happy life." The old man smiled,

   "I never am unhappy."


   Tauler laid

   His hand upon the stranger's coarse grey sleeve:

   "Tell me, O father, what thy strange words mean.

   Surely man's days are evil, and his life

   Sad as the grave it leads to." "Nay, my son,

   Our times are in God's hands, and all our days

   Are as our needs: for shadow as for sun,

   For cold as heat, for want as wealth, alike

   Our thanks are due, since that is best which is;

   And that which is not, sharing not his life,

   Is evil only as devoid of good.

   And for the happiness of which I spake,

   I find it in submission to His will,

   And calm trust in the Holy Trinity

   Of Knowledge, Goodness, and Almighty Power."


   Silently wondering, for a little space,

   Stood the great preacher; then he spoke as one

   Who suddenly grappling with a haunting thought

   Which long has followed, whispering through the dark

   Strange terrors, drags it, shrieking, into light:

   "What if God's will consign thee hence to Hell?"


   "Then," said the stranger cheerily, "be it so.

   What Hell may be I know not; this I know--

   I cannot lose the presence of the Lord:

   One arm, Humility, takes hold upon His dear

   Humanity; the other, Love,

   Clasps His Divinity. So where I go,

   He goes; and better fire-walled Hell with Him

   Than golden-gated Paradise without."


   Tears sprang in Tauler's eyes; a sudden light,

   Like the first ray which fell on chaos, clove

   Apart the shadow wherein he had walked

   Darkly at noon. And, as the strange old man

   Went his slow way, until his silver hair

   Set like the white moon where the hills of vine

   Slope to the Rhine, he bowed his head and said--

   "My prayer is answered. God hath sent the man

   Long sought, to teach me, by his simple trust,

   Wisdom the weary schoolmen never knew."


   So, entering with a changed and cheerful step

   The city gates, he saw, far down the street,

   A mighty shadow break the light of noon,

   Which tracing backward till its airy lines

   Hardened to stony plinths, he raised his eyes

   O'er broad fa√ßade and lofty pediment,

   O'er architrave, and frieze, and sainted niche,

   Up the stone lace-work chiselled by the wise

   Erwin of Steinbach, dizzily up to where

   In the noon-brightness the great Minster's tower,

   Jewelled with sunbeams on its mural crown,

   Rose like a visible prayer. "Behold!" he said,

   "The stranger's faith made plain before mine eyes.

   As yonder tower outstretches to the earth

   The dark triangle of its shade alone

   When the clear day is shining on its top,

   So darkness in the pathway of Man's life

   Is but the shadow of God's providence,

   By the great Sun of Wisdom cast thereon;

   And what is dark below is light in Heaven."

       befall us, and whether they be great or small.

   VI.

        Sermon for Palm Sunday

        How a man ought in all His works to regard God alone, and purely to
        make Him his end without anything of his own, and shall freely and
        simply perform all these works for the glory of God only, and not seek
        his own, nor desire nor expect any reward. Wherewith he may do such
        works without any self-appropriation or reference to time and number,

         How we ought to love God, and how Christ is a Master of the Eternal
         Good, wherefore we ought to love Him above all things; a Master of the
         Highest Truth, wherefore we ought to contemplate Him; and a Master of
         the Highest Perfectness, wherefore we ought to follow after Him without
         let or hindrance.

   XVI.

         Sermon for the Fourth Sunday after Easter

         How the Holy Ghost rebukes the World in man for sin, righteousness, and
         judgment; how hurtful it is to judge one's neighbour; after what
         fashion a pious man may rebuke his neighbour; further, what the Holy
         Ghost teacheth when he cometh to us.

         classes of men.

   XVIII.

         Sermon for Ascension Day

         This third sermon on the Ascension tells us how man ought continually
         to follow after Christ, as He has walked before us for three and thirty
         years, passing through manifold and great sufferings, before He
         returned unto His Father.

   XIX.

         Sermon for Whit Sunday

         How God drew the Apostles unto Christ by six degrees until they

         His burdens, with true long-suffering.

   XXIII.

         Second Sermon for the Twelfth Sunday after Trinity

         This sermon tells us how a man who truly loves God, whose ears have
         been opened to receive the seven-fold gifts of the Holy Spirit, is
         neither lifted up in joy nor cast down in sorrow.

   XXIV.

         Sermon for the Fifteenth Sunday after Trinity

         This sermon forbiddeth all carefulness, and telleth in what
         righteousness consisteth, and rebukes sundry religious people and their
         works, likening their ways to simony.

   XXV.

         Sermon for St. Stephen's Day

         Of three grades of those who learn to die unto themselves, like a corn
         of wheat, that they may bring forth fruit; or of those who are
         beginners, those who are advancing, and those who art perfect in a
         Divine life.

   XXVI.

         Sermon for St. Peter's Day

         Of brotherly rebuke and admonition, how far it is advisable and seemly
         or not, and especially how prelates and governors ought to demean
         themselves towards their subjects.

   XXVII.

         Sermon on a Martyr's Day

         Of three sorts of spiritual temptation by which holy men are secretly
         assailed; to wit: spiritual unchastity, covetousness, and pride.

Translator's Preface

   IN publishing a selection from the writings of a divine who nourished
   in an age and under social conditions so remote from our own as those
   of a German Dominican monk of the fourteenth century, it seems right to
   state at the outset whether the aim which has governed the selection is
   chiefly historical or devotional. The present work was undertaken, in
   the first instance, with a simply practical object. My earliest
   acquaintance with Tauler's Sermons was made while hearing them read in
   a family service; and believing, from further study, that they
   contained elements of truth not often brought into sufficient
   prominence in these days, yet possessing a most direct and valuable
   influence on Christian life, I wished to compile a volume of sermons
   for the Sundays and Holydays of the year, such as any head of a family
   might read to his household, or any district visitor among the poor.

   To have carried out this idea completely would, however, have involved
   the omission, in many of the sermons, of passages either too abstruse
   for easy comprehension, or too much imbued with references to the
   Romish ritual and discipline, to be suitable for the Protestant common
   people. But such a mutilation seemed to me scarcely honest in the case
   of a writer now to be presented for the first time in a foreign
   language, and it appeared better therefore to reconcile historical
   truthfulness with practical usefulness, by restricting the selection,
   but giving all the sermons included in it in their complete form. Had
   it been my object merely to present an interesting picture of a
   remarkable man, the selection would possibly have been somewhat
   different,--certainly much wider. As it is, I have chosen the practical
   rather than the more metaphysical sermons, and have included none which
   seemed to me, in my conscientious judgment, open to objections as to
   their moral tendency.

   Among such I should reckon some tinctured with an asceticism throwing
   contempt on the affections of ordinary life. Of the duties of ordinary
   life Tauler never speaks disparagingly. When he says that the inward
   work in the soul is more than all outward good works, it is always the
   outward practices of religion of which he is speaking--attendance in
   church, fasting, the repeating of prayers, &c.; never of the exercise
   of active benevolence, or even the performance of minor household
   duties. It is one good feature of the school to which he belonged, that
   these things are restored to their due honour, so far as that is
   compatible with the whole system of conventual life. But Tauler does
   teach that repression of the natural affections which is inevitable so
   long as the vital idea of monasticism,--viz., the severance of the
   religious from the secular in life,--is retained. That this severance
   is false and mischievous, Tauler no more perceived than did the whole
   body of his contemporaries; but while we have no right to censure him
   for errors which he shared with all the men of his age (and which he
   often divested for his own hearers of much of their baneful influence),
   it is equally unnecessary to place such doctrine before people at the
   present time. So, too, the sermons on the Mass and on the Virgin Mary,
   while containing many excellent practical remarks, are of course based
   on beliefs that would render them unprofitable to the great multitude
   of English Protestants nowadays, and I did not deem it needful to
   insert them merely for the sake of presenting a full view of all that
   Tauler believed or taught. But neither did it seem essential to
   practical usefulness to eliminate from sermons whose general scope is
   rich in Christian instruction, all such passages as might contain
   passing allusions to purgatory, transubstantiation, the invocation of
   saints, &c.; mystical and figurative interpretations of Scripture, or
   questionable philosophical speculations, in order that nothing might be
   left but what Protestant Christians at the present day actually
   believe. For private reading it is the less necessary, as it is often
   curious and instructive to observe how Tauler, in many cases, supplies
   the practical antidote to the hurtful effects of a Romish doctrine
   without in the least seeing through the doctrine itself; while, should
   these sermons be used, as I earnestly wish they may be, for family
   reading, it will be very easy to omit anything which it might be
   undesirable to read to uneducated persons.

   With regard to those not included, the greater number have been
   rejected simply because many of their ideas occurred in the sermons
   which I have chosen, and I was anxious to avoid repetition; and among
   these many were so good as to render the task of selection very
   difficult. A very small proportion have been omitted on account of
   their Romish doctrine; more because of their obscure mysticism, and a
   few because they contained figures that would sound coarse, or at least
   grotesque and unsuitable for the pulpit, to our modern ears. I believe
   that those I have given may be regarded, from the absence of omissions,
   and the variety of their scope, as furnishing, on the whole, a correct
   picture of the mind and faith of their author.

   The edition of Tauler's Sermons which I have used for my Translation is
   that published at Franks fort in 1826. Among the numerous ancient and
   modern editions of these Sermons, that published at Leipsic, in 1498,
   holds the highest rank as an authority; but of this, now very rare
   work, it has not been in my power to consult a copy; and of the later
   editions that of Frankfort is the best. It is based upon an edition
   published at Cologne in 1543, and contains one hundred and fifty-three
   sermons; only eighty-four of these, however, are to be found in the
   mss. now extant. Many of the mss. have, indeed, only portions of these
   eighty-four; but the best and oldest are also the most complete. They
   are two which are in the Strasburg Library, and are most probably
   contemporary with Tauler himself,--certainly not of much later origin.
   The oldest printed edition, too, that of Leipsic, in 1498, has only
   these eighty-four sermons. These are, therefore, all of whose
   genuineness we have distinct certainty from external evidence. In an
   edition, however, which Johann Rynmann published at Basle in 1521
   (probably induced to do so by Luther's republication of the Theologia
   Germanica, in 1517, and his recommendation of Tauler's writings to his
   friends [1] ), forty-two more sermons are added with the preface: "Here
   followeth the second part of the sermons of the said John Tauler, which
   have been more recently discovered, and collected with great care and
   diligence. Although there may be a doubt about some of them, let not
   that offend thee; for it is certain that they have been written by a
   right learned man of his age, and are all based on one foundation,
   namely, true self-surrender and the preparation of the spirit for God."

   There can be no doubt that several of these are not productions of
   Tauler; and Surius, in his Latin Edition of 1548, appends the names of
   the authors Eckart, Suso, Ruysbroek, in several instances where he had
   ascertained them,--in which the Frankfort Editor follows his example.
   [2] The styles of Eckart and Suso are, indeed, very distinguishable
   from Tauler's. That of Ruysbroek seems to me less so. Finally, the
   Cologne Edition of 1543, which has been the basis of all the later
   editions of Tauler's Sermons, adds twenty-five more, and among these,
   too, some by the authors already named have crept in. Still, I cannot
   see any reason to question the statement of the Editor, Petrus
   Noviomagus, who says:--"Having made research in all directions, that I
   might obtain the most correctly-copied mss., I have at last, in 1542,
   found in the library of St. Gertrude's, at Cologne (where the said
   Doctor had his abode, and was wont to preach God's word), and also in
   some other places, old written books, in which many excellent, nay,
   some of the best of Tauler's Sermons stand clearly written, which have
   not yet been printed or made public."

   Tauler did not himself write down his discourses, but they were
   compiled from notes taken by his hearers, which accounts at once for
   the fragmentary character of the style, and for the great number of
   various readings to be found in the different editions. It is important
   to bear this circumstance in mind in judging of the style of the
   following sermons. It seems highly probable that the eighty-four
   sermons contained in the Strasburg mss. were published during his life
   and received his own corrections; but there appear no adequate grounds
   for supposing that these eighty-four are the only genuine ones we
   possess; for in the numerous places where Tauler preached, many of his
   sermons would probably be taken down by single hearers, which in those
   times of rare and difficult communication, were never brought under the
   notice of the Strasburg Collector, but, as his fame spread in after
   years, came to be gradually put into the hands of later collectors by
   their possessors, as seems to have been the case with those of which
   Petrus Noviomagus speaks.

   The Frankfort Edition has not, however, been the sole source of the
   following translation; for with great generosity, for which I beg to
   tender him my warmest thanks, Professor Schmidt of Strasburg, has
   placed at my disposal a transcript made by himself from the most
   ancient manuscript extant, by which I have corrected those of the
   following collection, which belong to the first eighty-four. In a very
   few passages only have I retained the version of the Frankfort Edition,
   where the sense was so evidently clearer and fuller as to indicate a
   high probability that the later collector had had the opportunity of
   consulting fuller notes than his more ancient predecessor. This,
   however, is very rarely the case; in general the oldest version is so
   much the best as to give great force to the supposition generally
   entertained that it had been corrected by the author himself. Of the
   following collection Nos. 5, 6, 9, 11, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, may
   be thus said to be, in effect, translated from the Strasburg ms. The
   Frankfort Editor gives the sources from which he has taken his version
   of the sermons, and upon this authority I may mention that Nos. 3, 4,
   7, 8, 10,13,14,17, 25, 26, 27, are from the Appendix to the Basle
   Edition of 1521; and Nos. 1, 2, 12, 15, 19, from that of the Cologne
   Edition of 1543. The sermon No. 2, is marked as Eckart's in the
   Frankfort Edition, and No. 4 as most probably the production of a
   disciple of his, commonly called Eckart, junior. It is, however,
   somewhat doubtful whether the two Eckarts were not in truth one and the
   same. The Cologne Editor expresses the wish that "God would anoint some
   man enlightened by the Holy Ghost to render this precious treasure into
   Latin for the comfort of many who desire it;" and this wish was
   fulfilled in 1543, by the Carthusian, Laurentius Surius, the translator
   also of the works of Suso and Ruysbroek.

   The principal sources from which my sketch of Tauler and the "Friends
   of God" has been derived, are furnished by Professor Schmidt of
   Strasburg, in his Johannes Tauler von Strasburg; his essay on Eckart in
   the Theologische Studien und Kritiken, 1839, p. 684; and his work, Die
   Gottesfreunde im Vierzehnten Jahrhundert, Jena, 1855. I have, however,
   also to acknowledge my obligations to Wackernagel's essay on the
   Gottesfreunde in the Beitraege zur Vaterlaendischen Geschichte (Basle,
   1843, B. ii. s. III); to Neander's Kirchengeschichte; Hase's
   Kirchengeschichte; Milman's Latin Christianity, &c.

   Any one acquainted with the admirable Essays of Professor Schmidt,
   above-named, will perceive how largely I am indebted to him for the
   facts of Tauler's life, and the account of Eckart; but will also
   observe that my theory of them is, in some points, very different from
   that of M. Schmidt. For my notices of the Gottesfreunde, his recent
   work has furnished the whole of the facts; but, again, it is only fair
   to state that for the light in which I regard these facts, I am alone
   responsible.

Preface
to original edition
by
Charles Kingsley

   IT is with great diffidence that I have undertaken to furnish a preface
   to these Sermons. It must always be an invidious task to stand toward a
   far wiser and better man than one's self in a relation which is likely,
   at every moment, to be mistaken either for that of a critic or that of
   a commentator.

   The critic of Tauler, no man has a right to become, who has not first
   ascertained that he is a better man than Tauler.

   The commentator of Tauler, no man has a right to become, who has a
   strong belief (as I have) that Tauler's Sermons need no comment
   whatsoever: but that all which is good and eternal in them will
   recommend itself at once to those hearts, let their form of doctrine be
   what it may, who have hold of, or are seeking after, Eternal Goodness.

   The historical and biographical information which may be necessary for
   a right understanding of the man and his times, will be found in the
   Life and the Introductory Notice which are appended to the Sermons;
   while any notions of mine as to the genesis of Tauler's views, as to
   how much of them he owed to divines, how much to his own vital
   experiences, are likely to be equally unsafe and uninteresting. The
   English churchman of the present day, enjoying a form of doctrine far
   more correct than that of any other communion, and resting on the sound
   dogma that nothing is to be believed as necessary to salvation but what
   can be proved by Scripture, has (whether rightly or wrongly, I do not
   here ask) become so satisfied with the good fruit, as to think little
   of the tree which bore it. The Church controversies, and the
   metaphysical inquiries, by which, after many mistakes, and long
   struggles, that form of doctrine was elicited from Scripture, are to
   him shadows of the past, and "Schoolmen's questions." The element in
   the ancient worthies of the Church which is most interesting to him is
   their human sorrows, temptations, triumphs, with which, as having
   happened in men of like passions with ourselves, we still can
   sympathise. We cannot, however, now understand how strong and generally
   just an influence those private and personal experiences had, in
   forming the opinions of the old worthies upon Scriptural doctrines,
   which we have been taught from childhood to find in Scripture, and are
   therefore astonished, if not indignant, that every one in every age did
   not find them there at first sight.

   Thus, standing upon the accumulated labours of ages, we are apt to be
   ungrateful to those who built up with weary labour, and often working
   through dark and dreary nights, the platform which now supports us. We
   complain impatiently of the blindness of many a man, without whom we
   should not have seen; and of the incompleteness of many a man whose
   doctrine was only incomplete because he was still engaged in searching
   for some truth, which, when found, he handed on as a precious heirloom
   to us who know him not.

   For the many, therefore, it will be altogether uninteresting for me to
   enter into any speculation as to the spiritual pedigree of Tauler's
   views. How far Philo-Jud√¶us and the Brahmins may have influenced the
   Pseudo-Dionysius; how far the Pseudo-Dionysius may have influenced John
   Erigena; how far that wondrous Irishman may have influenced Master
   Eckart; how far that vast and subtle thinker, claimed by some as the
   founder of German philosophy, may have influenced Tauler himself, are
   questions for which the many will care little; which would require to
   be discussed in a large volume, ere the question could not merely be
   exhausted, but made intelligible. Such matters may well be left for
   learned and large-minded men, to whom the development of Christian
   doctrine (both in the true and the false sense of that word) is a
   scientific study.

   But let me express a hope, that such men will turn their attention more
   and more, not merely to the works of Tauler, but to those of his
   companions, and to that whole movement of the fourteenth century, of
   which Tauler is the most popular and easily accessible type, as to a
   most interesting and instructive page in the book of Christian, and
   indeed of human, thought. I say human; for it will be impossible for
   them to examine the works of such men as Erigena, Tauler, Eckart, and
   Ruysbroek, any more than those of the later mystics, whether Romish or
   Protestant, without finding that their speculations, whether right or
   wrong in any given detail, go down to the very deepest and most
   universal grounds of theology and of metaphysics; and howsoever
   distinctly Christian they may be, are connected with thoughts which
   have exercised men of every race which has left behind it more than
   mere mounds of earth. They will find in the Greek, the Persian, and the
   Hindoo; in the Buddhist and in Mohammedan Sufi, the same craving after
   the Absolute and the Eternal, the same attempt to express in words that
   union between man and God, which transcends all words. On making that
   discovery, if they have not already made it, two courses will be open
   to them. They can either reject the whole of such thoughts as
   worthless, assuming that anything which Christianity has in common with
   heathendom must be an adulteration and an interpolation; or, when they
   see such thoughts bubbling up, as it were spontaneously, among men
   divided utterly from each other by race, age, and creed, they can
   conclude that those thoughts must be a normal product of the human
   spirit, and that they indicate a healthy craving after some real
   object; they can rise to a tender and deeper sympathy with the
   aspirations and mistakes of men who sought in great darkness for a ray
   of light, and did not seek in vain; and can give fresh glory to the
   doctrines of the Catholic Church when they see them fulfilling those
   aspirations, and correcting those mistakes; and in this case, as in
   others, satisfying the desire of all nations, by proclaiming Him by
   whom all things were made, and in whom all things consist, who is The
   Light and The Life of men, shining for ever in the darkness,
   uncomprehended, yet unquenched.

   There is another class of readers worthy of all respect, who may be
   dissatisfied, if not startled, by many passages in these sermons. Men
   well skilled in the terminology of the popular religion, and from long
   experience, well acquainted with its value, are apt to be jealous when
   they find a preacher handling the highest matters, and yet omitting to
   use concerning them the formul√¶ in which they are now commonly
   expressed. Such men I would entreat to have patience with, and charity
   for, a man whose character they must so heartily admire. Let them
   remember that many of our own formul√¶ are not to be found verbatim in
   Holy Writ, but have been gradually extracted from it by processes of
   induction or of deduction; and let them allow to Tauler, as far as is
   consistent with orthodoxy, Christian liberty to find likewise what he
   can in that Scripture, which he reveres as deeply as they do. Let them
   consider also, that most of those expressions of his which are most
   strange to our modern pulpits, are strictly Scriptural, and to be found
   in the Sacred Text; and that no man can be blamed at first sight for
   understanding such expressions literally, and for shrinking from
   reducing them to metaphors. God has ordained that the Pauline aspect of
   Christianity, and the Pauline nomenclature, should for the last three
   hundred years at least, mould almost exclusively the thoughts of His
   church: but we must not forget, that St. John's thoughts, and St.
   John's words, are equally inspired with those of St. Paul; and that not
   we, but Tauler, are the fit judges as to whether St. Paul's language,
   or St. John's, was most fit to touch the German heart in the dark and
   hideous times of the Fourteenth Century. The important question is--Did
   Tauler, under whatsoever language, really hold in spirit and in truth
   the vital doctrines of the Gospel? That can only be ascertained by a
   fair and charitable induction, and of the result of such an induction I
   have little fear.

   Some again, whose opinions will be entitled to the very highest
   respect, will be pained at the fantastic and arbitrary method (if
   method it can be called) in which Tauler uses Scripture to illustrate
   his opinions. Let them remember, that this was not a peculiarity of the
   man, but of his age; that for various reasons, a simple, literal, and
   historic method of interpretation (which doubtless is at the same time
   the most spiritual) was then in its infancy; that it is by no means
   perfect yet; and that it is quite possible that our great grandchildren
   may be as much surprised at our use of many a text, as we are at
   Tauler's.

   But there are those--and thanks to Almighty God they are to be numbered
   by tens of thousands--who will not perplex themselves with any such
   questionings; simple and genial hearts, who try to do what good they
   can in the world, and meddle not with matters too high for them;
   persons whose religion is not abstruse, but deep; not noisy, but
   intense; not aggressive, but laboriously useful; people who have the
   same habit of mind as the early Christians seem to have worn, ere yet
   Catholic truth had been defined in formul√¶; when the Apostles' creed
   was symbol enough for the Church, and men were orthodox in heart,
   rather than exact in head. For such it is enough if a fellow-creature
   loves Him whom they love, and serves Him whom they serve. Personal
   affection and loyalty to the same unseen Being is to them a communion
   of saints both real and actual, in the genial warmth of which all minor
   differences of opinion vanish, and a truly divine liberality enables
   them to believe with St. John, that "Thereby know ye the spirit of God;
   every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is
   born of God."

   To such these sermons, should be, and I doubt not will be, welcome. If
   they find words in them which they do not understand, even words from
   which at first sight they differ, they will let them pass them by for
   awhile, in charity and patience. Seeing (as they will see at the first
   glance) that John Tauler was one of themselves, they will judge of what
   they do not understand by what they do, and give him credit for sense
   and righteousness, where their own intellects fail to follow him.

   Especially too, if they be distracted and disheartened (as such are
   wont to be) by the sin and confusion of the world; by the amount of
   God's work which still remains undone, and by their own seeming
   incapacity to do it, they will take heart from the history of John
   Tauler and his fellows, who, in far darker and more confused time than
   the present, found a work to do, and strength to do it; who, the more
   they retired into the recesses of their own inner life, found there
   that fully to know themselves was to know all men, and to have a
   message for all men; and who, by their unceasing labours of love,
   proved that the highest spiritual attainments, instead of shutting a
   man up in lazy and Pharisaic self-contemplation, drive him forth to
   work as his Master worked before him, among the poor, the suffering,
   and the fallen.

   Let such take heart, and toil on in faith at the duty which lies
   nearest to them. Five hundred years have passed since Tauler and his
   fellows did their simple work, and looked for no fruit from it, but the
   saving of one here and there from the nether pit. That was enough for
   which to labour: but without knowing it, they did more than that. Their
   work lives, and will live for ever, though in forms from which they
   would have perhaps shrunk had they foreseen them. Let all such
   therefore take heart. They may know their own weakness: but they know
   not the power of God in them. They may think sadly that they are only
   palliating the outward symptoms of social and moral disease: but God
   may be striking, by some unconscious chance blow of theirs, at a root
   of evil which they never suspected. They may mourn over the failure of
   some seemingly useful plan of their own: but God may be, by their
   influence, sowing the seed of some plan of His own, of which they
   little dream. For every good deed comes from God. His is the idea, His
   the inspiration, and His its fulfilment in time; and therefore no good
   deed but lives and grows with the everlasting life of God Himself. And
   as the acorn, because God has given it "a forming form," and life after
   its kind, bears within it, not only the builder oak, but shade for many
   a herd, food for countless animals, and at last, the gallant ship
   itself, and the materials of every use to which nature or art can put
   it and its descendants after it throughout all time; so does every good
   deed contain within itself endless and unexpected possibilities of
   other good, which may and will grow and multiply for ever, in the
   genial Light of Him whose eternal Mind conceived it, and whose eternal
   Spirit will for ever quicken it, with that Life of which He is the
   Giver and the Lord.

   There is another class of readers, to whom I expect these sermons to be
   at once very attractive and very valuable; a class of whom I speak with
   extreme diffidence, having never had their experiences; and of whom I
   should not have spoken at all, were they not just now as much
   depreciated, as they were in past centuries rated too highly; I mean
   those who are commonly called "Mystics." Doubtless, they are paying a
   penalty for that extravagant adoration which was bestowed of old upon
   the "Saint." Mankind has discovered that much of what once, in such
   persons, seemed most divine, was most painfully human; that much of
   what seemed most supernatural, was but too degradingly natural, the
   consequences of diseased brain, deranged nervous system, or weakness
   brought on by voluntary asceticism; and so mankind, angry with its
   idols for having a flaw anywhere, has dashed them peevishly to the
   ground. Would it not have been better to give up making idols of such
   persons, and to have examined patiently, charitably, and
   philosophically what they really were, and what they were not? By so
   doing, I believe, men would have found that in these mystics and
   saints, after all bodily illusions, all nervous fantasies, all
   pardonable "confusions between the object and the subject," had been
   eliminated, there still remained, in each and every one of them, and
   not to be explained away by any theory of diseased body or mind, one of
   the very loveliest and noblest human characters; and on that discovery
   the question must have followed,--Was that, too, the product of
   disease? And to that there can be, I trust, but one answer from the
   many. If here and there a man shall be found daring enough to assert
   that the most exquisite developments of humanity are grounded on a lie;
   that its seemingly loveliest flowers are but fungi bred of corruption;
   then the general heart of mankind will give their cynicism the lie, and
   answer, "Not so! this is too beautiful and too righteous to have been
   born of aught but God."

   And when they found these persons, whatsoever might be their
   "denomination," all inclined to claim some illumination, intuition, or
   direct vision of Eternal truth, Eternal good, Eternal beauty, even of
   that Eternal Father in whom all live and move and have their being; yet
   making that claim in deepest humility, amid confessions of their own
   weakness, sinfulness, nothingness, which to the self-satisfied many
   seem exaggerated and all but insincere; they would have been, perhaps,
   more philosophical, as well as more charitable; more in accordance with
   Baconian induction, as well as with Saint Paul's direct assertions in
   his Epistles to the Corinthians, if they had said: "The testimony of so
   many isolated persons to this fact is on the whole a fair probability
   for its truth; and we are inclined to believe it, though it transcends
   our experience, on the same ground that we believe the united testimony
   of travellers to a hundred natural wonders, which differ as utterly
   from anything which we ever saw, as do these spiritual wonders from
   anything which we have ever felt."

   And, if men are willing (as they may be hereafter) patiently to examine
   the facts still further, they may possibly find, in the very
   circumstances which now make them scornfully incredulous of "mystic
   raptures," a moral justification of their reality.

   It will be found that these "mystics" are, in almost every case,
   persons who are suffering; perhaps disappointed, perhaps lonely,
   perhaps unhealthy, perhaps all three at once, bereaved of all social
   comfort, and tortured with disease.

   It is easy enough to say that such persons are especially liable to
   melancholic delusions, liable to mistake the action of their diseased
   nerves for external apparitions and voices; liable, from weakness of
   brain, and the too intense self-introspection which disease often
   brings with it, to invest trifling accidents with an undue importance,
   and to regard them as supernatural monitions. Be it so. Mystics in all
   ages have not been unaware of their own dangers, their own liability to
   mistakes; and have tried to distinguish, by such canons as their age
   afforded them, the false from the true, the fleshly from the spiritual.
   But meanwhile, has this hypothesis no moral justice, and therefore
   moral probability (which must always depend on the amount of moral
   justice involved in any given hypothesis),--namely, the hypothesis that
   to these lonely sufferers more was granted than to the many, because
   they needed more? that some direct and inward "beatific vision" of God
   was allowed to them, because they had no opportunity of gaining any
   indirect and outward one from a smiling world, seen in the light of a
   joyful heart? There are those who have health and strength, health and
   beauty, wife and child; a past which it is pleasant to remember, and a
   future which it is pleasant to work out. Such find no difficulty in
   saying that God is Love; that God cares for them, and His mercy is over
   all his works. But if they had lain, and lain perhaps from childhood,
   in the lowest deep, in the place of darkness, and of storm, while lover
   and friend were hid away from them, and they sat upon the parching
   rock, like Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, beside the corpses of their
   dead sons, dead hopes, dead health, dead love, as on a ghastly
   battlefield, stript among the dead, like those who are wounded, and cut
   away from God's hand; if they had struggled in the horrible mire of
   perplexity, and felt all God's billows and waves go over them, till
   they were weary of crying, and their throats were dry, and their sight
   failed them with watching so long for their God, and all the faith and
   prayer which was left them was: "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
   neither suffer Thy holy one to see corruption"--If all this--or less
   than this had come upon them; then they might have felt it not
   altogether so easy to say that God is Love. They, too, might have
   longed for some inward proof, some token which transcends all argument,
   that though they go down to hell, God is there; that in their most
   utter doubt and darkness, and desolation, all is well; for they dwell
   in God, and God in them. They might have longed for it: and God might
   have been just and merciful in giving it to them; as He may have been
   in giving it already to thousands, who by no other means could have
   been able to face the fearful storm of circumstances, which seemed to
   proclaim the Devil, and not God, the master of the world. Why not let
   the mystics tell their own story? It is more philosophical, after all,
   perhaps, as well as more Scriptural, to believe that "wisdom is
   justified of all her children."

   As for the impossibility of such a direct assurance, it is an assertion
   too silly to be seriously answered in the nineteenth century, which is
   revealing weekly wonders in the natural world, which would have seemed
   impossible to our fathers. Shall the natural world, at every great
   step, transcend our boldest dreams: and shall the spiritual world be
   limited by us to the merest commonplaces of everyday experience,
   especially when those very commonplaces are yet utterly unexplained and
   miraculous? When will men open their eyes to the plain axiom, that
   nothing is impossible with God, save that He should transgress His own
   nature by being unjust and unloving?

   But whether or not the popular religion shall justify and satisfy the
   aspirations of the mystics, Tauler's sermons will do so. They will find
   there the same spiritual food which they have found already in St.
   Bernard, a Kempis, and Madame Guyon; and find there also, perhaps more
   clearly than in any mystic writer, a safeguard against the dangers
   which specially beset them; against the danger of mistaking their
   passing emotions for real and abiding love of good; against exalting
   any peculiar intuition which they may think they have attained, into a
   source of self-glorification, and fancying that they become something,
   by the act of confessing themselves nothing. For with Tauler, whether
   he be right or wrong in any given detail, practical righteousness, of
   the divinest and loftiest kind, is at once the object, and the means,
   and the test, of all upward steps. God is the Supreme Good which man is
   intended to behold: but only by being inspired by Him, owing all to
   Him, and copying Him, can he behold Him, and in that sight find his
   highest reward, and heaven itself.

   But there are those oppressed by doubts, and fears, and sorrows, very
   different from those of which I have just spoken, who may find in
   Tauler's genial and funny pages a light which will stand them in good
   stead in many an hour of darkness. There are those, heaped beyond
   desert with every earthly bliss, who have had to ask themselves, in
   awful earnest, the question which all would so gladly put away: Were I
   stripped to-morrow of all these things, to stand alone and helpless, as
   I see thousands stand, what should I then have left? They may have been
   tempted to answer, with Medea in the tragedy:--


   "Che resta? . . . Io!"

   But they have shrunk from that desperate self-assertion, as they felt
   that, in the very act, they should become, not a philosopher, but, as
   Medea did, a fiend. Tremblingly they have turned to religion for
   comfort, under the glaring eye of that dark spectre of bereavement, but
   have felt about all commonplaces, however true, as Job felt of old;
   "Miserable comforters are ye all! . . . . Oh, that I knew where I might
   find HIM. I would order my cause before Him, and fill my mouth with
   arguments. I should know the words which He would answer me, and
   understand what He would say to me!"

   To such, Tauler can tell something, though but a little, of that still
   waste, where a man, losing all things else, shall find himself face to
   face with God, and hear from Him that which no man can utter again in
   words, even to the wife of his bosom. A little, too, though but a
   little, can Tauler tell him how he may die to those whom he loves best
   on earth, that he may live to them, and love them better still, in the
   ever-present heavens; of how he may lose his life, and all persons and
   things which make his life worth having, that he may find again all of
   them which God has indeed created, in that God to whom all live
   eternally.

   There are those, too, who have endured a struggle darker still; more
   rare, perhaps, but just as real as the last; men on whom the
   "nothingness" of all created things has flashed, not as a mere
   sentimental and exaggerative metaphor, but as a stern, inevitable,
   logical fact; who have felt, if for a moment, that perhaps they and all
   they see and know,--


   "Are but such stuff

   As dreams are made of----"

   who have hung, if but for one moment, self-poised over the abyss of
   boundless doubt; who have shuddered as they saw, if but for a moment,
   sun, and hills, and trees, and the faces which they loved, and the
   seeming-solid earth beneath their feet,--yea, their own body, flesh and
   blood,--reel, melt, and vanish, till nothing was left of the whole
   universe but solitary self with its eternal malady of thought; who have
   cried out of the lowest deep: "What is all which I love--all which I
   hate? I gaze on it; but I see not it, but a picture on my own eyeball.
   I clutch it in despair: but I feel not it, but the nerves of my own
   finger-tip: if, indeed, eyeball and finger-tip be not, like the rest,
   phantoms of a homeless mind, and the only certain existence in the
   universe is I--and that I at war with myself, self-discontented,
   self-despising, and self-damned."

   That problem Tauler will solve for no man; for he will say that each
   man must solve it for himself, face to face with God alone: but he can
   tell how he solved it for himself; how he came to find an eternal light
   shining in for ever in that utter darkness, which the darkness could
   not comprehend; an eternal ground in the midst of that abyss, which
   belonged not to the abyss, nor to the outward world which had vanished
   for the moment, nor to space, nor time, nor any category of human
   thought, or mortal existence; and that its substance was the
   Everlasting Personal Good, whose Love is Righteousness. Tauler can
   point out the path by which he and others came to see that Light, to
   find that Rock of Ages;--the simple path of honest self-knowledge,
   self-renunciation, self-restraint, in which every upward step towards
   right exposes some fresh depth of inward sinfulness, till the once
   proud man, crushed down, like Job and Paul, by the sense of his own
   infinite meanness, becomes, like them, a little child once more, and
   casts himself simply upon the generosity of Him who made him:--


   "An infant crying in the night;

   An infant crying for the light,

   And with no language but a cry."

   And then, so Tauler will tell him, there may come to him the vision,
   dim, perhaps, and fitting ill into clumsy words, but clearer, surer,
   nearer to him than the ground on which he treads, or than the foot
   which treads it--the vision of an Everlasting Spiritual Substance, Most
   Human and yet Most Divine, who can endure; and who, standing beneath
   all things, can make their spiritual substance endure likewise, though
   all worlds and √¶ons, birth, and growth, and death, matter, and space,
   and time, should melt in very deed,--


   "And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,

   Leave not a rack behind."

   If there be any to whom these sentences shall seem merely an enigmatic
   verbiage, darkening counsel by words without knowledge, I can only beg
   them not to look at Tauler's wisdom through my folly; his siccum lumen
   through my glare and smoke. As I said at first, he needs no Preface.
   There are those who will comprehend him without comment. There are
   those, also, who will rise up and follow him, and his Master.

The History and Life
of the
Reverend Doctor John Tauler.
     __________________________________________________________________

  FIRST CHAPTER

   IN the year of Our Lord 1340, it came to pass, that a Master in Holy
   Scripture preached oft-times in a certain city, and the people loved to
   hear him, and his teachings were the talk of the country for many
   leagues round. Now this came to the ears of a layman who was rich in
   God's grace, and he was warned three times in his sleep that he should
   go to the city where the Master dwelt, and hear him preach. Now that
   city was in another country, more than thirty leagues distant. Then the
   man thought within himself, "I will go thither and wait to see what God
   is purposed to do or bring to pass there." So he came to that city and
   heard the Master preach five times. Then God gave this man to perceive
   that the Master was a very loving, gentle, good-hearted man by nature,
   and had a good understanding of the Holy Scripture, but was dark as to
   the light of grace; and the man's heart did yearn over him, and he went
   to the Master and said, "Dear and honoured Sir, I have travelled a good
   thirty leagues on your account, to hear your teaching. Now I have heard
   you preach five times, and I pray you in God's name to let me make my
   confession to you." The Master answered, "With all my heart." Then the
   man confessed to the Master in all simplicity, and when he desired to
   receive the Lord's Body, the Master gave it him. When this had lasted
   twelve weeks, the man said to the Master, "Dear Sir, I beg you for
   God's sake to preach us a sermon, showing us how a man may attain to
   the highest and utmost point it is given to us to reach in this present
   time." The Master answered, "Ah! dear son, what dost thou ask for? how
   shall I tell thee of such high things? for I ween thou wouldst
   understand but little thereof." But the man said, "Ah! dear Master,
   even though I should understand little or nothing thereof, yet I cannot
   but thirst after it. Multitudes flock to hear you; if there were only
   one among them all who could understand you, your labour were well
   bestowed." Then said the Master, "Dear son, if I am to do as thou
   sayest, I must needs give some study and labour to the matter before I
   can put such a sermon together." But the man would not cease from his
   prayers and entreaties till the Master promised him that he should have
   his desire.

   So, when the Master had finished his sermon, he announced to the people
   that in three days they should come together again, for he had been
   requested to teach how a man could attain to the Highest and Best and
   nearest to God that might be reached in this present time. And when the
   day was come, much people came to the church, and the man sat down in a
   place where he could hear well; and the Master came, and thus began his
   discourse, and said:
     __________________________________________________________________

SECOND CHAPTER

   In the following gracious Sermon, twenty-four articles are rehearsed
   whereby a man may perceive who are the proper, true, reasonable,
   enlightened, contemplative men; and what sort of man it is to whom
   Christ may well speak these words: Ecce vere Israelita in quo dolus non
   est--Lo! see a true beholder of God in whom is no guile (John i. 47).

   DEAR children, I have much to say to you in this sermon concerning
   those things of which I have promised to speak; wherefore I cannot for
   this time expound the gospel of the day to you as is my wont, neither
   shall I speak much Latin in this sermon; for what I have to say, I will
   prove with Holy Scripture [and he said]: "Dear children, I would have
   you to know that there be many men, who indeed attain to a clear
   understanding and reasonable judgment, but who do this by means of
   images and forms through the help of other men, and without the
   Scriptures. Further, there be found many who, when they mark that
   something is known to them through the Scriptures, are not therewith
   content. Such a man is still far from his highest and greatest good.
   Dear children, if a man had broken through these things, and was become
   dead to them, and had got above forty stages of contemplation, and
   above the conceptions of our reason, whether they come to us through
   images or forms of speech--if there were a man who had come to this, he
   would be dearer and more precious in God's sight than a hundred
   thousand men who never get out of their own self, and live after the
   way of their own choosing; for to such God cannot find entrance, nor
   work in their souls. This all comes of their own will, and their
   self-glorifying folly, which takes delight in the dexterity of their
   own reason, in framing and handling conceptions. But those men who
   while on earth have broken through those things, and have given
   themselves to God in such sort that they have died unto themselves, and
   have both made themselves free from all outward forms, and the use of
   sensible images in their exercises of contemplation, and humbly toiled
   and pressed onwards above the images of mere reason, as Dionysius says,
   "the light of faith requires that a man should be raised above the
   apprehensions of reason;"--know, dear children, that in such souls God
   doth find rest, and a place wherein to dwell and to work when He
   chooseth. Now when God findeth thus no hindrance in such a man, He
   works His own works in him, and draweth him truly to Himself in
   Himself. Now know that such a man is rare, for his life and ways are
   hidden from others, and unknown to them, except to such as have a like
   life, of whom, alas! I fear there be but few. To this state, and this
   noble perfectness, none can come except through boundless humility, an
   unclouded understanding, and a clear reason; for it has happened ere
   now that some great doctors and priests have fallen; and a multitude of
   rational spirits belonging to the angelic hosts, who perceived nothing
   else in their nature and essence but mere reason, have erred hence, and
   fallen everlastingly away from eternal truth. And this is what happens
   still to all those who look to their own reason, and want to be and do
   as God by the light of their self-willed understanding. For which
   reason it is profitable and needful to know who are the proper, truly
   reasonable, enlightened, contemplative men. Now as far as I can find
   from Scripture, there are four and twenty tokens which such a man must
   possess.

   The First is given us by the highest Master of all doctors, arts and
   wisdom, namely, our Lord Jesus Christ, when he says: "Hereby shall ye
   know whether ye be my disciples, if ye have love one to another even as
   I have loved you." As much as to say, Though ye should possess arts and
   wisdom, and high understanding, it is all in vain if ye have not withal
   fidelity and love.' We believe that Balaam was so replete with
   understanding, that he perceived what things God purposed to do or
   reveal hundreds of years after his day; but it availed him nothing,
   forasmuch as he did not cleave with love and loyalty to the things
   which he understood.

   The Second mark appertaining to a truly reasonable, enlightened man is
   that he must become empty of self; and this must not make him proud,
   but he shall consider how he may ever more attain to this freedom, and
   sit loose by all creatures.

   The Third Article: He shall resign Himself utterly to God, that God may
   work His own works in him, and he shall not glory in the works as being
   his own, but always think himself too mean to have done them.

   The Fourth Article: He shall go out from himself in all the things in
   which he is wont to seek and find himself, whether belonging to time or
   to eternity, and by so doing he shall win a true increase.

   Fifth Article: He shall not seek his own ends in any creature, whether
   temporal or eternal, and hereby he shall attain to perfect satisfaction
   and content.

   The Sixth Article: He shall always wait on that which God will have him
   to do, and shall try, with the help of God, to fulfil that to the
   uttermost, and shall take no glory to himself therefor.

   The Seventh Article: He shall daily, without ceasing, give up his will
   to the will of God, and endeavour to will nothing but what God willeth.

   The Eighth Article: He shall bend all his powers into submission to
   God, and exercise them so constantly and so strenuously in God, and
   with such power and love, that God may work nothing in him without his
   active concurrence, and he may do nothing without God.

   The Ninth Article: He shall have the sense of the presence of God in
   all His works, at all times, and in all places, whatever it please God
   to appoint, whether it be sweet or bitter.

   The Tenth Article: All his pleasure and pain he shall receive, not as
   from the creature, but from God; howbeit God ofttimes works through the
   creature, yet he shall receive all things as from God alone.

   Eleventh Article: He shall not be led captive by any lusting or desire
   after the creatures without due necessity.

   The Twelfth Article: No contradiction or mishap shall have power to
   move or constrain him so that it separate him from the truth; therefore
   hold fast always and entirely by the same.

   Thirteenth Article: He shall not be deceived by the glory of the
   creature, nor yet by any false light, but in a spirit of kindness and
   love he shall confess all things to be what they are, and from all
   things draw out what is best, and use it to his own improvement, and in
   no wise to his own detriment; for such a course is a certain sign of
   the presence of the Holy Spirit.

   Fourteenth Article: He shall at all times be equipped and armed with
   all virtue, and ready to fight against all vice and sin, and with his
   good weapons he shall obtain the victory and the prize in all
   conflicts.

   Fifteenth Article: He shall confess the truth in simplicity, and he
   shall mark what it is in itself, what God requireth of us, and what is
   possible to man, and then order his life accordingly, and act up to
   what he confesses!

   The Sixteenth Article: He shall be a man of few words and much inward
   life.

   The Seventeenth Article: He shall be blameless and righteous, but in no
   wise be puffed up by reason of the same.

   The Eighteenth Article: His conversation shall be in all uprightness
   and sincerity; thus he shall let his light shine before men, and he
   shall preach more with his life than with his lips.

   The Nineteenth Article: He shall seek the glory of God before all
   things, and have no other aim in view.

   The Twentieth Article: He shall be willing to take reproof; and when he
   striveth with any he shall give way if the matter concern himself
   alone, and not God.

   The Twenty-first Article: He shall not desire or seek his own
   advantage, but think himself unworthy of the least thing that falls to
   his lot.

   The Twenty-second Article: He shall look upon himself as the least wise
   and worthy man upon earth, yet find in himself great faith; and above
   all he shall take no account of his own wisdom and the works of his own
   reason, but humble himself beneath all men. For the Author of all truth
   will not work a supernatural work in the soul, unless He find a
   thorough humility in a man, and go before his doings with his perfect
   grace, as he did with St. Paul. But I fear, alas! that little heed is
   taken to this in these our days.

   The Twenty-third Article: He shall set the life and precepts of our
   Lord Jesus Christ before him for a pattern to his life, words, and
   works, and without ceasing look at himself therein as in a mirror,
   that, in so far as he is able, he may put off everything unbecoming the
   honoured image of our Lord.

   The Twenty-fourth and last Article is: He shall comport himself as a
   man of small account,--as nothing more than a beginner in a good life;
   and though he should therefore be despised by many, it shall be more
   welcome to him than all the favour of the world.

   Now, dear children, these are the signs that the ground of a man's soul
   is truly reasonable, so that the image of all truth shineth and
   teacheth therein: and he who does not bear in himself these signs, may
   not and must not set any store by his own reason, either in his own
   eyes or those of others. That we all may become such a true image, in
   thorough sincerity and perfect humility, may He help us who is the
   Eternal Truth, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen!

THIRD CHAPTER

   How this pious man privately reveals to the doctor in part his own
   hidden holiness, and convicts the Master that he is still walking in
   the night of ignorance, and has an unclean vessel, and therefore is yet
   a Pharisee.

   WHEN this sermon was ended, the man went home to his lodging, and wrote
   it down word for word as the Master had spoken it. And when he had
   finished he went to the Master, and said, "I have written out your
   sermon, and if it be not troublesome I should like to read it to you."
   The Master replied, "I shall be glad to hear it." Thereupon the man
   read the sermon over, and then said to the Master, "Dear sir, pray tell
   me if there be a word wanting, that if so I may set it down." The
   Master said, "Dear son, thou hast written every word and phrase just as
   it came out of my mouth. I tell thee, if any one would give me much
   money for it, I could not write down every word so exactly as thou hast
   done it here, unless I set to afresh to draw it from the Scripture. I
   confess that I am greatly astonished at thee to think that thou hast
   been concealed from me so long, and I should never have perceived how
   full of wit thou art, and so often as thou hast confessed to me, thou
   shouldst so have hidden thy talent that I have never perceived it in
   thee." Then the man made as though he would depart, and said, "Dear
   Master, if God will I am purposed to go home again." But the Master
   said, "Dear son, what shouldst thou do at home? Thou hast neither wife
   nor child to provide for; thou must eat there as well as here: for if
   God will, I am minded to preach again of a perfect life." Then said the
   man, "Dear Master, you must know that I have not come hither for the
   sake of your preaching, but because I thought, with God's help, to give
   you some good counsel." Quoth the Master, "How shouldst thou give
   counsel, who art but a layman, and understandest not the Scriptures;
   and it is, moreover, not thy place to preach if thou wouldst. Stay here
   a little longer; perchance God will give me to preach such a sermon as
   thou wouldst care to hear." Then the man said, "Dear Master, I would
   fain say somewhat to you, but I fear that you would be displeased to
   hear it." But the Master answered, "Dear son, say what thou wilt; I can
   answer for it that I shall take it in good part." Hereupon, the man
   said, "You are a great clerk, and have taught us a good lesson in this
   sermon, but you yourself do not live according to it; yet you try to
   persuade me to stay here that you may preach me yet another sermon.
   Sir, I give you to know that neither your sermons, nor any outward
   words that man can speak, have power to work any good in me, for man's
   words have in many ways hindered me much more than they have helped me.
   And this is the reason: it often happened that when I came away from
   the sermon, I brought certain false notions away with me, which I
   hardly got rid of in a long while with great toil; but if the highest
   Teacher of all truth shall come to a man, he must be empty and quit of
   all the things of time. Know ye that when this same Master cometh to
   me, He teaches me more in an hour than you or all the doctors from Adam
   to the Judgment Day will ever do." Then said the Master, "Dear son,
   stay here, I pray thee, and celebrate the Lord's Death with me."
   Whereon the man answered, "Seeing that you adjure me so solemnly, it
   may be that, in obedience to God, I ought to stay with you; but I will
   not do it unless you promise to receive all that I have said to you,
   and all I may yet say to you, as under the seal of confession, so that
   none may know of it." Quoth the Master: "Dear son, that I willingly
   promise, if only that thou wilt stay here." Then said the man, "Sir, ye
   must know, that though you have taught us many good things in this
   sermon, the image came into my mind while you were preaching, that it
   was as if one should take good wine and mix it with lees, so that it
   grew muddy." Quoth the Master: "Dear son, what dost thou mean by this?"
   The man said, "I mean that your vessel is unclean, and much lees are
   cleaving to it, and the cause is, that you have suffered yourself to be
   killed by the letter, and are killing yourself still every day and
   hour, albeit you yourself know full well that the Scripture saith, The
   letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.' Know, that same letter
   which now killeth you will make you alive again, if so be you are
   willing; but in the life you are now living, know that you have no
   light, but you are in the night, in which you are indeed able to
   understand the letter, but have not yet tasted the sweetness of the
   Holy Ghost; and, withal, you are yet a Pharisee." Then said the Master,
   "Dear son, I would have thee to know that, old as I am, I have never
   been spoken to in such fashion all my life." The man said, "Where is
   your preaching now? Do you see now what you are when you are brought to
   the proof? And although you think that I have spoken too hardly to you,
   you are in truth guilty of all I have said, and I will prove to you
   from your own self that it is true." Then said the Master, "I ask for
   no more, for I have ever been an enemy to all Pharisees." Quoth the
   man, "I will first tell you how it is that the letter is killing you.
   Dear sir, as you know yourself, when you were arrived at the age to
   understand good and evil, you began to learn the letter, and in so
   doing you sought your own welfare, and to this day you are in the same
   mind; that is to say, you are trusting to your learning and parts, and
   you do not love and intend God alone, but you are in the letter, and
   intend and seek yourself, and not the glory of God, as the Scripture
   teacheth us to do. You have a leaning towards the creatures, and
   specially towards one creature, and love that creature with your whole
   heart above measure, and that is, moreover, the cause why the letter
   killeth you. And whereas I said that your vessel is unclean; that is
   also true, inasmuch as you have not in all things a single eye to God.
   If you look into yourself, you will, for one thing, find it out by the
   vanity and love of carnal ease whereby your vessel is spoiled and
   filled with lees; wherefore, when the pure unmixed wine of godly
   doctrine has gone through this unclean vessel, it comes to pass that
   your teaching is without favour, and brings no grace to pure, loving
   hearts. And whereas I further said that you were still in darkness, and
   had not the true light; this is also true, and it may be seen hereby
   that so few receive the grace of the Holy Spirit through your teaching.
   And whereas I said that you were a Pharisee, that is also true; but you
   are not one of the hypocritical Pharisees. Was it not a mark of the
   Pharisees that they loved and sought themselves in all things, and not
   the glory of God? Now examine yourself, dear sir, and see if you are
   not a proper Pharisee in the eyes of God. Know, dear Master, that there
   are many people in the world who are all called Pharisees in God's
   sight, be they great or small, according to what their hearts or lives
   are bent upon."

   As the man spoke these words the Master fell on his neck and kissed
   him, and said: "A likewise has come into my mind. It has happened to me
   as it did to the heathen woman at the well. For know, dear son, that
   thou hast laid bare all my faults before my eyes; thou hast told me
   what I had hidden up within me, and specially that I have an affection
   for one creature; but I tell thee of a truth that I know it not myself,
   nor do I believe that any human being in the world can know of it. I
   wonder greatly who can have told thee this of me? But doubt not that
   thou hast it from God. Now, therefore, I pray thee, dear son, that thou
   celebrate our Lord's Death, and be thou my ghostly father, and let me
   be thy poor sinful son." Then said the man, "Dear sir, if you speak so
   contrary to ordinances, I will not stay with you, but ride home again;
   that I assure you." Hereupon said the Master, "Ah, no! I pray thee, for
   God's sake, do not so; stay awhile with me; I promise thee readily not
   to speak thus any more. I am minded, with God's help, to begin a better
   course, and I will gladly follow thy counsel, whatsoever thou deemest
   best, if I may but amend my life." Then said the man, "I tell you of a
   truth, that the letter and learning lead many great doctors astray, and
   bring some into purgatory and some into hell, according as their life
   here hath been,--I tell you of a truth, it is no light matter that God
   should give a man such great understanding and skill, and mastery in
   the Scripture, and he should not put it in practice in his life."
     __________________________________________________________________

FOURTH CHAPTER

   How God had wrought a great miracle through this pious man, and how
   this had come to pass because God found in him a good and thorough
   humility.

   THEN said the Master, "I pray thee, for God's sake to tell me how it is
   that thou hast attained to such a life, and how thou didst begin thy
   spiritual life, and what have been thy exercises and thy history." The
   man said, "That is, indeed, a simple request: for I tell you truly, if
   I should recount, or write, all the wondrous dealings of God with me, a
   poor sinner, for the last twelve years, I verily believe that you have
   not a book large enough to contain it if it were all written; however,
   I will tell you somewhat thereof for this time.

   "The first thing that helped me was, that God found in me a sincere and
   utterly self-surrendering humility. Now I do not think there is any
   need to tell you the bodily exercises by which I brought my flesh into
   subjection: for men's natures and dispositions are very unlike; but
   whenever a man has given himself up to God with utter humility, God
   will not fail to give him such exercises, by temptations and other
   trials, as He perceives to be profitable to the man, and such as he is
   well able to bear and endure if he be only willing. But this you ought
   to know: he who asks counsel of many people will be apt to go often
   astray; for each one will point him to his own experience. But ofttimes
   a man may exercise himself in a certain practice which is good and
   profitable to himself; while, if another did the same, it might very
   likely be useless, or even hurtful to him. The Devil often stirs up a
   man to practise great austerities, with the intent that the man may
   grow sick and infirm thereby, or weak in his brain, or do himself some
   other injury.

   "I will tell you how it befell me in the beginning. I was reading the
   German books about the lives of the Saints, when I thought to myself,
   These were men who lived on this earth as well as I, and perhaps, too,
   had not sinned as I have.' And when these thoughts came into my head, I
   began to exercise myself in the life of the Saints with some
   severities, but grew so sick thereby that I was brought to death's
   door. And it came to pass one morning at break of day, that I had
   exercised myself so that my eyelids closed from very weakness, and I
   fell asleep. And in my sleep it was as though a voice spoke to me and
   said, Thou foolish man, if thou art bent upon killing thyself before
   thy time, thou wilt have to bear a heavy punishment; but if thou didst
   suffer God to exercise thee, He could exercise thee better than thou by
   thyself, or with the Devil's counsel.' When I heard speak of the Devil
   I awoke in a great fright, rose up, and walked out into a wood nigh to
   the town. Then I thought within myself, I had begun these exercises
   without counsel: I will go and tell the old hermit all that has
   happened to me. And I did so, and told him the words that I had heard
   in my sleep, and besought him in God's name to give me the best counsel
   he could. So the hermit said, Thou must know that if I am to advise,
   thou must first tell me all about thy exercises.' So I did, and he
   said, By whose counsel hast thou done these things?' and I answered, Of
   my own will. Then the hermit said, Then know that it has been the
   Devil's counsel, and thou must not obey him any more as long as thou
   livest, but thou must utterly give thyself up to God; He can exercise
   thee much better than thou thyself, or the Devil.' Behold, dear Master,
   thereupon I ceased from these exercises, and yielded myself and my
   doings altogether up to God. For the rest, dear sir, you must know that
   by nature I was a very ingenious, clever, good-hearted man; but I had
   not the Scriptures in my hand, like you, but could only learn to know
   myself by my natural intelligence; and with this sometimes I got so far
   that I was surprised at myself. And once upon a time, I thought in my
   reason, Thou hast such good parts, may be, if thou shouldst give thy
   mind to it with all earnestness, thou couldst attain to comprehend
   somewhat of divine things.' But as this thought came into my head I
   marked straightway that it was the Devil's counsel, and saw that it was
   all false. So I said, O thou Evil Spirit, what an impure false counsel
   hast thou put in my heart, thou bad, false counsellor! If we had such a
   God I would not give a berry for him.' After that, another night, when
   I was saying my matins, [3] an ardent longing came over me, so that I
   said, O eternal and merciful God, that it were thy will to give me to
   discover something that should be above all our sensual reason!' As
   soon as I had said it I was sorely affrighted at this great longing,
   and said with great fervour, Ah, my God and my Lord, forgive me of Thy
   boundless mercy for having done this, and that it should have entered
   into the heart of a poor worm like me to desire such a great gift of
   such rich grace, and I confess indeed that I have not always lived as I
   ought of right to do. I confess, moreover, dear Lord, that I have been
   unthankful to Thee in all things, so that methinks I am not worthy that
   the earth should bear me, still less that such an ardent, gracious
   desire should spring up in me; wherefore my body must be punished for
   my sin.' With that I threw off my garments and scourged myself till the
   blood ran down my shoulders. And as these words remained in my heart
   and on my lips till the day broke, and the blood was flowing down, in
   that same hour God showed His mercy on me, so that my mind was filled
   with a clear understanding. And in that same hour I was deprived of all
   my natural reason; but the time seemed all too short to me. And when I
   was left to myself again I saw a supernatural mighty wonder and sign,
   insomuch that I could have cried with St. Peter, Lord, it is good for
   me to be here!' Now know, dear sir, that in that self-same short hour I
   received more truth and more illumination in my understanding than all
   the teachers could ever teach me from now till the Judgment Day by word
   of mouth, and with all their natural learning and science. Now, dear
   Master, I have said enough for this time, as to how it stands with
   you."

FIFTH CHAPTER

   How God converted a heathen in a foreign land through this pious
   layman, and how that the Holy Ghost still to this day displays His
   grace with the same power that He showed on the day of Pentecost, when
   He finds fitting hearts to receive Him. Further, how this pious man
   gives still better instruction to the Doctor in these matters, and
   shows him that he is a true Pharisee, and brings him to submit to be
   converted and amend his ways.

   THEN said the Master, "If God give thee grace to say still more, I
   should heartily rejoice in it, for I tell thee in all sincerity that I
   have listened to thee gladly, dear son: now I beg thee for God's sake
   do not leave me, but stay here, and if thou lack money I will not let
   thee want for anything, if I have to pledge a book for it." Then said
   the man, "God reward you, dear sir: know that I need not your kindness,
   for God hath made me a steward of His goods, so that I have of earthly
   wealth five thousand florins, which are God's, and if I knew where
   there was need of them, or where God would have them bestowed, I would
   give them away." Then said the Master, "Then, dear son, thou art indeed
   the steward of a rich man and a great Lord! I am in great wonderment
   about that thou saidst, that I and all teachers could not teach thee as
   much by the Day of Judgment as thou hast been taught in an hour. Now
   tell me, for I wish to hear, has the Scripture proceeded from the Holy
   Ghost?" Then said the man, "Sir, methinks it seems impossible that
   after I have said so much to you, you should talk in such a childish
   fashion! Look here, dear Master! I will ask you a question, and if with
   all your reason you can explain it to me, either by the Scriptures, or
   without the Scriptures, I will give you ten thousand florins." Then
   said the Master, "What is that?" The man said, "Can you instruct me how
   I should write a letter to a heathen far away in a heathen land, in
   such fashion and language that the heathen should be able to read and
   understand it; and make the letter such that the heathen should come to
   the Christian faith?" Then said the Master, "Dear son, these are the
   works of the Holy Ghost; tell me where has this happened? If thou know
   anything of the matter, tell me in what way this came to pass, and
   whether it happened to thyself?" Then said the man, "Albeit I am
   unworthy of it, yet did the Holy Spirit work through me, a poor sinner;
   and how it came to pass would take long to tell, and make such a long
   story that one might write a large book about it: The heathen was a
   very good-hearted man, and often cried to Heaven, and called upon Him
   who had made him and all the world, and said: O Creator of all
   creatures, I have been born in this land: now the Jews have another
   faith, the Christians another. O Lord, who art over all, and hast made
   all creatures, if there be now any faith better than that in which I
   have been born, or if there be any other better still, show it to me in
   what wise Thou wilt, so that I may believe it, and I will gladly obey
   Thee and believe: but if it should be that Thou dost not show it me,
   and I should die in my faith, since I knew no better, if there were a
   better faith, but Thou hadst not shown it nor revealed it to me, Thou
   wouldst have done me a grievous injustice.' Now, behold, dear sir, a
   letter was sent to that heathen, written by me, a poor sinner, in such
   sort that he came to the Christian faith; and he wrote me a letter back
   again, telling what had befallen him, the which stood written in a good
   German tongue, that I could read it quite well. Dear sir, there were
   much to be said on this matter, but for this time it is enough; you are
   well able to mark the meaning thereof." Then said the Master, "God is
   wonderful in all His works and gifts! Dear son, thou hast told me very
   strange things."

   The man said, "Dear sir, I fear that I have said some things to you
   which have vexed you greatly in your mind; it is because I am a layman,
   and you are a great doctor of Holy Scripture, and yet I have said so
   much to you after the manner of a teacher. But that I have meant it
   well and kindly, and sought your soul's salvation in it, and simply the
   glory of God, and nothing else, of that God is my witness." Then said
   the Master, "Dear son, if it will not make thee angry, I will tell thee
   what vexes me." Then said the man, "Yea, dear sir, speak without fear;
   I promise not to take it amiss." The Master said, "It amazes me
   greatly, and is very hard to receive, that thou being a layman, and I a
   priest, I am to take instruction from thee; and it also troubles me
   much that thou calledst me a Pharisee." Then said the man, "Is there
   nothing else that you cannot take in?" The Master answered, "No, I know
   of nothing else." Then said the man, "Shall I also explain to you these
   two things?" He answered, "Yes, dear son, I pray thee in all kindness
   to do so, for God's sake." Then said the man, "Now tell me, dear
   Master, how it was, or whose work it was, that the blessed Saint
   Katharine, who was but a young virgin barely fourteen years old,
   overcame some fifty of the great masters, and moreover so prevailed
   over them that they willingly went to martyrdom? Who wrought this?"
   Then said the Master, "The Holy Ghost did this." Quoth the man, "Do you
   not believe that the Holy Ghost has still the same power?" The Master,
   "Yes, I believe it fully." The man, "Wherefore then do you not believe
   that the Holy Ghost is speaking to you at this moment through me, a
   poor sinner and unworthy man, and is minded to speak to you? He spoke
   the truth through Caiaphas, who was also a sinner; and know, that since
   you take what I have said to you so much amiss, I will refrain from
   saying anything to you for the future." Then said the Master, "Dear
   son, do not do that: I hope, if God will, to be the better for thy
   words." The man said, "Ah, dear sir, it vexes you also that I should
   have called you a Pharisee, and yet I gave you such full proof of it
   that you could not deny it. This should have been enough to content
   you, but since it is not, I must say still more, and prove to you once
   again, that I am right, and that you are what I said. Dear Master, you
   know very well that our Lord Jesus Christ said himself, Beware of the
   Pharisees, for they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and
   lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them
   with one of their fingers.' Now, dear sir, look at yourself; in this
   sermon of yours you have bound and laid upon us twenty-four articles,
   and you keep few enough of them yourself. Again: Our Lord said, Beware
   of the Pharisees: whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do,
   but do not ye after their works, for they say and do not.'" Quoth the
   Master, "Our Blessed Lord spoke these words to the men of his own day."
   The man said, "He speaks them still, now and evermore, to all men. Dear
   Master, look at yourself; whether you touch these burdens and bear them
   in your life is known to God and also to yourself; but I confess that
   as far as I can judge of your present condition, I would rather follow
   your words than your life. Only look at yourself, and see if you are
   not a Pharisee in the eyes of God; though not one of those false
   hypocritical Pharisees whose portion is in hell-fire." The Master said,
   "I know not what I shall say; this I see plainly, that I am a sinner,
   and am resolved to better my life, if I die for it. Dear son, I cannot
   wait longer; I pray thee, simply for God's sake, to counsel me how I
   shall set about this work, and show me and teach me how I may attain to
   the highest perfection that a man may reach on earth." Then said the
   man, "Dear sir, do not be wroth with me; but I tell you of a truth that
   such counsel is scarcely to be given you; for if you are to be
   converted, all your wonted habits must be broken through with great
   pain; because you must altogether change your old way of life: and
   besides I take you to be near fifty years old." Then said the Master,
   "It may be so; but O dear son, to him who came into the vineyard at the
   eleventh hour was given his penny the same as to him who came in at the
   first. I tell thee, dear son, I have well considered the matter, and my
   heart is so firmly set that if I knew this moment that I must die for
   it, I would yet, with the help of God, cease from my carnal life, and
   my earthly reasonings, and live according to thy counsel. I beseech
   thee for God's sake not to keep me longer waiting, but to tell me this
   moment how I must begin." Then said the man, "Dear sir, because you
   have received grace from God, and are willing to humble yourself and
   submit, and to bow down before a poor, mean, unworthy creature; for all
   this let us give the glory to God, to whom it is due, for this grace
   proceeds from him, and flows back to Him. Since then, dear sir, I am to
   instruct you, and counsel you in God's name, I will look to Him for
   help, and do so in love to Him, and set you a task such as they give
   children to begin with at school,--namely, the four-and-twenty letters
   of the alphabet, beginning with A:

SIXTH CHAPTER

   This is the golden A B C which this pious man set the Doctor to learn,
   for the amending of his life, and which, doubtless, it were very
   profitable and needful for us all to repeat many times and oft, and
   amend our lives thereafter.

   After a manly and not a childish sort, ye shall, with thorough
   earnestness, begin a good life.

   Bad ways ye shall eschew, and practice all goodness with diligence and
   full purpose of mind.

   Carefully endeavour to keep the middle path in all things, with
   seemliness and moderation.

   Demean yourself humbly in word and work, from the inward holiness of
   your heart.

   Entirely give up your own will; evermore cleave earnestly to God, and
   forsake Him not.

   Forward and ready shall ye be to all good works, without murmuring,
   whatever be commanded you.

   Give heed to exercise yourself in all godly works of mercy toward the
   body or the spirit.

   Have no backward glances after the world, or the creatures, or their
   doings.

   Inwardly in your heart ponder over your past life with honesty, sincere
   repentance in the bitterness of your heart, and tears in your eyes.

   Knightly and resolutely withstand the assaults of the Devil, the Flesh,
   and the World.

   Learn to conquer long-cherished sloth with vigour, together with all
   effeminacy of the body, and subservience to the Devil.

   Make your abode in God, with fervent love, in certain hope, with strong
   faith, and be towards your neighbour as towards yourself.

   No other man's good things shall ye desire, be they what they may,
   corporeal or spiritual.

   Order all things so that you make the best and not the worst of them.

   Penance, that is, suffering for your sin, you shall take willingly,
   whether it come from God or the creatures.

   Quittance, remission, and absolution, you shall give to all who have
   ever done you wrong in thought, word, or deed.

   Receive all things that befall you with meekness, and draw improvement
   from them.

   Soul and body, estate and reputation, keep undenied with all care and
   diligence. [4]

   Truthful and upright shall ye be towards all, without guile or cunning.

   Wantonness and excess, of whatsoever kind it may be, ye shall learn to
   lay aside, and turn from it with all your heart.

   Xt., our Blessed Lord's life and death, shall ye follow, and wholly
   conform yourself thereunto with all your might.

   Ye shall evermore, without ceasing, beseech our blessed Lady that she
   help you to learn this our lesson well.

   Zealously keep a rein over your will and your senses, that they may be
   at peace with all that God doth, and also with all His creatures.


   All this lesson must be learnt of a free heart and will, without
   cavilling.

SEVENTH CHAPTER

   How the Doctor learns this task very quickly (though with trouble), and
   how this layman further instructeth him in the shortest way to the
   highest contemplation; also how he was obliged to begin a dying life,
   and exercise himself therein till at last he prevailed over himself.
   And in this following lesson lies the true ground of almost all the
   sermons that stand in this book, from which lesson also this Doctor
   obtained his understanding of Holy Scripture, and the perfecting of his
   life, as shall be hereafter set forth.

   NOW, dear sir, take kindly as from God, without cavilling, this child's
   task, which He sets you by the mouth of me, a poor and unworthy human
   being."

   Then said the Master, "However thou mayst call this a child's task,
   methinks it needs a man's strength to attack it. Now tell me, dear son,
   how long a time wilt thou give me to learn this lesson?" The man
   answered, "We will take five weeks, in honour of the five wounds of
   Christ, that you may learn it well. You shall be your own schoolmaster;
   and when you are not perfect in any one of these letters, and think
   yourself hardly able to learn it, then cast aside your garment and
   chastise your body, that it may be brought into subjection to your soul
   and reason." Then said the Master, "I will gladly be obedient."

   Now when this discipline had lasted three weeks, the man said to the
   Master, "Dear sir, how goes it with you?" The Master said, "Dear son,
   thou must know that I have received more stripes in these three weeks
   about your lesson than I ever did in all my days before." Then said the
   man, "Sir, you well know that no man giveth his pupil a new task before
   he have learnt the first lines." Then said the Master, "If I said that
   I knew them, I should say what is not true." Then said the man, "Dear
   sir, go on as you are doing till you know your lesson right well."

   But at the end of another three weeks the Master sent for the man, and
   said to him, "Dear son, rejoice with me, for I think, with God's help,
   I could say the first line; and if thou art willing, I will repeat over
   the whole lesson to thee." "No, dear sir," said the man, "I will gladly
   rejoice with you, and take your word for it that you know it." Then
   said the Master, "I tell thee of a truth it has gone hard with me. And
   now, dear son, I pray thee give me further instruction." Then said the
   man, "I can for myself teach you nothing further; but if so be that God
   willeth to teach you through me, I will gladly do my part, and be an
   instrument in the Lord's hand by which He may work out His purposes.

   "Hearken, dear Master: I will counsel you in godly love and brotherly
   faithfulness. If it should happen to you as to the young man in the
   Gospel, to whom our Lord said, Go and sell all that thou hast and give
   to the poor, and come and follow me,' I will not be answerable." Then
   said the Master, "Dear son, have no fears on that score, for I have
   already left all that I have, and, with God's help, am resolved to go
   forward, and be obedient unto God and to thee." Then said the man,
   "Since your heart is steadfastly fixed to commit yourself wholly unto
   God, I counsel you in all faithfulness that ye be obedient to your
   order and your superiors; as it may be that you may be brought into
   great perplexity if you be minded to go the straight and narrow way,
   and that you will be hard pressed and assailed, and most of all by your
   brethren. And if this should come to pass, your earthly feelings will
   seek everywhere for help, and make you call to mind the words in which
   you pledged yourself to God, and also other things, with the intent
   that, if possible, they might break away from the cross; and that must
   not be, but you must yield a willing obedience to suffer all that is
   appointed you, from whatsoever it may proceed. For know that you must
   needs walk in that same path of which our Lord spoke to that young
   man;--you must take up your cross and follow our Lord Jesus Christ and
   His example, in utter sincerity, humility, and patience, and must let
   go all your proud, ingenious reason, which you have through your
   learning in the Scripture. You shall also for a time neither study nor
   preach, and you shall demean yourself with great simplicity towards
   your penitents; for when they have ended their confession, you shall
   give them no further counsel than to say to them, I will learn how to
   counsel myself, and when I can do that I will also counsel you.' And if
   you are asked when you will preach, say, as you can with truth, that
   you have not time at present, and so you will get rid of the people."
   Then said the Master, "Dear son, I will willingly do so; but how then
   shall I occupy myself?" The man replied, "You shall enter into your
   cell, and read your Hours, and also chant in the choir if you feel
   inclined, and shall say mass every day. And what time is left, you
   shall set before you the sufferings of our Lord, and contemplate your
   own life in the mirror of His, and meditate on your wasted time in
   which you have been living for yourself, and how small has been your
   love compared to His love. In all lowliness ye shall study these
   things, whereby in some measure ye may be brought to true humility, and
   also wean yourself from your old habits, and cease from them. And then,
   when our Lord sees that the time is come, He will make of you a new
   man, so that you shall be born again of God.

   "Nevertheless, you must know that before this can come to pass, you
   must sell all that you have, and humbly yield it up to God, that you
   may truly make Him your end, and give up to Him all that you possess in
   your carnal pride, whether through the Scriptures or without; or
   whatever it be, whereby you might reap honour in this world, or in the
   which you may aforetime have taken pleasure or delight, you must let it
   all go, and, with Mary Magdalene, fall down at Christ's feet, and
   earnestly strive to enter on a new course. And so doing, without doubt,
   the Eternal Heavenly Prince will look down on you with the eye of His
   good pleasure, and He will not leave His work undone in you, but will
   urge you still further, that you may be tried and purified as gold in
   the fire; and it may even come to pass, that He shall give you to drink
   of the bitter cup that He gave to His only-begotten Son. For it is my
   belief that one bitter drop which God will pour out for you will be
   that your good works and all your refraining from evil, yea your whole
   life will be despised and turned to nought in the eyes of the people;
   and all your spiritual children will forsake you and think you are gone
   out of your mind, and all your good friends and your brothers in the
   convent will be offended at your life, and say that you have taken to
   strange ways.

   "But when these things come upon you, be not in any wise dismayed, but
   rejoice, for then your salvation draweth nigh; howbeit, no doubt, your
   human weakness will shrink back in terror, and give way. Therefore,
   dear Master, you must not be fainthearted, but trust firmly in God, for
   He forsakes none of His servants, as you know well from the examples of
   the blessed saints. Now, dear sir, if so be that you are minded to take
   these things in hand, know that there is nothing better or more
   profitable for you at this present than an entire, hearty, humble
   self-surrender in all things, whether sweet or bitter, painful or
   pleasant, so that you may be able to say with truth, Ah, my Lord and my
   God, if it were thy will that I should remain till the Day of Judgment
   in this suffering and tribulation, yet would I not fall away from thee,
   but would desire ever to be constant in thy service.' Dear sir, I see
   well, by God's grace, how you are thinking in your heart, that I have
   said very hard things to you, and this is why I begged you beforehand
   to let me go, and told you that if you went back like that young man, I
   would not have it laid to my charge." Then said the Master, "Thou
   sayest truly; I confess it does seem to me a hard thing to follow your
   counsel." The man answered, "Yet you begged me to show you the shortest
   way to the highest perfectness. Now I know no shorter nor surer way
   than to follow in the footsteps of our Lord Jesus Christ. But, dear
   sir, I counsel you in all faithfulness, to take a certain space of time
   to consider these matters, and then in God's name do as God gives you
   grace to do." Then said the Master, "That will I do, and wait and see
   whether, with the help of God, I may prevail."
     __________________________________________________________________

EIGHTH CHAPTER

   How it fared with the Doctor after this, and how he fell into great
   tribulation and contempt, till he fell ill thereby; and how the layman
   counselled him, and allowed him to help nature with some good food and
   spices, and afterwards departed from him.

   ON the eleventh day after this, the Master sent for the man, and said
   to him, "Ah, dear son, what agony and struggle and fighting have I not
   had within me day and night, before I was able to overcome the Devil
   and my own flesh. But now by God's grace I have gathered myself
   together with all my powers inward and outward, and set my hand to this
   work with good courage, and am purposed to remain steadfast therein,
   come weal come woe." Then said the man, "Dear sir, do you remember
   still all I said to you when you asked me how you should begin?" The
   Master answered, "Yes, the moment thou didst depart I wrote down all
   thou hadst said to me, word for word." Then said the man, "Dear sir,
   that through God you have found this bold heart, rejoices me from the
   bottom of my soul, and I am as well pleased as if it had happened to
   myself, so God be my witness. And now in the name of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, set forward." Then the man took his leave, and the Master did
   as he had been bidden.

   Now it came to pass that before a year was out the Master grew to be
   despised of all his familiar friends in the convent, and his spiritual
   children all forsook him as entirely as if they had never seen him. And
   this he found very hard to bear, and it caused him such grief that his
   head was like to turn. Then he sent for the man and told him how it
   fared with him; how he was ill in his whole body, and especially in his
   head. Then said the man, "Sir, you must not be dismayed, but you must
   humbly cleave to God, and put your firm trust in Him. Know that this
   account of yours pleases me well, and it stands well with your life,
   and will grow better every day.

   "Dear sir, you know well that he who will walk in the right way, and
   tread this path, must be made a partaker of the sufferings of our Lord
   Jesus Christ; therefore be not afraid, but commit yourself wholly to
   God. For know that the same thing happened to me also. Meanwhile you
   must take some remedies while you are in this state, and treat your
   body well with good food which may strengthen it. A box of spices was
   made for me, and I will have such an one prepared for you to strengthen
   your head. But you must know that I always gave myself up body and soul
   to God, that He might do with them what he pleased."

   Then said the Master, "But thou didst tell me before that I must shun
   good eating and drinking." The man answered, "Yes, sir, that was in the
   first beginning, when the flesh was yet wanton, but now that it is
   tamed and obedient to the spirit, we may come to its help with
   remedies, else we should tempt God. So long as you are in this
   sickness, you will be serving God to cherish your body by allowable
   means, but not to live disorderly; that must not be. Dear sir, make God
   your help, and go forward with cheerful mind, and commit yourself to
   God with true and thorough resignation, and put your trust in His
   boundless mercy, and wait for His grace to show you what He will have
   you to do, and then with His help strive to fulfil that to the
   uttermost, whether it be bitter or sweet. Further, I beseech you for
   God's sake not to take it amiss of me, but I must go home on account of
   a very important matter, which I assure you in all earnestness I have
   much at heart; but if so be that you could not or would not do without
   me, send into the town for me, and I will gladly come; but if you can
   bear up without the aid of any creature, that would be best of all for
   you." Then said the Master, "Dear son, say not so, for I cannot and
   would not do without thee for any length of time; it would be hard
   indeed if thou didst forsake me, for then I should have no consolation
   left in the world." The man said, "Dear sir, I will show you a better
   Comforter, that is the Holy Ghost, who has called and invited and
   brought you to this point, by means of me His poor creature, but it is
   His work which has been wrought in you, and not mine; I have been
   merely His instrument, and served Him therein, and have done so right
   willingly, for the glory of God and the salvation of your soul." Then
   said the Master, "Dear son, may God be thine eternal reward! Since it
   is so weighty a matter, I will commit myself to God, and bear this
   suffering as best I may." The man said, "Dear sir, since you are now
   under the yoke, and have entered on a spiritual life and obedience to
   God, and have voluntarily devoted yourself thereto, you should know how
   to live discreetly and wisely, and to govern yourself aright; and do
   not let it repent you because you are forsaken of the creatures, but if
   it should happen that you lack money, or have need of some, put a part
   of your books in pawn, and do not suffer yourself to want for anything,
   but by no means sell the books, for a time will come when good books
   will be very useful, and you will have need of them." Then the man took
   his leave and departed from that place, but the Master's eyes filled
   with tears, and he began to weep.
     __________________________________________________________________

NINTH CHAPTER

   How Doctor Tauler was visited, touched, and illuminated after a
   wonderful manner by God, and how the layman came to him again, and
   admonished him tenderly to begin to preach afresh, and to exercise
   himself in the Holy Scriptures. Also concerning a strange event that
   befell him afterwards, whereby he was still more tried and humbled, yet
   not without fruit.

   NOW when the Master had suffered thus for two years, from sore assaults
   and temptations of the Devil, and great contempt from all his friends,
   and also great poverty, so that he was obliged to pledge a part of his
   books, and withal fell into great weakness of the body, and he had
   demeaned himself with great humility throughout;--behold, it came to
   pass on the Feast of St. Paul's Conversion, that in the night he was
   overtaken by the most grievous assault that may be imagined, whereby
   all his natural powers were so overcome with weakness that when the
   time for matins came he could not go in to chapel, but remained in his
   cell, and commended himself to God in great humility, without help or
   consolation from any creature. And as he lay in this state of weakness,
   he thought of the sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ, and His great
   love that He had for us, and considered his own life, how poor his life
   had been compared to the love of God. Whereupon he was overwhelmed with
   contrition for all his sins and all his wasted time, and exclaimed with
   tongue and heart: "O merciful God! have mercy upon me a poor sinner,
   for thy boundless mercy's sake, for I am not worthy that the earth
   should bear me." And as he was lying in this weakness and great
   sadness, but fully awake, he heard with his bodily ears a voice saying:
   "Stand fast in thy peace, and trust God, and know that when He was on
   earth in human nature, He made the sick whom He healed in body sound
   also in soul." Straightway when these words were uttered, he lost his
   senses and reason, and knew not how or where he was. But when he came
   to himself again, he felt within himself that he was possessed of a new
   strength and might in all powers outward and inward, and had also a
   clear understanding in those things which aforetime were dark to him,
   and he wondered greatly whence this came, and thought to himself, "I
   cannot come to the bottom of this matter. I will send for my friend and
   tell him all that has happened." So he sent for the man; and when he
   was come, the Master told him all that had befallen him. Then the man
   said, "It rejoices me from the bottom of my heart to hear all that you
   have told me. Dear sir, you must know that you have now for the first
   time received the true and mighty gift of God's grace; and I tell you
   of a truth that now, for the first time, your soul has been touched by
   the Most High; and know that, as the letter hath in some measure slain
   you, so it shall likewise make you alive again, for your doctrine will
   come now from the Holy Ghost, which before came from the flesh; for you
   have now received the light of the Holy Spirit by the grace of God, and
   you already know the Holy Scriptures. Therefore you have now a great
   advantage, and you will henceforward have a much clearer insight into
   the Scripture than you had before. For, as you know, the Scripture
   sounds in many places as if it contradicted itself, but since that you
   have now, by the grace of God, received the Holy Scriptures into your
   own heart through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, you will
   perceive that all Scripture has the same intent, and does not
   contradict itself, and you will also be able rightly to follow the
   pattern left us by the Lord Jesus Christ. You ought also to begin to
   preach again, and to teach your fellow-Christians, and show them the
   right path to eternal life. The time is come now when good books will
   be profitable to you; for know that one of your sermons will be more
   profitable now, and the people will receive more fruit therefrom, than
   from a hundred aforetime, for the words that you say now, coming from a
   pure soul, will have a pure and simple favour. Wherefore, just as much
   as you have been despised by the people, so shall you now be esteemed
   and beloved by them. But it will be most especially needful that you
   keep yourself humble, for you know well that he who carries a great
   treasure exposed to view must ever be on his guard against thieves. I
   tell you truly the Devil is in great terror when he perceives that God
   has bestowed on any man such a noble and precious treasure, and the
   devils will set all their arts and wisdom, and their lusts too, to
   work, to rob and bereave you of this costly treasure; wherefore look
   wisely to your goings, for nothing will so greatly help you to preserve
   it as utter humility. Now, dear sir, it is no longer needful for me to
   speak to you as a teacher, as I have done hitherto, for you have now
   the right and true Master, whose instrument I have been: to Him give
   ear, and obey His commands; this is my most faithful counsel. And now,
   in all godly love, I desire to receive instruction from you, for I
   have, with God's help, accomplished the good work for which I was sent
   and came hither. I would fain, if God will, sojourn here a good while
   and hear you preach. If God give you to do so, methinks it were well
   that you should now begin to preach again." Then said the Master, "Dear
   son, what had I better do; I have pledged a great many good books, as
   many as come to thirty florins?" The man answered, "Look! I will give
   you that sum, for God's sake, and if you have any of it left over, give
   it back to God, for all that we have is His, whether temporal or
   spiritual." So the Master redeemed his books, and ordered notice to be
   given that he would preach three days after. The people wondered much
   thereat, because it was so long since he had preached, and a great
   crowd gathered together to hear him. And when the Master came and saw
   that there was such a multitude, he went up into a pulpit in a high
   place that they might hear him all the better. Then he held his hood
   before his eyes, and said, "O merciful, Eternal God, if it be Thy will,
   give me so to speak that it may be to the praise and glory of Thy name
   and the good of this people." As he said these words, his eyes
   overflowed with tears of tenderness, so that he could not speak a word
   for weeping, and this lasted so long that the people grew angry. At
   last a man spoke out of the crowd, "Sir, how long are we to stand here?
   It is getting late; if you do not mean to preach, let us go home." But
   the Master remained in earnest prayer, and said again to God, "Oh, my
   Lord and my God, if it be Thy divine will, take this weeping from my
   eyes, and give me to deliver this sermon to Thy praise and glory. But,
   if Thou dost not do it, I take it as a sign that Thou judgest I have
   not yet been enough put to shame. Now fulfil, dear Lord, Thy divine
   will on me Thy poor creature, to Thy praise and my necessities." This
   all availed nothing; he wept yet more and more. Then he saw that God
   would have it so, and said, with weeping eyes, "Dear children, I am
   sorry from my heart that I have kept you here so long, for I cannot
   speak a word to-day for weeping; pray God for me, that He may help me,
   and then I will make amends to you, if God give me grace, another time,
   as soon as ever I am able." So the people departed, and this tale was
   spread abroad and resounded through the whole city, so that he became a
   public laughing-stock, despised by all; and the people said, "Now we
   all see that he has become a downright fool." And his own brethren
   strictly forbade him to preach any more, because he did the convent
   great injury thereby, and disgraced the order with the senseless
   practices that he had taken up, and which had disordered his brain.

   Then the Master sent for the man, and told him all that had happened.
   The man said, "Dear Master, be of good cheer, and be not dismayed at
   these things. The Bridegroom is wont to behave so to all His best and
   dearest friends, and it is a certain sign that God is your good friend,
   for, without a doubt, He has seen some speck of pride concealed within
   you that you have not perceived, nor been conscious of yourself, and
   therefore it is that you have been put to shame. You may have received
   some great gifts of God, which you yourself do not know or perceive,
   that have been given you by means of the patience with which you have
   endured this assault; therefore be of good cheer, and be joyful and
   humble. Neither should you think this a strange thing, for I have seen
   many such instances in other people. You shall not despise this
   pressure of the cross which God has sent you, but count it a great
   blessing and favour from God. I counsel you that you remain alone for
   the next five days, and endure without speaking to any, to the praise
   and glory of the five wounds of our Lord Jesus Christ. And when the
   five days are ended, beg your Prior to give you permission to deliver a
   sermon in Latin. If he refuse, beg him to let you try in the school and
   read a lecture to the brethren." And he did so; and read to his
   brethren such an excellent lecture as they had never heard in their
   lives before, so grand and deep and godly was his doctrine. Then they
   gave him permission to preach a sermon; and after one of their brethren
   had preached in the church where the Master was wont to preach, he gave
   notice to the people, and said, "I am ordered to announce that
   to-morrow the Master intends to preach in this place; but if it should
   befall him as it did lately, I will not be answerable for it. So much I
   can say with truth, that in our school he has read us a lecture
   containing such great and profound instruction, with high and divine
   wisdom, as we have not heard for a long time. But what he will do this
   time I know not; God only knoweth." The next day after, the Master came
   to the convent (it was a convent of ladies), and began to preach, and
   said:

TENTH CHAPTER

   An excellent sermon which this Doctor delivered in a convent after his
   illumination, concerning Christ the true Bridegroom of the soul, in the
   which he showed how she is to follow Him in true, shamefaced, humble,
   and patient resignation, and how Christ tries her beforehand in divers
   ways, and at last accepts her lovingly. Taken from these words--"Ecce
   sponsus venit, exite obviam ei" (Matt. xxv. 6).

   DEAR children, it may be now two years or more since I last preached. I
   spoke to you then of four-and-twenty Articles, and it was then my
   custom to speak much Latin, and to make many quotations; but I intend
   to do so no more, but if I wish to talk Latin, I will do so when the
   learned are present, who can understand it. For this time repeat only
   an Ave Maria to begin with, and pray for God's grace.

   Dear children, I have taken a text on which I mean to preach this
   sermon, and not to go beyond it: in the vulgar tongue it runs
   thus,--"Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him."

   The Bridegroom is our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Bride is the Holy
   Church and Christendom. Now we are all called brides of Christ,
   wherefore we ought to be willing to go forth and meet our Bridegroom;
   but, alas! we are not so. The true paths and straight highways by which
   to go out to meet the Bridegroom are, alas! nowadays quite deserted and
   falling into decay, till we have come hardly to perceive where they
   are; nay, this highway is to many quite strange and unknown, so that
   they do not go out to meet the Bridegroom, as they are in duty bound to
   do, of which I will speak another time, with God's help; but now, since
   we hear that we are all called brides, I will tell you somewhat
   concerning what the Bride must do in order to go and meet the
   Bridegroom.

   It is seemly that a faithful Bride should avoid everything that is
   displeasing to the Bridegroom, such as vain-glory, pride, envy, and all
   the other sins of this world, and all the delights of the body and the
   flesh, whether it be the ease and indulgence of the body, or other
   things which are beyond the necessaries of life. Further, it beseems a
   faithful Bride to be shamefaced. When this comes to pass, and the
   Bride, for her Bridegroom's sake, has despised and given up all these
   things, then she begins to be somewhat well-pleasing to the Bridegroom.

   But, if she desires to be yet more well-pleasing in His sight, she must
   humbly bow down before Him, and say with heart and lips, "Ah! my dear
   Lord and Bridegroom, Thou knowest all hearts. I have said to Thee, with
   my whole heart, that I desire to do all that I can and may, and to do
   it willingly, as far as Thou givest me to perceive through my
   conscience what is agreeable and well-pleasing to Thee." When the Bride
   makes this vow to the Bridegroom, He turneth himself and begins to look
   upon her. Then she beseeches Him to bestow upon her some gift as a
   token of love. What is the gift? It is that she is inwardly and
   outwardly beset with divers assaults, with which He is wont to endow
   his special friends.

   But if the Bride be as yet unaccustomed to suffer, she will say, "Ah!
   dear Lord and Bridegroom, this is very hard upon me; I greatly fear
   that I shall scarcely be able to endure it. Therefore, dear Lord and
   Bridegroom, I pray Thee to make my burden somewhat more tolerable, or
   else to take a part of it away." Then the Bridegroom answers, "Tell me
   then, dear Bride, should the Bride fare better than the Bridegroom has
   fared? If thou desirest to meet the Bridegroom, thou must imitate Him
   in some sort, and it is, moreover, reasonable that a faithful Bride
   should suffer somewhat with Him for her Bridegroom's sake." Now when
   the Bride heareth what is the will of her Bridegroom, and how grave a
   matter it is, she is sore affrighted, and says, "Dear Lord and
   Bridegroom, be not wroth with me, for I will gladly hearken unto Thee:
   appoint unto me what Thou wilt; I am willing to suffer all things with
   Thy help and in thy love." When the Bridegroom heareth this, He loveth
   the Bride yet better than He did before, and giveth her to drink of a
   still better cup. This cup is that she is to cease from all her own
   thoughts, and all her works and refrainings will give her no content,
   for she can take pleasure in nothing that is her own. However good the
   actions may be in themselves, she is always thinking how she shall
   anger her Bridegroom therewith, and feareth much that she will,
   perhaps, have to suffer a great punishment for them hereafter.
   Moreover, she is derided by all, and these things are accounted her
   folly.

   Now, children, by reason of all these things, her natural powers become
   wearied out and grow feeble, insomuch that she is constantly in fear
   lest she should not hold out to the end, but must die at last; and
   hereupon she is greatly terrified, for she is yet somewhat timorous and
   faint-hearted. Then she cries earnestly unto the Bridegroom, and says,
   "Ah! dear Lord and Bridegroom, how great are Thy terrors; know that I
   cannot endure them long: I must die." But the Bridegroom answers, "If
   thou wilt in truth go out to meet thy Bridegroom, it is fitting that
   thou should first tread some portion of the path that He has travelled.
   Now whereas the Bridegroom has suffered shame, hunger, cold, thirst,
   heat, and bitter pains, for three and thirty years, and at last a
   bitter death, for the Bride's sake, out of pure love, is it not just
   and right that the Bride should venture even her life for the
   Bridegroom's sake, out of love, and with all her heart? Verily, if thou
   hadst the right sort of love and true faithfulness unto thy Bridegroom,
   all thy fear would vanish."

   Then when she hears these words of the Bridegroom her whole heart is
   moved with fear, and she says, "Ah! dear Lord, I acknowledge in all
   sincerity that I have done wrong, and I am out of all measure terrified
   at it; I grieve from the bottom of my heart that I have not with a
   faithful heart yielded myself up unto Thee, even unto death. Dear Lord
   and Bridegroom, I here vow and promise to Thee surely that all which
   Thou willest I also will. Come sickness, come health, come pleasure or
   pain, sweet or bitter, cold or heat, wet or dry, whatever Thou willest,
   that do I also will; and desire altogether to come out from my own
   will, and to yield a whole and willing obedience unto Thee, and never
   to desire aught else either in will or thought: only let Thy will be
   accomplished in me, Thy poor unworthy creature, in time and in
   eternity. For, dear Lord, when I look at what I am, I am not worthy
   that the earth should bear me."

   Now when the Bridegroom seeth this entire and faithful will in the
   Bride, and her deep and thorough humility, what does He then do? His
   heart yearns over the Bride, and giveth her a very costly, noble, sweet
   cup to drink. What is this cup? It is that she suffers yet far more
   from all manner of temptation and tribulation than she has ever
   suffered before. And when the Bride perceiveth this, and seeth the
   Bridegroom's earnestness and good pleasure concerning her, she
   suffereth all these things willingly and gladly for the Bridegroom's
   sake, and boweth herself down humbly before Him, and saith, "Ah! dear
   Lord and Bridegroom, it is just and right that Thou shouldest not will
   as I will, but I desire and ought to will as Thou wilt; I receive this
   gift right willingly and gladly for Thy love from Thy divine hand,
   whether it be pleasant or painful to the flesh, I acquiesce wholly in
   it for love of Thee."

   Now when the Bridegroom, in His eternal wisdom, perceives this
   disposition within His humble Bride, and her thorough earnestness, she
   begins to grow precious to Him, and from hearty love He giveth her to
   suffer in all her nature, until the Bride is wholly purified from all
   faults and stain of sin, and become perfectly fair and unspotted. Then
   He says, "Now rise up, my beloved, my pleasant, my beautiful Bride, for
   Thou art pure and without spot, and altogether lovely in my eyes." Then
   He looks upon her with infinite, mighty, divine love. To this joyful
   high-tide cometh the Father of the Eternal Bridegroom, and saith to the
   Bride, "Rise up, my lovely, chosen beloved, it is time to go to
   Church," and He taketh the Bridegroom and the Bride, and leadeth them
   to the Church, and marries them to each other, and binds them together
   with divine love; yea, God doth bind them together in bonds so fast
   that they can never be parted again, either in time or eternity. And
   when, in these divine espousals, they have been made one, the
   Bridegroom saith, "O, beloved and Eternal Father, what shall be our
   wedding-gift?" And the Father saith, "The Holy Ghost, for that it is
   His office to be in the Father's stead." And He sheds forth upon the
   Bride the torrent of divine love, and this love flows out unto the
   Bridegroom, insomuch that the Bride loseth herself, and is intoxicated
   with love, so that she forgets herself and all creatures, in time or
   eternity, together with herself.

   Now he only who is bidden to such a spiritual, glorious marriage-feast,
   and has obeyed the call, does for the first time perceive and taste the
   real, true, blessed, gracious sweetness of the Holy Spirit. Now is this
   Bride a true worshipper, for she worshippeth the Father in the Holy
   Spirit. In this marriage-feast is joy upon joy, and therein is more
   peace and joy in one hour than all the creatures can yield in time or
   in eternity. The joy that the Bride hath with the Bridegroom is so vast
   that no senses or reason can apprehend or attain unto it."

   As the Doctor spoke these words a man cried out with a loud voice, "It
   is true!" and fell down as if he were dead. Then a woman called out
   from the crowd and said, "Master, leave off, or this man will die on
   your hands."

   Then the Master said, "Ah, dear children, and if the Bridegroom take
   the Bride and lead her home with Him, we will gladly yield her to Him;
   nevertheless, I will make an end and leave off. Dear children, let us
   all cry unto the Lord our God in Heaven. For verily we have all need so
   to do, seeing that, alas! we have grown so dull of hearing and foolish
   of heart that none of us has compassion on his fellow, although we
   confess that we are all called brothers and sisters. There be also few
   who are willing to fight their way against their own flesh, and follow
   the Bridegroom, in order to reach a nobler joy and a glorious
   wedding-feast.

   I give you to know that in these days those be few and far between who
   do truly go out to meet the Bridegroom, such as there were many in the
   olden time. Therefore it behoveth each one to look at himself and
   consider his ways with great earnestness. For the time is at hand--nay,
   it is already come--when it may be said of most who are now living
   here, that "they have eyes and see not, and ears that hear not." Dear
   children, let us all strive to enter into this wedding-feast, most rich
   in joy, and honour, and blessedness.

   But when the Bride departs from this marriage-feast and is left to
   herself, and beholds that she has come back again to this miserable
   earthly state, she says within herself, "O! poor miserable creature
   that I am, am I here again?" And she is sad in herself; nevertheless,
   she is so utterly resigned in boundless humility to her Bridegroom,
   that she in no wise may think of or desire His presence, because she
   deems herself wholly unworthy thereof. But the Bridegroom does not
   therefore forsake her, but looketh upon His Bride from time to time,
   because He well knoweth that none will or can comfort her, but He
   alone.

   And now that you have heard this, let it not surprise you that I have
   not told you how lovingly the Bridegroom talketh with the Bride. It
   might well happen that none would believe me (except such a one as had
   tried and tasted it himself), should I tell you what strange words the
   Bride saith to her Bridegroom. We find, too, in the Scriptures, that
   the loving soul ofttimes holds such converse with her Beloved as words
   cannot perfectly express. Nay, does it not happen every day with
   earthly lovers, that a bride and bridegroom talk together in such wise
   that if others heard it they would declare them mad or drunk?

   Now, dear children, I fear that I have kept you too long; but the time
   has not seemed long to me: also, I have said it all for your good, and
   could not well this time make my sermon shorter if I were rightly to
   explain my meaning; therefore receive it kindly.

   That we may all become real, true, perfect brides of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, and that we may in sincere, true, utter humility and
   resignation, go out to meet our glorious Bridegroom, and abide with Him
   for ever, may God help us, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
   Amen."

ELEVENTH CHAPTER

   Of a great prodigy that was wrought in certain persons through this
   sermon, as afterwards appeared, whereby we are given to understand what
   great wonders God works by good instruments, that is that He will do
   more by one sermon of an enlightened man than by a hundred others.

   WHEN this sermon was ended, the Master went down and read Mass, and
   gave the Lord's Body to certain good people; but after the sermon the
   man perceived that some forty people remained sitting in the
   churchyard. When Mass was over he told the Master of it, and they went
   out to where he had seen the people sitting that they might see how it
   was with them. But in the meantime, while the Master had been
   celebrating Mass, they had risen up and gone away, except twelve, who
   were still there. Then said the Master to the man, "Dear son, what dost
   thou think we had best do with these people?" Then the man went from
   one to another and touched them, but they lay as if they were dead, and
   scarcely moved. The Master knew not what to think of this strange
   thing, for he had never seen the like before, and so he said to the
   man, "Tell me, what dost thou think? Are the people alive or dead?"
   Then he smiled and said, "If they were dead, it would be your fault and
   the Bridegroom's; how then should you bring them round again?" The
   Master said, "But if the Bridegroom be with me in this business, ought
   I to awaken them?" The man answered, "Sir, these people are still in
   this present state, and I wish that you would ask the convent ladies to
   let them be carried into their cloister, that they may not take some
   sickness and harm to their bodies, by lying in the open air on the cold
   earth." And they did so; and the people were brought into a warm place.
   Then the convent ladies said, "Dear sir, we have a nun here to whom the
   same thing has happened, and she is lying on her bed as if she were
   dead." Then said the Master, "My dear daughters, be patient, for God's
   sake, and look to these sick people, and when any one of them comes to
   himself give him something warm to take; if he will have it; give it
   him in Christ's name." And the ladies said they would willingly do so.
   So the Master and the man went their way, and entered into the Master's
   cell. Then the man said, "Now, dear Master, what think you of this? Has
   the like ever happened to you in your life before? Now I wot you see
   what wonders God works with good tools. Dear sir, I perceive that this
   sermon will stir many, and one will tell it to another. If it please
   you, methinks it were well that you let these sick children rest for
   awhile, for this sermon will give them plenty to digest for some time,
   and if you think it good, and God give you so to do, that you preach a
   sermon also to those who are in the world, seeing it is now Lent." And
   the Master did so gladly, and preached also to those who were in the
   world, to the great amendment of certain of them. [5]

   most of his sermons, and have nothing whatever to do with the progress
   of the story, I have judged it best to omit them.--Tr.

FOURTEENTH CHAPTER

   How this holy Doctor came to his end, and afterward appeared to his
   dear friend the layman, and showed him the cause of his painful
   departure from this world, to wit that it had been his purgatory, after
   which he attained great joy and eternal blessedness, which were given
   him by God as the reward of his good and faithful teaching.

   NOW you must know that the Master made progress in the divine life, and
   received such wisdom, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, that he preached
   both to clergy and laity, and came to be held in such esteem and honour
   throughout the land, and also in that city, that whenever the people
   had any weighty matter to transact, he was called in to settle it with
   his wisdom, whether it concerned spiritual or temporal affairs, and
   whatever he counselled them was right in their eyes, and they hearkened
   unto him gladly. And after that the Master had led this faithful life
   full eight years, God would not leave His servant longer in this
   earthly misery, and saw fit to take him to Himself without purgatory.
   Wherefore He sent His judgments upon him, and visited him with
   sickness, so that the Master kept his bed for more than twenty weeks,
   and his sufferings were very sore, and his pains grievous. Then he
   perceived, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, that he was about to depart
   from this world (God was minded to reward him for his work); wherefore
   he sent for the man, his dear friend, and begged him to come to him,
   for he expected not to be much longer in this world. And the man
   hearkened and came to the Master, who received him after a most
   friendly sort; and the man was glad that he found him yet alive, and
   said, "Dear Master, how fares it with you?" The Master said, "I believe
   that the time is very near when God purposes to take me from this
   world, for which cause, dear son, it is a great consolation to me that
   thou art present at my end. I pray thee take these books which are
   lying there: thou wilt find written therein all thy discourse with me
   aforetime, and also my answers, and thou wilt find somewhat concerning
   my life, and the dealings of God with me His poor unworthy servant.
   Dear son, if thou think fit, and if God give thee grace, make a little
   book of it." Then said the man, "Dear Master, I have written down five
   of these sermons, and if it please you, I will write them out also, and
   will make a little book about you." Quoth the Master, "Dear son, I lay
   upon thee my most solemn admonition, that thou write nothing about me,
   and that thou do not mention my name; for thou must know that of a
   truth the life, and words, and works which God has wrought through me a
   poor, unworthy, sinful man are not mine, but belong to God Almighty,
   now and for evermore; therefore, dear son, if thou wilt write it down
   for the profit of our fellow-Christians, write it so that neither my
   name nor thine be named, but thou mayst say the Master and the man.
   Moreover, thou shalt not suffer the book to be read or seen by any one
   in this town, lest he should mark that it was I, but take it home with
   thee to thy own country, and let it not come out during my life."

   And for a space of eleven days the Master held much discourse with the
   man. After that, the time came that the Master should die. Then he
   said, "Dear son, I pray thee, in God's name, to give thy consent to it,
   if God should permit my spirit to come back to thee, and tell thee how
   it fared with me." The man answered, "Dear Master, if God will have it
   so, I am also willing." But it came to pass that at the last the Master
   had a most horrible and frightful death-struggle, insomuch that all the
   brethren in the convent, and also other people, were greatly terrified
   and distressed thereat, and were sore amazed at the dreadful anguish
   that they saw in his death.

   Now when he was dead, all who were in the convent and the city were
   filled with sorrow. But when they perceived who was the man that had
   been so long his bosom-friend in secret, they came and desired to show
   him honour, and besought him to be their guest. But when he was aware
   of their intent, he fled that same hour out of the city, and travelled
   home again. And as he was on the way, the third day after the Master's
   death, at nightfall he was passing through a little village with his
   servant, and seeing a nobleman go past along the road, he said to him,
   "My friend, is there any inn in this village?" The nobleman answered,
   "No." Then said the man, "Then show us the kindness, dear friend, in
   God's name, to let us lodge in thy house for to-night, and take for it
   what thou wilt." Then he said, "If you will put up with such things as
   we have, I will willingly lodge you, and give you the best in my
   power." So he took him home with him. When it was night he laid the man
   upon a feather-bed, and showed the servant into the barn to lie upon
   the straw. Now in the night the man awoke and heard a voice close by;
   yet he saw no one. Then a shudder ran through him, and he made the sign
   of the Cross. Then the, voice said, "Fear not, dear son, it is I, the
   Master." Then said the man, "Dear Master, is it you? Then I beseech
   you, with my whole heart, to tell me, if God will, how it standeth with
   you, and how it came to pass that you had such a dreadful end; for your
   brethren in the convent were much astonied at you, and it is to be
   feared that your frightful end will be a great stumbling-block to your
   own brethren in the convent." Then said the Master's voice, "Dear son,
   that will I tell thee. Thou must know that our Lord God saw fit to
   appoint me such a hard death in order that the holy angels might
   straightway receive my soul to themselves; and for the same cause thou
   shalt also have such a like hard death. It was needful that I should
   suffer this as a purgatory; but know likewise, my dear son, that the
   evil spirits tormented me greatly, and assailed me with such cunning
   and instancy, that I was in constant fear lest my courage should fail
   me. But, however hard my death was, it was as nothing compared to the
   joy which the Almighty, Eternal, and Merciful God hath given me in
   return. Know, dear son, that the same hour in which my soul left my
   body, the blessed angels received it, and conducted me to Paradise, and
   said to me, Here shalt thou tarry five days, and shalt know no anxiety
   or fear lest the evil spirits should harm thee any more, neither shalt
   thou labour any more, only thou shalt be deprived for these five days
   of the blissful company of the blessed in eternity. And then we will
   come again with joy, and bring thee to the unspeakable joys, and reward
   thee for thy good and faithful teaching and useful counsels;' all which
   I have received by thy excellent instruction, for the which I can never
   thank God and thee enough."

   Then said the man: "Dear Master, I beseech you from the bottom of my
   heart that when you come into the presence of God, you pray Him for
   me." But whatever the man said after this, or whatever questions he
   put, no one answered him again. Then he would fain have slept, and
   turned from one side to the other; but it availed him nothing: he got
   no more rest that night, and could hardly wait till it was light. And
   at daybreak he rose up, and wrote that same hour word to the Prior and
   brethren of all things that the spirit had said to him, and returned to
   his own house, and came also to a good and blessed end.

   That we may all follow the pattern of our Lord Jesus Christ, insomuch
   that after this miserable life and this transitory world we may come to
   eternal and never-ending joys,--to God and His chosen and beloved
   friends, may He help us, God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
   Amen!

   Here endeth the History of the Life of the enlightened Doctor John
   Tauler.

Introductory Notice

  respecting

Tauler's Life and Times

  By the Translator.


   JOHN TAULER, who appears as "the Master" in the foregoing History, was
   born at Strasburg in the year 1290. His father was most probably
   Nicolas Tauler, whose name occurs among those of the senators of
   Strasburg in 1313. At all events, he belonged to a tolerably wealthy
   family, and might have lived on his patrimony since he tells us in one
   of his sermons: "Had I known when I lived as my father's son, all that
   I know now, I would have lived on his heritage and not upon alms." He
   devoted himself, however, in early years to a clerical life, and
   entered the Dominican Order in Strasburg, taking up his abode in the
   handsome, spacious convent belonging to that Order, the church of which
   was consecrated in the year 1308. A sister of his was a nun in the
   convent of St. Nicolas at Krautenau, likewise belonging to the
   Dominican Order. In what year Tauler renounced the world cannot be
   determined with precision, but there can be little doubt that he did so
   at the same time with his friend John von Dambach, in 1308. From
   allusions in his writings, it seems probable that he soon after, with
   the same friend, betook himself to Paris, the great metropolis of
   Christian learning in that age, in order to study theology in the
   famous Dominican College of St. Jacques, from which the monks of that
   Order were called Jacobins in France.

   The University concentrated within its precincts representatives of the
   varied intellectual tendencies of the age. Up to the middle of the
   thirteenth century, it had been distinguished by the freedom of thought
   which prevailed among its teachers, unshackled as they were by any
   episcopal, almost by any regal jurisdiction over their doctrine, and
   acknowledging only the authority of the Pope himself, directly
   exercised. The influence of the all-questioning Abelard, the subtle
   Gilbert de la Por√©e, the pantheistic Amaury de Bene, and other
   free-thinking teachers, was not extinct, though they lay under the
   censure of heresy. The works of Aristotle, condemned in 1209, had been
   gradually introduced into the schools, with the Arabian commentaries of
   Avicenna and Averrhoes. The Dominican Order, founded for the
   extirpation of heresy, early recognised the prime necessity of
   providing instruction which should purify the streams of human thought
   at their fountain-head; and in spite of the opposition raised by the
   heads of the University, succeeded, in 1228, in establishing
   theological chairs in their convent in Paris, from which to combat the
   heathenising philosophers of Christendom with their own weapons of
   reason; and in Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas they may be said to
   have reconquered philosophy for the Church, and Christianised
   Aristotle, who thenceforth became the established master of philosophy,
   but was studied through the commentaries of the great Dominican
   luminary.

   But the colossal volumes of the schoolmen, embracing as they did within
   the vast sweep of their speculation disquisitions upon the nature of
   the Godhead, upon the universe of superhuman intelligence revealed by
   the pseudo-Dionysius, and upon the nature of man and matter,--while
   affording a tremendous gymnastic discipline to the human intellect,
   were barren in actual practical results, and might well be
   unsatisfactory to one whose soul craved to be something more than a
   logical athlete. And it is evident that, in his later life, Tauler did
   not look back upon the scholastic theology which he studied during his
   sojourn in Paris as having taught him that which answered to the needs
   of his spirit. Thus, in one passage of his sermons he says: "These
   great masters of Paris do read vast books, and turn over the leaves
   with great diligence, which is a very good thing; but these
   [spiritually enlightened men] read the true living book, wherein all
   things live: they turn over the pages of the heavens and the earth, and
   read therein the mighty and admirable wonders of God." He seldom cites
   any of the schoolmen in his writings, with the exception of "Master
   Thomas;" but he not unfrequently refers to Aristotle, under the title
   of the "Natural Master," or the "Master of Nature." The authors who
   seem to have had the greatest attraction for him, and whom he must have
   early made the subject of his study, judging from the acquaintance with
   them displayed in his writings, and the little leisure which he could
   have had for such pursuits during the busy activity of his later years,
   were the more mystical and speculative among the ecclesiastical
   writers, the pseudo-Dionysius, the Monks of the school of St. Victor,
   St. Bernard, and above all St. Augustine. Neither was he a stranger to
   the Neo-platonists,--Proclus is referred to several times in his
   writings.

   While the whole bent of Tauler's mind thus appears to have disposed him
   to contemplation on the great spiritual questions immediately affecting
   man's actual destiny, rather than more purely intellectual theses, he
   must, on returning from Paris to Strasburg, have come in contact with
   several of the mystical teachers whom we know to have flourished there
   about this time, and who certainly cannot have been without influence
   on the course of his mental development. The most eminent of these was
   the celebrated Master Eckart, a brother of his own Order, who, after
   having filled the important offices of Provincial in Saxony and
   Vicar-General in Bohemia, had returned to Strasburg, where, with the
   earnestness of profound conviction, he was now discoursing to the
   people in their native tongue, on lofty philosophical themes, till then
   only deemed fit to be treated of in Latin before learned assemblies;
   and which he handled in a way that he himself confesses to be contrary
   to what any of the Masters had taught hitherto. Yet it is clear, from
   the accusations afterwards brought against him of misleading the
   vulgar, that the metaphysical speculations which form the staple of his
   sermons, though they would seem to us utterly beyond the range of
   ordinary thinkers, must have touched some chords in the hearts of the
   multitude, expressed as they are, not only in a sharp, clear, forcible
   style, but often clothed in a thoroughly popular form, and illustrated
   by metaphors appealing to the eye, and allegorical interpretations of
   Scripture histories. [6]

   The man himself and his doctrines were equally calculated to make a
   powerful impression on the mind of the youthful Tauler, already
   dissatisfied with the frigid subtleties of the dialecticians, and
   arriving at an age when he was called on to exercise his vocation as a
   preaching friar in times of extraordinary commotion and perplexity.

   Eckart's keen and soaring intellect had been trained by a close study
   of the Fathers and the Schoolmen before he became a professor in the
   convent at St. Jacques at Paris, in which position he soon acquired no
   ordinary fame; being esteemed (according to the statement of the Abbot
   Trithemius in his great encyclop√¶dia of ecclesiastical writers) "the
   most learned man of his day in the Aristotelian philosophy." The vivid
   remembrance of such a master would be still lingering in the hearts of
   many pupils when Tauler came to Paris; though Eckart himself must have
   quitted his professorship some years before, as, on account of the
   severity of his morals and the firmness of his character, he was
   appointed, in 1304, Provincial of the Dominican Order in Saxony, where
   he laboured with such success in the restoration of discipline, that
   three years later he was made Vicar-General of Saxony, with the express
   commission to undertake any improvements and reforms in the Order that
   he might judge necessary. In this new sphere of action, likewise, he
   soon became celebrated as a preacher and metaphysical teacher. From
   this date, when he was held in reverence by the Church, he disappears
   from our view for a space of some years; after which we find him in
   Strasburg, divested of his dignities, but preaching with great effect
   his peculiar doctrines, now in his mature life elaborated into a system
   which has been claimed by Hegel and some of his disciples as the parent
   of the German philosophy. [7] To say whether this claim is just would
   require a knowledge of Hegel and his school, which I do not possess.
   [8] That which was the aim of all Eckart's reasonings, to which all
   else was but a means, was the perfect repose of a spirit in absolute
   union with God, and dwelling in a region far above the clouds and
   tempests of this changeful, barren life of sense. He himself appears to
   have attained in a high degree to this state of abiding peace; yet his
   writings are pervaded by a strain of deep lamentation over the
   imperfections of this earthly sphere, and the misery arising from a
   sense of separation from God. In fact, he certainly retains a positive
   and vivid sense of the nature of sin; whether this be consistent with
   Pantheism or Hegelianism, I leave those better qualified to judge. In
   the passionate endeavour to free himself from the entanglements of the
   creature, and to enter into living union with God, he, however,
   undoubtedly does not escape the danger of merging created existence in
   the one uncreated Essence which alone has true Being, and forgetting
   the limits that bar our approach to the Infinite. Thus he says; "That
   word, I am, can none truly speak but God alone." "He has the Substance
   of all creatures in Himself; He is a being that has all Being in
   Himself." "All things are in God, and all things are God." "All
   creatures in themselves are naught; all creatures are a speaking of
   God." "Dost thou ask me what was the purpose of the Creator when He
   made the creatures? I answer, Repose. Dost thou ask again what all
   creatures seek in their spontaneous aspiration? I answer again, Repose.
   Dost thou ask a third time what the soul seeks in all her motions? I
   answer, Repose. Consciously or unconsciously all creatures seek their
   proper state. The stone cannot cease moving till it touch the earth;
   the fire rises up to heaven: thus a loving soul can never rest but in
   God, and so we say God has given to all things their proper place,--to
   the fish the water, to the bird the air, to the beast the earth, to the
   soul the Godhead." "Simple people conceive that we are to see God, as
   if He stood on that side and we on this. It is not so; God and I are
   one in the act of my perceiving Him." "O noble soul, put on these wings
   to thy feet and rise above all creatures, and above thine own reason,
   and above the angelic choirs, and above the light that has given thee
   strength, and throw thyself upon the heart of God; there shalt thou lie
   hidden from all creatures." But if, in thus denying a separate
   existence to the creature, he uses expressions which logically conduct
   to Pantheism, on the other hand his God is clearly a living God; not a
   mere object of philosophical thought, but an actual and working
   reality. [9] So, again, some of his expressions might seem to imply
   Antinomianism, as when he says: "Whenever a man enters into this union
   with God, that God is so dear to him that he forgets himself, nor seeks
   himself either in time or in eternity, so oft does he become free from
   all his sins and all his purgatory, though he should have committed all
   the sins of all mankind:" and we can hardly doubt, from what we read of
   the Brethren of the Free Spirit, that some did abuse Eckart's doctrine
   of the inward freedom of the spirit to justify sin in pretenders to
   piety. But it does not seem that even his enemies ever doubted of his
   own high morality; while Qu√©tif and Echard, in their Scriptores ordinis
   Pr√¶dicatorum, praise him as a virum moribus et scientia probatissimum,
   omni laude superiorem, and add that a hundred years after him a brother
   of his Order says of him, that he was vita purissimus, expedites Doctor
   Ecclesi√¶, suo tempore incomparabilis eruditione, fide, conversatione et
   moribus insignis.

   Eckart always endeavours to bring his speculations into combination
   with the theology of the Church; but the interpretation which he puts
   upon the received dogmas often deviates widely from their spirit. [10]
   He evidently regards, nay, openly proclaims outward rites and
   observances as not necessary to the essence of piety. Traces of his
   familiarity with the Schoolmen may be found in his subtile and often
   purely formal distinctions and syllogisms; but their spirit was utterly
   repugnant to his. On this point Professor Schmidt says:--"Regarding
   Neoplatonism as by no means incompatible with Christianity, his
   philosophical views resemble in their general tendency those of
   Dionysius Areopagita, combining with them the mystical elements
   contained in the writings of St. Augustine. The theory of that great
   Father respecting the total corruption of human nature does not,
   however, occur in his writings in the sense in which it is understood
   by the Church. With Plato himself he is not unacquainted, but cites him
   several times, calling him the great Parson' (Der grosse Pfaffe).
   Scotus Erigena, the translator of the Platonizing Dionysius, though not
   named in his writings, must be regarded as furnishing the starting
   point for his theories. Of the other mystics of the middle ages he only
   names St. Bernard. But he has not rested within the systems advanced by
   any of the philosophers he studied; he made all the ideas that he may
   have derived from them his own, and gave them a further development, so
   that his position is that of a thoroughly original thinker."

   After preaching some time in Strasburg, Eckart appears to have removed
   to Cologne. It is not known whether or not he had found it necessary to
   leave the former city; but it seems not improbable that he may have
   fallen under accusation of heresy there, from the circumstance that
   many of the propositions condemned, by the Bishop (John of Ochsenstein)
   in 1317, as the doctrines of the Strasburg Beghards, agree, often word
   for word, with propositions to be found in Eckart's writings. In
   Cologne he preached publicly for a few years in the church of his
   convent, and taught in the university; but he was not suffered to
   remain long unmolested. The way in which his writings were used by the
   Beghards, who were condemned by the Archbishop of Cologne in 1322,
   appears to have drawn the attention of the latter to his preaching. He
   cited Eckart to appear before him, and accused him of heresy; but as
   Eckart refused to submit to his sentence, and continued to preach, the
   Archbishop appealed to the Pope. His writings were at length condemned
   in a bull dated March 1329, from which it appears that he was then no
   more, as it is stated that he had returned to the Catholic faith before
   his death. It seems utterly inconsistent with the deep conviction that
   pervades his writings, and the inflexibility of his character, to
   suppose that he should have recanted any of his doctrines; but probably
   he merely expressed his adherence to the doctrines of the Church, which
   he never seems to have intended to impugn, but to place upon what he
   regarded as their true foundation. He never separated from the
   communion of the Church, and gathered round him in Cologne a circle of
   ardent admirers, among whom was probably Tauler [11] (who seems to have
   often visited Cologne), and certainly Suso, whose biographer relates:
   "After these dreadful sufferings (of conscience) had lasted near upon
   ten years, . . . he came to the holy Master Eckart, and told him of his
   pain, . . . and the Doctor helped him out of it." [12]

   Tauler's influence upon his countrymen has been so much more powerful
   and enduring than that of Eckart, that he has often been called
   erroneously the first of the German Mystics, and Eckart represented as
   his pupil. While, however, in his general cast of thought and language,
   Tauler bears traces of Eckart's influence, his views do not appear at
   any period to have been identical with those of his forerunner. Though
   inclined to speculation, his whole turn of mind and character was more
   practical than that of Eckart, and his attention more directed to the
   application of religious principles to real life. Even the sermon
   which, as we have read, he preached before the remarkable change
   wrought in him through the agency of the great Layman, though
   displaying more formality and subtlety with less of tenderness,
   unction, and spirituality than generally characterize his later
   sermons, is yet far less abstruse and metaphysical, and has far more
   bearing upon morals and life, than is the case with Eckart's
   discourses.

   There was, however, another famous Dominican preacher at Strasburg, in
   Tauler's youthful days, Nicolas of Strasburg, who though also a mystic,
   and possessing a very powerful intellect, was a man of a very different
   stamp from Eckart, and who appears to have always stood in high favour
   with the heads of the Church. He was the author of several works, and
   was appointed by Pope John XXII. Nuncio, with the oversight of all the
   Dominican convents in the province of Germany. I have not had the
   opportunity of reading any of his productions; Professor Schmidt
   describes his preaching as less speculative and much more popular,
   intelligible, and practical than Eckart's, and says that "his sermons
   are rather mystical and ascetic than, strictly speaking, metaphysical;
   they breathe a profound yearning after inward peace and a glowing love
   to God, but do not display an intellect so lofty as that of the great
   mystic." That he was, however, a man of extraordinary learning is
   evinced by a work which he wrote on the coming of Anti-Christ, and the
   second Advent of Our Lord, in order to prove that the numerous legends
   and prophecies current in that age, as in all times of great calamity
   and mighty convulsions, were unworthy of credit, and that nothing
   positive was to be learnt from Holy Scripture respecting the date of
   future events. [13]

   There were many other mystics in Strasburg at this date, of whom
   nothing is known beyond their names, but this very fact is sufficient
   to prove the wide diffusion of such doctrines in that city. The same
   phenomenon also meets us in a heretical guise, among the fanatical
   Beghards who since the close of the thirteenth century had filled the
   Rhenish provinces with their doctrines of the absolute freedom of the
   spirit, and the abolition of all distinctions between the Creator and
   the creature. They were denominated (most likely by the title of their
   own choosing) the Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit, and made
   proselytes equally among the laity and clergy. In the year 1317, Bishop
   Ochsenstein complains that Alsace was full of them, and in a circular
   to the clergy of his diocese, he condemns the mystical and pantheistic
   doctrines of this sect, whose members were given over to the secular
   authorities, and by them apparently punished with imprisonment. Whether
   or no Eckart was connected with them, they do not seem to have
   exercised any influence upon Tauler; for in his sermons he repeatedly
   inveighs against "The Free Spirits," who he says, "striving after a
   false freedom, and on pretext of following the inward light, follow
   only the inclinations of their own nature."

   But besides the Beghards, there were still lingering in Southern
   Germany and Italy, remains of the Albigenses and Waldenses and
   Manichean Cathari,--reverers of the Abbot Joachim's Eternal Gospel of
   the Holy Ghost (that was to overthrow the Gospel of the
   Son),--believers in the visions of the Prophetess Hildegard,--adherents
   of the revolutionary Oliva and Fra Dolcino. There were, indeed, many
   reasons why heresies and religious divisions should abound in these
   regions at this period. Not only was the German Empire, as we shall
   soon see, torn by political dissensions, which in many ways were
   interwoven with the religious controversies then afloat, but there was
   variance between the heads of the Church and its most efficient
   servants,--the devoted, hard-working, enthusiastic Franciscans. The two
   Mendicant Orders were formed to reclaim for the Papacy her empire over
   the human mind, which in the twelfth century was threatened on the one
   hand by the moral purity and elevation of the Albigenses, who almost
   occupied the fairest provinces of France, on the other by the learning
   and civilisation no less than the arms of the Mahometan infidels; and
   faithfully had they accomplished their vocation, by turns refuting
   heretics by their learning or dazzling them by miracles, outshining
   them in ascetic purity, crushing them by the Inquisition, or winning
   them by self-devoted charity. While the higher ecclesiastics, above all
   the Papal court, were enormously wealthy, and, with few exceptions,
   absorbed in secular objects and pleasures,--the parochial clergy
   likewise often worldly and vicious, generally ignorant and inert,--the
   wandering friars came among the neglected flocks, roused them from the
   sleep of sin, reclaimed the vicious, convinced the scoffer, brought
   hope to the wretched, consolation to the sick and dying; and, as a
   natural result, the people were eager to express their gratitude by
   placing their property in the hands of the Order which had shown such
   zeal for their souls. And thus, though forbidden by their original
   constitution to hold property, in a few years the amount of wealth
   which they accumulated from the bequests of the dying was so large as
   to excite the jealousy of the regular clergy, already irritated by the
   friars' denunciation of worldliness, and the tacit censure of
   themselves implied in the ascetic lives and burning zeal of their
   rivals, and they repeatedly demanded the suppression of the two Orders.

   But within the Orders themselves had soon sprung up the old strife and
   division that seems to threaten the life of all spiritual organizations
   in the second generation, arising from the innate antagonism between
   the self-indulgence, prudence, and acquisitiveness inherent in human
   nature, and the pure but unreasoning spiritual impulses to which they
   have owed their existence. The Dominicans, with their characteristic
   address, retained the conflicting elements within their own bosom, and
   equally availed themselves of fervent piety or worldly power. The
   Franciscans, more enthusiastic and less far-sighted, divided into two
   parties,--those who consented to hold property in trust for the See of
   Rome, and those termed Spiritual Franciscans, who adhered rigidly to
   the literal interpretation of their rule of absolute poverty. From the
   latter sprang numerous spiritual and mystical sects, differing in their
   tenets, but all coinciding in their fervid faith and their inculcation
   of poverty and asceticism, all democratic as regarded hierarchical
   authority, and many involving all the wealthy and noble in their hatred
   to wealth and power. Doctrines of this kind were indeed sure to find
   acceptance among the oppressed serfs and lower classes in general; and
   by their very essence the Franciscans had entirely cast in their lot
   with the people. Among these sects the Fraticelli, who flourished at
   the beginning of this century, foretold the overthrow of the corrupt
   and carnal Papacy, and the establishment of a spiritual kingdom ruled
   over by "the Perfect." The eremitical Coelestines, the charitable
   Beguines, who originally devoted themselves to works of mercy, the
   devotional Lollards, nay, probably the brethren and sisters of the Free
   Spirit, seem also to have been offshoots from these Spiritual
   Franciscans.

   The Pope now ruling had, however, put himself in opposition with those
   of the Spiritual party who remained within the bounds of their Order,
   and were guilty of no heresy but that of asserting the absolute poverty
   of Christ and His Apostles. He deposed the General of the Order, and
   caused the inmates of many convents to be persecuted for maintaining a
   doctrine which struck at the root of the Papal authority. In return,
   they boldly denounced the Pope as a heretic, and became important
   auxiliaries to the Emperor Louis IV. in that long struggle which
   occupies the period we are considering. They found powerful coadjutors
   in the profoundly learned and able politicians,--William of Ockham and
   Marsilio of Padua, whose writings taught men to investigate the origin
   of the Papal power. But not only from the princes with whom the Pope
   interfered, and the miserable populace whose passions were at the mercy
   of fanatical preachers or demagogues; from the burghers in the cities
   there also arose a strenuous opposition to the outrageous claims and
   the arbitrary tyranny of the hierarchy. This class had long been rising
   in wealth and importance; and in the earlier half of this fourteenth
   century they succeeded in obtaining a share of the government in nearly
   all the chief cities of Germany; and the men who had emancipated
   themselves from the temporal rule of the Bishop and his aristocracy,
   and were rejoicing in the fresh air of freedom and the sense of
   manhood, were not inclined to follow any longer blindly and
   unquestioningly their spiritual masters.

   With the double election of Frederic of Austria and Louis of Bavaria,
   who were both crowned on the 25th of November 1314, at Aix-la-Chapelle,
   began a desolating warfare, which lasted for eight years, till the
   Battle of Muehldorf in 1322 left Frederic a prisoner in the hands of
   Louis. Strasburg was divided between the rival Emperors. The Bishop and
   the important family of the Zorn were adherents of Frederic; but the no
   less important family of the Muellenheim declared for Louis; and the
   latter had the greater part of the citizens on their side. Thus, when
   Frederic ascended the Rhine and arrived in Strasburg in January 1315,
   he was not received as their sovereign by the citizens, but merely
   treated as an illustrious guest; while, on the contrary, the Bishop and
   clergy paid him regal honours, which procured them various proofs of
   his favour. Louis, on hearing in his camp at Spires the conduct of the
   citizens, confirmed the liberties and privileges of the city. When,
   five years later, in August 1320, Louis came with his army to
   Strasburg, the burghers solemnly tendered him allegiance in the
   cathedral, in return for which he again confirmed their privileges; but
   the clergy had suspended the offices of public worship, and the greater
   part of the nobles still sided with them. On the captivity of Frederic,
   most of the imperial cities of Alsace came over to Louis; but this did
   not restore concord to the afflicted land: for Pope John XXII., bent
   upon the humiliation of Louis, whose popularity and power were such as
   threatened to render him too independent of the Holy See, now
   interfered in the affairs of the Empire, and by his persistent refusal
   to acknowledge Louis, brought down unspeakable calamities on Europe,
   while he stirred up the people to a resistance which could not but in
   the end prove fatal to their reverence for the Papal Chair. So long as
   the strife lasted between Frederic and Louis, John XXII., while
   claiming it as his right to decide between them, had refrained from
   pronouncing any actual decision for either party; but as soon as the
   former was subdued, and there was a prospect of peace, he instituted a
   process against the victorious Louis for assuming the title of King of
   the Romans before receiving the Papal sanction, admonished him to lay
   down all his powers, and forbade his subjects to render further fealty
   to him. But when in the following year it appeared that the real object
   of the Pope was to depose Louis altogether, and raise the King of
   France to the throne, the Diet assembled at Frankfurt declared almost
   unanimously for their brave Emperor, in defiance of the unrighteous
   claims of the Romish See. The Pope in return laid all who had
   acknowledged Louis under interdict in July 1324, from which some places
   were not released for six-and-twenty years. It must not be forgotten
   what this sentence involved, how intimately its consequences were felt
   in every parish and every home, when the churches stood silent and
   empty for years, the lawless and wicked were left unwarned, and the
   pious deprived of the consolation of worship and the holy communion
   during all this most dark and troubled period. But, in spite of its
   terrors, the German people, and even the greater part of the clergy,
   took part with their princes, with the exception, however, of the
   Bishops of Passau and Strasburg. The city of Strasburg, however,
   remained faithful to Louis, resisting by force the officers who
   attempted to proclaim the Papal fulmination against the Emperor, and
   sending troops to his assistance. The Bishop John von Ochsenstein died
   in 1338; but his successor, Berthold von Bucheke, trod in his
   footsteps. Strasburg itself, like most of the German cities, took but
   little heed of the Interdict and the repeated sentences of
   excommunication hurled against Louis by the Pope. The internal division
   still continued, headed by the two families of Zorn and Muellenheim,
   till in 1332 a sanguinary contest took place, which resulted in the
   overthrow of the old constitution of the city, and the introduction of
   the craftsmen into the Senate. But the new magistrates and the Bishop
   remained as much at variance as ever. In 1338, the latter induced his
   Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Mayence, to convene an assembly of
   German Bishops at Spires, from which the prelates despatched an address
   to the Pope Benedict XII., earnestly beseeching him to be reconciled
   with Louis, and put an end to this lamentable state of discord. Their
   petition was supported by envoys from the Estates of the Empire, moved
   thereto by Louis, who declared himself ready to yield all obedience to
   the Holy See which was consistent with God's glory, his own just right,
   and the weal of the Empire. But as, in spite of these and similar
   efforts, the Pope continued to prescribe conditions which made a
   reconciliation impossible, the Bishop of Strasburg continued to
   withstand the Emperor, and do all that lay in his power to injure the
   imperial cause in Alsace. Louis now resolved to resort to decisive
   measures against this restless adversary, and in 1329 commanded the
   Rhenish cities to join the Duke Rudolf of Bavaria and Conrad Lord of
   Kinkel, in attacking Berthold. The latter, having for allies the Duke
   of Austria, the Count of Wurtemberg, the Bishop of Basle, and other
   nobles, took the field, beleaguered several cities of Alsace, and laid
   waste the surrounding country: his opponents carried reprisals into his
   territories. Strasburg, wearied out with the misery caused by this
   never-ceasing contention, at length declared to the Bishop that it
   would no longer yield him obedience unless he made peace with the
   Emperor; and the Prelate, whose arms had moreover met with reverses,
   and whose finances were exhausted, fearing lest the other towns of his
   diocese should follow the example of Strasburg, resolved to do homage
   to Louis and receive investiture from him, under the reservation of
   absolute obedience to the Pope, while he sent an envoy to Benedict XII.
   representing his desperate condition, and requesting permission to
   sheathe the sword. Both Emperor and Pope conceded his requests; and
   from this time forward he did all that he could to maintain
   tranquillity within his bishopric, which was the more necessary, as the
   controversy between the Empire and the Papacy grew more envenomed.

   After the famous meeting of the Electoral College at Rhense, near
   Coblenz, in July 1338, had declared that the King of the Romans
   received his dignity and power solely from the free choice of the
   Electors, and the Imperial Diet, held immediately after, had made it a
   fundamental law of the Empire, that "the imperial dignity is bestowed
   directly by God, and he who has been legitimately chosen by the
   Electoral Princes, becomes thereby King and Emperor without further
   confirmation by the Pope or any other,"--Louis published a Manifesto to
   all Christendom, refuting at full length the accusations brought
   against him by the previous Pope, and proving that the Pope has no
   authority to sit in judgment on the Emperor. He further commanded that
   none should observe the papal excommunication and interdict, and
   sentenced all those, whether individuals or whole cities and
   communities, who should continue to submit to the bann, to be deprived
   of their rights and liberties.

   Great was the impression made by this bold Edict upon the German
   people, who rallied more and more universally around the Emperor who
   thus defended his own rights and the honour of the Empire. But concord
   was banished further than ever, for the clergy in many cases resisted
   the Emperor's command to resume the services which had been so long
   suspended, while the citizens, who had borne with impatience their
   terrible deprivation of the sacred rites, now on the strength of the
   Edict issued orders that all the clergy who refused to perform service
   should be banished. Many priests left their churches and removed into
   other provinces, numerous convents stood empty of their inmates; still
   in most places there remained a sufficient number of priests and monks
   to fulfil the duties of their vocation. This was the case in Strasburg;
   the city had already suffered all the calamities consequent on the
   Interdict: the clergy had split into two parties; the larger number
   obeyed the Pope's commands; the Augustinians especially had for many
   years suspended the performance of all religious services. The
   Dominicans and the Franciscans had availed themselves of the privilege
   early granted to their Orders of celebrating mass during a time of
   interdict. But now, when the Emperor so openly set himself in
   opposition to the Pope, they too, terrified by the sentence of
   excommunication hanging over them, refused in many instances to say
   mass, on which the Senate of Strasburg proclaimed:--


   "Either let them go on to sing,

   Or out of the city let them spring."

   The Dominicans in general quitted the city, and Koenigshofen relates in
   his Chronicle, that they left their convent standing empty for more
   than two years; but no doubt many of the democratical Franciscans, who
   had always supported the Emperor, remained behind. They were, however,
   as we shall see, exceptions in these Orders to the general rule, which
   shows to how great an extent the brethren must have been guided by
   their individual conscience rather than their corporate organization.

   Such were the scenes amidst which Tauler was called to labour as a
   Christian minister and Dominican monk. Of the manner in which he
   fulfilled his work, and the vicissitudes of his personal career,
   history has preserved but a small number of facts, but these, though
   few, are significant. All the testimonies that have come down to us
   respecting him, concur in bearing witness to the universal affection
   and esteem with which he was regarded. Even so far distant as Italy his
   name was known as a teacher of high repute, who insisted on inward
   piety. The famous Brother Venturini, of Bergamo, who was residing at
   that time under disgrace in a convent at Marveges, names him in a
   letter which he writes to another Dominican in Strasburg, Egenolph von
   Ehenheim, calling him his beloved John Tauler, and wishing to enter
   into correspondence with him, because he perceives that "through him
   and others the name of Christ will be spread abroad, ever more and
   more, throughout Germany." Egenolph himself was one of these "others,"
   who were fellow-workers with Tauler. His early friend, Johann von
   Dambach was also here at this time.

   But the most remarkable trait in this period of Tauler's life is that
   he not only, unlike most of his Order, sided with the Emperor in his
   whole contest with the Pope, but did not suspend his activity when, in
   1338, the great struggle came between the absolutely contradictory
   commands of his temporal and spiritual lords, and, as we have seen, his
   brethren quitted the town, and left their convent deserted for two
   years. By the departure of nearly all the clergy from Strasburg, Tauler
   found a still wider field of labour; and from allusions to him in
   letters of his contemporaries, it appears that he did not confine his
   exertions to that city, but preached from time to time at various
   places, from Cologne to Basle. Before the close of 1338 he seems to
   have made a somewhat lengthened visit to the latter city, where the
   state of things was very similar to that in Strasburg. The Bishop of
   Basle belonged to the opponents of Louis of Bavaria, and made common
   cause with the Bishop of Strasburg in attacking the adherents of the
   Emperor in 1339. The citizens again, like those of Strasburg, had
   remained faithful to Louis, and had even gone so far in their hostility
   to the Pope, that when, in 1330, John XXII. despatched an envoy to
   publish his bull against the Emperor, the incensed mob hurled him,
   although a priest and a dignitary, from the citadel into the river;
   and, when he tried to save himself by swimming, put out in boats after
   him and slew him. During the Interdict, however, most of the clergy,
   and especially the monks, had forsaken the churches, so that in many
   places the Sacrament had not been administered for fourteen years; and
   on the magistrates ordering them to resume their functions the greater
   part had refused to do so. About this time, however, the people of
   Basle by some means prevailed on the Pope to relax the severity of the
   Interdict for the space of a year.

   In Basle, Tauler met with an old friend, Henry of Nordlingen, from
   whose letters most of the scanty notices of Tauler during this period
   are derived. He was a priest from Constance, which city he had been
   obliged to leave on account of his refusal to preach; for though a
   Bavarian by birth, and intimately connected with Tauler and others of
   similar views, he did not recognize Louis as the lawful Emperor. He is
   principally known by his correspondence with a very remarkable woman,
   Margaretha Ebner, a nun at the Convent of Maria Medingen, in the
   diocese of Augsburg. Her sister Christina was Abbess of the Convent of
   Engenthal, near Nuremberg. Both were distinguished by their mental
   endowments as well as their earnest piety, and were evidently held in
   great respect by Tauler, Suso, and others of that party. They seem also
   to have taken up a very decided position amidst the ecclesiastical
   commotions of their age, and were zealous partizans of Louis.
   Christina, famous for her visions, in one of her trances sees the
   Romish Church in the likeness of a magnificent Cathedral, the doors of
   which are, however, closed by reason of the Interdict. The singing of
   the priests within is heard; a crowd of people are standing round, but
   dare not enter. On a sudden a man in the garb of a preaching friar
   comes up to the nun, and tells her that he will give her words
   wherewith to console the forsaken multitude; and this man is Christ.

   Tauler occasionally visited both these nuns, and was in correspondence
   with Margaretha [14] , whom he urges to write down her visions
   respecting the state of Christendom and the friends of God. For him
   they had a deep veneration, and constantly call him "our dear Father
   Tauler." Christina learns, in one of her revelations, that he is "the
   holiest of God's children now living on earth," that "the spirit of God
   breathes through him, as sweet music through a lute;" Margaret speaks,
   too, sometimes of the joy that she has had in the presence of this
   great friend of God, and how hard it has been to part with him. She
   appears to have stood rather in the relation of a wise Christian friend
   and counsellor, than of a spiritual child, to Henry of Nordlingen, who
   from his letters seems to have been a man of gentle, pious spirit, more
   fitted for a quiet contemplative life than for the energetic activity
   required by the troublous times in which his lot was cast. He, like
   Tauler, was filled with anguish at the sight of the distress of those
   around him; but while Tauler's grief stirred him up to vigorous efforts
   in their behalf, and his courage and energy rose with the emergency,
   the timid and hesitating Henry was unable to surmount the difficulties
   in which he found himself involved, and the greater the pressure of the
   times, the greater was his perplexity and longing for peace. Yet, when
   his scrupulous conscience allowed him to preach, his labours appear to
   have been fruitful in result. This was the case during Tauler's visit
   to Basle, where he had previously been sojourning for some time in
   inactivity, after long wandering and much distress. [15]

   When the Pope allowed public worship to be celebrated for a year at
   Basle, Henry's friends, without his knowledge, procured him permission
   to preach, and give a forty days' indulgence; and he then ventured to
   appear in public, encouraged by Tauler's influence and counsel. Thus he
   says:--"Afterwards I came to Basle, to my and thy dear faithful Father
   Tauler (who was with me at thy house), and he helped me in every way he
   could with all fidelity." He then writes: "The great mercy has been
   granted us that we may celebrate mass in public, with the Pope's
   permission; and now do the hungry souls come with great desire to
   receive the Lord's body, which they have not been able to enjoy for
   fourteen years in Christian obedience. And now I entreat you, with
   special earnestness, that you pray to God for all those whom I feed
   with His Body, that we may receive His Holy Sacrament in His love, and
   administer it to His eternal glory, and the consolation of all
   Christian souls." He now preached every day, and often twice a day,
   besides performing mass daily; and so many of all classes streamed to
   confess to him that he was overwhelmed with his duties, and writes to
   his friend: "If I could manage it, I would gladly come to you; but I am
   not my own. I am the property of the whole Chapter, and the most
   important parishes. The people at Basle are not willing that I should
   leave them, neither, indeed, should I have courage to travel openly
   about the country; for I should be at the mercy of any ruffian or
   thief, and if aught befell me, no complaint would be laid against him.
   Still I trust in the Lord that He will suffer me to see thee, my
   heart's true consolation." But some months later he writes: "Methought
   I clung too much and with too carnal feelings to the ease, the
   luxurious and pleasant society, and the earthly comforts that I enjoyed
   at Basle. In truth I knew not that I did so while I had them, but felt
   it fully when I forsook them. Besides, I perceived in my heart, through
   many suggestions and admonitions, that my labours might be more needed
   elsewhere than at Basle, and so I ventured my departure for the sake of
   Christ and his flock, and have exchanged the marvellously holy and
   pleasant and acceptable society there for all manner of discomfort to
   my inward and outward man, by night and by day; so that now I must
   perforce retreat into myself, and take refuge in my only consolation,
   Christ Jesus, if I were unwilling to do so before."

   By the persuasion of Tauler, Henry appears now for a time to have
   preached even in places which still lay under the Interdict, but
   afterwards, terrified by the violent censure of the clergy for his
   conduct, to have submitted again to the papal prohibition, and resumed
   his wanderings. Tauler, on the contrary, waited for no papal permission
   to do that which he considered to be the bounden duty of a clergyman,
   and after his visit to Basle it appears from Henry's letters that he
   travelled more than once as far as Cologne. In this city, where Master
   Eckart had spent the latter years of his life, numerous preachers had
   gone forth from his school, who continued to promulgate his doctrines
   with more or less ability and originality. Nicolas of Strasburg, too,
   was at this time lecturing at Cologne, probably driven from Strasburg
   by the troubles to which his papal politics would expose him at this
   period. This was the case also with Tauler's old friend, Johann von
   Dambach, who had not only declared that during the Interdict it was the
   duty of a pious Christian to submit unconditionally to the Church, but
   even composed several tractates to prove the justifiableness of the
   Interdict from the Canon Law. Yet, as we have seen Tauler and the
   Ebners in undisturbed friendship with Henry of Nordlingen, in spite of
   differences which entered so deeply into the life of those times, so,
   notwithstanding Dambach's antagonistic opinions, and his removal to the
   distant Prague [16] , the connection between him and Tauler was not
   broken off, as is proved by the circumstance, that, after 1350 he sent
   his book, "De sensibilibus deliciis paradisi" to their Alma Mater, the
   College of St Jacques, in Paris, in their joint names.

   We now arrive at the date when that great change was produced in Tauler
   with which the foregoing "History" has acquainted us. Till recently,
   little was known of the "History," beyond the fact that it was found
   attached to some mss. of Tauler's sermons, and many have doubted of its
   genuineness. Qu√©tif and Echard, for instance, have treated it as a mere
   allegory. By dint of laborious researches among the old mss. of the
   libraries of Strasburg and Sarnen, and ingenious combinations of the
   results thence obtained, Professor Schmidt has not only established, in
   a way that it seems to me must be satisfactory to any one who goes
   through the evidence, that this Tractate is a perfectly genuine and
   truthful production, the work of the layman who professes to have
   written it, but also has succeeded in identifying this layman with a
   mysterious personage, called the Great Friend of God, in the Oberland,
   the head of a secret religious association; and the latter again, with
   a certain Nicolas of Basle, whose name, however, only occurs twice;
   once in the account of his own martyrdom, once in that of one of his
   disciples.

   The most important of the mss. examined by Professor Schmidt is a large
   folio volume, only recently discovered in the archives of Strasburg,
   and formerly belonging to the Convent of the Knights of St John in that
   city, called a Briefbuch [book of letters], and is for the most part a
   collection of letters and papers left by Rulman Merswin, the founder of
   the convent. This Rulman Merswin was a friend of Tauler (who was for
   some time his confessor), and, in the latter part of his life, of the
   "Layman," Nicolas, by whose advice he built a house for the Brethren of
   St John, on an island at Strasburg called the Gruenen-Worth (green
   meadow), and with whom he was in constant correspondence up to the time
   of his death in 1382. Several portions of this extremely curious
   Briefbuch were carefully copied into the archives of the convent,
   forming what is called its Memorial, [17] but the codex itself did not
   belong to the public archives of the house, being kept secret from all
   but a few, on account of the private letters and notes contained in it,
   and therefore treasured up with peculiar care. So late as the
   seventeenth century, this was still the case, and a reader of that
   period has traced on the outer covering of the Codex the words: "liber
   iste religiose custodiendus." The documents of which it consists were
   arranged, and most of them copied out, by Nicolas von Laufen, who
   (according to a few notices of himself, which he has inserted at the
   close of the Briefbuch) seems to have accompanied Rulman Merswin as his
   secretary, on taking possession of the newly-built Gruenen-Worth in
   1366, and a few years later to have become a priest of the order of St
   John. The codex contains among other less important matter, a ms called
   "The Book of the Five Men," being an account of Nicolas and his four
   companions, in the handwriting of Nicolas himself; twenty-two of his
   letters, apparently copied by Nicolas von Laufen, and the original ms.
   of Rulman Merswin's account of the first four years of his religious
   history, in his own handwriting. Thus, after a lapse of five hundred
   years, we are able to learn more about this extraordinary half-mythical
   "Friend of God in the Oberland," than his very contemporaries knew.

   From these documents we are able to obtain a general idea of the
   character and work of Nicolas, though the actual course of his history,
   especially during the earlier part of his life, is still almost
   entirely shrouded from view. All that we can discover respecting the
   commencement of his career is, that about the year 1328 or 1330, he was
   a youth of good family at Basle [18] , wealthy, universally esteemed,
   and possessed of abilities that ensured him success in all that he
   undertook. Nevertheless, he was unhappy, from the consciousness of his
   sinfulness and ignorance of divine things. Being, as a layman,
   uninstructed in Holy Scripture, he sought to master religious truths by
   the exercise of his reason; but his efforts to obtain satisfaction were
   in vain. For years he struggled with his own intellectual difficulties
   and the temptations of the world. One day, as he was meditating on the
   transitory nature of all earthly things and the rapid flight of time,
   the thoughtlessness, sinfulness, and thorough forgetfulness of God in
   all those around him were presented in such vivid colours to his mind,
   that it seemed inconceivable to him how man could take any delight in
   this vain world; and then, as the thought of his own wasted time rose
   to his remembrance, he was filled with such bitter remorse that he
   resolved from that moment to renounce the world and dedicate his life
   to God. To this end, as we have seen [19] , he read the lives of the
   saints and imitated their austerities. This discipline he had carried
   on for five years before he found peace in the way he describes in the
   "History." He afterwards set himself to study the Scriptures (no doubt
   in Latin), and says that in a space of thirty weeks he had come to be
   able to understand it as thoroughly, and "speak as good grammar, as if
   he had studied all his days in the best Universities;" which
   extraordinary facility of acquisition he refers to special divine
   assistance. We know no more of him till we find him at the head of a
   society of "Friends of God," who live with him in utter seclusion from
   the world, and form the secret centre of a wide circle of religious
   activity, unconnected with any recognized order, but yet not
   overstepping the pale of the Church.

   The title of "Friends of God" is one which meets us continually in the
   writings of those who are termed mystics in the fourteenth century, and
   is used in various connections. Sometimes it seems to denote those who
   were partakers of a spiritual in opposition to a formalistic piety;
   sometimes to denote the members of a particular body. Among those
   called "Friends of God" we find the names of individuals widely
   differing from each other in rank, vocation, opinion, and career; for
   they counted among their members Dominicans, such as Eckart, Tauler,
   Suso of Constance, and Henry of Nordlingen, and Franciscans, such as
   Otto of Passau; Knights married and single; nuns like Christina and
   Margaretha Elmer, and a Queen, Agnes the widow of King Andrew of
   Hungary; the rich banker, Rulman Merswin, and Conrad, the Abbot of
   Kaisersheim in Bavaria, who boasts, in a letter to Henry of Nordlingen,
   that he has not accepted the Bishop of Augsburg's absolution either for
   himself or his monastery; Conrad Brunsberg, again, the Grand-Master of
   the Knights of St John in Germany, besides the layman, Nicolas of
   Basle, and the great mystical author of the Netherlands, Ruysbroek. The
   appellation common to all these, with numbers of less distinguished
   persons, would seem to have been used among themselves to denominate
   those who could not but feel that they were more alive to the realities
   of religion and its spiritual nature than was the case with the
   multitude around them. That those possessing common sympathies on the
   subjects of highest import, should instinctively seek out and cling to
   each other, and thus an association should spontaneously grow up, even
   without any definite plan, is a natural and inevitable process, where a
   real, deep religious life has arrived at self-consciousness; and from a
   comparison of the passages in which Tauler and Henry of Nordlingen use
   the term "Friends of God," it appears to me that in the first instance
   the sense of having entered into a living, personal union with God,
   bringing with it a yearning pity for sinners, and a fervent desire to
   bring them to the same blessed state, was the sole distinction and bond
   of the "Friends of God."

   It is at all events clear that their union for common action was
   utterly independent of the attitude they assumed towards the great
   conflicting questions of the day; for, as we have seen in the Abbot of
   Kaisersheim, and Henry of Nordlingen, those are called "Friends of
   God," and treat each other as brethren, who are as far asunder in their
   politics as the Chartists and High Tories of our own days. Neither did
   they form a sect, but, on the contrary, repudiated the idea, as is
   shown by the following passage from Tauler's sermon on the
   twenty-second Sunday after Trinity, which I think, too, confirms this
   view of their origin. "The prince of this world has nowadays been
   sowing brambles among the roses in all directions, insomuch that the
   roses are often choked, or sorely torn by the brambles. Children, there
   must needs be a flight or a distinction; some sort of a separation,
   whether within the cloisters or without, and it does not make them into
   a sect, that the Friends of God' profess to be unlike the world's
   friends." The remark that the "Friends of God" were not a sect, would
   seem to prove that this accusation was brought against them; but,
   indeed, proof of this would seem superfluous, for then, as in all other
   times, it would infallibly happen that the unworldly and
   spiritual-minded, who recognized a nobler sort of religion than that
   comprised in the due observance of religious rites and decent moral
   conduct, should be charged with sectarianism and suspected of heresy,
   even if they broached no new dogmas, and went no farther than to bring
   out in their teaching and practice the real significance of the
   Church's ordinances.

   But the greater the sinfulness and deadness to religion in a particular
   age, the more strongly marked must be the line of demarcation between
   the careless and the earnest; for the religious are thus obliged to
   abstain from pleasures and occupations which, innocent in themselves,
   have become corrupt. At the same time, too, the danger of enthusiasm,
   and mistaking one's own natural emotions for direct Divine influence,
   will be greatest when such influences known to be real by the pious,
   are altogether denied by the world in general. Illustrations will
   instantly suggest themselves to the mind of the reader from the
   experience of our own Church in the times of Wesley and Whitfield; and
   in like manner, amidst the universal deadness of the Lutheran Church in
   the seventeenth century, arose the Pietistic movement of Spener and
   Franke. Thus the great wickedness, especially of the clergy, the
   contentions and dreadful catastrophes which mark the first half of the
   fourteenth century, would impel the pious to come out from the world,
   and stimulate them to specially earnest and direct efforts to enkindle
   the religious life of the people. And so, during the terrors of the
   Interdict, they seem to have formed an association with no declared
   boundary, yet whose boundaries would be most distinctly recognized by
   all who were within the line. To the name they adopted, the text John
   xv. 15 seems to have given occasion; for Tauler says: "Then said our
   Lord to His disciples, From henceforth I call you not servants, but
   friends.' The henceforth' that he spoke was from the time when they had
   forsaken all things and followed Him. Then were they his friends, and
   not servants; and therefore he who will be a true friend of God must
   leave all things and follow after Him." From this passage, in the
   spirit of which many others concur, we see at once in what the right to
   this title consisted--namely, in the thorough self-surrender to God,
   the forsaking all things to follow God alone.

   But while this principle, which surely we must recognize as that which
   does really constitute the friends of God in all ages, was brought out
   into peculiar prominence by these German Gottesfreunde, their views
   could not fail to be coloured by the modes of thought and the
   circumstances of their age. Thus, in order to this entire devotedness
   to God, we find a renunciation, so far as may be, of all earthly cares
   and ties recommended by them; thus, too, we see that their faith in
   God's direct, personal dealings with the individual soul is apt to be
   accompanied by a superstitious regarding of insignificant phenomena, or
   even the mere effects of an over-active fancy, as a positive intimation
   of His will. Some of us, too, would be inclined to think that their
   continual insisting on the duty of passively yielding up the soul to
   divine influences, and their exhortations to take all outward things as
   from God, would involve a danger of falling into an indolent quietism.
   But the fact, far from justifying our expectations, would afford
   another proof that when we leave off trying to do the work that God
   will do Himself, we shall find our energies all the more vigorous to
   accomplish that which He has set us to do; for instead of regarding the
   events around them with passive indifference, like many of the earlier
   ascetics, they believed themselves called to exercise a very positive
   influence on the course of events.

   This was in a special sense the case with Nicolas of Basle and his
   immediate companions, whom we find, from the recently discovered
   documents, to have entertained plans for the extension of religion and
   the reform of Christendom of a wider nature than it was safe to
   disclose even to their brethren indiscriminately, at a time when the
   Dominican inquisitors (who, moreover, were of the Papal, while most of
   the "Friends of God" were of the Imperial party) were actively engaged
   in hunting out heretics, especially those who might betray any leaning
   to the democratic and reformatory tendencies of the Spiritual
   Franciscans and their cognate sects. Thus the knot of men who gathered
   round Nicolas as their centre, seem, as compared with the Gottesfreunde
   at large, to have formed a church within a church, having secret
   schemes into which the others were not initiated.

   From hints of such private schemes scattered in the writings of Rulman
   Merswin and "the Layman," it was formerly imagined that the latter at
   any rate was a secret Waldensian; but this idea is not confirmed by
   more extended research; on the contrary, the importance which he and
   his friends attach to the rites of the Church,--to obedience to
   ecclesiastical superiors,--their belief in transubstantiation and
   purgatory, &c., are quite inconsistent with it. Indeed, the views of
   Nicolas seem to have been much more in unison with the doctrine of the
   Church than those of Eckart and his school. The only peculiarity of his
   belief, that I can discover, is his strong confidence in the reality of
   the visions and miraculous revelations imparted to himself and his
   friends; and it must be remembered that even this peculiarity he not
   only shares in common with the great Luther, who lived two centuries
   later, and with the liberal and sagacious Wesley, almost in our own
   days, but that his spiritual childhood had been nurtured on the legends
   of the saints, with all their marvels; and that we see, from the
   history of his times, that miracles and revelations were of everyday
   occurrence, at all events among the Franciscans and sectarians. The
   secret of the extraordinary sway which Nicolas obtained, not only over
   laymen less instructed and priests less thinking than himself, but even
   over a man of such commanding intellect as Tauler, seems to me to lie
   in the intense glow of his piety, the utter self-devotion of his own
   life, his force of will, and his real spiritual insight. Not only did
   he stand immeasurably below Tauler in point of learning, but his
   letters, while affording many traits of spiritual wisdom and acute
   practical sense, exhibit neither the reflective nor imaginative power
   of Tauler's writings. Yet the accomplished scholar, the experienced
   pastor, the fearless politician, resigns himself implicitly to the
   guidance of the obscure layman as his incontestable superior.

   The crisis which Nicolas was the means of bringing about in Tauler's
   life is commonly termed a conversion; but from all that we have read of
   his previous life, it seems clear that it cannot be regarded as what is
   ordinarily meant by that term. Before it took place Tauler was already
   a sincere, God-fearing, active Christian minister, and recognized as
   their "Father" and leader by the "Friends of God" scattered up and down
   Switzerland, Bavaria, and the Rhenish states. Neither can I discover
   any conversion, properly speaking, in point of doctrinal opinions.
   Nicolas agrees to all he taught as very good, and blames, not his
   preaching, but his life. Surely, therefore, this notable change is to
   be regarded in the light in which Tauler himself regarded it; as the
   coming to a deeper, more real and practical experience of the things of
   God. It seems, that with all his sincere piety, and hatred of sin, and
   abhorrence of the evil world around him, Tauler had never come to a
   clear consciousness of all the depths of sin concealed in his own
   heart, or an apprehension of the full import of the utter
   self-surrender to God which he preached. Such a deficiency of
   self-knowledge is indeed more possible with a conscientious man of
   Tauler's character, pure and gentle by nature, than with one of the
   opposite, or more stormy type. It is true that the task which God lays
   upon all is the same--the unceasing surrender of their own wishes to
   the higher aims which He sets successively before them. But with men of
   passionate temperament and selfish habits, who are therefore at every
   turn exposed by circumstances to violent temptation, their natural
   wishes are, for the most part, so obviously sinful that, though the
   struggle of renouncing them may be hard, the duty of doing so is clear
   and pressing. And when such turn to God, their falls in attempting the
   Christian walk are often frequent enough, or at least their battles
   with temptation severe enough, to teach them the evil and weakness of
   their own heart. With men, on the other hand, of calm, pure, and
   affectionate disposition, and trained in conscientious habits, so many
   of their wishes are for things harmless, or even good in themselves,
   that it is less easy to see why and how they are to be given up. Such
   men, just, kindly, and finding much of their own happiness in that of
   others, live, for the most part, in harmonious relations with those
   around them, and have little to disturb their consciences, beyond the
   fear of falling short in the path of duty on which they have already
   entered. But they are exposed to many perils, more insidious, because
   less startling, than those which beset their more fiercely-tempted
   brethren. They are in danger of depending too much on the respect and
   love which others so readily yield them; of valuing themselves on a
   purity which, if ever one of struggle, has come to be one of taste; of
   prizing intellectual clearness above moral insight and vigour; of
   mistaking the pleasure they feel in the performance of duty, for real
   submission to the will of God; and above all, of shrinking from new
   truths which would, for the time, confuse their belief, and break up
   the calm symmetry of their lives. The greater danger to the Christian
   life arising from those hidden heart-sins, than even from sinful acts
   which instantly wound the conscience, is a truth which Tauler insists
   upon in his sermons so strongly and so often, nay, sometimes almost to
   exaggeration, that one could not but guess that he was speaking from
   his own experience, even had we not the certainty of it from the
   "History." For, as he often declares, different natures require and
   receive a very different discipline from God. Sometimes it is by
   outward affliction that God speaks to souls thus sinking into the
   lethargy of formalism; and the loss of friends, or health, or influence
   suddenly seems to cut off, as it were, half their means of serving Him,
   and to rouse long-forgotten temptations to rise up against His will.
   Sometimes, on the other hand, He speaks to them inwardly, by opening
   their eyes to heights of holiness, which they had never before steadily
   contemplated. They now suddenly perceive that many of the fancied
   duties which have till now occupied their lives, and satisfied their
   consciences, have long ceased to be duties, and have come to be mere
   habits or pleasures; and that while they have been thus living in
   self-love, unseen and unrepented-of, they might have been coming to the
   knowledge of the higher obligations to which they have been so blind,
   but which were all implied in their first belief, if they had but
   continued to read it with a single eye. Thus they are weighed down by
   present temptations to which they have long been strangers. For, in
   order to follow the new light granted to them, they must give up
   long-cherished aims; relinquish many opportunities of doing good, and
   even, it may seem, the very faculties for using them; and sacrifice,
   not only the good opinion of the world, but the trust and affection of
   many who are dearest to them. They shrink from such renunciation; and
   then come doubt and perplexity to add to the bitterness of the
   struggle. Can it be right to abandon so much that is good and worthy in
   itself, can it be the voice of God that summons them to do this, or is
   it not rather a self-willed fancy of their own? No: for conscience
   cannot be mistaken when it tells us of sin, though it is insufficient
   to reveal to us duty--and this fierce clinging to their own wishes,
   what is it but the same obstinate resistance to the will of God, which
   they have been accustomed to blame, nay, even wonder at, in the vicious
   and criminal, whom they have perhaps been seeking to reclaim? Such a
   struggle, it seems, was that which Tauler had to pass through before he
   could fully apprehend or be fitted for the work which God had for him
   to do. And surely, without some such struggle, none can keep long in
   the right path. For the path to life does not stretch across the levels
   of habit, but winds up the heights of aspiration, and at every fresh
   step in the ascent a wider horizon of duty opens to the view.

   I will not mar the impression of the touching narrative given by Tauler
   himself by translating the story it relates into any weaker words, but
   leave it to make its own way to the heart of those who have hearts to
   understand it. There may be some who are unable to find within the
   range of their own experience and observation any key which can make it
   sound to them like reality and common sense, yet considering the
   practical energy and clear judgment of Tauler in other parts of his
   life, it may surely be worth their pains to study what he considered of
   so much importance with reverent and self-distrustful diligence, rather
   than reject it at once as the mere product of a heated fancy.

   It seems most likely that the attention of Nicolas had first been drawn
   to Tauler during the stay of the latter with Henry of Nordlingen, in
   Basle, in 1338; for, according to one of the best mss. of the
   "History," the Layman says, "I have heard much of your doctrine in my
   own country." Considering what we know of his previous history, and the
   accusation of Nicolas that he relied too much on his scholarship, it
   seems highly probable that Tauler may hitherto have been somewhat
   influenced by the cast of thought derived from his master Eckart, in
   whose writings the power of Knowing is so highly exalted that it
   sometimes is made to take precedence of the faculty of Love. That
   Nicolas should, after hearing Tauler preach a few times, have been able
   to penetrate his spiritual condition and detect its great imperfection,
   would not appear to imply anything miraculous, but to be merely a rare,
   though by no means singular, instance of the fine spiritual instinct
   sometimes found in men themselves of extraordinary religious
   attainments. Tauler shows us what he considers to have been the value
   of Nicolas to himself when he says, "Therefore for such as desire to
   live for the truth, it is a great assistance to have a Friend of God,
   to whom they submit themselves, and who guides them by the Spirit of
   God. . . . It were well worth their while to go a hundred leagues to
   seek out an experienced Friend of God, who knows the right path and can
   direct them in it." [20]

   The two years of silence, which must have been such a terrible trial to
   Tauler's faith and obedience, were compensated, not only by inward
   growth, as is always the case with such trials, but by the evident
   increase of his outward usefulness, so that he found the truth of
   Nicolas' assurance, that one of his sermons would bring forth more
   fruit now than a hundred had before. His preaching is distinguished
   from that of most of his brethren among the "Friends of God," by its
   more searching application of religious principles to the moral
   questions arising in the various emergencies of inward experience and
   outward life. How much more widely still must it have differed from
   that of the ordinary preachers, who sought to captivate the educated by
   the refinements of scholastic logic, employed on questions of no use
   but to display their own ingenuity, or to entertain the vulgar by
   marvellous stories of wonder-working saints or demons,--when in simple
   earnest language he appealed to the consciences of his hearers, and
   then showed them the way of escape from the wretchedness of their
   sinful lives to the peace of God, which passeth all understanding. And
   when he taught them that they must forsake the creature and cleave to
   God alone, it was no selfish shutting up of the heart within the narrow
   sphere of its own emotions and experiences which he preached, for he is
   continually admonishing to works of love, and ever places human duties
   on their true level, measuring their value not by the nature of the
   act, but by the obedience and love involved in its performance. "One
   can spin," he says, "another can make shoes; and all these are gifts of
   the Holy Ghost. I tell you, if I were not a priest, I would esteem it a
   great gift that I was able to make shoes, and would try to make them so
   well as to be a pattern to all." "The measure with which we shall be
   measured, is the faculty of love in the soul,--the will of a man; by
   this shall all his words and works and life be measured. . . ."

   But that which seems to me the most striking characteristic of Tauler's
   sermons is his profound sympathy with the spirit of Christ's life,
   especially with his infinite sorrow over the sins of others. This is,
   indeed, a characteristic of the "Friends of God" in general, but is
   expressed with greater force and beauty in Tauler than in the other
   writers of the same school. In this sense they specially deserve the
   title which they assumed; for, more than any other class of religious
   writers with whom I am acquainted, do they seem to have entered into
   that intense appreciation of the evil of sin, mingled with endless
   grief and compassion for its slaves, which could overwhelm the
   Saviour's mind with agony.

   It is true that a large proportion of his sermons are addressed to the
   inmates of cloisters, and have special reference to their peculiar
   requirements and dangers. But we must remember that he lived in an age
   when the social relations were in a state of disorganization; and in
   those times of general distress and perplexity, when the outward
   ministrations of the Church and the means of obtaining religious
   instruction were often cut off for long together, the number of those
   who retired into convents had become very large. There were great
   numbers, too, of laymen and women, who, without entering any Order,
   withdrew from the world and formed communities or unions (called
   Sammenungen), dwelling together without any monastic rules, yet
   differing little in their mode of life from the regular monks. Tauler
   often refers to these communities in his sermons. Their members
   generally chose Dominicans or Franciscans for their confessors, and a
   great number of this class appear to have attached themselves to
   Tauler. They found in him, however, a severe censor of the faults to
   which their recluse life rendered them peculiarly liable,--the relying
   on outward acts of piety, despising those who are outside, killing the
   body, which is God's instrument, with austerities, or allowing
   themselves to waste their time and fill their minds with trivialities,
   while imagining the fact of their being "religious" to make them safe.

   He is said by Specklin to have made the reformation of the lives of the
   clergy a special object of his efforts. The statutes passed for the
   regulation of their conduct by a synod convened by Bishop Berthold in
   1335, for the purpose of removing abuses, gives a lively picture of the
   inordinate covetousness, and utter neglect of the duties of their
   vocation, which prevailed among the clergy of Strasburg at this time.
   It is the more remarkable, that the Bishop should have found it
   necessary to take such strong measures during the solemn period of the
   Interdict, when the very struggle in which the clergy were engaged with
   the civil power, might have been expected at least to rouse them to
   lead a more decorous and sober life. From the statutes of this synod,
   we see that the clergy not unfrequently alienated the property of the
   Church to laymen, or borrowed money at high interest from the Jews, in
   order to gratify their propensity to ostentation and pleasure. There
   were even some who entered into trade. The younger and more wealthy
   especially distinguished themselves by their extreme fondness for
   display, and the Bishop complains that, instead of going about clad
   with due decorum in the proper priestly garb, they allowed their hair
   to grow long in order to conceal their tonsure, wore boots of red,
   yellow, and green, and adorned their coats with gold lace and gay
   ribbons; that they strutted about in the streets equipped with rapiers
   and swords, attended tournaments, frequented the public taverns, and
   were the most jovial of boon-companions at the drinking-bouts of the
   laymen. In some of the more wealthy nunneries, too, things had come to
   such a pitch, that the ladies dressed magnificently, took part in the
   amusements of the tournament, and even danced with laymen in their
   taverns. In reference to such, Tauler says: "If we look around us, we
   see that the greater part of the world are enemies of God; and among
   these we must account certain who are servants of God by constraint,
   who must be forced to do any services for Him, and the little that they
   do is not done out of love or devotion, but simply out of fear. . . .
   They are common hired servants of God; and such are all those priests
   and nuns and the like, who take up a religious life for the sake of
   revenues and fees, and if they were not secure of these, they would not
   serve God at all, but turn round altogether, and consort with the
   enemies of God. Thus they seek their own pleasure in dainty fare,
   dress, jewels, vanity, and the admiration of others, wherever they can
   find it. Nay, verily, at last they must have a spouse. Ah, dear Lord,'
   they say, it is no harm; it is a spiritual love. We must enjoy
   ourselves a little; we must have some recreation; we cannot do without
   it. See, dear Lord, we are spiritual people, we are in an Order.' But
   put on as many cowls and hoods as thou wilt, they will help thee
   nothing, if thou doest not what thou oughtest of right to do. There was
   once a man who fell into sin, and he put on a cowl, but did not give up
   his sin. The Devil came and took the man, and tore him into a hundred
   pieces, and left the cowl whole, but carried off the man, body and
   soul, to the amazement of all beholders. Therefore take heed to
   yourselves, knowing how full the world is of such bargainers with God,
   among monks and nuns." [21]

   Tauler's denunciations of this class brought him, of course, many
   enemies among the clergy, who hated the strictness of his principles
   and conduct; and they strove in various ways to distort his words, in
   order to find grounds for accusation against him. Thus he
   says,--"Children, I must tell you in love, that I am unjustly accused
   of having declared that I would hear no one's confession unless he
   first promised me to do everything that I wished. That is a very unjust
   word: what I wished.' I wish no one to do anything beyond that which is
   written, and I beg no man to promise me more than that." [22] He had
   also to defend himself against more serious charges, for his enemies
   not only ridiculed him for making so much of the inward work, but
   called him and his followers unorthodox innovators. Thus he says: "But
   if one come and warn them of the horrible danger in which they are
   living, and what a fearful death they are like to die, they mock at
   him, and say he is a Beghard, or belongs to the New Spirit, scoffing at
   him and slandering him worse than ever was done to the Christians by
   Jews or heathens. These false Christians contemn us far more, crying
   out, Here comes one of the New Spirit;' These are they of the lofty
   spirits.'" [23] It is even related that the clergy, enraged at the
   charges he brought against them, on one occasion forbade his preaching
   (which undoubtedly was in itself an act of disobedience to the
   Interdict), but that the magistrates obliged them to rescind their
   prohibition.

   Meanwhile, however, Tauler's efforts for their amendment were not
   wholly fruitless, for it is recorded that through him "many priests
   became quite pious;" while by the people at large he was revered and
   affectionately beloved, and "whatever weighty matter the people had to
   do, he was called in to settle it with his wisdom . . . and whatever he
   counselled them was right in their eyes." The "Friends of God"
   naturally attached themselves more strongly than ever to him, and about
   this time he seems to have been the means of adding a notable adherent
   to their numbers, in the banker, Rulman Merswin, who was at a later
   period the founder of the Gruenen-Worth, and author of the "Book of the
   Nine Rocks," a very remarkable allegorical picture of the then
   condition and prospects of the Church. Nay, even Bishop Berthold is
   related to have "heard him preach often and gladly with great
   admiration" at this time; no doubt rejoicing in so brilliant an
   exception to the general disgraceful conduct of his clergy, which
   caused him so much uneasiness; but the Bishop's favour was not destined
   to endure long, for political events soon occurred which produced an
   entire alteration in his views.

   After the death of Benedict XII., Clement VI., the most inveterate
   opponent of Louis IV., was elected Pope, and he had hardly ascended the
   throne when he renewed hostilities against the Emperor with greater
   vehemence than his predecessor. The most awful anathemas were launched
   against Louis, which again proved themselves by no means inefficient
   weapons of attack. Many ecclesiastics, secular no less than regular,
   who had been performing divine service in the cities that acknowledged
   the authority of the Emperor, now turned to their bishops, humbly
   beseeching them for absolution for their disobedience, which petition
   was not rejected; for in many places they obtained it without
   difficulty on payment of one florin! Bishop Berthold, too, whose
   outward reconciliation with Louis had been merely dictated by motives
   of fear and self-interest, now besought pardon for it from the new Pope
   in an epistle dated November 9th, 1345, in which he further renounces
   his allegiance to the Emperor, and promises unconditional obedience to
   the Romish See for the future. Clement granted his petition, and
   released him and his diocese from ecclesiastical penalties. Shortly
   after (1347), Louis died, fairly worn out and broken-hearted with the
   long struggle in which his reign had been passed, but not until several
   of the Electors, under the instigation of the Pope, had elected Charles
   IV. King of Rome (1346). Many of the Estates refused, however, even
   after Louis' death, to acknowledge the latter, commonly called the
   "Parson-King," because he had been elected in defiance of their wishes.
   Strasburg was one of these cities, and in consequence was again laid
   under interdict.

   To these political and ecclesiastical disturbances were added still
   worse miseries. The land was desolated successively by tempests,
   earthquakes, and famine, and at last, in 1348, the Black Death came to
   fill up the measure of the people's woe. This plague continued to rage
   through Southern Germany and France until the following year, bringing
   in its train the usual accompaniments of frantic terror, and the
   dissolution of all social bonds. In Strasburg sixteen thousand persons
   fell victims to it; and it is calculated that in Southern France
   two-thirds of the population perished. All these convulsions of the
   natural and social world struck terror to men's very hearts; bewildered
   and beset, they knew not which way to turn. Then appeared the ghastly
   processions of the Flagellants, who traversed the country half naked by
   hundreds and thousands, walking two and two in white shirts often
   stained with blood, and holding scourges in their hands. When they
   entered a town, they broke out into their wild howling chant,


   "Nun hebet auf eure H√§nde

   Dass Gott dies grosse Sterben wende,

   Nun hebet auf eure Arme

   Dass sich Gott √ºber uns erbarme;"

   and gathering round them all who would join, after service in a church,
   threw themselves on the ground, confessing their sins aloud, and then
   scourged each other till they were exhausted. In some places the
   popular fanaticism accused the Jews of causing the plague by poisoning
   the wells; and the multitude, in their fury, setting fire to the Jews'
   quarter, burnt thousands of the wretched creatures in their houses.
   Numbers of the lower classes hoped for a Messiah in the person of the
   great "Priest-hater," Frederick II., who, according to an old saying
   now expanded into a distinct prophecy, was in the latter days to rise
   again from the dead, to render justice to the widow and orphan, to
   punish and humble the Clergy, to constrain monks and nuns to marry, and
   then to sail over to the Holy Land and lay down his crown on the Mount
   of Olives. [24] This was not the only, though it was the wildest
   prophecy current at this time. Hermann von Fritzlar declares that the
   time is come that precedes the end of the world: [25] "This time in
   which we are now living, is that in which the people's hearts have
   waxed cold, for they have forgotten the life of our Lord. Wherefore do
   arson, and rape, and robbery, and treason, and strife, and envy, and
   hatred, rage now as they never did before; as Christ Himself foretold,
   that in these times the love of many should wax cold. The third, and
   coming age, is that of Anti-Christ." And Tauler too, in his Sermon on
   Christ's stilling the Storm, warns his flock: "O that ye knew what
   anguish and terror shall shortly seize the hearts of all who have not
   cleaved to God with all their might, . . . and all the evil that shall
   overtake them, as has been of late revealed to the Friends of God." In
   another sermon, preached before the coming of the Black Death, he thus
   recapitulates the judgments of God that were threatened if the people
   refused to repent: "horrible things have been foretold, of fire, of
   water, of great darkness, of hurricanes and drought." In the midst of
   these calamities he declaims against the perverted lessons drawn from
   them by the people; the recklessness and despair of some, the craving
   of others after marvellous visions and supernatural revelations,
   finally the sinfulness of those who, seeking only to escape from the
   world's evils, gave themselves up to the passive indulgence of their
   own emotion. The last error was that against which he inveighed most
   frequently, being the one, no doubt, of which his hearers were most in
   danger. He himself was not one of those passive mystics. "Works of
   love," he says, "are more acceptable to God than lofty contemplation;
   art thou engaged in devoutest prayer, and God wills that thou go out
   and preach, or carry broth to a sick brother, thou shouldst do it with
   joy."

   His own life was consistent with his teachings. When the Black Death
   came to Strasburg, he devoted himself to administering the sacraments
   and carrying consolation to the sick and dying. The renewal of the ban
   had increased the general terror and distress, and at the same time
   opened a still larger field for Tauler's activity. A proclamation had
   been issued exhorting the people not to give way to terror, as it would
   increase their danger of infection; but what could a proclamation
   avail, when they often saw more than fifty corpses carried through the
   streets in a day, and there were not priests enough to perform the
   funeral rites? The deeper was their gratitude to Tauler for his noble
   act of disobedience to the Church that denied them their only remaining
   consolation. But he did not stand alone; there were especially two
   monks who shared his labours, Thomas of Strasburg, an Augustinian and
   the Prior-general of his Order in Strasburg, and Ludolph of Saxony,
   Prior of the newly-established convent of the Carthusians. [26] The
   three friends were not content with setting an example of heroic zeal,
   they issued in their joint names an Address to the clerical body at
   large, showing how iniquitous it was that the poor ignorant people
   should be suffered to die excommunicate for no fault of their own, and
   calling on the priests to visit the sick and dying, and no longer to
   refuse them the consolation of religion, forasmuch as Christ had died
   for all men, and the Pope had no power to close heaven against an
   innocent person who should die under the Interdict. In a second Letter
   they went further; setting forth the doctrine of two Swords and two
   Powers, the temporal and the spiritual, and teaching that the two are
   not to be confounded, though they ought not to be set in opposition to
   each other; that it is indeed the duty of the spiritual arm to
   endeavour to direct the secular in the right course, but that if a
   great one has made himself liable to the Interdict, that does not give
   the spiritual arm any authority to curse and excommunicate poor people
   who, perhaps, do not even know their guilty lord, still less whole
   cities and countries without distinction; that it cannot be proved from
   Holy Scripture, that a King, chosen in a legal manner by the Electors,
   is to be called a heretic if he resist the power of the Church; and
   that in any case, it is the Emperor alone who must give an account to
   God for his acts of insubordination, and not his poor subjects.
   Therefore such an unjust curse as this Interdict shall be turned into a
   blessing on the heads which it strikes; and, for their oppression, God
   shall exalt them on high. Finally, they proclaimed the principle, that
   he who professes the true articles of the Christian faith, and only
   sins against the power of the Pope, is by no means to be counted a
   heretic. [27]

   What impression these free-spoken writings made upon the clergy is not
   known: it is only recorded that, through the exertions of Tauler and
   his friends, the people were enabled to die in peace, and no longer
   feared the ban, whereas before many thousands had died without shrift,
   in the agonies of despair; whence we must conclude that some of the
   other priests were brought to see the truth of the principles
   enunciated by the three monks. But it was not likely that such doctrine
   would long be suffered to work unchecked in the public mind. The Pope
   soon interfered, and commanded the Bishop of Strasburg to burn the
   books of the three friends, and forbid their perusal, whether by
   priests or laymen, on pain of excommunication. Berthold, anxious to
   prove his devotion to the Pope, without delay proceeded to take
   stringent measures against Tauler and the two high dignitaries who had
   done such good service in his diocese; their writings were everywhere
   searched for and destroyed, and they themselves were expelled from the
   city. It is not to be wondered at, that Henry of Nordlingen should
   write word that his "Brother Tauler is now constantly in great sorrow,"
   when he was thus driven from the field of faithful labours at the very
   moment of their greatest necessity. But he did not lose courage; with
   his two friends he retired into the neighbouring Carthusian convent, of
   which Ludolph was Prior, whence they continued to diffuse their
   writings.

   During the time of their seclusion, Strasburg was visited by the
   Emperor Charles IV., who was making the circuit of the Rhenish cities,
   to induce the citizens to acknowledge him as King of Rome. Bishop
   Berthold had already conjured the members of the Rhenish Estates
   assembled at Strasburg, for the sake of the public peace, to do
   allegiance to the Emperor whom they despised. Charles was therefore
   received with royal honours, and invested the Bishop with the imperial
   fief, after receiving his solemn homage; but he was obliged to promise
   the citizens that he would procure the removal of the Interdict, for
   only on this condition would they acknowledge him. From Strasburg
   Charles proceeded to Basle, where he met the Pope's Envoy bringing a
   commission to the Bishop of Bamberg to absolve the cities that should
   acknowledge the Emperor. But the terms of the Bull to this effect, in
   which Louis was called a heretic, and the cities were required to
   express their contrition for their fidelity to him, irritated the
   burghers to the highest degree, and they refused to swear to the
   formula of absolution when it was read to them. Nevertheless, as the
   Emperor stood in need of their services, the Interdict was removed. The
   Bishop of Bamberg next repaired, in his quality of Papal Legate, to
   Strasburg, to proclaim the Absolution there. The citizens were
   assembled before the Cathedral, then rising in its new glories. From
   the steps of the western door the Legate read the Bull in their ears,
   and then asked the Senate and commoners if they desired absolution?
   Peter Schwarber, the Mayor, replied, "Yes," in the name of all; and the
   Bishop immediately pronounced the Absolution. On this the Bishop
   Berthold, turning to the Mayor, said, "Master Schwarber, once you
   helped to force us to pay homage to the heretic Louis; and now that he
   is dead you yourself hold him to be a heretic." But the Mayor replied,
   "My Lord Bishop, I have never accounted the Emperor Louis a heretic."
   "How!" exclaimed Berthold, "have you not just declared him such?" "No,"
   said Schwarber: "the Bishop of Bamberg asked if we desired absolution,
   and to this I said, Yes,' in the name of all. Had he asked whether we
   believed and would observe all the articles he read to us, we should
   have given him a very different answer."

   During the visit of the Emperor to Strasburg he heard much talk of
   Tauler and his friends, and their free opinions, and sent for them to
   hear their defence. They read before him their confession of faith, and
   unshrinkingly declared their adherence to all that they had hitherto
   taught. Tauler, especially, was not a man to quail before a temporal
   sovereign after he had braved the more formidable terrors of the
   spiritual power; moreover, we find that he did not scruple occasionally
   in his sermons to rebuke the oppression of the people by their rulers
   [28] ; and he openly told the Emperor wherefore he was banished. The
   arguments of the three monks produced such an impression upon Charles,
   that he is said to have declared himself "sheer of their opinion," and
   expressed his desire that no further proceedings should be taken
   against them. Nevertheless the Bishops present condemned, as heretical,
   the doctrines we have already mentioned as contained in their writings,
   commanded them no longer so wickedly to withstand the Church and her
   Interdict, enjoined them to issue a public recantation, and for the
   future to write nothing more of the like nature on pain of
   excommunication. Specklin declares that they went on and wrote still
   better than before; but nothing more is known of the matter beyond this
   meagre statement of his.

   From this time forward, Tauler disappears from the history of his
   native city, until a short time before his death. It is said that,
   since the Emperor and Bishops forbade him to write, he forsook
   Strasburg, after having spread much good doctrine abroad in Alsace, His
   name was held in grateful remembrance, not only by the "Friends of
   God," but by all his fellow-citizens, for whom he had faithfully
   laboured and suffered during the whole period of their troubles; but he
   needed a sphere of greater freedom, and therefore took up his residence
   in Cologne, a city already familiar to him, and where he found numerous
   brethren in spirit. Here he commonly preached in the church of St.
   Gertrude, belonging to a convent of Dominican nuns, whose numbers were
   much increased by the desire of having Tauler for a preacher and
   confessor. Among these sisters, however, their original strictness of
   manners no longer prevailed, and Tauler often found occasion in his
   sermons to lament the decay of conventual discipline. The younger
   sisters too often brought with them from the world their love of
   society and amusements, and were strengthened in these tastes by their
   intercourse with the older nuns; for most of them thought more of dress
   and trinkets than of devout exercises and self-denial, so that Tauler
   tells them that all their piety is a mere outward semblance, and that
   many laywomen are much farther advanced in holiness than they. Tauler
   not only displayed his customary zeal in restoring a severer
   discipline, but endeavoured to substitute for these mere outward works
   of piety the spiritual, which he regarded as the only true service of
   God. He sought also, while in Cologne, to combat the pantheistic
   enthusiasm of the Beghards, who had been extremely numerous in this
   city ever since the commencement of the century, and, notwithstanding,
   or perhaps rather favoured by, frequent persecutions, in which many of
   their members were burnt at the stake, were continuing to make progress
   during this age of anarchy. [29] In the year 1357 (therefore during
   Tauler's residence in Cologne), the Archbishop, William of Gennep,
   instituted a fresh search after them, and commanded the clergy of his
   diocese strictly to enforce the statutes of his predecessors against
   them. Tauler, however, though a Dominican, never took part in any act
   of persecution; the profound spiritual struggles through which he had
   had to pass, had taught him how deep the roots of belief lay beneath
   those regions of the soul that can be reached by outward weapons; and
   when he speaks of the "Free Spirits," it is to show the error of their
   doctrines, not to demand their extirpation. Indeed, his writings, and
   those of his disciple Rulman Merswin, exhibit in this respect a
   Christian largeness of heart in great contrast to the prevailing spirit
   of his Order. They more than once maintain the salvation of those who
   are in error from ignorance, and declare that their desire to believe
   what is true is accepted by God in place of a correct belief, and that
   thus many heathen and Jews are saved now as well as before the coming
   of Christ. Rulman Merswin ascribes the terrible persecution of the
   Jews, then raging, to the covetousness of the Christians. [30]

   Tauler continued to correspond with Nicolas of Basle. In the year 1356
   the latter sent him a pamphlet, in which, on the strength of a warning
   vision, he bewails the sinfulness of the times, and foretells the
   coming of fresh calamities, of which the great earthquake that
   destroyed Basle in the same year was regarded as the commencement. No
   details of Tauler's work in Cologne have been preserved to us. It is
   not even known whether the composition of his chief work, the
   "Imitation of Christ's life of Poverty," is to be referred to this
   period or to that of his seclusion in the Carthusian Convent at
   Strasburg. In this work he sets forth the theory and practice of
   self-renunciation in order to union with God. In point of language and
   composition, it is superior to his Sermons, nearly all of which seem to
   be derived from mere notes taken by his hearers with more or less
   correctness. [31] It is interesting to compare his view of poverty with
   that of the Spiritual Franciscans, who taught that, to any high
   attainment in the Christian life, a literal renunciation of all
   property was absolutely necessary. Tauler, while assuming the
   excellence of this external poverty, as releasing the Christian from
   many cares and temptations to anxiety, shows that the essence of the
   poverty of Christ did not, as they taught, lie in this privation of
   earthly wealth, but in the poorness of the spirit that calls nothing
   its own, because itself and all that it has are God's, and held in
   trust for Him.

   Of Tauler's history we know no more till we find him at Strasburg, in
   1361, already labouring under the illness which closed his life. There
   are no indications of the date or the reason of his return to his old
   home. We are only told that, after a long life of toilsome yet fruitful
   labour, he was attacked, at seventy years of age, by a lingering
   disease, attended with great suffering. During his illness he caused
   himself to be removed to the convent where his aged sister was a nun,
   that she might be with him and tend him to the last,--an act which is
   enumerated as one of his faults, by one of the writers of his school,
   who calls it seeking for too much natural help and comfort.

   After twenty weeks of pain, he sent for his mysterious friend, and
   begged him to visit him once more, for he perceived that his end was
   nigh. The man was obedient, and came to the Master, who received him
   full lovingly; and the man was glad that he found him yet alive, and
   said, "Dear Master, how fares it with thee?" Then said the Master,
   "Dear son, I believe the time is near when God is minded to take me
   from this world; therefore, dear son, it is a great comfort to me that
   thou shouldst be here at my departure." On this, Tauler gave him some
   papers, in which he had written down the discourse which they had had
   together twenty years before, and begged Nicolas to make a little book
   of it, which the latter promised him to do. But Tauler earnestly
   enjoined him to conceal both their names; "for," he says, "thou must
   surely know that the life and words and works which God hath wrought
   through me, a poor unworthy sinner, are not mine, but wrought by the
   power of the Almighty God, to whom they eternally belong. Therefore,
   dear son, if thou art minded to write them for the benefit of our
   fellow-Christians, do it in such a manner that neither my name nor
   thine be mentioned therein. Thou mayst say, The Master and the Man.'
   Neither shalt thou let any one in this city see the book, else people
   will mark that it was I; but take it with thee into thine own country,
   so that it do not come out during my life." For yet eleven days, it is
   said that they held much discourse together; and then, under
   circumstances of extraordinary suffering, the faithful servant yielded
   up his spirit to God, on the 16th of June 1361. He was buried in his
   own convent. The stone which formerly covered his grave has been
   recently set up by the Protestants in the church in which he warned and
   consoled his brethren more than five hundred years ago by word of
   mouth, as he teaches us, who are now living, by the written record of
   those words.

   Here ends our proper task; but it can hardly, I think, be without
   interest to the reader to learn a few more particulars about the
   remarkable set of men to which Tauler belonged, especially concerning
   the great Layman who had so powerful an influence on his career, and
   the disciple and bosom friend of both successively, Rulman Merswin, who
   appears to stand third in rank in this group of "Friends of God." From
   the account of him given in the "Memorial" of the Gruenen-Worth
   Convent, it appears that he was originally a wealthy merchant and
   money-changer, "but always conducted his business with great fear of
   God before his eyes, and with scrupulous probity, and stood well with
   the world, and was of a very merry and pleasant temper, so that many
   esteemed and loved him, and sought his society, which was to himself
   also very agreeable in those days. And he had at the first an exceeding
   beautiful and sweet young wife; but when they had lived but a short
   time together, she died; and after that, he took another wife, the
   daughter of a pious knight. And when they had lived many years together
   according to Christian ordinances, and he was now forty years old, and
   God saw not fit to give him a child by either wife, he turned with his
   whole heart to God, and gave up his trade, and forsook the world, and
   led a single life henceforward, with the will and consent of his wife,
   who was an honourable simple-minded Christian woman."

   His own account of the next four years of his life, now printed for the
   first time from the ms. in his own handwriting, is a very curious and
   interesting document, in the vivid picture it gives of the inward
   struggles which this determination brought upon him; and however
   clearly we may perceive that many of his difficulties arose from the
   mistaken view of his social duties derived from the teachings of his
   church, it is impossible not to admire the simple directness of purpose
   and intense earnestness with which he strove to follow every indication
   he could perceive of the will of God. I give a few passages from it,
   taking the liberty to omit the perpetual repetitions, which would
   render an absolutely literal translation quite unreadable. Indeed,
   Rulman's style, both in this and his other productions, has all the
   awkwardness, circumlocution, and tautology, which usually characterize
   the efforts of an utterly unlearned person to express himself.

   "In the name of God, Amen! All ye dear Christian men, I give you truly
   to know that in the year of our Lord, 1347, it came to pass that I,
   Rulman Merswin, renounced all my traffic and gains, and moreover all
   natural pleasant companionship; the which I did with good courage for
   God's sake, to the sole end that I might atone for my sins. Now, though
   I had taken this first step with good courage, and of my own free
   choice had given myself to God, yet it was with great sorrow to my
   nature afterwards; for I had enjoyed great happiness in the good things
   of this world." After describing the dreadful anguish of mind he had to
   endure on account of his sins, and the spiritual joys with which it
   alternated, he continues: "And I came utterly to hate the world and all
   belonging to it, and also my own flesh, wherefore during this first
   year I chastised my body with very sore and manifold exercises, so that
   I more than once became so weak, that I thought I should die. But about
   this time I took Tauler for my confessor, who discovered somewhat of
   these exercises, for he perceived that I had become very sickly; and he
   feared for my head, and commanded me to exercise myself no more in such
   wise, and set me a certain time; and I must needs obey him, but my
   obedience went very much against the grain, for I had set my heart upon
   bringing my body into subjection. But as soon as the term was out, I
   said nothing, but began again to do as I had done before. . . . But our
   Lord was pleased, during this first year, to give me a true discernment
   in many things, so that whenever I commended any matter with great
   earnestness to God, He gave me to perceive what I must do and leave
   undone. Moreover, our Lord also suffered me to be ofttimes tormented
   with grievous and horrible temptations, both by day and night; but it
   was given to me, by the grace of God, to receive them with humble and
   cheerful submission, so that I could say with heart and mouth, My Lord
   and my God, my nature hates and loathes this suffering; wherefore I
   pray thee to take no account thereof, and do not as my poor nature
   would desire and entreat of thee, but fulfil thy most blessed will,
   whether it be sweet or bitter to my weak nature.' . . . And when God
   saw that it was the proper time, He came to my help with his merciful
   grace. . . . Now, during the second and the third years (this last was
   the jubilee, when all men went on pilgrimage to Rome), did God work
   many great and supernatural works with me, a poor sinner, through great
   sorrow and spiritual assaults, and withal unspeakable temptations, of
   which it were a sin to write. But one which I may write is, that God
   suffered me to be assailed with unbelief: to wit, that the devil put it
   into my head to ask: How may it be, that the Father and the Son and the
   Holy Spirit may consist in one nature?' And this unbelief remained upon
   me for a long space, and all that time I thought nothing else but that
   I must certainly burn for ever in hell; and yet I felt within myself
   that nevertheless my will was set to love God. And after a good while,
   I grew so infirm, through this continual pain, that it was all I could
   do, when Assumption day came, to venture to go and sit down to hear a
   sermon. And as I put my hat before my eyes, I fell into a swoon from
   very weakness; but while I was thus in a trance, there appeared unto me
   a great stone, wherein were carved the likeness of three men's
   countenances. . . . And it was as though a voice said to me, Now mayest
   thou well believe, since thou hast seen how in one stone may be three
   persons, and yet it is one stone, and the three persons have the nature
   of one rock.' And hereupon I came to myself, and was seized with fear
   when I found myself sitting among the crowd. . . . So I rose up and
   went out into the aisle, and found that my faith had been enlightened,
   insomuch that I never again was assailed with unbelief; but the other
   terrible temptations I had to endure for two years longer . . .
   insomuch that I often thought I knew the pains of hell. And I was so
   ill that my friends would not suffer me to go on pilgrimage to Rome;
   neither could I scourge myself nor wear a hair shirt, nor a sharp
   crucifix, nor endure any other hardship . . . but feared that I should
   die, and was somewhat troubled thereat, for I could not but love my
   natural life. . . . And in all those two years God would not suffer me
   to speak of my pain to any man, however great it might be . . . I must
   bear and endure to the end alone, that I might have no help or
   consolation. . . . But in the fourth year, my Lord and God showed his
   great mercy upon me, and looked upon my affliction, and came to my help
   with such great and superhuman joy, that in that moment I forgot all my
   woe and pain that ever I had suffered, and became also in all my
   natural powers quite strong and lively, as though I had never known
   what sickness was. . . . And he gave me, moreover, much gracious
   discernment, so that, when I looked narrowly at a man, I could ofttimes
   perceive pretty well how it stood with him inwardly. And I was further
   constrained, however unwilling, to write a little book for the benefit
   of my fellow Christians." From a comparison of dates, it appears that
   this "little book" must be the Book of the Nine Rocks, already
   mentioned. In the opening of this work, Rulman, under the allegorical
   form of visions, gives a much more detailed account of the mental
   conflicts he passed through, arising partly from reluctance to
   contemplate the wretchedness around him, partly from the dread of being
   condemned by the church as unauthorized to teach and heretical,--before
   he could resolve to write. Finally, seeing no escape from what appeared
   to him a positive duty, he sets to work. The first part contains a
   description of the terrible condition of Christendom; all classes are
   passed under review, and their particular sins exposed,--those of the
   clergy with especial freedom. [32] The second part is a description of
   nine rocks which symbolize nine stages in the progress of the soul
   towards a higher life; each more difficult of ascent, and more glorious
   than the preceding. From the summit, he obtains a momentary glimpse
   into the abyss of Deity; then, looking back to earth, sees two men, the
   one bright and shining as an angel, the other black as Satan. The
   latter was one who, having reached the summit of the nine rocks, had
   desired to be somewhat for himself, and had thereupon fallen step by
   step back into the abyss; the former, one who having gazed at the
   Godhead, filled with love and compassion, descended voluntarily to save
   his brethren from their sins.

   In his autobiography, Rulman further tells us, among other things: "In
   this fourth year, the three powers of faith, hope, and love were
   greatly strengthened in me. . . . Moreover, nothing in time or eternity
   could give me content but God Himself; but when He came to my soul, I
   knew not whether I were in time or eternity. . . . And in my heart I
   felt a great yearning, and wished it were the will of God that I might
   go to the heathen and tell them of the Christian faith. . . . And I
   would gladly have suffered death and martyrdom at their hands, in
   honour of our Lord's sufferings and bitter death. But of all this I was
   not suffered to speak a word to any, until there came a time when God
   gave a man in the Oberland to understand that he should come down to
   me. And when he came, God gave me to tell him of all these things. And
   this man was altogether unknown to the world, but he became my secret
   friend, and I gave myself up to his guiding in God's stead, and told
   him all my hidden life in these four years. . . . Then he said to me:
   Behold, dear friend, here is a book in which stand written the first
   five years of my life in God; give me the history of thy first four
   years in exchange for it.' But I answered: It would grieve me much if
   my history should come to the knowledge of any.' Then he said: Now see,
   I have given thee my book, and I know full well that thou wilt tell
   none of it. No more will I tell any of thee. I will take thy book up
   into my own land far away, where thou art as unknown as I am in
   Strasburg. And so begin to write thy history in two books, and the one
   I will take and the other thou shalt keep, and shalt hang thy seal
   thereto, and lock it up where none shall find it during thy lifetime.'
   . . .

   "Now, notwithstanding all the gifts and enlightenment that God bestowed
   on me in this fourth year, there was yet a secret spot in my soul, the
   which was altogether unknown to myself. . . . And it was, that, when I
   looked upon my fellow-men, I esteemed them as they were in this present
   time, and stood before God in their sins; and this was a hidden spot,
   for I ought, through grace, to have regarded them, not as they now
   were, but as they might well become. . . ." In seeing a waste piece of
   ground cumbered with rubbish, and giving it as his judgment that it
   might be reclaimed and made a garden of, an inward voice reveals his
   sin to him, and rebukes him, saying: "O thou poor miserable creature!
   how strange art thou . . . how darest thou, then, to esteem, according
   to what he now is, thy fellow-man, who is made in the image of God, and
   whom Christ has made his brother in his human nature, and not rather
   deem that God may make of him a comely and excellent garden, wherein He
   himself may dwell? . . ." The rest of Rulman's narrative refers to his
   views of the condition of the Christian world, and he tells us: "It was
   revealed to me that I should no longer be so greatly exercised by the
   temptations from which I had hitherto suffered . . . but that my
   affliction henceforth should be to behold how the sheep were wandering
   abroad among the proud, unclean, ravening wolves . . . this should be
   my trial and my cross. . . ."

   Rulman, however, not only sought "to benefit his fellow-Christians" by
   his writings, but also by his deeds of active benevolence. His name
   occurs about this time as one of the managers of a hospital; he is
   mentioned as Provost of the convent of St. Argobast, and in the 16th
   century a house of Beguines in Strasburg still bears his name; but he
   is best known as the founder of the convent belonging to the Knights of
   St. John at Strasburg. After long deliberation with Nicolas, whether it
   would not be better to "devote the money to the help of poor people,
   that they might not die of hunger," Rulman, with some pecuniary
   assistance from Nicolas, bought and repaired the half-ruined convent of
   Gruenen-Worth, which he then endowed and made over to the Order of St.
   John, on condition that its worldly affairs should be managed by three
   lay trustees, and that it should be a refuge for any good men, whether
   priests or laymen, rich or poor, who might wish to retire there for
   their spiritual benefit, and were willing, during their stay, to
   conform to the customs of the house. His principal motive seems indeed
   to have been the desire to provide a permanent asylum for pious persons
   like himself, whose free opinions might at any moment bring them into
   trouble. He entered on possession of it in 1366, and continued to live
   there till his death in July 1382, having, however, two years before,
   built himself a solitary cell close to the church, because he thought
   that he took too much earthly delight in the society of his brethren of
   the convent. He was buried, with his wife, who had also retired to a
   convent, and had died twelve years before, in the choir of the church
   he built.

   It is much to be regretted that the autobiography of Nicolas should not
   have been preserved, like that of his disciple, or at least has not as
   yet been found. Though, however, we are thus deprived of the secret
   history of his mind, we are able to learn a good deal respecting his
   work and mode of life from his Story of the Four Men who lived with
   him, and the recently discovered letters. Still these notices are very
   fragmentary, and his history is mixed up with so much of a marvellous
   and half-legendary character, that in many cases it is difficult to
   make out the actual facts. He appears at all events to have been the
   leader and centre of a distinct association of "Friends of God." That,
   even before the date at which he began to collect associates round him,
   he was regarded as a remarkably holy and enlightened man, is proved by
   the circumstance that two of the four men whose inward history he
   relates, having known him in their youth, came to him for help when
   they found themselves in spiritual perplexity. At an early period he
   began to cast his eye upon those whom he thought he could influence for
   good. In 1340, when, as he lived till the beginning of the following
   century, he must have been still comparatively a young man, he went on
   his mission to Tauler: about 1350, when the latter had left Strasburg,
   began his connexion with Rulman Merswin and probably with Berthold von
   Rohrbach, who was burnt at Spire, in 1356, for preaching that a layman
   enlightened by God was as competent to teach others as the most learned
   priest. About the same time he was in Hungary, and appears also to have
   sojourned in Italy. The four men already mentioned joined themselves to
   him one after the other. The second of them had been an intimate friend
   of Nicolas from his youth; he was a man of large property, and early
   married to a beautiful wife, by whom he had two children. After a few
   years of happiness, however, he began to suffer from the scruples by
   which pious Catholics have been so often tormented, and to doubt
   whether he ought not to renounce his domestic joys in order to do
   penance for his sins; but Nicolas, to whom he came for counsel,
   enjoined him to remain true to his duties as a husband and father; and
   it was not until after the death of his wife and both his children that
   he took up his abode with his friend, and became a priest. The two
   brothers who seem to have stood next to Nicolas in consideration, were
   a learned jurist, who had been also a lay-prebend, and a converted Jew,
   named John, who both afterwards became priests.

   The little company lived together on equal terms. Nicolas tells the
   priest, when deliberating whether or not to enter a monastic Order, and
   enquiring as to his brethren's mode of life; "They observe no rules but
   such as are common to secular priests, as indeed they are, but we live
   together in common as simply as we can, and have as little to do with
   the world as we may." The priests among them seem to have had no
   peculiar vocation, except that of celebrating mass; the laymen never
   took part in the administration of the sacraments, but in all other
   respects there was no distinction between them. As all stood in a
   direct and individual relation to God, they required no priestly
   mediation; nay, the priests themselves submitted to the layman Nicolas,
   because they regarded him as the most enlightened of their number. Not
   counsel from men ought we to seek after, writes Nicolas in 1356, but
   that which proceeds from the Holy Spirit; and, so long as we have it
   from that source, it is indifferent whether it flow to us through
   priest or layman. In their religious services and fasts they did not
   strictly observe stated hours, for they regarded external observances
   as unimportant in themselves, and only excellent as a means of
   improvement, or a sign of obedience. Thus, while they admitted ascetic
   exercises and painful penances to be useful in the commencement of a
   religious life, in order to mortify the sensual inclinations, they
   declared them to be afterwards a matter of indifference, nay, sometimes
   positively contrary to the Divine will. According to Nicolas, if a man
   have attained to a certain degree of mastery over nature, then fasting,
   scourging, the wearing of iron girdles, &c., is a self-sought pain, and
   as such a sign that he does not yet allow God to work alone. Moreover,
   such tormentings may be very detrimental to the body; for though it
   must needs be brought into subjection to the spirit, yet it ought not
   to be robbed of its strength; for how else should a man support the
   fatigue of the labours and travels that the "Friends of God" are so
   often called to undertake?

   Their doctrine on this point would seem to us more judicious than their
   practice, for it is evident from their writings that they frequently,
   in fact, carried their austerities so far as to endanger life or
   reason. But Nicolas admirably draws the line between suffering that is
   self-imposed, and that which God lays upon us. The latter, whether it
   consist in outward affliction or inward temptation, we are to take
   joyfully, for it is a proof that God's grace is at work within us;
   Christ, who has endured to the last extremity for man, loves pain, and
   will not spare it to his friends. The main thing is that we should find
   all things good in God, and look at things not as they appear to the
   world, but as they are in God's sight. When some of the Strasburg
   brethren of St. John argue that singing and reading in the chapel at
   fixed hours will hinder them in contemplation, they are censured for it
   by Nicolas, who tells them that these acts are prescribed by the rules
   of their Order, and though they have in themselves no merit, yet, if
   done from obedience, they cannot hinder the motions of grace; even
   while outwardly busy, God may be worshipped by us in spirit and in
   truth, if we put no selfish, carnal thoughts between our souls and Him.
   And when Nicolas von Laufen takes umbrage at the secular manners of
   some of his brethren who ride about on horseback clad in short coats,
   the Layman remarks that he has not yet learnt to find all things right
   in God, but clings too much to outward distinctions. So, again, the
   renunciation of the world does not in his opinion involve the absolute
   giving up of earthly possessions, as was taught in his day by the
   Franciscan Spiritualists and others, nor the violent rending asunder of
   social ties. Let him who is in an Order that makes poverty a rule, obey
   that rule; but he who can rightfully hold property is at liberty to
   retain it, if only he do not seek his own ends in the use thereof, but
   God alone. Thus these "Friends of God" do not appear to have renounced
   all control over their property, but merely to have thrown what they
   regarded as superfluous into a common stock, which was applied to the
   building of their house and church, to purposes of charity, to defray
   the expenses of their missionary journeys, &c. This common stock was
   managed by their trustworthy steward Ruprecht, who was the chief if not
   sole medium of communication between Nicolas and his Strasburg friends.

   From their seclusion, however, they kept a watchful eye upon all that
   was passing in the world around them, went out to those whom there
   seemed a prospect of winning over, and exercised no inconsiderable
   influence upon those who had put themselves under their spiritual
   guidance. This was the case with many who did not even know Nicolas by
   name. Thus, Henry von Wolfach, the Master of the Brethren of St. John
   in Strasburg, and even the Grand Master of the Order in Germany, Conrad
   von Brunsberg, and many others, desire his counsel to solve their
   doubts and direct their proceedings. Messengers from Nicolas seem to
   have been perpetually travelling about, who brought him letters from
   the "Friends of God," so that he kept up a constant communication, not
   only with those in the neighbouring regions but also with the brethren
   on the Rhine, in Lorraine, in Italy, and in Hungary. In this manner he
   became acquainted both with public events and likewise with the private
   affairs of individuals; so, for instance, he made very remarkable
   revelations to an Augustinian monk in Strasburg respecting one of his
   penitents. These messengers had certain secret signs by which they
   recognized each other. Thus, Rulman Merswin was made aware of the
   presence of Ruprecht, by hearing a peculiar cough when he was in
   church. Nicolas himself took extraordinary precautions to remain
   undiscovered, and with such success, that, after Rulman's death, the
   brethren at the Gruenen-Worth, who had previously received many letters
   from him, were never able to discover his retreat. When those with whom
   he corresponded desired to enter into personal communication with him,
   he usually refused it, simply saying that it could not be. This was the
   case with the vicar of the Bishop of Strasburg, John von Schaftolsheim,
   with the Master of the Brethren of St. John, in Strasburg, and even
   with Conrad von Brunsberg. In 1363, he writes that for twenty years he
   had only been able to reveal himself to one person, and not until God
   should take this one from him would he seek another; which probably
   signifies that in each city he had but one confidential person, through
   whom he corresponded with all who desired his counsel. Meanwhile he was
   active by means of his pen: in 1356, as we have seen, Tauler received
   from him a tractate on the decay of true religion. The alphabetical
   list of rules which he had given to Tauler in 1340, he sent in 1369 to
   the priests at Gruenen-Worth, and in 1371 to Rulman's secretary,
   Nicolas von Laufen; to the same priests he sent the History of Tauler;
   and in 1377, to the Brethren of St. John, he sends the book containing
   the History of the Five Brethren. It is to these circumstances that we
   owe the proof of the authenticity of Tauler's life, and the possibility
   of identifying the "man" there mentioned with "the secret friend," who
   meets us in the writings relating to Rulman Merswin.

   Up to 1367, Nicolas and his companions dwelt in a "city in the
   Oberland," most likely Basle; but in that year, finding it "not
   helpful" "to live among the common people," they determined on retiring
   into utter seclusion; principally, no doubt, in order to carry on their
   work unwatched and undisturbed. In accordance with a dream, as they
   tell us, which commanded them to take their black dog for a guide, they
   fixed on a site high up on a mountain, far away from any human
   habitation. This mountain was situated in the dominions of the Duke of
   Austria, and for two leagues round there was no town. A messenger whom
   they sent to the Duke, to request his permission to settle here, was
   taken prisoner in the wars then raging in those countries, and a year
   had elapsed before they were able to obtain his release. He, however,
   then brought back the required permission, and they began to build
   their house, in which each was to have his own spacious apartment, and
   there were also to be chambers for the reception of foreign brethren as
   guests; but they were prevented from finishing the edifice, by the
   political disturbances in the neighbourhood, so that it remained at a
   standstill for seven years, and the "Friends" gave up all idea of
   completing it.

   The political and ecclesiastical feuds by which the Papal court was
   distracted excited a lively but melancholy interest in Nicolas, who
   constantly predicts in his letters that they must bring down still
   heavier judgments at God's hand than even those which had already
   visited the world; but when, after his long residence in Avignon,
   Gregory XI. returned to Rome in 1376, a ray of hope that it might yet
   be possible to restore unity and concord to the afflicted Church seems
   to have dawned upon his mind, and he felt called on to make a personal
   effort to influence the Pope himself. Accordingly, as we learn from a
   letter to Henry von Wolfach, in the February of 1377 it was resolved by
   the "Friends" that Nicolas and the Jurist should repair to Rome; the
   Jew, John, offered to raise funds to defray the expenses of the journey
   from among his relatives,--Jews who harboured a secret inclination
   towards Christianity. The severity of the Alpine winter and an attack
   of illness which befell Nicolas, now above seventy years of age, caused
   the journey to be postponed till the end of March. I extract from the
   account of the "Friends of God" given in Rulman Merswin's Briefbuch
   [33] the following narrative of their mission and its results: "And
   when they came to Rome, the Layman (Rulman's secret friend) [34] made
   inquiry after a Roman whom he had known a long time before, and found
   him yet living. And this Roman received the two Friends of God' in a
   very friendly fashion, and would take no denial, but they, with their
   servants, and horses, and carriages, must lodge with him so long as
   their affairs kept them in Rome; and he entertained them most
   courteously with all manner of good cheer. Then he said to the Layman:
   Methinks it is somewhat strange that thou in thine old age shouldst
   come to court from such a distant land, unless it be upon some urgent
   occasion.' Then the Layman answered: So it is: we must speak to our
   Holy Father upon very weighty affairs.' Then said the Roman: I shall be
   able to bring you into his presence, for I am very familiar with him,
   and often dine at his table.' And he procured that the Pope should give
   them a privy hearing on the third day after. . . So they came into the
   presence of Pope Gregory, and the Jurist spoke to him in Latin, and the
   Layman in Italian, since he could not speak Latin, and said, among much
   other discourse: Holy Father, there be many grievous and heinous crimes
   wrought throughout Christendom by all degrees of men, whereby God's
   anger is greatly provoked; thou oughtest to consider how to put an end
   to these evils.' But he answered: I have no power to amend matters.'
   Then they told him of his own secret faults, which had been revealed to
   them of God by certain evident tokens, and said, Holy Father, know of a
   truth, that if you do not put away your evil doings and utterly amend
   your ways, you shall die within a year,' as also came to pass. When the
   Pope heard these words of rebuke, he was enraged beyond measure; but
   they answered and said: Holy Father, take us captive, and if we cannot
   give you evident tokens, then kill us and do what you will with us.' .
   . . And when they declared to him these tokens, he rose up from his
   throne, and embraced them and kissed them on the mouth, and said to the
   Layman, Let us talk together in Italian, since thou canst not speak
   Latin.' And they had much loving discourse together; and among other
   things the Pope said, Could you tell the Emperor as much as you have
   told me, you would indeed do a good service to Christendom.' And
   afterwards the Pope prayed the two Friends of God' that they should
   stay with him in Rome, and he offered to provide them all things
   needful, and also to follow their counsel. But they answered, Holy
   Father, suffer us to return home; and we will be at all times obedient
   to come if you send for us. For we seek no earthly gain, nor have we
   come hither for the sake of such; we seek only God's glory and the
   welfare of Christendom above all the perishable gifts of this present
   time.' Then he inquired of them where their home might be; and when
   they said, We have long dwelt in such a town,' he marvelled that such
   Friends of God' should dwell among the common people. Thereupon they
   told him [all that had happened], and how they had been hindered in
   their building. Then the Pope would have given them a bishopric and
   other revenues and grants, but they would not have them. . . . [But the
   Pope gave them letters recommending their cause to the Bishop and
   clergy of their diocese.] Now when these two dear Friends of God' had
   settled their affairs with the Pope, and desired to depart from Rome,
   their host would not suffer them to pay for anything that they had had
   in his house . . . and moreover gave the layman a good ambling horse
   instead of the heavy carriage in which he had come, saying that a
   soft-paced horse would be much easier for him to ride over the high
   mountains than the carriage, seeing that he was old and weakly. Now
   afterward the Pope was unmindful of God's message, and obeyed it not,
   and died that same year as they had prophesied--to wit, about the
   fourth week in Lent, 1378."

   On returning to their mountain, they found that the Bishop of their
   diocese was sojourning in a city thirteen leagues distant. It was
   resolved that the two who had been with the Pope should ride with his
   letter to the Bishop to entreat aid for the completion of their house.
   The prelate received them favourably, and gave them letters to the
   clergy of the town that lay nearest to their estate. On this, all the
   five brethren repaired thither, where the priests read from the pulpit
   the letters of recommendation which they had brought from the Pope and
   the Bishop. The magistrates also took up their cause, promising to send
   them armed men to protect their settlement in time of disturbance, and
   offering them besides a house in the town for a temporary abode, and in
   which they could also take refuge if necessary; and further sent them
   on leaving a complimentary present of fish and wine by the hand of
   their officers. Three foreign brethren, who had for some time cherished
   the wish to be received into their society, made over to them the whole
   of their property, in order to finish the house and erect the church.
   Thus aided, the little band were at length able to settle down in the
   home they had chosen. But, as far as we can gather from the obscure
   traces of their subsequent history, it does not appear that they were
   allowed to enjoy for more than a few years the retreat for which they
   had sighed so long.

   In the same year (1377), Nicolas learns from several foreign "Friends
   of God" that the Church is on the point of falling into great peril,
   doubtless from the growing discord which threatened all the convulsions
   of anarchy; and he foresees that things may come to pass which would
   constrain the "Friends of God" to separate and divide themselves over
   the world; but in the meantime their part is to remain in concealment
   till "God shall do something, we know not what as yet." Meanwhile he
   entreats the prayers of his friends, for they are greatly troubled in
   mind, and know not what will come of it. It is evident from such dark
   hints as these that Nicolas and his friends now began to contemplate
   the possibility of their duty calling them to use more public means of
   influence than the private, though by no means inactive or inefficient,
   line of conduct they had hitherto pursued. They must have foreseen the
   painful collision that was impending between their deep reverence for
   the outward authority of the Church and the inward authority of the
   indwelling light. Neither can they have been without forebodings of the
   martyr's doom, which actually befell all those of whose fate any traces
   are left; though we may well believe, from all we know of them, that
   this would occasion them far less anxiety and distress than the
   question whether they were acting most for the interests of the Church
   by continuing their present silent and therefore undisturbed efforts to
   influence the spiritual leaders of the people; or by going out among
   the people themselves, to call them to repentance, and proclaim
   doctrines which, however true, might unsettle the foundations of their
   traditional belief;--the difficulty and perplexity which in many ages
   meets and torments minds of the prophetic order.

   In the following year, the great schism that had been dimly foretold,
   broke out, and for forty years the church was divided between two
   heads; Urban VI. was elected at Rome, under the influence of terror at
   the violence of the insurgent mob; and soon after, in subservience to
   the French party, Clement VII. et Fondi, who immediately hastened to
   Avignon. When these tidings reached the "Friends of God," it seemed to
   them that the time was come when the threatened judgments of God were
   about to burst over the world. It was, indeed, intelligence fitted to
   shake all hearts, for, as the brethren of Gruenen-Worth write: "After
   God has been warning the world for these forty years past, by deadly
   diseases and earthquakes, famines, and a wild, masterless folk, [35]
   laying waste many lands, He is now sending us a plague that is worse
   than all the rest, because it attacks our faith; namely, the
   dissensions of Christendom, in which all the wisdom of nature, of
   Scripture, and of the grace of the Holy Spirit is so utterly dried up
   and extinct, that all our learned doctors and wise priests have lost
   their way, and know not which to choose of these two Popes, that they
   may help to bring back unity to Christendom, and peace to the See of
   Rome." Their Master wished in this perplexity to repair for counsel to
   the "Friends of God," but Nicolas forbade him, saying: "Have you not
   the Holy Scripture? Are you not a professor in the chair? Why should
   you ask counsel from the creature? Stop, and wait till God Himself
   shall constrain you to come to us. It is not yet time for us to reveal
   ourselves; but it may soon come to pass that we slip from our covert,
   to be scattered abroad over the world, and if so, I shall come to
   Strasburg and make myself known to you."

   It is, however, evident that the "Friends of God," though concealed,
   were by no means passive at this time; what special plans they
   cherished are unknown, but that they had such is clear from all their
   proceedings. So early as November 1377, Nicolas had been with the
   priest, John, in Metz, on some business with which we are not
   acquainted. During 1378, much consultation by means of messengers and
   letters must have taken place, for on the 17th of March, in the
   following year, Nicolas (as he relates in a letter to Henry von
   Wolfach), with seven other brethren, met in some wild place high up
   among the mountains, near a chapel hewn out in a rock, close to which a
   priest dwelt with two young brethren in a little hermitage. Four out of
   the seven were laymen, the other three ordained priests. Nicolas,
   whether from humility or not, speaks of himself as one of the least
   among them. From his letter it would seem that the chief purpose of
   this meeting was united prayer to God, to avert the "dreadful storm"
   that was menacing the Christian world, that there might be space left
   for amendment. A week was devoted to these supplications; every
   afternoon the brethren went out into the forest, and sat down "beside a
   fair brook," to converse upon the matters on which they had come
   hither. At length, on the last day, while thus assembled, a storm of
   wind came on, followed by a thick darkness, which they took for a work
   of the evil spirits. After the storm had lasted an hour, there came a
   pleasant light, and the sweet voice of an invisible angel announced to
   them that God had heard their prayer, and stayed his chastisements for
   a year; but when this was ended, they should entreat Him no more, for
   the Father would no longer delay to take vengeance on the despisers of
   His Son. After this the "Friends of God" returned back again each to
   his own place. Respecting the course they resolved to pursue, all that
   we can make out from the vague hints in the letters of Nicolas is, that
   they interpreted the promise of the angel to mean that they were to
   wait a year longer before quitting their concealment and taking an open
   and active part in the affairs of the world; the only thing that is
   distinctly stated is, that it was resolved once more to try the effect
   of personal remonstrances with the Pope. Nicolas himself was entrusted
   with this mission, which, however, from some unknown cause, was not
   carried out. Meanwhile, according to the intelligence received from the
   brethren in foreign parts respecting the progress of the schism,
   affairs were assuming a more and more gloomy aspect; the confusion and
   perplexity occasioned by the presence of two Popes was continually
   increasing; the Christian world was splitting into two parties; even
   the secular authority was in danger of disruption and subversion. The
   time drew nearer and nearer when Nicolas believed himself called on to
   begin to work among the common people; already, in June 1379, he calls
   on the Strasburg Master to warn the people in his sermons, and hold up
   before them the testimonies of Scripture concerning their duties in
   such a crisis.

   As the end of the year approached, during which the "Friends of God"
   were to wait, they agreed to hold another meeting. All the accounts
   relating to this conference (the latest distinctly recorded
   intelligence we have respecting this extraordinary band of associates),
   are so mixed up with the symbolical and the marvellous, that it is
   extremely difficult to make out the real facts of the case. According
   to the narrative given by Nicolas to Rulman Merswin, he, with twelve
   other "Friends of God," were at Christmas 1379 warned by dreams to
   assemble together on the following Holy Thursday, at the same place
   where the seven brethren had met the year before. So early as February
   some of the foreign brethren arrived at the abode of Nicolas: one from
   the country of the "Lords of Meiglon," (probably Milan); two from
   Hungary, whom he had known thirty years before; one from Genoa, a rich
   burgher, with whom Nicolas was not previously acquainted. On Holy
   Thursday, the 22nd of March, they met at the little chapel in the rock,
   and, after receiving the sacrament on Good Friday morning, repaired, as
   before, to the wood, and sat down beside the stream to begin their
   deliberations. What passed during these conferences is only related in
   the form of marvellous visions and fantastic occurrences. After
   tempests and diabolical apparitions, a bright light surrounds the
   place, and an invisible speaker tells them that the impending plagues
   shall be stayed for three years longer, on condition of their obeying
   the injunctions contained in a letter which thereupon drops down in
   their midst. These commands are somewhat mysterious: the "Friends of
   God" are to withdraw from their ordinary communications with the world,
   except in the case of those who desire their counsel; to receive the
   sacrament three times a week, &c.; and after three years they shall
   receive further commands from God. After they have declared their
   readiness to obey the letter, they are told by the same voice to light
   a fire, and throw it in. Instead of burning, it rises up in the fire, a
   flash of lightning meets the flame, and catches up fire and letter
   together to heaven, after which there is nothing more to be seen; and
   the brethren depart to their respective homes. The brethren in the
   Oberland commence their period of retreat at Whitsuntide, after a high
   mass has been performed by the priest John in their newly-finished
   church. Nicolas writes beforehand to Rulman Merswin releasing him from
   his obedience, and recommending him to take the Master Henry von
   Wolfach for a confessor in his stead. To the latter, who had again
   applied to know what course the "Friends of God" meant to take with
   regard to the rival Popes, Nicolas replies with his usual caution, that
   the Brethren of St. John could not regulate their conduct in these
   matters by that of the "Friends of God;" for they were bound to obey
   the dictates of their superiors in the Order, while the latter had
   received many privileges from Pope Gregory, and were, moreover, only
   subject to their Bishop, who did not press them for a decision.

   It is certainly very difficult to know in what light to regard the
   marvellous accounts that meet us in the writings of Rulman and Nicolas.
   Some of them seem to be simply symbolical; for it is clear that they
   were in the habit of presenting their views of human affairs under the
   form of an allegory, supposed to be seen in a vision or dream, just as
   Bunyan does in his "Pilgrim's Progress." This is the case with Rulman's
   Book of the Nine Rocks, Christiana Ebner's vision of the Closed
   Cathedral, and some unimportant visions occurring in the letters of
   Nicolas. [36] But the case is different when wonders are related, as
   far as we can see, as simple matters of fact. That, however, the
   "Friends of God" expected, and so were ready to receive without much
   hesitation as to their reality, not only direct spiritual
   communications from the Divine Being, but also miraculous
   interpositions in physical things, is perfectly clear; and thus they
   were undoubtedly open to all the self-deception in these matters which
   may arise from intense emotion and mental excitement acting on frames
   disordered by asceticism. Swoons under the pressure of religious
   emotion are with them, as with the Methodists of the last century, a
   matter of continual occurrence; and with them, as with the early
   Methodists, seem to have been not unfrequently the crisis of a state of
   overwrought physical and mental excitement, after which they regained a
   calmer and healthier condition both of body and mind, with an addition
   of spiritual experience and enlightenment. Such an occurrence as a
   letter falling from heaven presents much greater difficulties. It is
   possible that Nicolas may have intended the whole story rather as an
   allegory than as matter of fact; if he regarded it in the latter light,
   it must have been the result either of a terribly over-strained
   imagination, or of fraud on the part of some unknown person. But to
   suppose that a man of so much simple holiness and practical wisdom as
   Nicolas appears to us, should have taken part in juggling tricks of
   such dreadful impiety in order to persuade his associates that the
   course he judged best was prescribed to them by Heaven, is, I confess,
   a larger demand upon my powers of credence than they are able to meet.
   Moreover, we must judge these accounts by the age in which they were
   produced,--an age when the mental food of the pious laity was the life
   of St. Francis with his five wounds and blasphemous "conformities" to
   the life of our Lord, and other works of a similar nature. And it must
   be remembered that the leaders of this party--Nicolas, Rulman,
   John,--were laymen whose not large stock of erudition was
   self-acquired, comparatively late in life. In the writings of the
   scholar Tauler (though, in common with all his contemporaries, he
   believes in ghosts and heavenly visions) we find scarcely a trace of
   the fanatical credulity that meets us in the letters of these lay
   friends of his, if we are to take their statements as literal and not
   symbolical representations of fact. Even so doing, however, if we
   compare them with the stories contained in the staple religious
   literature of the day, or even in the life of Suso, Tauler's companion
   and friend, Nicolas and his friends, wild as they may seem to us
   rational Protestants, will appear scarcely to leave the regions of
   sober common sense; [37] and it is remarkable that, in most of the
   practical questions that arise with regard to self-discipline, he takes
   the moderate and judicious side.

   Whatever interpretation, however, we may be inclined to put upon the
   marvellous circumstances attending the above-mentioned conference, it
   seems tolerably clear that the three years' so-called seclusion of the
   "Friends of God" was regarded by them as a time of preparation for
   their public work, when they should be "scattered abroad over
   Christendom;" and that by their retirement, they were breaking the ties
   that bound them to those who had hitherto depended on them for
   guidance, and accustoming them to act for themselves against a time
   when they should no longer have their wonted counsellors at hand.
   Probably, too, the brethren took this course partly from the desire
   that their spiritual children should not be involved in the
   persecutions which they could not but perceive to threaten themselves,
   but might continue to work for the cause of true religion in their
   respective spheres, unhindered by the suspicions of heresy, which any
   known connexion with the "Friends of God" would have brought upon them.
   Not that there is any sign of the "Friends of God" having been
   heretical in point of dogma; it was rather the remarkable freedom with
   which they criticized the conduct both of the spiritual and temporal
   authorities that was likely to bring them into trouble. Thus, in one of
   their meetings just before their retreat, the brother who had been a
   Jurist says, that if offices in Church and State were conferred in
   accordance with God's law, neither Urban nor Clement deserved to be
   Pope; the former had been appointed by the Roman mob through violent
   means, and the latter was now defending himself by similar acts of
   violence, which was contrary to justice and God's order. So likewise,
   the King of Rome had obtained the crown after a shameful fashion
   (1376), for his father had bought the votes of the electors with gold;
   how the electors could reconcile it with their oath to choose an
   inexperienced boy for their king, God only knew; with the subjects
   matters did not stand much better: they obeyed their rulers only so
   long as it served their own interests to do so; a godly life was almost
   extinct, everywhere prevailed nought but the striving after riches and
   pleasures. [38] This passage throws much light on the views and aims of
   the "Friends of God," and enables us to form an idea of what must have
   been the frequent topics of discussion among them. With the cessation
   of the correspondence between Nicolas and Rulman Merswin, ceases our
   only source of information about the "Friends of God." Their term of
   waiting expired on the 25th March 1383; and since we know, from
   contemporary history, that the course of events, instead of bringing
   brighter prospects, grew ever darker and more threatening, we seem
   justified in concluding that they now believed the time to have arrived
   for them "to go out into the five ends of the world," and work for
   Christ. Most likely they went forth as preachers of repentance, for
   there occur in the letters of Nicolas frequent comparisons of the
   present state of the world to that of Nineveh, and hints that they may
   have to act the part of Jonah. But where, and how long they did so, is
   wrapt in utter darkness. As far as we can learn, Providence did not see
   fit to bless their preaching like that of Jonah, and, to human eyes,
   their enterprise was a failure. For all we actually know respecting
   their subsequent history is, that in 1393 a certain Martin von Mayence,
   a Benedictine monk of Reichenau, in the diocese of Constance, who is
   called in the acts of his trial a disciple of Nicolas of Basle and a
   "Friend of God," was burnt at Cologne, after the same fate had befallen
   some other "Friends of God," a short time before, at Heidelberg. Active
   researches were made after Nicolas, but as he had concealed himself
   from his friends, so for a long time he was able to elude the efforts
   of his persecutors. At length, on a journey which he had undertaken
   into France, in order to diffuse his doctrines, accompanied by two of
   his disciples, James and John (the latter most likely the converted Jew
   who always appears as his bosom friend), he fell into the hands of the
   Inquisitors at Vienne, in the diocese of Poitiers. He was brought to
   trial, and persisted firmly and publicly in his heresies, the most
   "audacious" of which seems to have been that he pretended to "know that
   he was in Christ, and Christ in him." He was therefore delivered over
   to the secular power, and perished in the flames, together with his two
   disciples, who refused to be parted from him. [39]

   Since, in the trial of Martin of Mayence, Nicolas is spoken of as still
   living, his death most likely occurred subsequently to that date, but
   cannot have taken place much later, as he must then have been near
   ninety years of age. Even before this time, the Strasburg brethren had
   lost all trace of the "Friends of God," and their frequent attempts to
   discover them had proved utterly unavailing; [40] no doubt, because the
   convent which they sought to find was already deserted, and its
   inmates, whose names they had never known, were scattered abroad in
   fulfilment of their vocation. That which appears to have formed the
   chief ground of their persecution, was their effort to free the people
   from the tyranny of the clergy, and their claiming for every one
   enlightened by God the right to teach,--a claim antagonistic to the
   inmost essence of the Romish Church. And if their teaching failed to
   effect a wide reformation because it was mingled with some of the great
   errors of Rome, and in place of priestly authority over men's
   consciences set up that of their brethren, whose inspiration was often
   not less doubtful, yet we cannot but recognize in it the germs of the
   true freedom of the Gospel, as well as the great and all-essential
   truth that the Christian life does not consist in outward works, but in
   the inward union of the spirit with God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] I borrow the following note from Schmidt's "Eckart." Theolog. Stud.
   u. Krit. 1839, S. 684, An. 15. "The raising of the widow's son
   furnishes him with materials for more than one allegory. In the Second
   Sermon on the Sixteenth Sunday after Trinity, the widow is first the
   soul, and her dead son, the Reason, which our Lord animates with new
   life; afterwards a widow signifies a forsaken one, and taken in an
   abstract sense, a state of loneliness, and forthwith Eckart springs to
   the conclusion, that therefore we also must forsake all things. In the
   story of the woman of Samaria, the woman is a type of the soul, the
   five husbands whom she has had are the five senses; with these she had
   sinned, and therefore are they dead. Christ says: Bring hither thy
   husband;' this is Free-will. She replies; I have no husband;' on which
   Christ says: Thou hast well said I have no husband;' that is, her
   Free-will was not her own, but in bondage to sin, etc."

   [7] See Schmidt's Eckart. Theol. Stud. u. Krit. 1839, S. 663.

   [8] Neither is my acquaintance with Eckart extensive; but I have made
   no statement in the text which does not seem to me to be substantiated
   by what I have read of his writings.

   [9] The second Sermon in the following collection, which is undoubtedly
   by him, exhibits the mode in which he presents abstract doctrines
   clothed in a popular form, and is not an unfavourable specimen of his
   style, though even more fragmentary than some others of his discourses.

   [10] He was, for instance, accused of teaching that Hell did not exist:
   his real teaching was that it consisted in the absence of God, as
   appears from the following passage:--"It is a question, what burns in
   hell? The Masters commonly say, Self-will. But I say of a truth that
   Nought burns in hell. Whereof mark this likeness. Were you to take a
   burning coal and lay it on my hand, if I were to say that the coal
   burnt my hand I should do it a great injustice. Strictly speaking, what
   burns me is Nought; for the coal has something in it which my hand has
   not. See, it is that same Not which burns me. If my hand possessed all
   the essence and qualities of a coal, it would have altogether the
   nature of fire; and then, if you were to throw all the fire that ever
   burnt upon my hand, it would not give me pain. In like manner, I say,
   if God, and those who are in the light of His countenance, have aught
   of true blessedness which those have not who are separated from God, it
   is that same Not which tortures the souls that are in hell, more than
   any fire or than self-will."

   [11] Tauler quotes Eckart. See the Second Sermon for the Thirteenth
   Sunday after Trinity.

   [12] See Diepenbrock's Suso. Regensburg, 1829. S. 71. A very
   interesting account of Suso's life, concerning which much more is known
   than of Tauler's, is given in Ullmann's "Reformers before the
   Reformation." See p. 190, etc.

   [13] In the first part of this treatise he cites authorities from the
   heathen authors to prove the truth of Christianity to those who
   rejected the Old Testament with the New. In the second, he reviews the
   writings of the Jews, and refutes their doctrines where they are at
   variance with Christianity. The third, de Anti-Christo ac fine mundi,
   contains extracts from the prophecies of Hildegard, Joachim, and other
   medi√¶val pseudo-seers, which he treats with contempt. The whole
   treatise exhibits a vast amount of reading in the ancient classics, as
   well as the Christian and Jewish writers of the Middle Ages. This work
   was dedicated to Pope John XXII.

   [14] Only one short letter, however, has been preserved, from having
   been placed among those of Henry of Nordlingen, and it is too
   unimportant for insertion.

   [15] His letters give a lively picture of the real dangers to which his
   politics exposed him. Thus he says, "I have been called before the
   princes of this world who have proscribed me, so that there is no place
   of safety for me in this land, unless I would consent to perform mass."
   Again, he would come to Margaretha, but "I may not as yet dare to
   appear openly in this land." "If the Emperor should leave the country,
   perhaps I might be able to see thee, if it were God's will." "At
   Constance and in the neighbouring country the priests have been
   everywhere ordered to sing mass, so that I do not know where I shall be
   able to remain."

   [16] He was made Professor at the newly-established University there in
   1347.

   Of this Memorial four copies are known to exist.

   dialect of the Tractate found in his own handwriting. See Schmidt's
   Gottesfreunde, S. 32.

   [26] Both these were also writers of some note. The former was the
   author of some dry but learned commentaries on Peter Lombard's
   Sentences. The latter, who had been a professor in Paris, wrote a Vita
   Christi, which was much celebrated in the Middle Ages, and an Expositio
   in Psalterium.

   [27] The following extract on this subject is given in Professor
   Schmidt's Tauler (p. 53), from Specklin's Collectanea:-- "Specially
   were those two Articles, which were quoted, forbidden and declared to
   be wholly heretical. The First was, that seeing that many persons,
   young and old, rich and poor, men and women, innocent and wicked, when
   they came to their death-beds, lay under the ban on account of the
   Emperor Louis, they had put forth a Letter to all priests, bidding
   them, when they should visit the sick and dying, to comfort the sick
   with the bitter passion and death of Jesus Christ, who had therewith
   made satisfaction before God, not for their sins only, but for the sins
   of the whole world, and had opened heaven, and reconciled us all to
   God. And the Pope had no power to shut heaven against poor sinners who
   had innocently fallen under the ban. Therefore, when one should confess
   his sins and desire absolution and the holy sacrament, they ought to
   give it unto him and comfort him, for heed should be given rather to
   the Word of Christ and His Apostles than to the ban, which proceeded of
   envy and lust of worldly power. . . . The Second was, that they put
   forth a general epistle (not among the common people, but among the
   clergy and the learned fathers), saying that there be two swords, the
   spiritual sword, which is the Word of God, and the other, which is the
   secular government, and the one had nought to do with the other. But
   since they are both of God, they cannot be contrary the one to the
   other; but the spiritual shall be diligent in its office and in the
   Word of God, and defend the Government; and the Government shall defend
   God's laws and the pious, and punish the wicked. But since the pious
   who preach the Word of God ought, by God's ordinance, to be defended by
   the secular power against the wicked, wherefore, then, should the
   Government be condemned by the spiritual power? for then should God
   condemn His own work. But when a secular Head sins, it behoves the
   spiritual Head, with great humility, to point out unto the sinner the
   right way, and with the rest of the clergy to entreat God day and night
   with tears, that the sinner may turn again from his way, and come to a
   true knowledge of his sins; for God desireth not the death of a sinner,
   but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live. "But
   Christ, and the Apostles, and the Church command that, if the sinner,
   after much admonition, will not be turned from his ways, he be
   excommunicated till such time as he shall be converted and turn again
   and amend his life; and then he shall be again received unto grace.
   "Much less doth it behove a Christian shepherd, if one be deserving of
   excommunication, to condemn and excommunicate without distinction
   innocent persons, who perchance have never known or seen the guilty
   man,--nay, whole lands, cities, and villages; the which is not
   commanded by Christ, nor the Holy Apostles, nor the Councils, but
   Cometh of a self-usurped power. For it is the office of the Pope to
   point sinners unto the true way of salvation. "But that all those are
   heretics who will not kiss the Pope's foot, or that to do so should be
   an article of faith, and that he is an apostate from the Church who
   takes the name and fulfils the office of King or Emperor, on being duly
   appointed thereto by the Electors, or that all who render obedience to
   him, as to their ruler ordained by God, sin against the Church and are
   heretics, cannot be proved by Holy Scripture. "The Government is a
   power ordained by God, unto which obedience ought to be rendered in
   worldly things, even by spiritual persons, be they who they may. The
   Emperor is the highest magistrate, wherefore obedience is due to him;
   if he doth not govern rightly, he, and not his poor subjects, must give
   account thereof to God; and even as God will not call the poor innocent
   subject to account for his evil ruler, so ought not man to condemn and
   excommunicate the poor innocent subject for the sake of his ruler.
   Moreover, they who hold the true Christian faith, and sin only against
   the Pope's person, are no heretics; but he were a heretic who, after
   much admonition, should stiffneckedly disobey the Word of God, and
   would not amend his life; for not even a murderer, a rogue, a thief, or
   an adulterer, who should ask pardon through Christ with true penitence
   and contrition, and amend his life, can be cast out of the Church.
   "Hence it is concluded, that all those who unjustly and innocently have
   come under the Ban, are free before God, and their curse will be turned
   into a blessing, and their ban and yoke of oppression will God lift
   off; even as Christ did not set Himself against the secular power when
   He said, My kingdom is not of this world,' even as He was obedient to
   the Government, though He was the Son of God, commanding men to render
   to God the things that be God's, and to C√¶sar the things that be
   C√¶sar's. Now our souls belong to God; our bodies and goods unto C√¶sar.
   All this was much better set forth in more words."

   [28] Thus, he says in his Sermon on the Twenty-first Sunday after
   Trinity:--"Now the Apostle tells us to contend against princes and
   powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world. This means the
   devils; but it means also the princes of this world, who ought to be
   the best of all, and are nevertheless the very horses on which the
   devils ride to sow discord and treason, and who torment their subjects
   by their pride and unjust tyranny and manifold oppressions, as we now
   see throughout the world."

   [29] I give the following passage from his Sermon on the First Sunday
   in Lent [No. 31, Frankfort Edition, 1826], as showing, more distinctly
   than any other I have found, the position in which he stood towards the
   antinomian doctrines of the Beghards, and as furnishing the most
   complete refutation of the charge of antinomian tendencies sometimes
   brought against his own preaching:-- "From these two errors proceedeth
   the third, which is the worst of all; the persons who are entangled
   therein call themselves beholders of God, and they may be known by the
   carnal peace which they have through their emptiness. They think that
   they are free from sin, and are united to God without any means
   whatsoever, and that they have got above all subjection to the Holy
   Church, and above the commandments of God, and above all works of
   virtue; for they think this emptiness to be so noble a thing that it
   may not be hindered by aught else, whatsoever it be. Hence they stand
   empty of all subjection, and do no works either towards them who are
   above or below them, even as an instrument is empty, and waiteth on the
   master when he shall choose to work therewith; for they deem that if
   they work, it hindereth the work of God, and therefore they empty
   themselves of all virtue. Nay, they would be so empty, that they would
   not give praise or thanks to God, nor have, nor confess, nor love, nor
   desire, nor pray for anything; for they have already, as they suppose,
   all that they could pray for; and think that they are poor in spirit,
   for that they are, as they dream, without all self-will, and have
   renounced all ownership wholly and without reserve. For they believe
   that they have risen above it, and that they possess all those things
   for the sake of which the ordinances and precepts of the Church were
   appointed and established, and that none can give or take from them,
   not even God Himself, since they think that they have suffered all
   exercises and all virtues, and have attained to pure emptiness of
   spirit; and they say it requireth more pains to become empty of virtue
   than to attain unto virtue. For the sake of this emptiness of spirit,
   they desire to be free, and obedient to none, neither the Pope, nor the
   Bishop, nor the Pastor; and though they may seem outwardly to be so at
   times, yet are they inwardly obedient to none, neither in will nor
   deed. For they would fain be free from all those things wherewith the
   Holy Church is concerned; and they say openly that a man, so long as he
   strives after virtue, is still imperfect, and knows nought of spiritual
   poverty and spiritual freedom. And they deem themselves exalted above
   the angels, and above all human merit and faith, so that they can
   neither increase in virtue nor commit sin; for they live, as they
   suppose, without will, and possess their spirits in peace and
   emptiness, and have become nought in themselves and one with God. They
   believe that they may do freely, without sin, whatsoever nature
   desireth, because they have attained to the highest innocence, and
   there is no law or commandment for them, and therefore they follow all
   the lusts of the flesh, that the emptiness of the spirit may remain
   unhindered. They care not for fasts, nor feasts, nor precepts, except
   so far as they may observe them for the sake of others, because they
   live without conscience in all things. Let each man examine himself
   whether he be not one of these. But a murderer, or any open sinner, is
   better than such spiritual men, for he confesses his misdeed that it is
   evil; but these confess it not. Hardly are they to be converted; and at
   times they are verily possessed by the Devil. They are, moreover, so
   ingenious that it is scarcely possible to overcome them in discourse,
   save by the life of Christ and Holy Scripture: through these may one
   well discern that they are deceived. "Now cometh the fourth error. Many
   be also called beholders of God who are yet different in some points
   from what we have just said. These also think that they are empty of
   all works, and are tools of God by whom God works whatsoever he will,
   and they merely suffer Him, without working themselves; and they say
   that the works wrought of God through them are more noble and of
   greater merit than those of a man who worketh his own works in the
   grace of God; and declare that they are God-suffering men, or they do
   but suffer the works that God worketh in them. But although they are
   empty of the works, and do nought, yet will they not be empty of and
   miss the reward; and whatever they do is no sin, for God worketh their
   works, as they say, and whatsoever He wills is wrought in them, and
   nought else, and, as we said, inwardly they are wholly passive, and
   live without care for anything; and they have a humble, submissive
   manner, and can bear well whatsoever befalls them, for they think
   themselves to be an instrument through which God worketh as He will.
   These people are, in many points, like unto the true men; but in this
   are they false, that they hold everything whereunto they are inwardly
   impelled, whether good or bad, to proceed from the Holy Spirit. But the
   Holy Spirit worketh never unprofitable things in a man, such as be
   contrary to the life of Christ or Holy Scripture, and therefore are
   they deceived. These men are very hard to discover, for they can give
   good reasons for, and put a fair face on all they do; but they may be
   known by their stubborn self-will, that they would rather die than give
   up one tittle of their own way. These are contrary to them who say that
   they cannot increase in virtue; but they deserve the same measure.
   Behold all such errors are messengers of Antichrist, preparing the way
   before him unto unbelief and damnation. "Now it concerns us somewhat to
   know how we may escape these cunning snares. No man may be free from
   keeping the commandments of God, and from the practice of virtue. No
   man can unite himself to God in emptiness of spirit, without loving and
   longing after God. No man can be or become holy without good works. No
   man can rest in God without the love of God. No man may empty himself
   of godly works that he may not hinder God in His works, but must work
   with Him in thankfulness. No man may serve God without praising and
   thanking Him; for He is the Maker of all creatures, and He alone can
   give and take, for of His riches and might there is no end. And a man
   may increase in virtue and goodness, and may exercise himself therein
   as long as he lives; and no man deserveth more reward, though he think
   that he merely suffer the works of God to be wrought in him. The works
   of God are eternal and unchangeable; for He worketh according to His
   own nature, and not otherwise; and in these works of God there can be
   no merit and adding thereunto of any creature, for there is none but
   God who cannot become more or higher; but through the power of God the
   creatures have their own work to perform, in nature, and in grace, and
   in glory."

   [30] The following curious passage is extracted from Rulman Merswin's
   Book of the Nine Rocks; but many passages in Tauler's sermons show that
   his sentiments were quite in harmony with those here expressed:-- "The
   Man said: Ah, my Beloved, have mercy upon poor Christendom, and
   remember how that the wicked Jewish people and the wicked heathen folk
   are all striving against thee with all their might, and shall all be
   lost.' The Answer said: I tell thee thou art right when thou prayest
   God to have mercy upon poor Christendom; for know that for many hundred
   years Christendom has never been so poor or so wicked as in these
   times; but I tell thee, whereas thou sayest that the wicked Jews and
   heathen are all lost, that is not true: I tell thee, in these days,
   there is a portion of the heathen and the Jews whom God preferreth
   greatly to many who bear the Christian name, and yet live contrary to
   all Christian order.' The Man: . . . What strange speech is this that I
   hear, and what may it mean?' The Answer: . . . The meaning is, that
   where a Jew or heathen, in any part of the world, hath a good,
   God-fearing mind in him, in simplicity and honesty, and in his reason
   and judgment knoweth no better faith than that in which he was born,
   but were minded and willing to cast that off, if he were given to know
   any other faith that were more acceptable to God, and would obey God,
   if he ventured body and goods therefor;--I tell thee, where there is a
   Jew or heathen thus earnest in his life--say, ought he not to be much
   dearer to God than the evil, false Christian men who have received
   baptism, and act contrary to God, knowing that they do so?' . . . The
   Man: . . . This seemeth to me most strange, . . . for it is written in
   the Scripture, and is also a part of our Christian creed, that no one
   can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven unless he first receive holy
   baptism.' The Answer: That is true, and the right Christian faith. . .
   . When God findeth such a righteous heathen or Jew, what doth He do? Of
   His free love and fathomless mercy, He cometh to his help: I tell thee
   God findeth many secret ways that such a man be not lost, wherever he
   may be in this wide world.' . . . The Man: Say! how are these
   unbaptized men saved from perdition?' The Answer: God doth it by many
   secret ways, which are unknown to most Christians in these days. . . .
   One way, which Christendom may well believe and does believe, is, that
   when one of these good heathens or Jews cometh to his end, God cometh
   and enlighteneth him with the Christian faith; . . . and if he may not
   be baptized, God baptizes him in his good desires and will, and in his
   miserable death. Thou shalt know that there be many of these good
   heathens and Jews in eternal life, who have entered thereon in this
   wise.' . . ."

   [31] It has been often questioned whether the Latin or the German form
   in which we possess Tauler's sermons be the original. On this point I
   transcribe Professor Schmidt's arguments, which seem to me quite
   conclusive:-- "There can be no question that Tauler delivered his
   sermons in German, and that this language is the original one of all
   the sermons of his which we still possess. After his connection with
   Nicolas of Basle, he had himself declared that he did not intend
   henceforward to speak so much Latin in his sermons. The greater part of
   those still extant are, indeed, addressed in the first instance to the
   brethren or sisters in whose convent-chapels he used to preach, but
   also have a reference to the laity, who usually assembled in great
   numbers in these churches to hear him; and to be intelligible to such
   an audience he must have spoken in the vernacular: it was only in the
   School attached to his own convent that he spoke in Latin. The language
   itself of Tauler's sermons and writings is, besides, a sufficient proof
   that they were composed in German; for they exhibit the most complete
   adaptation of the thought to the form in which it is conveyed; a form,
   moreover, that Tauler had to a considerable extent to create for
   himself. Up to his day, the German language had been little used for
   theological and metaphysical subjects, and was poor in terms to express
   any notions beyond those living in the popular mind, so that the
   writers of his school (in bringing the higher and more spiritual truths
   of religion down to the level of popular apprehension) had to frame for
   themselves a terminology of their own, whose constituents they borrowed
   partly from the Latin of the Schools, partly from figurative, mostly
   biblical, forms of speech. Tauler often avails himself of such German
   scholastic terms to express abstract notions: as, for instance,
   Istckeit (essentia), Eigenshaftlicheit, Creaturlicheit, Unserheit,
   Sinsheit, Holtzheit. So, too, be often speaks by images, in order to
   express spiritual facts or metaphysical ideas, for which the language
   either possessed no words as yet, or which in themselves were too vague
   to be expressed in a clear and distinct mode. All this indicates a
   laborious wrestling of the thought with the language. . . . Hence,
   also, the partial obscurity of Tauler's style, which is incurred by the
   pains he took to attain a terse purity by forming substantives made up
   of whole propositions: as, for instance, ein einvaltiges
   gr√ºntlich-uf-got-sich-lossen.' . . . Tauler and his school have,
   however, the merit of having given to their nation a philosophical
   language." (See Schmidt's Tauler, S. 78.)

   [32] Thus, in speaking of the Popes, he says, "Look around thee, and
   see what sort of lives the Popes have led and do lead in these our
   times; we may not name any one in particular. Look . . . if they have
   not taken more thought for themselves and for the maintenance of their
   own dignity than for the promotion of God's glory. . . . Look around
   thee, and behold the lives of the bishops in these days, whether they
   are not more busied in scraping together earthly wealth for the
   enriching of their relatives than in seeing to it that men are taught
   to walk in righteous, godly ways. . . . Behold and see how many doctors
   and teachers are to be found in these days, who utter God's word from
   their chairs, and dare publicly to proclaim the real truth, and
   publicly to speak of the great and murderous crimes that prevail in the
   Christian world, and to warn men; and are willing by so doing to risk
   their lives for God's honour."

   [33] The account itself says, "As the Layman wrote to Rulman Merswin
   and Brother Nicolas von Laufen;" but these letters are not among those
   preserved.

   [34] The name by which Nicolas is always designated, except where he is
   called "the Dear Friend of God in the Oberland."

   [35] The hordes known by the name of "Englishmen," who for several
   years after 1361 ravaged France, Lorraine, and Alsace.

   [36] See, for instance, his vision of the Three Birds. (Schmidt's
   Gottesfreunde, S. 147.)

   [37] This will, I think, seem no exaggerated expression to any reader
   who will take the pains to consult only Diepenbrock's Life of Suso
   (Ratisbon, 1829), with Gorres' Introduction to it, and so see for
   himself the space that separates the Romish from our Protestant point
   of view in these matters; not forgetting, meanwhile, that the Editor
   Diepenbrock was the secretary of the learned Bishop Sailer, the leader
   of the most liberal party among the Catholics of almost our own day.

   [38] See Schmidt's Gottesfreunde, S. 170.

   [39] The following note, inserted by Schmidt in his Tauler, S. 205, is,
   I believe, the only source of information we have respecting the end of
   the Layman:-- "Johan Niederus, formicarius, Arg. 1517, 4to. F. 40, &c.:
   Vivebat paulo ante [the Council of Pisa] quidam purum laicus, Nycholaus
   nomine. Hic in linea Rheni circa Basiliam et infra, primum velut
   Beghardus ambulans, a multis qui persequebantur hereticos, de eorundem
   hereticorum numero quasi unus habebatur suspectissimus. Acutissimus
   enim erat, et verbis errores coloratissime velare novit. Ideireo etiam
   manus inquisitorum dudum evaserat et multo tempore. Discipulos igitur
   quosdam in suam sectam collegit. Fuit enim professione et habitu de
   damnatis Beghardis unus, qui visiones et revelationes in praedicto
   damnato habitu multas habuit quas infallibiles esse credidit. Se scire
   affirmabat audacter quod Christus in eo esset actu, et ipse in Christo,
   et plura alia, quae omnia, captus tandem Wiennae in Pictaviensi
   diocesi, inquisitus fatebatur publice. Sed cum Jacobum et Joannem
   suspectos in fide, et sibi conscios sues speciales discipulos, ad
   jussum ecclesiae eum inquirenti nollet dimittere nisi per ignem, et
   reportis in multis a vera fide devius et impersuasibilis, secularium
   potestati juste traditus est qui eum incinerarunt.

   [40] A detailed account of these attempts is given in Schmidt's
   Gottesfreunde, S. 29.

Sermon for the First Sunday in Advent

   (From the Epistle for the day)

   How that we are called upon to arise from our sins, and to conquer our
   foes, looking for the glorious coming of Our Lord in our souls.

   Rom. xiii. 11.--"Now it is high time to awake out of sleep."

   THIS day we celebrate the beginning of the season of Advent, that is to
   say, the coming of our Lord; and now, indeed, we enter on an exceeding
   sweet and blessed time, concerning which very devout and joyful words
   are read and sung by the holy Church. For as May excels all other
   months in gladness and delights, so is this season specially dear to
   our hearts, and sacred above all other festivals. For these are the
   days which the prophets and righteous men of the Old Testament for five
   thousand years have longed and sighed for, crying out--"Oh that thou
   wouldst rend the heavens and come down, to enlighten those who are
   sitting in darkness and the shadow of death." And, indeed, all the
   histories and symbols of the Old Testament are designed to shadow forth
   the greatness of Him who should come, and who now has come. O let us,
   therefore, give thanks and praise to God without ceasing, that He has
   made us to live in this His time of grace, and is ready to bestow all
   His gifts and riches upon us if we are but willing to receive them.

   And now, as at this time, does the holy Apostle call upon us to arise
   from the sleep of sin, "for the night is far spent, and the day is at
   hand; let us, therefore, cast off the works of darkness, and let us put
   on the armour of light, and let us walk honestly as in the day."

   Now to this end, let us mark diligently, first, how it is that we have
   fallen; and, secondly, how we are to arise from all our sins and
   infirmities into our first state of innocence.

   God created man to the intent that he should possess those mansions in
   the kingdom of heaven from which Lucifer and his angels were thrust
   out. The same Lucifer, for his deadly hatred towards man, hath seduced
   him likewise into disobedience against God, by the which he lost all
   the graces and endowments that were intended to make him like unto God
   and the angels, and poisoned his own pure nature, so that it became
   corrupt. And through this poison man has wounded himself mortally with
   blindness in his reason, with perverseness or malice in his will, with
   shameful lusts in his appetites, and with loss of his just indignation
   at sin. Man, being in honour, understood it not, and is become like
   unto the beasts that perish.

   And hence it has come to pass that three foes have risen up against
   him, who, alas! on all sides have got the upper hand, and are ruling in
   the hearts of the people: these are, the World, the Flesh, and the
   Devil. Where these three have their will, that noble thing, the Soul,
   is lost, on which God hath looked with such great love; for those in
   whom they obtain the mastery do most surely walk in a way that leadeth
   unto eternal death. How cruelly and perilously these three enemies now
   reign in numbers of men, both in the Church and in the world, standing
   in God's place, is bewailed with bitter tears by the friends of God,
   who love Him and seek His glory. For the everlasting injury of their
   fellow-creatures is a sore grief to such men, insomuch that their heart
   is ready to dry up within their body for anguish, when they see
   self-love so rooted in men's hearts, that there be few left who wholly
   love God and have a single eye to His glory.

   The World rules through pride, outward or inward. How many are members
   of this Devil's Order! They desire to be and appear to be somewhat;
   while their sins and infirmities are not to be numbered.

   The Devil's government leads to bitterness, to hatred and anger, to
   suspicion, to judging others, to revenge, to ill-will, to discord. All
   his disciples are quarrelsome, unloving, envious of their neighbours.

   The will of our own Flesh is set upon earthly pleasures and sensual
   delights, and it craveth to have the best of everything, and
   continually to find enjoyment in all things. How great is the mischief
   that springs from this fountain, people do not know, especially those
   who are themselves blinded through it. By these three foes are nearly
   all men led astray to their eternal loss.

   Now he who desires to rise again to his first honour and dignity, which
   Adam at the beginning, and we after him, have lost through sin, and to
   make way for the coming of Our Lord in his soul, must flee the world,
   overcome the Devil, bring his flesh under dominion to his reason, and
   exercise himself diligently in these six points following:--

   Man fell in Paradise through two things,--lust and pride; so likewise
   we must return by means of two things, for nature to win back again her
   original powers. We must resist and die to all irregular desires, after
   a manly and reasonable sort. In the second place, we must humble
   ourselves, and bow our nature down to the earth in deep humility before
   God and all men against whom it had lifted itself with pride. Take
   always the lowest place, and so shalt thou rise to the highest. By
   these two things nature recovers her original powers.

   Next, in two things man must become like unto the angels. He must
   pardon and forgive all those who do him wrong, and be from his heart
   the friend of his enemies, like the angels, whom we ofttimes vex with
   our sins. Further, he must serve his neighbour with a willing spirit,
   as the holy angels are ever ministering to us for God's sake.

   Lastly, in two things man must become like unto our Lord Jesus Christ.
   First, in perfect obedience, as our Lord was obedient to His Heavenly
   Father, even unto death; secondly, he must persevere and grow in
   obedience and in all virtues, unto his life's end.

   By these means the heart is made pure and heavenly, and the man becomes
   of one mind with God through deep humility, free self-surrender,
   patient long-suffering, true poorness of spirit, and fervent love to
   God. And all who do verily seek the kingdom of God (of whom, alas! how
   few is the number), do prevail against their foes, and God delivers
   them from their heavy burdens, and helps them to bear all their
   afflictions. For He lays upon them much suffering of many kinds; but
   the righteous God does this to the intent that four ends may be
   accomplished in them. The first, that they may come to themselves, and
   see whence their trouble cometh, and that their thoughts may be turned
   upon themselves by reason of the pain, and so be fixed. The second,
   that they may examine why God has laid the burden of pain upon them;
   and when they perceive God's purpose in their sufferings, let them
   strive to fulfil that, and resign themselves wholly to His divine will.
   The third, that they may come out from themselves, and from all
   creatures. The fourth, that they may learn true patience under diverse
   afflictions. But what is true patience under affliction? Is it to
   remain unmoved by outward things? No. True patience is that a man
   should feel in his inmost soul, and in utter sincerity thus judge, that
   no one could or might do him a real injustice, but always remember that
   he is receiving no worse than his deserts, for he might justly have far
   more to suffer and endure; insomuch that he may feel nothing but
   gentleness and compassion towards all who do him wrong. Such men are
   followers of Christ, our humble Master, in whom He reigns, and to whom
   He said: "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;
   and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."

   Now there are two sorts of men who follow after the word of Christ. The
   one sort hear it with joy, and follow after it as far as they are able
   with their reason to perceive its truth, and take it in just in the
   same way as their reason takes in what is concerned with the world of
   sense; and all this they do by means of their natural light, but they
   make no account of anything that they themselves do not feel or enter
   into; but with these natural powers of theirs, they are ever running
   out to catch up and understand some new thing. They have not learnt by
   experience that they ought to die to this restlessness; but if they are
   ever to grow better men, they must try another road.

   But the other sort turn their thoughts inward, and remain resting on
   the inmost foundation of their souls, simply looking to see the hand of
   God with the eyes of their enlightened reason, and await from within
   their summons and their call to go whither God would have them. And
   this they receive from God without any means; but what is given through
   means, such as other mortal men, for instance, is as it were tasteless;
   moreover, it is seen as through a veil, and split up into fragments,
   and bears within it a certain sting of bitterness. It always retains
   the savour of that which is of the creature, which it must needs lose
   and be purified from, if it is to become in truth food for the spirit,
   and to enter into the very substance of the soul. For those who
   perceive God's gifts and leadings from within, whether by the help of
   means or without means, do receive them from their fountain-head, and
   carry them back again unto their fountain-head in the Divine goodness.
   These are they who draw and drink from the true well, of which Christ
   said: "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall
   never thirst." But the first of whom we spoke are seeking their own
   things; wherever they are, and whatever they do, they are always
   standing upon their own foundation. Yet, in truth, they can never find
   their own good so certain and so unmixed, as in its inward source,
   without the aid of means.

   Now you may ask, How can we come to perceive this direct leading of
   God? By a careful looking at home, and abiding within the gates of thy
   own soul. Therefore, let a man be at home in his own heart, and cease
   from his restless chase of and search after outward things. If he is
   thus at home while on earth, he will surely come to see what there is
   to do at home,--what God commands him inwardly without means, and also
   outwardly by the help of means; and then let him surrender himself, and
   follow God along whatever path his loving Lord thinks fit to lead him:
   whether it be to contemplation or action, to usefulness or enjoyment;
   whether in sorrow or in joy, let him follow on. And if God do not give
   him thus to feel His hand in all things, let him still simply yield
   himself up, and go without for God's sake, out of love, and still press
   forward, setting ever before him the lovely example of our Blessed Lord
   Jesus Christ; who did all his works for three ends:

   The first was, that in all His doings He sought the glory of His
   Heavenly Father only, and not His own in any matter, whether great or
   small, and committed all things into His hands again.

   The second was, that with His whole heart He purposed and sought the
   salvation and blessedness of men, that He might lay hold on all men,
   and bring them to the acknowledgment of His Name, according to the
   words of St. Paul: "God will have all men to be saved, and to come to
   the knowledge of the truth."

   The third end which He kept in view, in all His words, and works, and
   life, was, that He might give us a true example and model of a perfect
   life in its highest form.

   The men who thus tread in His steps do become, in very truth, the
   noblest and most glorious of their race; and those who are thus born
   again into His life, are the rich and costly jewels of the Holy
   Christian Church, and in all ages they work out the highest good, while
   they look not to the greatness or meanness of their work, nor to their
   success or failure, but look only to the will of God in all things; and
   for this cause all their works are the best that may be. Neither do
   they look whether God will place them high or low, for the only thing
   they care for is, that in all things alike God's will may be done. God
   grant that it may be thus with each of us. Amen.

Sermon for the Second Sunday in Advent

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   How that God is very near to us, and how we must seek and find the
   Kingdom of God within us, without respect to time and place. [41]

   Luke xxi. 31.--"Know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand."

   OUR Lord says here that the kingdom of God is nigh to us. Yea, the
   kingdom of God is in us; and St. Paul says, that now is our salvation
   nearer to us than we believe.

   Now ye ought to know, first, how the kingdom of God is nigh at hand;
   secondly, when the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

   Now we must give earnest heed to take note of all that is contained in
   these words, "The kingdom of God is nigh at hand." For if I were a
   king, and did not know it, I should be no king; but if I were fully
   convinced that I was a king, and if all men deemed me so likewise, and
   further, if I knew that all men deemed me such, I should be a king, and
   all the riches of the king would be mine. But if any of these three
   things were wanting, I could be no king. In like manner does our
   blessedness depend upon our perceiving and knowing the Highest Good,
   which is God Himself. I have a power in my soul which enables me to
   perceive God: I am as certain as that I live that nothing is so near to
   me as God. He is nearer to me than I am to myself. It is a part of His
   very essence that He should be nigh and present to me. He is also nigh
   to a stone or a tree, but they do not know it. If a tree could know
   God, and perceive His presence as the highest of the angels perceives
   it, the tree would be as blessed as the highest angel. And it is
   because man is capable of perceiving God, and knowing how nigh God is
   to him, that he is better off than a tree. And he is more blessed or
   less blessed in the same measure as he is aware of the presence of God.
   It is not because God is in him, and so close to him, and he hath God,
   that he is blessed, but because he perceives God's presence, and knows
   and loves Him; and such an one will feel that God's kingdom is nigh at
   hand.

   Often, when I meditate on the kingdom of God, I cannot speak for the
   greatness thereof. For the kingdom of God, what is it but God Himself
   with all His riches? The kingdom of God is no small thing. If we think
   of all the worlds that God could create, that is not the kingdom of
   God. When the kingdom of God is manifested in a soul, and she knows it,
   you need not to preach or to teach; for that soul is taught of God, and
   assured of eternal life. He who knows and perceives how nigh God's
   kingdom is, may say with Jacob; "Surely the Lord is in this place, and
   I knew it not."

   God is alike near in all creatures. The wise man says; "God hath spread
   out His nets and snares over all creatures, so that he who desireth to
   perceive Him, may find Him in every one of them."

   A Master has said: "He knoweth God aright who knoweth him in all things
   alike." He who serveth God with fear, it is good; he who serveth Him
   with love, it is better; but he who in fear can love, that is the best
   of all. That a man should have a life of quiet or rest in God is good;
   that a man should lead a painful life in patience is better; but that a
   man should have rest in a painful life is best of all. Whether a man
   walk out in the fields and say his prayers, and feel God's presence, or
   whether he be in the church and feel God's presence, does he perceive
   Him any the better because he is in a place of rest? If he do, it comes
   from his own infirmity; the difference is not on God's side, for God is
   in all things and places alike, and is ever alike ready to give Himself
   to us, in so far as we are able to receive Him; and he knows God aright
   who sees Him in all things.

   St. Bernard says: "Why does my eye perceive the heavens, and not my
   feet? Because my eye is more like the heavens than my feet." Thus, if
   my soul is to perceive God, it must be heavenly. Now what will bring
   the soul to see God in herself, and know how nigh God is to her?
   Consider! The heavens cannot take any imprint from other things,
   neither can they, by any violence or force, be turned from their order.
   In like manner, the soul that would know God must be so grounded and
   built up in Him, that neither hope, nor fear, nor joy, nor sorrow, nor
   weal or woe, nor anything else, can so move it as to force it from its
   place in Him.

   The heavens are everywhere alike far from the earth: thus shall the
   soul be alike far from all earthly things, that she be not nearer to
   one than to another, but keep herself alike far from all, in joy and
   sorrow, in prosperity and adversity, for she must be utterly dead to
   all that is of the earth, earthly, and altogether raised above it.

   The heavens are pure and bright, without a speck; they have nought to
   do with time or space; no bodies have a fixed place therein; neither
   are the heavens subject to time: their circuit is swift beyond belief;
   their course is without time, yet from their course cometh time.

   Nothing hinders the soul so much in its knowledge of God as time and
   place. Time and place are parts, and God is one; therefore, if our soul
   is to know God, it must know Him above time and place, for God is
   neither this nor that, like these complex things around us, for God is
   one.

   If the soul is to see, she must not look at the things that exist in
   time, for so long as she is looking at time and place, or at the
   phenomena dependent thereon, she can never perceive God Himself: just
   as, if mine eye is to perceive colour, it must first be cleared of all
   tint in itself. If the soul is to know God, she must have no fellowship
   with that which is Nought. He who sees God, knows that all creatures
   are nought; for when you compare one creature with another, it indeed
   appears beautiful and is somewhat, but when you compare it with God it
   is nothing. I say more: if the soul is to know God, she must forget
   herself and lose herself, for while she is looking at and thinking
   about herself, she is not looking at or thinking about God; but when
   she loses herself in God, and lets go of all things, then she finds
   herself again in God. When she comes to know God, then does she know to
   perfection in Him, both herself and all the things from which she has
   separated herself. If I am truly to know the Highest Good, or the
   Eternal Goodness, I must know it in that wherein it is good, namely, in
   itself,--not in those things in which it is only in part. If I am to
   know real Being, I must know it in that where it is self-existent, that
   is, in God. In God alone is the true Divine Substance: in one man you
   have not all humanity, for one man is not all men; but in God the soul
   knows all humanity, and all things in their Ideal, for she knows them
   in their Substance. When a man has been within a beautifully-painted
   house, he knows much more about it than another who has never been
   inside it, and is able to tell much about it. So I am as certain as
   that I live and God lives, that if the soul is to know God, she must
   know Him above time and space; and such a soul knows God, and knows how
   nigh God's kingdom is; that is, God with all His riches.

   The Masters have set forth many questions in the Schools as to how it
   be possible for the soul to know God. It is not of God's severity that
   He requires much from man; it is of His great kindness that He will
   have the soul to open herself wider, to be able to receive much, that
   He may bestow much upon her. Let no one think that it is hard to attain
   thereunto. Although it sound hard, and is hard at first, as touching
   the forsaking and dying to all things, yet, when one has reached this
   state, no life can be easier or sweeter, or fuller of pleasures; for
   God is right diligent to be with us at all seasons, and to teach us,
   that He may bring us to Himself when we are like to go astray. None of
   us ever desired anything more ardently than God desires to bring men to
   the knowledge of Himself.

   God is ever ready, but we are very unready; God is nigh to us, but we
   are far from Him; God is within, we are without; God is at home, we are
   strangers. The Prophet says: "God leadeth the righteous by a narrow
   path into a broad highway, till they come unto a wide and open place;"
   [42] that is, unto the true freedom of that spirit which hath become
   one spirit with God. God help us all to follow Him, that He may bring
   us unto Himself! Amen.

  III

Sermon for the Third Sunday in Advent

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   How that we must wholly come out from ourselves, that we may go into
   the wilderness and behold God.

   Matt. xi. 7.--"What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?"

   OUR Lord Jesus Christ said unto the Jews, "What went ye out into the
   wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?" In these words let
   us consider three things: First, the going out; secondly, the
   wilderness; thirdly, what we are to see there.

   First, let us consider the going out. This blessed going out takes
   place in four ways:--

   The first way is to come out from the world, that is, from the craving
   after worldly advantages, and to despise them, according to that
   precept of St. John, "Love not the world, neither the things that are
   in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not
   in him." Those who thus forsake the love of the world, may be fitly
   said to come out of Egypt, leaving King Pharaoh behind; that is, they
   purpose to forsake pride, vain-glory, presumption, and all other sins.
   And those who are thus minded do greatly need a Moses to be their
   leader and commander; for he was very gentle and merciful, and in their
   coming out they require to be treated with great gentleness, and
   kindness, and forbearance. But such as come out from Sodom and
   Gomorrah, that is, those who have to depart from covetousness,
   intemperance, and unchastity, and are hard beset by these foes, do need
   an angel for their leader and guide; that is to say, a man who can have
   compassion on them, but who is himself temperate, pure, and strict in
   life. Now those who do thus suffer themselves to be led and guided,
   shall be verily delivered from all their pride and sensuality, as
   Isaiah says: "Ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace;"
   and as Christ also says: "In the world ye shall have tribulation, but
   in me ye shall have peace."

   The second kind of coming out is to loose thy hold on outward things,
   to cease from thy vain anxieties, thy selfish wishing and planning, and
   to turn thy thoughts inward, that thou mayest learn to know thyself,
   and to see what thou art, how thou art, and in what it standeth amiss
   with thee. He who is too full of his own joys or sorrows to get beyond
   himself can never come to know himself. So St. Bernard says: "It were
   better to know thyself, and to see how sick and full of infirmities
   thou art, than to be master of all the sciences in the world."
   Therefore says Solomon in his Song: "If thou know not [thyself], O thou
   fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock [of
   thy companions]:" which signifies, consider the lives of God's saints,
   and look at thyself in that mirror; that is to say, follow their
   example, and walk not after thine own will.

   The third kind of going out is to give up thine own ease and thine own
   way, and to devote thyself, so far as thou art able, to thy neighbour,
   to help him by counsel and deed, and by thine own good example, to the
   utmost of thy power and the best of thy knowledge, in a constant spirit
   of hearty love, that he may be brought to the things that make for his
   eternal peace. For this is the commandment of the Lord, "That ye love
   one another, as I have loved you. By this shall all men know that ye
   are my disciples, if ye have love one to another." So likewise St. Paul
   says: "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
   Just as it is said in the Book of Genesis: "Except ye bring your
   youngest brother with you, ye shall see my face no more." This is also
   plainly meant in the Book of Canticles, where we read, "Come, my
   beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us get up early to the
   vineyards, and let us lodge in the villages, and let us see if the vine
   flourish."

   The fourth kind of going out is to forsake everything but God, so that
   our love towards God should be the strongest love we have; and we
   should indeed love Him with all our heart, and with all our soul, and
   with all our strength. As it was said unto Abraham: "Get thee out of
   thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house:" that
   is to say, "Set not your affections on the things that perish, but on
   God only; and whatever you possess, thank God for it, and use it for
   Him." Thus had the woman of Canaan come out, as her words indeed
   testify: "True, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from
   their master's table;" and therefore she obtained her request. Thus it
   is said to the loving soul and her companions: "Go forth, O ye
   daughters of Zion." Well may it be said "ye daughters," and not sons;
   for they are still feeble in understanding, and troubled with many
   womanish fears, and not yet strong in renunciation, but are still
   tender and weak, like maidens or daughters.

   The second subject for our consideration is "the wilderness." When men
   have forsaken sins and worldly ambition, they come into the wilderness,
   which signifies a spiritual life, or the life of one who is dead to the
   world. Now there are two kinds of wilderness, a good and a bad. It is
   an evil wilderness when a man's heart is filled with vanity, and barren
   of good deeds, of love and of heavenly aspiration, and far and wide in
   the Church, or in the temple of the soul, there rises no incense of
   praise to God; when the sheep of the house of Israel, that is to say
   all good thoughts, are scattered, each to his own way. But that is a
   wilderness which is very fruitful and good, when the whirlwinds of
   earthly cares or passions are laid to rest, and the billows of worldly
   desire and creature aims cease to swell up in the depths of the heart.
   And then, even though the first sharp dart of pain pierce through every
   nerve of body and mind, yet in the deep sources of his will, the man
   remains undaunted. That is a good wilderness when without there are
   storms, yet within there is peace; the wilderness of which God said by
   the prophet: "I will bring you into the wilderness, and there will I
   plead with you face to face;" for no one does hear or understand what
   is in him, and what God says in his soul, until he is brought into this
   wilderness.

   There are three reasons why a spiritual life is called a wilderness, or
   a life in the desert. The first is on account of the small number who
   do turn from the world and go forth into it, and because the common way
   of the world is for each man to follow his own earthly objects. But it
   is the wisest course to drive out the world from the heart, by
   banishing the very thoughts and images thereof, and, with Moses, go
   into the depths of the wilderness and dwell therein, that so we may the
   better watch over and guard our sheep; that is to say, escape the
   assaults of inward temptation, and the wanderings of the imagination
   into forbidden fields. And as, when Moses drove his sheep into the
   farthest corners of the wilderness, God revealed Himself to him there
   in a burning bush, so likewise shalt thou be filled with burning love
   and holy longing, and follow on to know God.

   This is the beauteous wilderness of which Solomon speaks when he says:
   "Who is this that cometh up out of the wilderness like a pillar of
   smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense?" St. Gregory says: "It is
   the nature and property of love to rise up unceasingly from itself to
   God with holy aspiration, never resting till it hath reached and
   embraced the Highest Good; for nothing on earth can draw it down or
   imprison its flame, but it soars ever upwards to God above itself." And
   so it is with good men; and the closer they cling to Him whom they
   love, the more do they turn from and despise all the smiles of the
   world. They cleave with steadfast desire unto God, as Job says; "Even
   that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his
   hand, and cut me off! Then should I yet have comfort." Of this
   wilderness say the angels: "Who is this that cometh up from the
   wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?" and the loving soul answers: "I
   have found him whom my soul loveth, I have laid hold on him and will
   not let him go." For those who come into this wilderness are able to
   taste and tell of secret and inward matters. Moreover, in the exercise
   of love all virtues do spring up and grow. So Christ, on Mount Tabor,
   took to Himself all His glory, for an image to us of that fruit of the
   wilderness which shall be ours also if we give ourselves unto God. For
   St. Paul says: "But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the
   glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory,
   even as by the Spirit of the Lord."

   Again, a spiritual life may be fitly called a wilderness, by reason of
   the many sweet flowers which spring up and flourish where they are not
   trodden under foot by man. In this respect the life of one dead to the
   world may well be likened to a wilderness, seeing that so many virtues
   may be learned by continual and earnest striving; but because the
   effort needed is toilsome and painful at the first, few are willing to
   make it. In this wilderness are found the lilies of chastity, and the
   white roses of innocence; and therein are found too the red roses of
   sacrifice, when flesh and blood are consumed in the struggle with sin,
   and the man is ready, if need be, to suffer martyrdom,--the which is
   not easily to be learned in the world. In this wilderness, too, are
   found the violets of humility, and many other fair flowers and
   wholesome roots, in the examples of holy men of God. And in this
   wilderness shalt thou choose for thyself a pleasant spot wherein to
   dwell; that is, a holy life, in which thou mayest follow the example of
   God's saints in pureness of heart, poverty of spirit, true obedience,
   and all other virtues; so that it may be said, as it is in the
   Canticles: "Many flowers have appeared in our land;" for many have died
   full of holiness and good works.

   A third likeness between a spiritual life and the wilderness is that we
   find in the wilderness so little provision for the flesh, and therefore
   the lovers of this world cannot live there. Thus did the children of
   Israel complain against Moses because they lacked many things. By this
   we are to understand a life of moderation, girding up the loins with
   manly vigour. And every man is bound to lead such a life; for had he
   the whole world wherewith to supply his wants, he would still be bound
   scrupulously to take no more than sufficient for his real necessities.
   Moreover by such a life all the powers of the soul are braced up. And
   although there is little to delight the senses in this wilderness,
   there is much of the comfort of the spirit, which far excels the
   pleasures of the world. Isaiah says: "For the Lord shall comfort Zion;
   he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness
   like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord." And again: "I
   will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of
   water." Thus the solitary soul bears many more children of good works
   than she that is married to the world. So Pharaoh was commanded by God
   to let His people go forth into the desert, that they might sacrifice
   unto the Lord, and receive spiritual manna instead of the carnal
   pleasures of Egypt.

   The third thing for our consideration is what we are to see in the
   wilderness. When a man has gone out into the wilderness, he is bidden
   to look with his inward eye upon "the king and his bride," which is the
   soul, with all her hidden treasures of loveliness. It is written, "Go
   forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold the king;" that is, Solomon,
   who is a type of Christ, of whom Isaiah says: "To us a child is born,
   unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder;
   and his name shall be called Wonderful." And now behold how wonderful
   God is in His deity, that He has become man for the sake of His bride.
   This is the miracle that Moses saw, and said: "I will now turn aside
   and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt." The thorn-bush is
   Christ's human nature; the flame is His soul filled with burning love;
   the light is His deity shining through His mortal body. Now, consider
   this Christ and Solomon, upon whom is poured out without measure that
   wisdom which comprehends all things in its grasp: He is the Truth who
   hath taught us the way to heaven; let the soul look upon Him, that she
   may follow Him, to live after His spirit, and not after her own
   inclination, and her nature shall be greatly strengthened to fight the
   good fight when she considers the nature of her King, how He fulfilled
   His pilgrimage. For it shall greatly refresh the living soul to
   remember from time to time His human infirmities, and from time to time
   to rejoice in His life in the spirit.

   A master has said: "Excess in pleasures enfeebles the powers, and
   overflowing spiritual emotions consume the spirit. Great joy cannot
   last always, but while here we have need of variableness in our joys;
   for it is not yet given to the soul to serve God in the holy of
   holies." Therefore shall the soul sometimes contemplate the divine
   greatness of Christ, and sometimes His holy humanity. A soul that is as
   yet inexperienced and strange in the things of God shall be bidden to
   believe in God; but a fervent, tried, and experienced soul shall be
   invited to behold the King in his beauty. And hence the loving soul
   shall see with her inward eye in what wise she ought to yield to or
   withstand her fellow-Christians of mankind. St. Bernard says: "O Lord,
   come quickly and reign on Thy throne, for now ofttimes something rises
   up within me, and tried to take possession of Thy throne; pride,
   covetousness, uncleanness, and sloth want to be my kings; and then
   evil-speaking, anger, hatred, and the whole train of vices join with me
   in warring against myself, and try to reign over me. I resist them, I
   cry out against them, and say, I have no other king than Christ.' O
   King of Peace, come and reign in me, for I will have no king but Thee!"
   And Gilbert says: "O Lord, I endure Thy hand upon me, and press forward
   with straining eyes, with knocking, with prayers, and through many
   heights and depths of joy and sorrow." But O, who can faint and grow
   weary in making himself ready for such a king, when he remembers how
   God has made our little nature able to receive His divine Substance,
   and has even taken upon Himself our nature, and invested Himself with
   the colours of our humanity, and so revealed His beauty unto us, and
   loveth us much more than we love Him! I were in truth worthy of all
   condemnation, if I did not love Him above all things, when He asketh
   nothing from me but to love Him!

   Therefore let us in the first place come out wholly from ourselves,
   that we may, in the next place, enter into this blessed wilderness,
   and, in the third place, desire to know and behold the true King and
   bridegroom of the soul. And to this end the Moses of a holy Will must
   lead us into the Mount of God. But the people whom Moses led up out of
   Egypt are an image of those who, having newly laid aside their evil
   customs, do easily return to their old ways, and make to themselves in
   the wilderness a golden calf of their old fleshly lusts, of unchaste or
   worldly thoughts, to live after the flesh, and serve their own bellies
   and not God, but have their delight in the creature. And hence we have
   need of the true Moses, even Christ Jesus, that He may at all times
   guide us and lead us, and draw us to Himself, so that we may go out
   after Him into the wilderness of our own hearts, wherein God lies
   hidden to us. May God help us all to attain thereunto! Amen!

Sermon for Christmas Day

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   Of the things by which we become children of God. [43]

   John i. 12.--"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to
   become the sons of God."

   THIS day, dear children, hath God wrought a great wonder, and
   manifested the greatness of His love towards us, in that He hath looked
   down upon us, who were His enemies, aliens and afar off from Him, with
   such mercy as to give us power to become His sons and children;
   therefore it behoves us not to show ourselves unthankful for such
   kindness, but to put on the true marks and qualities of the elect,
   beloved children of God. And hereby we may know what these are.

   He who would be a son of our Father in Heaven must be a stranger among
   the children of this world, and separate himself from them, and must
   have an earnest mind and a single eye, with a heart inclined towards
   God. Now such a one is made a son of God when he is born again in God,
   and this takes place with every fresh revelation of God to his soul. A
   man is born of the Spirit when he suffers God's work to be wrought in
   his soul; yet it is not this which makes the soul to be perfectly
   blessed, but that revelation, of which we have spoken already, makes
   the soul to follow after Him who has revealed Himself to her, and in
   whom she is born anew, with love and praise. Thus she returns again to
   her first source, and is made, of God's grace, a child of God, united
   to Him in rightful love. And let him who would attain hereunto, copy
   Christ in his human nature, and God Himself will verily come unto him
   in His superhuman Godhead.

   The beloved children of God renounce themselves, and hence they do
   right without effort, and mount up to the highest point of goodness;
   while he who will not let go of himself, but does right by labour and
   toil, will never reach the highest that he might. In other words: he
   whose works proceed from himself, does little good service to God;
   while he who suffers himself to be guided by the Holy Spirit, does
   great works even in small actions. But he who will attain to this must
   beware of men, so far as is consistent with reason. A heathen teacher
   has declared: "I never mingled with men, but I came home less of a man
   than I went out." Men who live on the outside of things are a great
   hindrance in the way of goodness by their many idle words. Therefore
   those who wish to foster the inner life of their souls, are in great
   danger of receiving hurt from things which are said without thought,
   especially when many are together. He who repents what he has said as
   soon as the words are out of his mouth, is one of the careless
   speakers.

   He only is a good son who has cast off his old sins and evil habits;
   for without this it is impossible that he should be created anew in
   Christ Jesus. It is not until the thoughts can find rest in nothing but
   God, that the man is drawn close to God Himself, and becomes His. He is
   happy who is always in the full use of his collective powers; and this
   is the case when God is present to his spirit, and he gladly obeys all
   the motions of God's Spirit, and gives his whole diligence to act and
   live agreeable thereunto. He hath a right spirit who is free from all
   craving after temporal things, and like a good son is united by love to
   his God, without any earthly desires.

   The child of God should so order his life as always to promote his own
   steadfastness in virtue. When a man always keeps his body in due
   subjection, it is an outward pledge of the strength of his virtuous
   intents. Then is God in the man, when there is nothing in him which is
   contrary to the will of God. For God makes a man's body the temple of
   the Holy Ghost when He finds nothing in the man which grieves His
   Spirit, but He reigns with Jesus Christ over the body. That is to say:
   when a man knows of nothing in himself which is displeasing to God,
   then God dwells in him, and he is set free from the things that perish.
   He who most hates and comes out from himself has the greatest share in
   God, and possesses his earthly heritage in peace.

   Master Eckart says; "That which kindles the warmest devotion in a man's
   heart, and knits him most closely to God, is the greatest benefit he
   can receive in this present time; and hence the greatest good work a
   man can do, is to draw other men to God, so that they enter into a
   union with Him. And this is the best work of love to our neighbour
   while we are in this world."

   Further: it is a mark of the children of God that they see their own
   little faults and shortcomings to be great sins. Now he who entangles
   himself with a multitude of matters, outward or inward, and will meddle
   with every thing that is going forward, will also have a share in the
   evil thereof. We must let all things be to us merely the supply of our
   wants, and possess them in their nothingness. The great work and aim of
   the beloved children of God is to shun all sin, deadly or trifling,
   that they may not grieve God's spirit; for they know, as St. Augustine
   says, that for the smallest habitual sin which is not punished and laid
   aside in this present life, they will have to suffer more than all the
   pains of this world. Hence Anselm says, that he would rather die, and
   that this world should be destroyed, than commit one sin a day
   knowingly. And Augustine says: "The soul is created eternal, and
   therefore she cannot rest but in God." And again: "He who prays for
   anything except for God's sake, does not ask aright, and will not be
   answered with a blessing."

   Again: the child of God must have exercise in good works; but when he
   comes to possess the very substance of virtue, then virtue is no longer
   an exercise to him; for he practises it without an effort, and when
   virtue is practised without labour or pain, we have got beyond
   exercises. But none may get so far before body and soul are separated
   from each other; unless, indeed, the soul were drawn out of herself,
   and it were possible in this present state for God to dwell in the
   soul, acting and suffering. Ah, Lord, did we all we should, God would
   do to us all we would. If any wish to become such that God can love
   him, and look upon him with complacency, let him forsake all that he
   loves in the world, and love nothing but God alone. He who desires to
   receive with the Son of God a man's reward, must suffer from and with
   the wicked of this world; and if he hunger after his salvation as one
   who is perishing for lack of food, it will avail him nothing, until he
   cast off sin and work the works of righteousness which are befitting [a
   child of grace], and endure all wrong and injustice patiently for God's
   sake. For without this, his hunger and thirst after salvation can
   neither be satisfied here nor hereafter. For it is of the very essence
   of salvation to love God, to depart from sin, and to work
   righteousness; not to be able to find happiness in all the pleasures of
   earth, but to be willing to suffer willingly all manner of pain and
   contradiction, and not seek to avoid them: when a man has come to this
   state all is well with him, and not otherwise. And whatever such a
   child of God beholds, it works for his good. If he sees sin, he thanks
   God for having kept him from it, and prays for the conversion of the
   sinners; if he sees goodness, he desires to fulfil it in his own
   practice. We ought always to keep two ends in view,--to put away from
   us all that is hurtful, and to put on all that is yet lacking to us of
   good works. But those who vainly think to be made God's children by
   their much watching, and fasting, and labour, by keeping silence, by
   singing hymns, by wearing bad and inconvenient clothing, or again by
   great deeds and pious works, while they do not dive into the bottom of
   their hearts, and spy out all their secret inclinations, to lesser as
   well as to greater faults; such as an inclination to think too well of
   themselves and too ill of their neighbours, or to harshness, to
   trespass on the rights of others, to moroseness, to a bitter spirit, to
   contradiction, to obstinacy, to caprice, and the like, and do not
   perceive these things in themselves, nor wish to learn how to get rid
   of their old bad dispositions nor yet of their outward bad habits, such
   as evil speaking, lightness of manners, unkind ridicule of others, and
   refuse to give ear to those who teach and exhort them to what is right,
   or to probe their own motives;--these are all the children of the
   Devil. Alas! how many are martyrs for the Devil! To such as these
   Isaiah says: "Bring no more vain oblations: cease to do evil; learn to
   do well; wash you, make you clean." Yea, if a man were to suffer
   himself to be torn to pieces, and did not learn to cleanse himself
   thoroughly from his sins, to behave towards his fellow-creatures in a
   spirit of generous love, and to love God above all things, it would all
   be useless and in vain.

   Dionysius says: "To be converted to the truth means nothing else but a
   turning from the love of created things, and a coming into union with
   the uncreated Highest Good. And in one who is thus converted there is a
   joy beyond conception, and his understanding is unclouded and
   unperverted by the love of earthly things, and is mirrored in his
   conscience, in the mirror of God's mind. Love is the noblest of all
   virtues, for it makes man divine, and makes God man." And again:
   "Cleanse your hearts and make yourselves at one with God, for one
   glimpse of Him brings the soul closer to Him than all the outward works
   of all Christendom. He who wishes to attain to this union must get
   beyond all that may be conquered and grasped by the understanding, for
   God hath nothing so hidden that it cannot be revealed unto the soul. O
   that she were but wise enough to seek after it with all earnestness!"

   A certain teacher has said, that if a man will give his heart and life
   to God, God will give him in return greater gifts than if he were to
   suffer death over again for him.

   Now that man shall attain unto the Highest Good who is ready to descend
   into the lowest depths of poverty. And this comes to pass when he is
   cast into utter wretchedness, and forsaken of all creatures and all
   comfort. And let him ask help of none; let him be as knowing nothing,
   and as though he had never been aught but a fool; let him have none to
   take compassion on him, even so much as to give him a cup of cold water
   to drink; yet let him never forget God in his heart, and never shrink
   from God's searching eye of judgment, though he knows not what its
   verdict will be; but with a cheerful and thankful spirit yield himself
   up to suffer whatever God shall appoint unto him, and to fulfil
   according to his power, by the grace of God, all His holy will to the
   utmost that he can discern it, and never complain of his distresses but
   to God alone with entire and humble resignation, praying that he may be
   strong to endure all his sufferings according to the will of God;--Ah,
   dear children, what glorious sons of God would such men be! what
   wonders would God work through them to the magnifying of His glory!
   These are the true and righteous men who trust in God, and cleave to
   Him in spirit and in truth! That we may thus become His sons, may God
   help us by His grace! Amen.

Sermon for Epiphany

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   This Sermon on the Gospel for the day, from St. Matthew, showeth how
   God, of His great faithfulness hath foreseen and ordained all
   sufferings for the eternal good of each man, in whatever wise they
   befall us, and whether they be great or small.

   Matt. ii. 11.--"And they presented unto him gifts: gold, and
   frankincense and myrrh."

   NOW consider first the myrrh. It is bitter; and this is a type of the
   bitterness which must be tasted before a man can find God, when he
   first turns from the world to God, and all his likings and desires have
   to be utterly changed. For it is necessary that all which a man has
   hitherto taken pleasure in possessing should be given up, and this is
   at first very bitter and very hard work to him. All things must become
   as bitter to thee as their enjoyment was sweet unto thee. But to this
   work thou hast need of a full purpose of heart and never-failing
   diligence. For the greater thy delight in anything has been, the more
   bitter will it be to give it up, yea the very gall of bitterness.

   Now, it may be asked, "How can a man be without appetites and enjoyment
   so long as he is in this present state? I am hungry, and I eat; I am
   thirsty, I drink; I am weary, I sleep; I am cold, I warm myself; and I
   cannot possibly find that to be bitter nor barren of natural enjoyment
   which is the satisfaction of my natural desires. This I cannot alter,
   so long as nature is nature." True; but this pleasure, ease,
   satisfaction, enjoyment, or delight, must not penetrate into the depths
   of thy heart, nor make up a portion of thy inner life. It must pass
   away with the things that caused it, and have no abiding place in thee.
   We must not set our affections thereon, but allow it to come and go,
   and not repose upon the sense of possession with content or delight in
   the world or the creature. We must mortify and subdue nature with
   nature, and the love thereof within us, yea, even the delight that we
   have in the children of God and good men. These and all other
   inclinations must be brought under dominion to a higher power; for till
   this is accomplished, Herod and his servants, which seek after the
   young child's life, are not altogether and of a surety dead within
   thee. Therefore beware that thou do not deceive thyself, but look
   narrowly to it, how it stands with thee, and do not be too secure, nor
   live without fear.

   But there is yet another myrrh, which far surpasses the first. This is
   the myrrh which God gives us in the cup of trouble and sorrow, of
   whatever kind it may be, outward or inward. Ah, if thou couldst but
   receive this myrrh as from its true source, and drink it with the same
   love with which God puts it to thy lips, what blessedness would it work
   in thee! Ah, what a joy and peace and an excellent thing were that!
   Yes, the very least and the very greatest sorrows that God ever suffers
   to befall thee, proceed from the depths of His unspeakable love; and
   such great love were better for thee than the highest and best gifts
   besides that He has given thee or ever could give thee, if thou couldst
   but see it in this light; yea, however small a suffering light on thee,
   God--who, as our Lord says, counts the smallest hair that ever fell
   from thy head, without thy knowing it--God has foreseen it from
   eternity, and chosen, and purposed, and appointed that it should befall
   thee. So that if your little finger only aches, if you are cold, if you
   are hungry or thirsty, if others vex you by their words or deeds, or
   whatever happens to you that causes you distress or pain, it will all
   help to fit you for a noble and blessed state; and it has been foreseen
   and fore-appointed by God that such and such things should happen and
   come upon you; for all is measured, weighed, and numbered, and cannot
   be less nor otherwise than it is. That my eyes are now in my head, is
   as God our Heavenly Father has seen it from eternity; now let them be
   put out, and let me become blind, or deaf, this also has our Heavenly
   Father foreseen from eternity, that it ought to come to pass, and had
   His eternal counsel with respect unto it, and determined it from
   eternity within Himself. Ought I not, then, to open my inward eyes and
   ears, and thank my God that His eternal counsel is fulfilled in me?
   Ought I to grieve at it? I ought to be wonderfully thankful for it! And
   so also with loss of friends, or property, or reputation, or comfort,
   or whatever it be that God allots to us, it will all serve to prepare
   thee, and help thee forward to true peace, if thou canst only take it
   so. Now, sometimes people have said to me: "Master, it is ill with me:
   I have much suffering and tribulation"; and when I have answered: "It
   is all as it should be," they have said, "No, Master, I have deserved
   it; I have cherished an evil thing in my heart." Then take blame to
   thyself; but whether thy pain be deserved or not, believe that it comes
   from God, and thank Him, and bear it, and resign thyself to it.

   All the myrrhs of bitterness that God gives, are ordered aright, that
   He may by this means raise men to true greatness. It is for the
   wholesome exercise of suffering that He has set the forces of nature as
   it were at war with man. He could just as well and as easily have
   caused bread to grow as corn, but that it is necessary for man to have
   his powers exercised in every way. And He has bestowed as much care and
   thought in the arrangement of each single thing, as the artist does
   when he is painting a picture, who never draws a single stroke with his
   pencil without considering how long, how short, and how broad it ought
   to be; and it must be so and no otherwise, if the picture is to be a
   perfect masterpiece, and all its bright red and blue colours are to
   come out. But God takes a thousand times more pains with us than the
   artist with his picture, by many touches of sorrow, and by many colours
   of circumstance, to bring man into the form which is the highest and
   noblest in His sight, if only we received His gifts and myrrh in the
   right spirit.

   There are some, however, who are not content with the myrrh that God
   gives them, but think fit to give themselves some, and create evils for
   themselves and sick fancies, and have indeed suffered long and much,
   for they take hold of all things by the wrong end. And they gain little
   grace from all their pain, because they are building upon stones of
   their own laying, whether it be penances or abstinence, or prayer or
   meditation. According to them, God must wait their leisure, and let
   them do their part first, else no good will come of the work. God hath
   fixed it in His purpose that He will reward nothing but His own works.
   In the kingdom of Heaven He will crown nothing to all eternity but His
   works, and not thine. What He has not wrought in thee, He takes no
   account of.

   In the third place, there is an exceeding bitter myrrh which God gives;
   namely, inward assaults and inward darkness. When a man is willing to
   taste this myrrh, and does not put it from him, it wears down flesh and
   blood, yea, the whole nature; for these inward exercises make the cheek
   grow pale far sooner than great outward hardships, for God appoints
   unto his servants cruel fightings and strange dread, and unheard of
   distresses, which none can understand but he who has felt them. And
   these men are beset with such a variety of difficulties, so many cups
   of bitterness are presented to them, that they hardly know which way to
   turn, or what they ought to do; but God knows right well what He is
   about. But when the cup is put away, and these feelings are stifled or
   unheeded, a greater injury is done to the soul than can ever be
   amended. For no heart can conceive in what surpassing love God giveth
   us this myrrh; yet this which we ought to receive to our soul's good,
   we suffer to pass by us in our sleepy indifference, and nothing comes
   of it. Then we come and complain: "Alas, Lord! I am so dry, and it is
   so dark within me!" I tell you, dear child, open thy heart to the pain,
   and it will do thee more good than if thou wert full of feeling and
   devoutness.

   Now men receive this bitter myrrh in two ways; they try to meet it as
   with their practical sense or with their intellectual subtilty. When it
   springs from outward circumstances, men wish they had known better, and
   they would have averted it with their wisdom, and attribute it to
   outward accidents, to fate, or misfortune, and think they might have
   taken steps to prevent what has happened, and if they had done so, the
   means would have succeeded, and the calamity would have been turned
   aside. They would fain be too wise for God, and teach Him, and master
   Him, and cannot take things from His hand. The sufferings of such are
   very sore, and their myrrh is exceeding bitter.

   There are others, who having tasted the cup of that bitterness which
   springs from within, do start back and forthwith seek to break away
   from it by the exercise of their natural wit and subtilty, and think to
   quell the strife by dint of reasoning and arguing with themselves. And
   this kind of trouble often passes away more quickly with simple minds
   than with those whose reason is more active; for the former follow God
   more simply, they feel they do not know what to do, and so they trust.
   But if those of higher powers follow God's leading, and surrender
   themselves wholly to Him, their career is far nobler and more blessed,
   for their reason serves them in all things more freely and excellently.

   Now from this myrrh springs a noble branch, which beareth costly
   frankincense. The frankincense gum sends forth a sweet-smelling smoke;
   so when the fire catches the rod, it curls round it and seeks to set
   loose the perfume that is contained therein, that it may go forth and
   spread a fragrant incense around. The fire is nothing else than burning
   love to God, which is as it were latent in prayer; and love is the
   frankincense which sends forth the true fragrance of holy devotion.
   For, as a writer has said: "Prayer is nothing but the going up of the
   spirit unto God." And just as the straw exists for the sake of the
   corn, and is good for nothing in itself but to make a bed whereon to
   lie, or to manure the earth, so outward prayer is of no profit except
   in so far as it stirs up the noble flame of devotion in the heart, and
   when that sweet incense breaks forth and rises up, then it matters
   little whether the prayer of the lips be uttered or not. In saying
   this, I except those persons who are bound by the ordinances of the
   Holy Church to offer up prayers, and those who have vowed to perform
   acts of devotion, or have been advised thereunto by their spiritual
   directors.

   May Jesus Christ, the King of Glory, help us to make the right use of
   all the myrrh that God sends us, and to offer up to Him the true
   incense of devout hearts. Amen! [44]

  VI

Second Sermon for Epiphany

   Showeth on what wise a man shall arise from himself and from all
   creatures, to the end that God may find the ground of his soul
   prepared, and may begin and perfect his work therein.

   Isaiah lx. 1.--"Arise, O Jerusalem, and be enlightened." [45]

   IN all this world God covets and requires but one thing only, and that
   He desires so exceeding greatly that He gives His whole might and
   energy thereto. This one thing is, that He may find that good ground
   which He has laid in the noble mind of man made fit and ready for Him
   to exercise His divine agency thereon. For God has all power in heaven
   and on earth, and the only thing that is lacking unto Him is that He is
   hindered from accomplishing the most glorious of all His works in man.

   Now what must we do that God may shine in on this innermost ground of
   the soul, and work there? We must arise, says our text. Arise! this
   sounds as if we could do something towards this work. We must arise
   from all that is not God, from ourselves and from all creatures. And by
   this act of arising, the ground of the soul is stirred, and a strong
   craving springs up in it; and the more this deepest ground of the soul
   is laid bare, and all that occupied and cumbered it is cleared away,
   the keener grows this craving after something higher than itself, so
   that ofttimes with God's lightest touch upon the naked soul, the
   longing pierces through flesh and blood and marrow.

   But there are two sorts of over-bold men who are driven by this
   stirring up of their souls into two rash courses. The first come with
   their natural quickness of parts, and with the conceptions of their own
   minds, and try therewith to touch the principle of their souls, and
   seek to still the craving within them by hearing and learning of lofty
   matters. And in this they find great delight, and ween that they are a
   Jerusalem,--a city of peace, by the exercise of their intellect. There
   is another class who think to prepare the ground of their souls for God
   and to obtain peace by means of self-chosen good works, or by religious
   exercises, such as prayer, meditation, or whatever they see other
   people do for the same end; and then they fancy they are verily
   children of Zion, and their works of piety and charity do yield them
   great peace, and they delight in nothing so much as in religious
   exercises and the fulfilling of the tasks they have set themselves. But
   that their peace is a false one, may be perceived by this, that they do
   not cure themselves of their former faults, such as pride, sensuality,
   self-indulgence, love of the creature, proneness to suspect or to judge
   others; and if any offend them, resentment forthwith flames up within
   them, and an angry word escapes them, or hatred smoulders in their
   heart; and such like faults they indulge in with their own consent. By
   this we may know that they wish to manage their souls after their own
   fashion, and work in them; while God cannot accomplish His work in such
   a foul and unswept chamber. Therefore, their peace is false, and they
   have not yet arisen in truth. Let not such claim to be children of
   Zion, nor dare to think they have found true peace; but let them
   seriously set themselves to work to conquer their faults, exercising
   themselves, after the pattern of our Lord, in humility and works of
   love, dying unto themselves in all things, and thus learn how to rise
   on high.

   But those others, that is to say those noble men who do truly arise and
   receive divine light, these allow God to prepare their souls for
   Himself, and renounce themselves in all things without any reserve,
   either as regards their words or their daily habits, or what they do or
   refrain from, or anything else, whether things go smoothly or crossly
   with them. Both in framing their purposes, and in meeting what arises,
   they refer all to God in humble fear, and give themselves wholly up to
   Him, in utter poorness of spirit, in willing self-surrender,
   acquiescing in the divine will. They are content to say in all matters,
   "As God will": in quiet or in disquiet; for their sole delight is the
   holy and excellent will of God. To these we may apply what Christ said
   unto His disciples when they bade Him to go up unto the feast: "Go ye
   up; your time is alway ready, but my time is not yet come." These men's
   time is alway ready for them to endure and submit; all time is fitting
   for them; but God's time is not alway ready, when He deigns or sees fit
   to work, or to send forth His light. This they submissively leave to
   His divine will, and are willing to wait as long as He pleases.

   Now the distinguishing mark of this better sort of men is that they
   suffer God to order their souls' affairs, and do not hinder Him. Yet
   they are not raised above the shocks of temptation, nor even the
   liability to fall for a moment (for no one is entirely delivered from
   this danger); but afterwards, as soon as the first onset of passion is
   over, and their fault is held up before them, whether it be pride, or
   self-indulgence, or anger, or hatred, or whatever is their special
   temptation, they come to God in self-abasement, and submit themselves
   to Him, and bear without murmuring what He sees fit to appoint unto
   them. And such do in truth arise, for they rise above themselves in all
   things, and they do become in truth a Jerusalem or stronghold of peace,
   for they have quiet in disquietude and prosperity in adversity, and
   rejoice in the will of God amidst all circumstances. Therefore no power
   in this world can take away their peace, nor could all the devils in
   hell, nor all the men on earth banded together. All their affections
   centre in God, and they are enlightened by Him of a truth; for He
   shines into their souls with a strong and clear light that reveals all
   things unto them; and He shineth as truly, nay far more brightly, in
   the blackest darkness than in the seeming light. Ah! these are sweet
   and lovely children of God, raised above nature by their likeness to
   Him; and such neither undertake nor bring to pass any of their works
   without God. Nay, if we may dare to use such language, they are, so to
   speak, nothing, but God is in them; as St Paul says: "I live, yet not I
   but Christ liveth in me." Ah! these are highly-favoured men; they bear
   the world upon, their shoulders and are the noble pillars of society.
   To make one of their number, what a blessed and glorious thing were
   that!

   Now, the distinguishing mark of those two classes of presumptuous men
   whom we first spoke of, is that they choose to govern their souls for
   themselves, instead of submitting themselves to the direction of God;
   and hence their powers are kept under bondage to sin, so that they
   cannot fully conquer their evil habits; nay, they even continue therein
   with content, or at least with the consent of their own will. But those
   other noble, blessed, self-renouncing men, who have given themselves
   over to God, are exalted above themselves; and hence, if they are
   overtaken in a fault, so soon as they are aware of it, they flee unto
   God with it, and straightway the sin is no more, and they are in a
   state of godlike freedom. Shall they not then with reason desire that
   God may prepare their souls?

   There is no need for these men to perform outward works, in addition,
   as if they were a matter of necessity. No! Now the text itself in this
   one word, "Arise!" bids them to lift themselves up: and is not that a
   work? Yes, one work it does behove them to fulfil without ceasing, if
   they are ever to come to perfectness. They must continually arise, and
   have their minds directed upwards towards God, and their hearts free
   from entanglement, ever asking, "Where is He who is born a king?" and
   watching with humble fear and quick eye to discern what God desires of
   them, that they may do His pleasure. If God gives them to suffer, they
   suffer; if He gives them to work they work: if He them to enjoy Him in
   contemplation, they contemplate. The ground of their own souls bears
   witness that God has cleansed them and created them anew.

   And this ground and substance of the soul will God possess alone, and
   will not that any creature should enter therein. In this chamber of the
   heart God works through means in the one class of men, and without
   means in the other and more blessed sort. But what he works in the
   souls of these last with whom He holds direct converse, none can say,
   nor can one man give account of it to another, but he only who has felt
   it knows what it is; and even he can tell thee nothing of it, save only
   that God in very truth hath possessed the ground of his soul. And where
   this comes to pass, outward works become of no moment, but the inward
   perceiving of God greatly increases. But when a man reaches the highest
   point that he may attain unto by his most earnest endeavour and the
   help of God's grace, let him ascribe nothing whatever unto himself; as
   our blessed Lord said: "When ye have done all those things which are
   commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that
   which it was our duty to do." Therefore, let a man be never so perfect,
   he shall always stand in humble fear, at his highest glory; and shall
   always say and feel, "Father, thy will be done!" and shall at all times
   keep a watch upon himself, looking narrowly lest he should cleave unto
   one single thing that is amiss, and God should find anything in the
   secret chambers of his heart that hinders His accomplishing His
   glorious work therein without the help of means.

   May God help us all so to arise that He may accomplish His work in our
   souls! Amen.

Sermon for the Fourth Sunday after Epiphany

   (From the Gospel for the day; and from Hosea xiv. 1, 2.)

   Of the great wonders which God has wrought, and still works for us
   Christian men; wherefore it is just and reasonable that we should turn
   unto Him and follow Him, and whereby we may discern between true and
   false conversion.

   Matt. viii. 23.--"Jesus went into a ship, and His disciples followed
   Him." And Hosea xiv. 1, 2.--"O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God;
   take with you words, and turn to the Lord."

   WE read in the Gospel for this day that Jesus went into a ship, and His
   disciples followed Him. In like manner must all pious Christians turn
   from sin and follow Christ, as He commands us by the mouth of the
   Prophet Hosea, saying: "O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God."

   Out of all the tribes of mankind the Lord chose one, to whom He showed
   great kindness, and promised to do yet greater things for them, if they
   would turn with their whole heart unto Him, and not follow after the
   ways of the other nations who lived according to their sinful lusts in
   the darkness and blindness of their hearts, and went astray with wicked
   lives and perverse minds after the vanities of the world and the
   deceits of the Devil. And to this end, God led His people out bodily by
   the hand of His servants and prophets, and also gave them His law to
   teach them, that they might behold His great power which he had
   glorified against their enemies, and His great love which He had
   manifested by numberless acts and unspeakable benefits towards
   themselves, being minded to do yet greater things for them hereafter,
   if they would truly turn to Him with their whole heart, and love Him,
   and keep His commandments. And he commanded them that they should never
   forget the day on which they had been delivered out of the hands of
   their enemies, and from their cruel bondage and toil, but should set
   themselves with earnestness and diligence to consider His commandments,
   to keep them and do them. But this people was stiff-necked, heedless,
   and unthankful, and did not do as God had commanded by the mouth of His
   servants, but was continually self-willed, perverse, and bent on sin;
   and therefore the Lord suffered them all to die in the wilderness, and
   slew many of them. And afterwards He sent again other servants unto
   them, saying: "O my chosen people, if ye will be converted and turn
   unto me with your whole heart, and not go astray halting between two
   opinions, but follow after me only, and forsake the way of the
   Egyptians, the way of darkness, of sin, and of death, I will bring you
   into a land of righteousness, where all good things shall be given
   you."

   Now all these things came to pass under the old dispensation in past
   ages, with many signs and in hidden mysterious covenants sealed by
   oaths. But they also foreshadowed all that should come to pass in
   future ages after the incarnation of the Son of God, in the which we
   now live. Now He purposes to draw us likewise to Himself, by the help
   of these same words and teachings, if only we will turn unto Him; and
   therefore does He give us so many reasons, exhortations, instructions
   or motives, that we should turn unto Him with our whole hearts. He
   works now-a-days quite as many miracles and mighty deeds as then, among
   the Egyptians of this world and Pharaoh its king, spiritually and also
   visibly, in the conversion of each one among us, if we give heed
   thereto with thankful hearts. But alas! it is with too many of us as it
   was with the Israelites, we are only changed outwardly with the body,
   but our heart is yet in Egypt. We all pass under good names, and make a
   fair show, but in reality our whole affections and endeavours are
   turned towards the pleasures and advantages of the flesh and the world.
   And we are all the time so very careful and diligent to keep strictly
   to all that is commanded respecting outward observances, such as
   vestments, chanting, kneeling, and the like, and are satisfied if all
   these matters are scrupulously observed, and sit down contented,
   fancying that all is well with us, and that we are far enough from
   Egypt. Nay, verily, dear children, we are very wide of the mark; this
   is all a mere semblance and shadow, the leaves of the fig-tree which
   could not satisfy our Lord's hunger; He must find fruit on the tree,
   else it is nigh to be cursed by Him, that no man taste fruit thereof to
   all eternity. Ah! how often have you been taught that you ought not to
   cleave unto mere shadows and outward forms. Although these be wholesome
   and needful for beginners, still they are but a long way off from the
   real truth and substance, for the sake of which all these outward acts
   are performed. If you do not look to it betimes, you will have the
   outward shape remaining, while within there is all manner of sin and
   wickedness cherished in your hearts, as much as with those who have not
   the show of religion; and alas! men often fall into deeper vice under
   this cloak, than if they were yet in the Egypt of worldliness. It would
   be better for them if they had never quitted the world, for now is
   there damnation greater while they wear the garb of holiness, not
   acting conformably to it, and yet claim and make use of all the
   privileges of their religious profession.

   Children, I know of nothing so greatly needed as that those who are
   entering on a religious life should be instructed with all care, that
   they may know what things they ought first to learn, and then
   afterwards, when the outward practice of good works and piety has
   become a habit to them, that they may also know how to advance farther,
   and not content themselves or be satisfied with outward habits; for
   these do not in themselves make a perfect life, but are only a good
   preparation and a slight furtherance thereto. If this be early
   instilled into beginners, while they are yet young, docile, and quick
   of apprehension, and also hot and earnest, it may be that some of them
   will study betimes to press onwards to what is higher. But, alas! and
   worse than alas! we have so often to behold the sorrowful spectacle of
   some who began in the spirit with great zeal; who at first were so
   fervid that they would hardly turn their eyes upon any who might lead
   their thoughts astray; and who now can hardly be persuaded to quit
   men's company for an hour's meditation; some who at first could not
   bear to listen to a worldly word, and now, early and late, you can
   scarcely get a respite from their gossiping, and unprofitable questions
   and answers; at first they wanted to withdraw into silence and
   solitude, that they might by prayer and work sustain their devoutness;
   and now, the more earthly care they can encumber themselves with, the
   better they are pleased. Ah! this and the like is a certain sign that
   they are held captive by the flesh, that they have wandered into
   darkness, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt. Children!
   for the love of Christ, look to yourselves each of you, and see how it
   stands with you. However well you may begin in virtue, do not rely upon
   your good beginning, for all your piety may pass away if you are not
   watchful. Our hearts are more unstable than we can believe.

   Some are at first so zealous for all righteousness, that if they hear
   an idle word, or witness any other little failing, it makes them angry;
   but when they are a little older, they indulge without any rebuke of
   conscience in such levity, evil-speaking, and often malicious and
   scornful speeches, that they not only cause others vexation, but even
   serious trouble and sorrow, and never even give it a thought whether
   they may have done so, but behave as if they had done perfectly right.

   Some are at first so strong, and ready to withstand temptation and
   assaults, that they are not even afraid of the Devil: yea, they would
   fain be great and holy martyrs; yet afterwards, when they have lived
   for a while among holy, pious people, you would hardly meet with more
   perverse, cross-grained, self-willed persons. Some are at first so
   eager to take upon themselves all manner of hardships and indignities,
   that the severities and self-humiliation of those with whom they live
   are too light and few for them; but after they have travelled this road
   for a while, they are not only able to submit to the ordinary habits of
   others, but it is hardly possible to make things comfortable and easy
   enough for them to prevent their complaining, and every little
   inconvenience annoys them. Ah! what would not be needed to stop their
   murmuring!

   Very different from these are many pious, warmhearted, spiritual-minded
   men, who find the cross very hard to bear at first, but in a short time
   make great progress, and become a most edifying and useful pattern to
   others, while those from whom too much was expected have come to
   nothing. Hence we must be very much upon our guard because of our
   instability; we know not what may overtake us in time to come.

   Dear children, that each of you may be able in some measure to mark
   whether he be converted or not, I will lay open to you a little,
   whereby we may perceive the sincerity of our own conversion, and
   redemption from all the evil which our Enemy may try to lead us into by
   his various incitements to sin. In our baptism we promised before God
   and the Church to withstand all sin, and to serve God in all holy
   living. But afterwards our wicked adversary led us astray again, so
   that we fell afresh, and lost the grace which had been given us; but
   God of his unspeakable mercy calls us again to a new repentance, that
   all which we have lost may be restored unto us. But herein many are
   beguiled by the Evil One into deadly error, so that they miss this
   opportunity of amendment; for he knows how, with his cunning wiles, to
   cover our old sins under the mantle of conversion, and thus to
   frustrate all a man's labour and toil. That we may be the better able
   to escape him, I will give you some tokens to mark which man is truly
   converted and which is not.

   A truly converted Christian man abides in a sincere and humble
   confession of his nothingness; all his desire is that none should set
   him above others, nor yet to rule over others, but rather to be subject
   in all meekness to another, according to whose will he may fulfil all
   his works. He thinks lightly of himself and his own wisdom, and desires
   in all things to take the lowest place; and is willing to take advice,
   and interprets everything for the best; and simply in the fear of God,
   with a thankful heart, fulfils all that which he is bidden or
   counselled, or that others beg of him to do. But, on the other hand,
   those who are not truly converted think much of themselves, and deem
   all their works and services of great value, and it is not at all to
   their taste to be subject to others, or that any should have a right to
   command them, and are fond of reproving others unnecessarily, and of
   discoursing on lofty matters, and boast themselves proudly of all that
   belongs to them, and yet cover all this under a specious show of piety
   and humility, that men may not take it amiss of them. If any seem to
   put a slight upon them, they are contentious, and defend and justify
   themselves to the utmost that they can. They are arrogant and
   ambitious, and unyielding in their hardness of spirit. These are all
   still in the hands of the Enemy, yea, did they wear the Pope's tiara.

   Those who are truly converted are kind-hearted to their neighbours,
   indulgent from brotherly love, praising the works of their neighbours
   as far as they can, and with great sincerity of heart rejoice in the
   well-being of their neighbour, and lend him a helping hand wherever
   they can, and have great sympathy with him in his troubles; but the
   falsely converted are spiteful, and look with an evil eye on the
   usefulness or piety of others, are ready to breed mischief with a
   taunt, and are revengeful, sneering, and puffed up in their own
   conceits.

   The right sort of men are patient under all the annoyance and injustice
   that God suffers to befall them, and bear it long with peaceable
   tempers. They speak mildly, using soft words, and are wont meekly to
   seek reconciliation with those who have done them wrong; but the false
   burn with anger, are envious of others' good fortune, slanderous,
   quarrelsome, and censorious, not orderly in all their affairs, and full
   of murmuring against all, above and below them, who do not conform to
   their wishes.

   The truly righteous are ever gentle and merciful, ready to give and to
   assist as far as they are able, without regard to their own advantage;
   for they despise the perishable things of time, and maintain their
   love, enjoyment, and cheerfulness under distress, poverty, and
   contempt, being easily contented and cheerful, and thankful to Almighty
   God, in spirit looking up constantly to God who preserves and sustains
   them, and casting behind them all unprofitable earthly anxieties, that
   they may give the more heed to the things of God and eternity. But the
   false burn like a furnace with the desire of temporal things, and seek
   their own pleasure and ease when and how they may, and often steal time
   and other things for it, that they may not be discovered by their
   superiors; or if they can no longer conceal their practices, then they
   indulge in them with an obstinate bold face, and steal time for
   themselves shamelessly in the teeth of their masters. They want to have
   praise and earthly reward for all that they do, and if they are not
   honoured and thought highly of, they become like one possessed, and
   openly or secretly do all the harm they can for spite and vexation.
   They are always hoping to receive a worldly and corruptible reward for
   their religious professions, and are often seduced into actual deceit
   and lying, in their struggle to get honour or to save their reputation.

   The upright are careful to fill up their time industriously, with good
   and useful undertakings to the glory of God and the good of their
   neighbours, rejoicing in spirit as they exercise themselves in good
   works, endeavouring to do all things well, and continue with hearty
   trust in God, steadfast in goodness. The false converts are constantly
   indolent and half-hearted in their work, wavering, ill-mannered, easily
   disheartened, and altogether drowsy, their minds lying waste and their
   hearts undisciplined.

   The true converts are moderate and decorous in the satisfying of their
   natural wants, shunning all excess, and if they by accident transgress,
   avoiding it for the future. By moderation in eating, they keep their
   faculties clear and under control; and above all, they most earnestly
   guard against any excess in drinking. But false professors are given to
   eating and drinking, yet they can never fully satisfy their desires,
   and are unthankful to God for the food He gives them. Without restraint
   or good manners, they cram their bodies, whereby they often bring on
   grievous sicknesses, and they seek their pleasure without shame
   wherever they can. And after excess at table, some give way to unseemly
   levity in words and gestures, and inconvenient jesting, and telling and
   hearing all manner of tales. Others become quarrelsome, brawling, and
   so noisy, that to hear their senseless cries you would think them
   asses, not men. Some become so sleepy and lazy after dinner, that they
   could scarcely repeat the Lord's Prayer without a blunder; and in
   general, sloth and the like commonly proceed from strong drinks and
   over-feeding. Hence it is that all holy men have insisted so strongly
   upon simplicity in food and drink, that they might give no cause in
   themselves or others to such infirmities. But now, alas! it has gone so
   far, that even the clergy, for the most part, cannot, or rather will
   not, content themselves even with rich men's fare; and from this cause
   their blindness has grown so great that it is rare now-a-days to find
   one who is really aware of the dangers from this source to which he is
   exposed by the assaults or suggestions of the Devil. For the adversary
   is apt to bring these men sooner than they think for into an
   inclination towards, or even to commit acts of foul uncleanness, by
   defiling their heart with obscene thoughts and evil lusts; and in this
   way they often sin grossly, and provoke God more than they believe. And
   then the tumult of evil desires within makes them to be unfit for good
   works, and displeasing to God and holy men; and they are so tossed, and
   driven, and blinded by passion, that they actually try to quench it in
   riotous company, and in eating and drinking. This leads to inordinate
   merriment and light discourse, which are generally wont to estrange a
   man so much from all godly thoughts, that afterwards he can hardly read
   a verse with devotion; and in his very prayers the Devil brings the
   scenes he has witnessed and the language he has heard so vividly before
   him, that he can scarce hold in his tittering and laughing.

   The righteous and truly converted men are so shamefaced and chaste of
   heart before God and the angels, that they would rather die than
   conceive an impure image in their hearts, and with all watchfulness
   they preserve their mind pure and unsullied, and they diligently keep
   all their senses and members under strict and constant control,
   insomuch that they will hardly pay any attention to their own bodies,
   except for safety and cleanliness; and for the better preserving of
   their pureness of mind, they chastise their bodies with fasting, and
   watching, and toil, exercising constant prayerfulness and trust in God,
   in whom all their help lies. But the false of heart do not see much
   harm in looking at and dwelling on evil, sinful thoughts and images in
   their hearts; hence they often come into such perturbation of soul and
   body, that they stand, as it were, in the very gate of hell; yea, they
   often fall so deep, as to give consent to sin with their heart, and
   would actually fulfil all wickedness if the opportunity arose. So
   unthinkingly do they fall through love of themselves, in seeking the
   pleasure of the body! Some of these become so hardened, and restless,
   and maddened with the sense of restraint, that they come to hate God
   for having forbidden the lusts of the flesh, and wish He did not know
   of their sins, or was not able to punish them, which is as much as to
   wish that there were no God.

   And now, dear children, consider how you stand; and, seeing the perils
   which beset us all, let no one be too secure or too bold, but let each
   look to himself in fear; and however well it may be with him now, let
   him not trust in his goodness; and however deeply he may have fallen,
   or however far he may have wandered, let him now turn and be converted
   of a truth, for the path to all goodness stands yet open to him so long
   as God spares him in life. That we may all enter therein, may God help
   us! Amen.

Sermon for the Sixth Sunday after Epiphany

   (From the Gospel for St. Matthias'-day, 24th February)

   Of the proper marks of true humility.

   Matt. xi. 29.--"Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart."

   CHRIST, our blessed Lord, the true master and teacher of all art and
   virtue, and a pattern of all perfection, when He came down from Heaven
   to instruct us poor ignorant men, did not see fit to make use of great
   subtleties, or mysterious and ingenious statements of truth; but in
   short, plain, simple words He delivered to us a maxim, and gave us a
   very short, easy lesson, which we were well able to learn. Now this
   stood written in the book of His holy humanity, in large, distinct
   letters, easy to be read, and runs thus: "Learn of me, for I am meek
   and lowly in heart."

   What shorter, easier, more intelligible lesson could be set us? but we
   must give our minds with willing industry to read it over and over
   again attentively, and practise it in our life, ever looking to the
   admirable model of the divine humanity of Christ, whose whole life was
   not only meek and humble, but whose words, ways, walk, and all that
   ever He did, are simply the illustration of this doctrine. Hence He
   chose at the beginning such scholars and disciples as were specially
   fitted to learn this doctrine, and these were the holy apostles, and
   His blessed mother, who said when she had conceived Him: "He hath
   regarded the lowliness of His handmaiden." Thus He says, in the Gospel
   for this day, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth,
   because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent" (that is
   from the proud), "and hath revealed them unto babes" (that is to the
   humble). From this we gather that none but the humble are able to
   receive the hidden things of God. Therefore, dear children, that we may
   obtain this grace, and the better learn this lesson, we shall now
   consider some tokens of true lowliness which is never without meekness,
   and these are the following:

   He who sincerely desires to become lowly of heart, must not be ashamed
   of performing any outward office such as the worldly heart thinks mean
   and humiliating; for as it is a sure token of conversion from sin that
   it becomes hateful to the man, so it is a sign of true repentance, when
   he is ready in all things to take the meanest place, if that he may
   attain to that true lowliness of heart which is seated inwardly in the
   soul. And he who will go forward in this blessed path must faithfully
   examine himself, and to this end God also will bestow on him such great
   grace as he has never had before.

   He must always be ready to acknowledge himself in fault towards
   whomsoever it may be, and esteem others better than himself; for by so
   doing the loving heart can best soften the dispositions of men and
   touch their hearts, and win them over to meekness. And although he be
   sometimes not justly to be reckoned as in fault at all, yet knowing
   that he might have done the wrong, he shall always behave himself
   humbly, for the sake of love, to the glory of God, seeing that God has
   forgiven him sins ere he committed them; for it is equally an act of
   mercy to forgive sins, or to preserve us from sinning.

   In the third place, it belongs to a lowly heart to be kindly affected
   towards all, not with a partial love; that is, not to show more
   kindness to one than another, to friends more than strangers, but to do
   good to all for God's sake, as our neighbours, not from mere natural
   affection, but to bestow on all a free, generous love (like our Father
   in Heaven, "who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and
   sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust"), and also to love each
   according to his worthiness.

   In the fourth place, it is necessary to lowliness of heart that we
   divest and disencumber ourselves of all things, that we may cleave only
   to our merciful God, and become one with Him; for God will not and
   cannot unite Himself or dwell with a worldly heart. Therefore let a man
   bow himself to the earth beneath God and his creatures, in
   self-annihilation inward and outward; and this is what is meant by
   forsaking all things, and putting away the creature. The fifth token of
   true lowliness of heart is to know how to suffer to the glory of God,
   for sincere love of God, simply hoping, believing, and trusting in Him.

   Thus a lowly walk consists in three things; in patient endurance, in
   giving up out of love and faith, and in hope towards God. And from
   these flows the sense of our own wretchedness, the knowledge of our
   Creator, and a will wholly resigned to God, not for our own sake, but
   for the glory of God. May God help us to learn thus to be meek and
   lowly of heart. Amen!

Sermon for Septuagesima Sunday

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   In this Sermon following we are taught how we must perpetually press
   forward towards our highest good, without pause or rest; and how we
   must labour in the spiritual vineyard that it may bring forth good
   fruit.

   Matt. xx. 1.--"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
   householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into
   his vineyard."

   THIS householder went out early at the first hour, and again at the
   third and at the sixth hours, and hired labourers for a penny a day.
   But when it was quite late in the evening he went out again, and still
   found men standing idle. Then he said unto them, Why stand ye here all
   the day idle? Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I
   will give you.

   Dear children, this householder signifies our Lord Jesus Christ; His
   house is the heavens, and this earth, and purgatory, and hell. He saw
   that all nature had gone astray, insomuch that His lovely vineyard lay
   a barren waste; and man, whom He had made to possess this fair and
   fruitful vineyard, had wandered far away from Him, and left this
   excellent vineyard to be untilled. But the Lord of the vineyard
   determined to invite men to return into this vineyard for which He had
   created him, and went out early to that end.

   Dear children, in one sense Jesus Christ went out early from the divine
   bosom of the Father, and yet evermore dwells there. But in another
   sense, He went out early in human nature, that He might hire us into
   His service, and bring us back again into His noble vineyard, and so
   there might be labourers to till it. And He went out at the first hour,
   and also at the third, and sixth, and ninth hours. And at the eleventh
   hour He went out once more, and again found men standing idle, to whom
   he spoke roughly, saying, Why stand ye here all the day idle? Then they
   answered, No man hath hired us, Lord. These idle men whom no man hath
   hired are those who are still in their original, uncorrupt, and
   innocent state, and hence they are rightly called blessed; for God saw
   as He looked on them, that they were unhired; that is, not held in
   servitude to the world and the creatures. There are some who are God's
   hired labourers, and these are in a higher sense free, and at large,
   and not held in servitude to the world or the creature. But these of
   whom we are now speaking are still standing idle, which ought not to
   be; that is, they are standing in apathy, cold, loveless, and devoid of
   grace; for so long as a man is not standing in the grace of God, he is
   standing alone in nature. And if such a man (were it possible, which it
   is not) were to fulfil all the good works which have ever been done in
   this world, he would still, nevertheless, be living altogether idly,
   unprofitably, and in vain, and it would avail him nothing. Again, this
   going out early in the morning is a type of the dawning of the grace of
   God in the soul; for the morning is the end of the night, when the
   darkness vanishes, and the day-spring of grace arises in the soul of
   man, and God says, Wherefore stand ye here idle? Go ye into my
   vineyard, and what is right, that will I give you.

   But the men entered after a very unequal manner into the vineyard. One
   class are those who are mere beginners; these work in God's vineyard
   with outward acts, and bodily exercises, and self-imposed tasks, and
   are persuaded that they are accomplishing great good works with their
   fasting, watching, and praying; while they never look to the purity of
   their motives, but retain their love of earthly enjoyments, and their
   own likes and dislikes. And therefrom do spring up injustice, false
   judgment, and many faults; such as pride, earthly or spiritual,
   bitterness or enmity, and more of the like, that greatly hinder the
   outpouring of divine grace, if we allow these untoward dispositions to
   break forth in words or actions. Let one who has thus been building
   upon a false foundation give heed to himself, and watch how he may best
   condemn and destroy this inward falsehood, that it lead not to his own
   ruin, nor cause harm to those with whom he may hold converse.

   A second class of men who have likewise entered into God's vineyard,
   are those who are above living for mere temporal things, and have also
   overcome their grosser sins, and have turned their minds towards higher
   things. Their life is spent in the rational practice of virtue; and in
   this they find such pleasure and delight, that they are contented with
   their condition, and miss the highest and sublimest truth; for they
   abide in the present sense of satisfaction, and do not pant to reach
   upward through and above this enjoyment to the eternal God Himself. For
   our delight ought to be in God Himself, not in these gifts of His.

   But the third class of those who go into God's vineyard are truly noble
   and highly-favoured men, who in deed and truth rise above all creature
   things in God's vineyard; for they seek and love nothing but simply God
   in Himself. They neither look to pleasure, nor to any selfish end, nor
   to that which is a mere outflow from God; for their inner man is wholly
   plunged in God, and they have no end but the praise and glory of God,
   that His good pleasure alone may be fulfilled in and through them and
   in all creatures. Hence they are able to bear all things and to resign
   all things, for they receive all things as from God's hand, and offer
   up to Him again in simplicity of heart all that they have received from
   Him, and do not lay claim to any of His mercies. They are like a river
   that flows out with every tide, and then again hastens back to its
   source. So do these men refer all their gifts back to the source whence
   they proceed, and flow back again unto it themselves likewise. For
   inasmuch as they carry all the gifts of God back unto their divine
   fountain, and do not claim any ownership in them, either for pleasure
   or advantage, and do not purpose this or that, but simply God alone,
   God must of necessity be their only refuge and stay, outward or inward.

   But although this aim carry a man so completely out of himself, and be
   perfectly simple and directed to nothing but God, yet nature has some
   regard to herself, of which a man cannot be wholly bereft. Whether he
   choose it or no (this is a simple fact), he cannot but always desire to
   feel God's presence; and so too it is a natural instinct to wish to be
   happy. But this desire should be far from his strongest, and the least
   part of what he takes into the account in his purposes. [ [46] And here
   I wish to rebuke all those religious persons who are leaning on their
   good works, and as it were keep a right of property in them, thinking
   themselves free to do or not to do them. For whenever they see or
   imagine any new undertaking or religious practice which can afford them
   inward or outward satisfaction, they give themselves to it with prayer,
   and striving, and weeping, and watching. And as long as they find
   pleasure in it, they cannot have enough of it; but if this sense of
   pleasure and interest passes away, their devotion passes away likewise,
   and they come to dislike their good and holy work, and then they grow
   lukewarm and careless, performing all they do without devotion. All
   this is owing to their not having had a single eye to God's glory. They
   have been prompted and sustained in their labour by the pleasure it has
   yielded them, and now this has fled. For we must not seek enjoyment and
   sweetness in the gifts of God, either in holy exercises, or in words or
   works; but we must take delight in God alone, and not in his gifts.

   There are, however, some religious persons who will not be left without
   solace or stay. For rather than be left simply and truly without a
   solace, destitute and bare, they set up for themselves heavenly beings,
   such as the saints and angels, and claim a sort of right to them as a
   source of spiritual enjoyment, and look to them as a consolation. Thus
   they will say: "Such a saint or angel is dear to me before all others;"
   and if you throw down this prop of their own raising, and say that they
   ought not to speak thus, you leave them little peace; nay, they are
   greatly disquieted; and this is worst of all, and doing God a great
   wrong. Thou must not place thy reliance on any creature in heaven or on
   earth, nor repose nor lean on any save God alone. If thou didst trust
   Him really and truly, all His saints would be truly and rightly
   honoured and reverenced by thee; for the departed saints are always
   absorbed in the divine, fatherly abyss of the Holy Trinity. For I tell
   thee by that Truth, which is God Himself, if thou art ever to become a
   man after the will of God, everything must die in thee to which thou
   art cleaving, whether it be God's gifts, or the saints, or the angels,
   or even all that would afford thee consolation for thy spiritual wants:
   all must be given up. If God is to shine in on thy soul brightly,
   without a cloud, and accomplish His noble and glorious will in thee,
   thou must be free and unencumbered by all that affords thee comfort out
   of God.

   We are not, therefore, forbidden to honour the blessed saints, but only
   to claim any property in their merits for the sake of our own delight
   in them; for I tell thee, that if thou hadst all manner of heavenly
   grace from God, and didst possess the good works of all mankind, so
   soon as thou shouldst claim it as thine own, for the sake of thine own
   delight therein, that moment all this goodness would be sullied and
   defaced with thine own evil. For a true and faithful servant of God
   shall be always pressing upward to what is before him, not suffering
   himself to be held back by comfort or pleasure, joy or sorrow, wealth
   or poverty. Through all this he shall urge onward, till he come unto
   the infinite ocean of the Godhead. And therein he shall be lost without
   his own knowledge, and dazzled by excess of light and love. There it
   shall be given him to know all that belongs to true perfection.]

   A good and devout man shall be like the labourer in the vineyard, who
   works all the day long, and nevertheless he must take food. But the
   labour is long and the meal barely lasts an hour, and he only takes it
   for the sake of the work. He must eat that he may work, and the
   nourishment he takes diffuses itself through every part of his body,
   continually supplying it with fresh strength, which again is consumed
   in his labour; and when it has been consumed with labour he eats again
   a little, that he may again consume it by working in the Lord's
   vineyard. So is it with a noble-minded man. When he feels an
   inclination in himself to enjoy God or His heavenly grace and what is
   thereof, let him for a little while seek and purpose his own good, but
   not longer than is needful for the nourishing of his soul, that he may
   consume his spiritual strength again in labour; and when it has thus
   been spent in the noblest of all ways, from a love flowing back unto
   God who has inspired it, then the man must go for refreshment again
   into the river of life that floweth out from the throne of God, that it
   may again bring forth in him the fruit of good works. All these
   spiritual men who thus know how to resign or to return again unto God,
   with their body and their spirits, the gifts that He has mercifully
   bestowed on them, with deep, humble self-renunciation, these do
   continually grow more able and more worthy to receive blessing from
   God. Where such admirable, god-like men are to be found, they are
   worthy, as none else are, to be fed with gold and silver and fine
   pearls, and the best that the world contains as their heritage. But
   there is many a poor noble man of God, who has none of all these
   things; let such an one humbly cast himself on the all-powerful God and
   trust him utterly; without doubt thy heavenly Father will and must
   provide thee well, yea, wert thou hidden in a rock.

   These exalted and most noble men are just like the wood of the vine,
   which is outwardly hard and black and dry, and good for no purpose
   whatever; and if we had never seen it before, we should think it of no
   use at all, and good for nothing but to be thrown into the fire, and
   burned. But in this dry wood of the vine, there lie concealed the
   living veins of sap, and power of yielding the noblest of all juices,
   and of bringing forth a greater abundance of fruit than any other sort
   of wood that grows. And thus it is with these beloved and lowly
   children, who are at all times and seasons plunged in God; they are
   outwardly in appearance like unto black rotten wood, seeming unto men
   dry and unprofitable. For there are many of these who are humble,
   noways remarkable for their gifts, outward or inward, nor for any
   extraordinary works or sayings or exercises of devotion, and who move
   in the narrowest sphere; but living veins from the fountain of truth
   lie hidden within them, forasmuch as they have asked for no earthly
   heritage, but God is their lot and their portion, their life and their
   being.

   Now the vine-dresser goes out and prunes the vine, lopping off the wild
   shoots; for if he neglected this, and suffered them to remain on the
   good stem, the whole would yield bad, sour wine. So likewise shall good
   men do: they shall cut off from themselves ill that is not according to
   God's order in their conduct or dispositions, likings or dislikings,
   and destroy it to the very root; thou shalt cut away all evil failings
   from thy heart, and it will do thee no harm, either in head or in hand,
   or any member. But hold thy knife still, till thou hast really seen
   what ought to be cut off. If a vine dresser be not skilled in his art,
   he is as likely to crop off the good branches which bear the grapes as
   the wild shoots, and thus spoil the vineyard. So it is with those who
   do not understand this spiritual art; they leave the roots of vice and
   evil dispositions alive in the heart, and hew and lop at poor nature,
   and thereby destroy this noble vineyard. Nature is in itself good and
   noble, why shouldst thou hew away aught that belongs to it? For I tell
   thee that when the time is come for it to yield fruit in a godly,
   blessed, devout life, then it will be seen that thou hast spoiled thy
   nature.

   After this the labourer binds up the vine, putting in stakes; he bends
   the upper branches down towards the earth, and fastens the vine to a
   strong framework, that it may have a support. This is a type of the
   sweet and holy life, the sacred example and sufferings of our blessed
   Lord Jesus Christ, for these and nothing of our own should be a man's
   stay. For the higher powers of his reason shall be drawn down into due
   control, and he shall sink low in deep submissive humility before Our
   Lord, in truth and not with hypocrisy, with all his powers, outward and
   inward. For when both the appetites of the body, and the highest
   intellectual powers of the soul are thus trained and bound down, each
   in its own place, so that neither the senses nor the will, nor any
   faculty, is left too free and too proud, but they are at all times
   controlled and trained into due rightful order under the Divine will,
   and man's desire at all times, and in all things, is to be by the help
   and grace of God, to the utmost of his power, outwardly and inwardly
   obedient to the Divine will, without contradiction, in all that the
   Eternal God, our Heavenly Father, has determined in His eternal divine
   counsels;--[and when all the powers humbly act in this way, in
   dependence upon God, whether they are exercised or kept in check,--were
   it within the bounds of reasonable possibility that a man could be
   conscious of possessing all the good works, and all the heavenly graces
   of all mankind, and yet took none of all this unto himself, but,
   calling nothing his own, stood up destitute and bare, in free, simple
   love to God, as if all this goodness belonged to another, and not
   himself;--Children, wherever such noble men may exist or live in this
   age of grace, in them may the Father of Heaven truly and absolutely
   accomplish His divine and mysterious work without any hindrance. And in
   him whose heart is not sincerely standing thus toward God, as to the
   guiding principle of his life, in him doubt not that this holy, divine
   birth cannot be truly brought to pass or be made fruitful.]

   Afterward the vine-dresser digs about the stems of the vine, and roots
   out all noxious weeds. Thus shall a devout man dig about the soil of
   his own heart by close observation and testing of his own principles,
   to see whether there be aught for him to root out. And if he find
   anything, let him that moment pluck it up, however trifling or
   unimportant it may be, that the beams of the eternal and divine sun may
   penetrate the farther into his very midst, shining with unbeclouded
   force, and fructifying his noblest powers. For thus the glorious sun
   draws the juices outward into the living vessels which lie hidden in
   the bark, and then the fair clusters begin to appear. Ah! children, if
   man knew how so to tend his vine, that God's sun might shine in on and
   vivify his soul, what sweet, excellent, delicious fruit would the
   eternal sun draw forth from him! For the lovely sun shines with all its
   fulness into him, and works within these precious clusters, and makes
   them flourish in sweetness and beauty. Their blossoms send forth a
   sweet and delicate fragrance, which dispels all poisonous vapours;
   neither serpent nor toad can endure their perfume, when the eternal
   divine sun shines direct among the branches, and through the clusters.
   The fruit is so entirely of God's producing, and flourishes in such
   beauty and richness, in pure looking up to God, whose rays draw forth
   from it such wondrous and delicious favour and perfume, that it needs
   must destroy the venom of the old serpent; yea, had all the devils in
   hell, and all the men on earth conspired together, they would not be
   able in the least to injure a thoroughly godly-minded and God-loving
   man, but the more they strive to injure him, the deeper he is rooted
   and the higher he is built up in God with all his powers. And if such
   an admirable man, bearing his precious fruit, were to be cast down to
   the depths of hell, he must needs turn it into a kingdom of heaven, and
   God and eternal blessedness would exist in hell. And a man who should
   bear such fruit would not need to fear in anywise all the reproach that
   could be heaped upon him. When we have no aim but God, nothing can part
   us from Him, or lead us astray.

   Now after that the vine has been well pruned, and its stem cleared of
   all weeds, the glorious sun shineth yet more brightly, and casteth his
   heat on the precious clusters, and these grow more and more
   transparent, and the sweetness begins to disclose itself more and more.
   And to such a man as we have described, all means of communication
   between God and his soul begin after a time to grow so transparent that
   the rays and glances of the divine sun reach him without ceasing, that
   is, as often and as soon as he turns himself towards them in feeling
   and thought. This divine sun shines much more brightly than all the
   suns in the firmament ever shone; and in its light all the man's ways,
   and works, and doings are so changed into its image, that he feels
   nothing to be so true as God, with a certainty that is rooted in the
   very midst of his being, yet is far above the sphere of his reason, and
   which he can never fully express, for it is too deep and too high above
   all human reason to be explored and understood.

   After this the vine-dresser loves to strip off the leaves, that thus
   the sun may have nothing to hinder its rays from pouring on the grapes.
   In like manner do all means of grace fall away from this man, such as
   images of the saints, teachings, holy exercises, set prayers, and the
   like. Yet let none cast these things aside before they fall away of
   themselves through divine grace: that is to say, when a man is drawn up
   above all that he can comprehend, then do these precious and divine
   fruits grow more sweet and delightful than either sense or reason may
   conceive, and it is possible for him to be carried so far that his
   spirit is as it were sunk and lost in the abyss of the Deity, and loses
   the consciousness of all creature distinctions. All things are gathered
   together in one with the Divine sweetness, and the man's being is so
   penetrated with the Divine substance, that he loses himself therein, as
   a drop of water is lost in a cask of strong wine. And thus the man's
   spirit is so sunk in God in divine union, that he loses all sense of
   distinction; and all that has brought him to this point, such as
   humility, the seeking God's glory,--nay, his very self,--loses its
   name, and there remains a secret, still union, without cloud or colour.
   And all good purposes are fused into a true and pure oneness, and a
   real but silent mystery, such as human powers can scarce apprehend.
   [Children, could we but truly stand in this holy of holies for an hour
   or a moment, it were a thousand times better and more profitable for
   us, and more pleasing and praiseworthy in the sight of the Eternal God,
   than forty years spent in our own self-imposed tasks.]

   That we may thus give place to God, [for Him to do His work in us, and
   die to all to which we ought to die, that we may live truly and only to
   that to which we ought to live, if this exalted work of God is to be
   accomplished in us and through us,] may He help us. Amen!

Sermon for Ash Wednesday

   Gal. ii. 20--"I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not
   I, but Christ liveth in me."

   THE holy Apostle Paul, whose endeavours towards a perfect life were all
   founded upon endurance and true resignation, shows us in himself how a
   righteous, spiritual man, being nailed with Christ to the cross, and
   whose sufferings bring forth in him the living fruits of the Spirit,
   now no longer liveth through himself, but Christ liveth in him, as is
   taught in the words which he writes to the Galatians, saying: "I am
   crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
   liveth in me." Again he continues; "The life which I now live in the
   flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave
   Himself for me." In these words we have a wholesome admonition to
   strive after such a life as that Christ may be glorified in us, and His
   bitter grief and cross may be manifested in our mortal body, to the
   bettering of our neighbour and ourselves. Wherefore we ought to observe
   here, that though there be many kinds of cross and suffering, of which
   each has its own length, and depth, and breadth, and height, yet there
   is only one on which our eternal redemption was accomplished; that is,
   the cross of Christ's humanity, which again points us to a still higher
   cross (yet, so to speak, without cross and pain), of His divine nature.
   So likewise there were two crosses which stood beside the cross of
   Christ; the one bearing the malefactor on His right hand, and the other
   on His left. From all which we purpose to gather some spiritual emblems
   that may help us to discern what sort of cross and grief it is that we
   are bearing, and to which of these three crosses it may be compared.
   This we may tell by the following tokens.

   By the cross of the malefactor on Christ's left hand may be understood
   those who have made a religious profession, and are hanging on the
   cross of continual exercises and outward austerities which they have
   bound themselves to practise; they have well-deserved this cross, but
   it brings them no profit, because they have not died on it to self-will
   and other sinful failings. It is possible for them after this
   crucifixion to go down to eternal torment with the unjust malefactor;
   so that, to use a common proverb, they drag the barrow here and the
   waggon in the world to come. The height of this cross is the spiritual
   pride and self-complacency which they have in the strictness of their
   life, on account of which they set themselves up above others; for none
   can be good enough for them, and they lay great stress on such
   austerities, despising all who do not lead such a life as themselves.

   St. Augustine said to his brethren: "Dear brethren, rather than you
   should say or think yourselves to be different from or better than
   other men, I would that you should return to the world. You ought to
   say, as Christ did by the mouth of his Prophet David: I am a worm, and
   no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people;' and with the
   publican: God be merciful to me a sinner.'"

   The depth of this cross is a type of the depth of sin into which such
   men fall; and that comes hence, that their inward principle is false
   through and through, and they have never taken pains to look within and
   examine their evil unchanged hearts, and amend them; they lean
   altogether on outward exercises, which at the same time they hate, and
   perform with backward hearts. They know nothing of a union with God, or
   of His mysteries; nay, they no more reach after anything of this kind
   by questioning, or inquiring, or seeking, than they think of the Sultan
   over the sea, and take no more thought about it than if it in no wise
   concerned them. If they hear talk of divine things, they understand as
   much of them as a German does of Italian. They say their prayers and
   read their Bibles, and perform their dry works of obedience with the
   outward man and their senses; and with this they are well satisfied.
   Let God unite Himself with whom He will, what does that concern them?
   But if it were a question of outward advantage in respect of gain, or
   honour, or other things that might be turned to account, which any one
   had obtained thereby, then we should see whether it concerned them or
   not. Hence, in spite of their pious acts, it comes to this, that when
   they are called on to renounce their own way and will, they behave as
   if they were deaf or senseless. Thus St. Augustine writes: "I do not
   know wickeder, more utterly corrupt men than those who fall away while
   maintaining a religious profession; for not seldom they fall so deeply
   into sin, that they come to err from the faith and the things touching
   the Holy Scriptures, and thus sink under the cross to which they are
   bound and fastened."

   The width or breadth of this cross is that they go the wide, broad,
   well-trodden way that leadeth unto hell; for they live after the flesh,
   and therefore they do not seek after the sweetness of the spirit; for
   he who liveth to the flesh cannot please God. He who will not seek the
   narrow path that leadeth unto eternal life, must needs often be delayed
   and lose the way, by which means he is made too late to find the way
   that leadeth unto life. This is the case with those who seek and intend
   themselves in all things, and are always wanting to get some ease and
   to gain some indulgence from the Lord, now for this, now for that
   forbidden thing; in a word, to have nothing to bear is what would suit
   them best. For this very reason they are obliged to bear a heavy cross
   in their conscience whether they like it or no, and have no confidence
   towards God whom they have set at nought, nor yet any consolation from
   the world which despises them. Ah! dear children, what a hard life and
   cross is theirs! They would fain be without pain, and have the very
   bitterest pain; which will, moreover, be followed by eternal pain,
   unless they repent and turn to God.

   The length of this cross is, that they remain and persevere impenitent
   and without virtue unto the end; and this comes from their great
   ingratitude, inasmuch as God has bestowed on them such great grace
   before other worldly people who would have made better use of it, and
   has visited them in so many good influences and admonitions, inward and
   outward, as often even to raise their own wonder; and for all that they
   do not turn from evil. Of these says Paul: "For it is impossible for
   those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift,
   and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good
   word of God and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall
   away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to
   themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to an open shame." And He
   gives us a likeness for them: "For the earth which drinketh in the rain
   that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom
   it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: but that which beareth
   thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing: whose end is
   to be burned." As much as to say, Of these men who have received great
   grace from God, and to whom He has showed special tokens of His secret
   favour, when they are notwithstanding obstinately perverse and
   unfruitful, it is to be feared, if they persevere in such a course,
   that they will fall under the eternal curse of God. Therefore beware
   that you be not hanged on this cross of condemnation, and meet your
   last end thus.

   The second kind of cross is good, and is that of the malefactor on
   Christ's right hand, who had indeed well deserved his punishment, but
   it became unto him fruitful and profitable. This cross we may take as a
   type of the hardship and sufferings needful to be borne by those who
   have turned with their whole heart from this world and sin to a life of
   repentance; who have indeed well deserved to suffer much for their
   sins, because they have wasted their time so unprofitably in fleshly
   and natural pleasures, doing their own will; but now they wish to
   forsake all these things for God's sake, and on the contrary to suffer
   whatever God shall appoint for them. To these the cross is not only
   profitable and fruitful, but also consoling, sweet, and lovely. For to
   them it brings, as it did to this malefactor, a strong faith with a
   firm hope in the unspeakable love and mercy of God. Ah! children, what
   greater good could befall this criminal hanging on the cross, in this
   short space of time, than to hear those comfortable words: "Verily I
   say unto thee, this day shalt thou be with me in Paradise." And what
   can better comfort these rightly disposed converts of whom we are
   speaking, than for Christ to exclaim unto them: "Come unto me all ye
   that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." That is, I
   will receive you into my favour, and help you to bear your burdens, and
   after a short season of travail most sweetly quicken and refresh you.

   The depth of this cross is boundless humility, not deeming ourselves
   higher than other men, but having our eyes always open to our own
   shortcomings; like this malefactor, who acknowledged that he was
   suffering the just reward of his misdeeds. So let it be with all these
   converts; in all their sorrows let them remember that they might justly
   have suffered more, and that no suffering on earth or in hell would be
   a sufficient retribution for their sins. This makes them not to
   despise, nor judge, nor condemn any but themselves; and when they are
   brought to this point, then their cross begins to blossom and bear
   fruit.

   The height of this cross is a mind directed upwards to the
   contemplation of divine and heavenly things, and a forsaking of outward
   things; that is, they shall learn to look upward toward eternal things,
   without letting their eyes wander after earthly things, and fix their
   looks on the admirable life and walk of our dear Lord, his sufferings,
   his bitter death, his resurrection, ascension, and everlasting reign.
   This makes a man's suffering and cross light unto him, as it did to
   this malefactor when he said: "Lord, remember me when thou comest into
   thy kingdom." Behold, dear children, how his mind and thoughts were
   filled with the eternal world.

   The breadth of this cross signifies a hearty, all-embracing love to
   God, men, and all creatures; for those who are on this cross pray with
   lip and heart, not alone for themselves, but also for all men, even for
   their enemies: thus their prayer extends unto all, and they are ever
   ready to devote themselves, body and soul to their fellow-creatures;
   and thus they do what in them lies to make amends to God, whom they
   have aforetime dishonoured and provoked in his creatures. Thus love, as
   St. Peter saith, covereth a multitude of sins; and, as Christ said of
   Mary Magdalene: many sins are forgiven her, for she loved much.

   The length of this cross is perseverance and growth in good works; for
   these men never cease from their kind and virtuous labours, but
   undertake one after another with just discrimination, and give all
   diligence to put off their old man, and to put on a new man created
   after God in righteousness and holiness of life. And hence their inward
   man is renewed day by day, and groweth up amidst all their sorrow,
   pain, and temptation, so that they may well feel how truly Paul has
   said, that "this light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
   for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look
   not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen;
   for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are
   not seen are eternal."

   The third cross is the cross of Christ, and is a type of the perfect
   men, on whom their Heavenly Father has bestowed peculiar glory and
   honour, and fellowship with His only begotten Son, in that He sends
   them, after a special sort, all manner of contradiction, pain,
   assaults, tribulation, and crosses of every kind; and gives them to
   drink of the cup of which Christ, His only begotten Son, has drunk. As
   it was with the holy Apostles James and John, to whom Christ said: "Are
   ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink off? and to be baptized
   with the baptism that I am baptized with?" As much as to say, If ye
   desire to be the chiefest, dearest friends of God, ye must, like me,
   suffer the greatest contradiction beforehand; for the disciple is not
   above his master. If Christ must needs suffer and enter by the cross
   into the kingdom of His Father, without doubt so must every friend of
   God have somewhat likewise to endure.

   The depth of this cross is that they have at all times a childlike
   fear, and allow God to move them as He will, and keep a constant care
   not to offend God. Its height is the well-grounded hope which they have
   of eternal blessedness, not founded on their own merit or good life,
   but on a firm faith, in a humble principle of entire self-surrender to
   the perfectly holy will of God. And this hope maketh not ashamed; but,
   as St. Paul says, "the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by
   the Holy Ghost which is given unto them." The width or breadth of this
   cross is that they love God with their whole hearts, and themselves and
   all men through God; and endeavour with all their might "to keep the
   unity of the spirit in the bond of peace." They shun all giving of
   offence and scandal, and are useful to all and hurtful to none. And
   therefore they suffer gladly all that befalls them in their work of
   love, that they may bring many souls unto God. The length of their
   cross stretches out into eternity: for they are ready to suffer gladly
   all that God shall appoint unto them in time or in eternity; it is
   their highest happiness to forward all that God chooses to do through
   them; however and whenever He will, they simply follow His leading,
   without murmuring or questioning. They are those who are able to say in
   sincerity with Christ: "Not my will, but thine be done." Nothing
   grieves them more than that they cannot utterly give up their own will,
   by reason of human infirmity and weakness. O, how blessed are these
   men, and how fruitful is their cross, not only to themselves, but also
   to all Christendom!

   This cross leads and brings them to the ineffable cross of the divine
   nature, of which Paul was thinking when he prayed for his friends that
   they might "be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth
   and length, and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ which
   passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God."
   The length is His never-ending eternity; the breadth His boundless
   goodness and mercy, which has been shed abroad, and is yet poured out
   over the whole creation and mankind; the height is His omnipotence, and
   the depth of His unfathomable wisdom. Now he who will reach up unto the
   cross of Christ's divine nature, must first be fashioned into the
   likeness of His crucifixion in the flesh. And all those who truly lead
   a life in the spirit, such as we have described, are thus crucified
   with Christ; for they shall keep themselves from all the works of the
   flesh, which God hates, and shall have an earnest love to all
   righteousness, so that they are united with the bonds of their soul
   unto His divine nature. They shall, moreover, be ever striving to
   fulfil God's will, continually fixing their thoughts on Him, and
   keeping themselves from all that would be displeasing in His sight, and
   thus be nailed with the right foot to the cross of the divine nature;
   and they shall further learn to hold themselves between these two, that
   they be neither carried away by unblessed happiness, nor yet shrink
   from blessed unhappiness, nor be led astray between these two; and thus
   are they bound with the left foot to the cross of the divine nature.
   Furthermore, they shall have an inward sympathy with God, for the
   dishonour that has been done Him from the beginning of the world, and
   will yet be done Him by men in the Church and in the world until the
   last day, and for the shame and dishonour of His dearest friends, who
   have yielded themselves to suffer on this cross with Christ, that His
   divine glory may be magnified through them; for God will guard them as
   the apple of His eye, insomuch that whoso entreateth them evil hath
   done it unto God.

   That we may thus be nailed with Christ to the cross of his
   humanity,--that we may be admitted to the eternal beholding of the
   brightness of His godhead, may the Almighty Trinity grant and help us.
   Amen!

Sermon for the Second Sunday in Lent

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   Tells us how God drives forward some of His children by the struggle
   between the inward and outward man.

   Matt. xv. 21-28.--"Jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of
   Tyre and Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same
   coasts, and cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son
   of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But He answered
   her not a word. And His disciples came and besought Him, saying, Send
   her away, for she crieth after us. But He answered and said, I am not
   sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then came she and
   worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me. But He answered and said, It is
   not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs. And she
   said, Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their
   master's table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great
   is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was
   made whole from that very hour."

   THE gospel for this day points us to a guiding principle which is of
   all others the noblest, surest, most useful and most essential
   principle that we can have while here on earth. For be assured, that
   unless your conversion have within it this kernel, all your efforts to
   perform good works and to abstain from transgression will avail you
   little or nothing.

   Now let us in the first place consider these words: "Jesus went out
   from thence." Whence was it that He departed? From the Scribes and
   Pharisees. Now give heed to the principle herein contained: the Scribes
   were the wise men who prided themselves upon their knowledge; and the
   Pharisees were those who prided themselves upon their spirituality, and
   trusted in their religious practices and set talks. These two classes
   of men are types of two of the most dangerous principles which can
   exist among religious people; and those who remain in their way of
   thinking are lost, for these two principles do ruin the soul like a
   worm at the root, so that men come to nothing. And yet there are few
   but what are in some measure under the influence of one or both of
   them, though some much more than others. By the Scribes we may
   understand men of a reasoning turn of mind, who try all things by the
   light of their reason, or as they appear to them through their senses.
   They receive ideas by means of their senses, and then exercise upon
   them their powers of reflection that they may attain to the
   comprehension of high questions. And they glory therein, and make very
   lofty discourses; but in the inward parts, where pure truth should gush
   forth from its fount, they are empty and dry, yielding nothing.

   The second class are the Pharisees. These are the religious people who
   look upon themselves as the excellent of the earth, and think highly of
   themselves, and take their stand upon prescribed customs and ways, and
   regard these usages as of more importance than anything else, and
   desire to be respected on this account and to have praise of men; but
   their hearts are full of judging thoughts of other men who do not
   observe or approve of their ways. From these our Lord went out. The
   Scribes had asked him to pronounce a judgment, saying: Why do thy
   disciples transgress the good customs of our forefathers, by eating
   with unwashen hands? And He answered them: Why do ye transgress the
   commandments of God? Just so do those of the present day who regard
   their own ordinances and practices of devotion as the commandments and
   will of God, and condemn and think slightingly of the friends of God
   who refuse to follow usages of man's prescribing, because they are
   constrained to follow God's secret motions in their hearts. In thus
   saying, we do not mean that open evil-livers or despisers of godliness
   are not to be judged by the congregation, for else there would be an
   end of all ecclesiastical discipline; but let each beware of this
   pharisaical temper in himself, looking to see if any false piety lurk
   within him that has some other origin or end than God. For Jesus
   departs when that is so, and assuredly will not stay where that exists.

   Thus we find many people who never look to anything beyond their
   outward conduct; they perform good works and behave with decorum, and
   then think they have done all; while their inward part is altogether
   overgrown and choked up with the creature, by which they are held fast
   to their great hurt. And while in this state, they pray much and read
   their Bible. So likewise did the blind Jews, they read much in the
   Scriptures; and yet God was an utter stranger to them, and hidden from
   them in spirit and in truth. So it is with this sort of religious
   people: they submit to Church discipline, they pray, they fast, they
   watch; and for all this, God is not really and truly the principle of
   their life, but poor, miserable nature, toward which all their love,
   and striving, and aspiration is directed, notwithstanding the abundance
   and the fervour of their religious exercises. No, children, the eternal
   God will have nothing to do with these Pharisees; for they are not
   plants which our Heavenly Father has planted, but weeds which must be
   plucked up by the roots, as our Lord Himself has said: "He who is not
   with me is against me;" and, "He who gathereth not with me,
   scattereth." When the time of harvest is come, and the eternal God will
   gather His wheat into the garner, these will be found to be the called
   who have not gathered with Him, and He will not know them; and where He
   does not find His planting in the ground of the heart, He will cast the
   men out into outer darkness. I have shown you two false principles; I
   beseech you, for God's sake, beware of them, if you would be kept unto
   eternal life. For this zealous activity of the natural man, after the
   fashion of the Scribes or Pharisees, in outward show or prescribed
   usages, prevails greatly, alas! at this day among all ranks. Men's
   minds are now-a-days so subtle and quick, after the fashion of these
   Scribes [raising doubts and questions of conscience], that a
   conscientious confessor scarcely knows how to direct their souls by
   reason of their subtlety or their scrupulousness. From such men Jesus
   departed, as He does still to this day.

   But whither did the Lord Jesus go? He went into the land of Tyre and
   Sidon. Now Tyre signifies a state of apprehension, and Sidon signifies
   the state of one driven by the hunters. Ah, children! few, alas! are
   willing to experience in themselves what it is to go thither; and yet
   it is a wondrously ennobling and profitable thing that these two trials
   should be laid upon a man together; and if under them he can act
   rightly and well, what nobleness, growth in grace, and good fruit will
   be born of this sharp tribulation! Now what is this being hard pressed
   by the hunters? Nothing else but that the inward man would always fain
   be with God (who is his proper resting-place); and thus it ever drives
   the outward man towards and after God; but the outward man strives in
   the contrary direction, always going outwards after lower things, where
   indeed is his proper place; and thus there is a division in the man.
   The inward man's own place is God, and towards this centre all his
   desire, and free will, and endeavours are turned, and he is continually
   called and drawn this way by God his Lord. But this is contrary to the
   outward man, by his very nature, which wars against it every day and
   hour. As St. Paul says: "For I delight in the law of God after the
   inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring against the
   law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which
   is in my members." Wherefore, "the good that I would, I do not; but the
   evil which I would not, that I do." Thus the flesh and the spirit
   strive and fight against each other; and then cometh God from above,
   and pursues after them both with His grace. And where this is rightly
   and duly understood, it stands well with the man; for all who are thus
   led by God's spirit, are the children of God.

   Now this conflict causes to the man sharp and bitter pain and
   tribulation. But while he is plunged in the thick of the strife,
   perceiving nothing beyond it, and destitute of consolation, then comes
   Jesus and enters in of a surety. And to the man who does not obey the
   strivings of God's spirit, nor experience this inward conflict, Jesus
   does not enter in. For all those who have never felt this inward
   strife, nor God's hand heavy on their soul, and truly yielded to it in
   their life, these will never bring any good to pass so long as they
   live. Moreover, they never come to themselves, and therefore know
   nothing of all that is lying hidden within them. For many assaults come
   upon us, both carnal and spiritual, which we can best withstand by
   meeting them with a spirit of humility and gratitude; and if we await
   these trials with a cheerful spirit, we may be assured that God will
   stand by us with His grace. And then, when the world comes with its
   raging storms, beating upon his head, and the Devil with his crafty
   wiles, and the man's own flesh and senses and lowest powers are beset
   with great weakness and passionate impulses towards outward things, and
   all this while the inward man is urged on by God, and by the thirst
   which he by nature has after God,--then, indeed, there must needs be
   within him a bitter agony and tearing strife. And what shall the poor,
   wretched, comfortless man do, hunted and assailed as he is, without way
   or means of escape? He shall do as this poor woman did; go to Jesus and
   cry with a loud voice of strong desire; "O, Lord, thou son of David,
   have mercy on me!" And then from the depths of the struggle an
   impetuous cry leaps forth; and this cry of the spirit flies over
   thousands and thousands of miles with its piercing call: it is an
   infinite sighing from the fathomless abyss. This is something far above
   nature, whereunto the Holy Spirit must supply what is lacking because
   of our infirmities: as St. Paul says: "The Spirit maketh intercession
   for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." And by these means the
   Holy Spirit doth better prepare the ground of the heart than by any
   other preparation on earth that can be imagined.

   And when a man is thus hunted and plunged into the bottomless pit of
   temptation and suffering, and then, amidst "groanings which cannot be
   uttered," cries to God with a loud voice, so that the accents of his
   strong desire pierce through the heavens; and yet God makes as though
   He did not hear, or would not listen, O, how utterly must the man yield
   up his own self, and suffer his wishes to melt into the depths of God's
   will, waiting with ever-strengthening patience upon God, till His
   appointed time come to visit him and all creatures! For, oh! how
   impossible were it that the fount of all mercy should be sealed up!
   yet, when this woman came crying after Jesus with a loud voice, the
   stream from this fount of mercy was not suffered to flow out unto her.
   The disciples prayed that it might be opened; and at last, with severe
   aspect and harsh words, Jesus answered them that He was not sent save
   to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, saying: "It is not meet to
   take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs." He not only
   refused her the blessing she sought, but did what was much harder to
   bear,--proved in clear, cutting language that it was reasonable and
   just that He should do so. He not only refused to give her bread, which
   is necessary to life, and a common blessing, but denied her the name of
   a child, thus depriving her of humanity, and called her a dog. Could
   our Lord have tried her by a harder, sharper test,--could He have
   pressed her harder, or overwhelmed her more completely? But what does
   she do in this her distress and anguish? She takes it all meekly and
   patiently, and suffers herself to be driven and buffeted as He will.
   Nay, she sinks much lower than He had plunged her, and casts herself
   into the very depths of humiliation, saying: "No, Lord, not a dog, but
   even less, one of the least of the little whelps." But in her
   self-abasement and self-annihilation she holds fast her confidence, and
   says: "Yet, O Lord, the little whelps are wont to be fed and satisfied
   with the crumbs that fall from their master's table."

   Oh, how blessed and holy were men who could thus strike into the very
   truth of things, and see themselves with the mind of God, not through
   figures of speech, or customary phrases, or as the world judges.
   Neither God nor all His creatures could then abase and annihilate them
   so thoroughly as they would abase, and accuse, and annihilate
   themselves in the sight of the truth! Blessed indeed, if then,
   notwithstanding this wretched tumult of suffering and humiliation, they
   should be constant in their hope and confidence in the goodness of God,
   and abide therein without wavering; so that under all these afflictions
   their desire and earnest purpose towards Him should strengthen more and
   more, as it was with this woman. However harshly our Lord spoke to her,
   and denied her His acts of mercy, yet she never let go her trust in His
   grace. Therefore everything was granted to her that she had sought and
   desired of the Lord. Dear children, this is the right, true, godly way
   unto eternal truth. Oh! this way leads unto the truth; this alone leads
   straight to God without a means. And some have not strength to try the
   depth of this fathomless annihilation of self. This was the way the
   woman of Canaan took, and she received at last the blessed answer: "O,
   woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee according to thy will!"

   Children, I tell you of God's truth, that to every man who shall be
   found really and truly thus walking in this way, God will assuredly one
   day declare: "My beloved friend, whatsoever thou choosest or desirest,
   it shall be done unto thee according to thy will; forasmuch as thou
   hast willingly given up all that was thine. Therefore, thy will is
   swallowed up in mine, and thou hast become one with me by grace, and a
   partaker of my nature." Now this becoming one with the eternal Goodness
   cannot come to pass but by an absolute renunciation of our Self, and
   all that is ours, natural or spiritual; for in the same measure that a
   man comes out from himself, in that measure does God enter in with His
   divine grace, and he who loseth his life shall find it.

   Children, I will say no more now, but tell you a little story that is
   very apt to our purpose. I knew a "woman of Canaan," well deserving of
   the name. What I am about to tell you, happened within these four
   years, and she is yet living. This woman lost her senses, and fell into
   a trance, and was borne up on high, till she came into the presence of
   God, and beheld our Lady and all the saints. And as she looked upon
   this vision she saw herself to be at an immeasurable distance from God.
   Then her spirit was seized with such unutterable woe that it seemed as
   if she must perish that moment with the bitter, smarting, hellish pain
   that it gave her to see herself so far off from God. (For know ye that
   this is the worst torment which the souls in hell have to endure, that
   they know themselves to be afar off, and utterly parted from God and
   all His elect, and know that it will last for ever, and that they shall
   never see God.) Now in this unspeakable distress she turned to our Lady
   and all the saints, and besought them all that they would intercede for
   her. But then she saw that the blessed saints were so utterly lost in
   the contemplation of God that none of them for a moment listened to her
   cries and appeals. In their overwhelming bliss and joy they never even
   heard her voice. Then she turned after a human fashion to the sacred
   sorrow and bitter death of our Lord Jesus Christ, and it was answered
   her, why should she appeal to that to which she had never shown due
   honour and reverence? But when she saw that neither our Lady, nor the
   saints, nor the sufferings of our Lord brought her help, she turned
   herself with all earnestness to God, and said: "Ah, Lord! since none
   will come to my help, behold, O beloved Lord, that I am Thy poor
   creature, and Thou art my God; I fall down before Thy righteous
   sentence, according to Thy most blessed will; and whether Thou wilt
   have me to remain for ever in this horrible, hellish torment, I leave,
   dear Lord, altogether to Thy most blessed will." But when she had thus
   utterly surrendered herself to God for all eternity, that moment she
   was lifted up far away beyond all intervening things, and wafted into
   the abyss of God's love. O what a glorious abyss is that! This same
   person is still often brought either into this state of mind, or
   carried into the abyss of the divine love. She is a young maiden, and I
   firmly believe that she had never in her life committed any gross sins,
   wherewith she had provoked God; and yet she needed thus to suffer.
   Children! how great and manifold, then, must be the pangs of those who
   have often and deeply angered God, and withal are still cleaving while
   on earth so closely to the miserable creature delights? But this maiden
   resigned herself humbly to the will of God, content to bear an eternity
   of pain in hell, if God in His righteousness saw fit to condemn her
   thereunto.

   How unlike this woman are those who fancy that in four or five years
   they shall work wonders, and say to others: "Ah, my dear friend, pray
   the Lord for me that I may become one of his dearest friends." Now know
   that, if thou wert in the right way, thou wouldst never think thyself
   worthy to become one of the least of the friends of God; therefore set
   thyself humbly in the lowest place, as the Gospel teaches, and then
   thou wilt be bidden to come up higher. But those who lift themselves
   up, God will assuredly cast down. Wherefore beseech Him that His good
   pleasure may be wrought in and with thee, according to His ever-blessed
   will, and so wilt thou find thy dwelling-place and rest in Him, and not
   else. Children, on this wise God entereth into the soul immediately,
   without a veil; that is, when a man wholly renounces Self--all that he
   has. Now, if any man while here on earth should obtain one drop of this
   blessing, and one spark of this love should be kindled in his soul, he
   would be more truly and really made fit for God's dwelling, and led
   farther into the truth, than if he were to strip all the clothes off
   his body and give them to the poor, or to macerate his flesh with
   penances. One moment in this state were more worth living than forty
   years spent in doing and leaving undone what we pleased. Moreover this
   would be the noblest and shortest, and also the easiest, of all courses
   that reason can conceive. O God! with what things are men taken up,
   while they waste this precious, blessed season of grace, and come short
   of that pure, exalted good which might and ought unceasingly to be
   wrought in them; and so the long years roll slowly by, and they are as
   one in a sleep, never coming any farther, unstirred by God's grace; and
   after the many years that they have lived, they are as far from true
   perfectness as the first day that they set out. This is indeed a
   terrible and awful thought for all religious persons; for if they knew
   the great and perilous injury that they do to their souls with their
   own devices, their very marrow and blood would dry up within their
   body. Now let us pray God that we may thus sink into the divine abyss,
   and fall down before God's sentence, that we may be also found in Him
   like this woman of Canaan! Amen!

Sermon for the Fourth Sunday in Lent

   Of the power of the Word of God, of fiery desires, and the essence of
   self-renunciation.

   John viii. 47.--"He who is of God heareth the words of God."

   DEAR children, ye ought not to cease from hearing or declaring the word
   of God because you do not alway live according to it, nor keep it in
   mind. For inasmuch as you love it and crave after it, it will assuredly
   be given unto you; and you shall enjoy it for ever with God, according
   to the measure of your desire after it. There are some people who, when
   they hear speak of high things which they do not understand, and
   moreover see that they have no share in them, turn away from these
   things with such aversion, that they do not even like to hear them
   treated of, or that others should think about them and seek after them.
   Yea, they hear of high things, and say: "That is not my way of
   thinking; I had better not try to put it into practice, for I should
   not keep it, and then I should be just where I was before." And thus
   they turn away themselves and others from the truth, just as if it in
   no wise concerned them, and sit down quite contented with their own
   ways, while yet they know in the bottom of their hearts that their ways
   are not the best that might be. This is an infallible token that these
   persons will never reach the highest point of which they are capable;
   nor will they become partakers of the highest, pure, absolute goodness,
   unless indeed they come to go through a painful and agonizing struggle
   after it.

   St. Bernard has said: "Man, if thou desirest a noble and holy life, and
   unceasingly prayest to God for it, if thou continue constant in this
   thy desire, it will be granted unto thee without fail, even if only in
   the day or hour of thy death; and if God should not give it thee then,
   thou shalt find it in Him in eternity: of this be assured." Therefore
   do not relinquish your desire, though it be not fulfilled immediately,
   or though ye may swerve from your aspirations, or even forget them for
   a time. It were a hard case if this were to cut you off for ever from
   the end of your being. But when ye hear the word of God, surrender
   yourselves wholly to it, as if for eternity, with a full purpose of
   will to retain it in your mind and to order your life according to it;
   and let it sink down right deep into your heart as into an eternity. If
   afterward it should come to pass that you let it slip, and never think
   of it again, yet the love and aspiration which once really existed live
   for ever before God, and in Him ye shall find the fruit thereof; that
   is, to all eternity it shall be better for you than if you had never
   felt them.

   What we can do is a small thing; but we can will and aspire to great
   things. Thus, if a man cannot be great, he can yet be good in will; and
   what he, with his whole heart and mind, love and desire, wills to be,
   that without doubt he most truly is. It is little we can bring to pass;
   but our will and desire may be large. Nay, they may grow till they lose
   themselves in the infinite abyss of God. Not that we ought to think
   within ourselves that we wish to be this or that, like such a saint or
   angel, for we ought to be much more than we can conceive or fathom:
   wherefore our part is to give ourselves over to God, and leave
   ourselves utterly in His hands, being wholly His. And if ye cannot be
   as entirely His as ye fain would be, be His as much as ye may attain
   unto; but whatever ye are, be that truly and entirely; and what ye
   cannot be, that be contented not to be, in a sincere spirit of
   resignation, for God's sake and in Him. So shall you peradventure
   possess more of God in lacking than in having. Therefore be God's;
   yield to His hand, suffer Him to do in thee, and to thee, and with
   thee, what He will; and then nothing here or hereafter shall be able to
   confound you.

   Think not that God will be always caressing His children, or shine upon
   their head, or kindle their hearts, as He does at the first. He does so
   only to lure us to Himself, as the falconer lures the falcon with its
   gay hood. Our Lord works with His children so as to teach them
   afterwards to work themselves; as He bade Moses to make the tables of
   stone after the pattern of the first which He had made Himself. Thus,
   after a time, God allows a man to depend upon himself, and no longer
   enlightens, and stimulates, and rouses him. We must stir up and rouse
   ourselves, and be content to leave off learning, and no more enjoy
   feeling and fire, and must now serve the Lord with strenuous industry
   and at our own cost. Our Lord acts like a prudent father, who, while
   his children are young, lets them live at his cost, and manages
   everything for them. What is needful for them, he provides, and lets
   them go and play; and so long as this lasts they are at leisure, free
   from care, happy, and generous at their father's expense. Afterwards he
   gives a portion of his estate into their own hands, because he will
   have them to take care of themselves, and earn their own living, to
   leave off childish play, and thus learn how to grow rich. So it is with
   us. In the beginning of a holy life, there is nothing but brightness,
   enjoyment, and feeling, and God draws us after Him with His gifts, that
   we may praise Him in the influencing of our wills, and we do all with a
   good will, and we know and recognize therein God's will. But now it is
   very different; now God will have us to give up ourselves and our own
   will, and to accept Him with readiness in His acts of severity, and in
   all kinds of suffering, and in darkness of mind, whatever He may do,
   and however contrary it may be to all our natural wishes. As the Lord
   said to Peter: "When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and
   walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt
   stretch forth thy hand, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee
   whither thou wouldest not." Thus did the Lord in our early days go
   beside us, drawing us onward by His benefits; then we went whither we
   would, for our will was sweetly girded with the pleasantness of divine
   things. But now it must be otherwise: another shall gird us, and lead
   us whither we would not.

   The Lord will draw us and securely lead us to Himself, in a way
   contrary to all our natural will, until He have divested us thereof,
   and consumed it and made it thoroughly subject unto the Divine will.
   For this is His will: that we should cease to regard our own wishes or
   dislikes; that it should become a light matter to us whether He give or
   take away, whether we have abundance or suffer want, and let all things
   go, if only we may receive and apprehend God Himself; that whether
   things please or displease us, we may leave all things to take their
   course and cleave to Him alone. Then first do we attain to the fulness
   of God's love as His children, when it is no longer happiness or
   misery, prosperity or adversity, that draws us to Him, or keeps us back
   from Him. What we should then experience none can utter; but it would
   be something far better than when we were burning with the first flame
   of love, and had great emotion but less true submission: for here,
   though there may be less show of zeal, and less vehemence of feeling,
   there is more true faithfulness to God. That we may attain thereunto,
   may God help us with His grace. Amen!

Sermon for Palm Sunday

   How a man ought in all His works to regard God alone, and purely to
   make Him his end without anything of his own, and shall freely and
   simply perform all these works for the glory of God only, and not seek
   his own, nor desire nor expect any reward. Wherewith he may do such
   works without any self-appropriation or reference to time and number,
   before or after, and without modes. How the Divine Word speaks and
   reveals itself in the soul, all in a lofty and subtile sense.

   Matt. xxi. 10-17.--"And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city
   was moved, saying, Who is this? And the multitude said, This is Jesus,
   the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. And Jesus went into the temple of
   God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and
   overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that
   sold doves: And said unto them, It is written: My house shall be called
   the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. And the
   blind and the lame came to Him in the temple; and He healed them. And
   when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He
   did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the
   Son of David, they were sore displeased, and said unto Him, Hearest
   thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never
   read, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected
   praise? And He left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and He
   lodged there."

   WE read in the holy Gospel how that our Lord went into the Temple, and
   drove out those who were buying and selling therein, and said to those
   who sold doves: "Take these things hence." Herewith He signified nought
   else but that He would have the temple empty; just as if He had said:
   "I have a right to this temple, and will dwell there alone, and have
   the sole rule therein." Now what is this temple of which God is minded
   to have possession even by force, and to rule according to His own
   will? It is the soul of man, which He has created and fashioned so
   truly in His own likeness; as we read that God said: "Let us make man
   after our image." And He has done so too, and made the soul of man so
   like Himself, that there is nothing in heaven or on earth so like
   Himself as that is. For which reason God will have this temple to be
   empty, that nothing be there but He alone; and the cause why this
   temple pleases Him so well, is that it is so like Himself, and He
   loveth to be in it forasmuch as He is there alone.

   Now mark, who were the people who were buying and selling, and whom do
   they represent at this day? Now observe, I intend to speak only of the
   good people who thus bought and sold, and yet whom our Lord scourged
   and drove out, and do not mean to say anything to-day concerning open
   sinners, who knowingly live in the commission of deadly sins. And the
   Lord does the same now-a-days to all who buy and sell in His temple,
   for such He will not suffer to remain therein. Behold, dear children,
   all those are traders who keep themselves from open sins, and would
   fain be good people, and do their works to the glory of God, and
   perform many good works, such as fasting, watching, praying, and the
   like; yet do it all in order that our Lord may give them, or do for
   them, something that they wish, and thus they seek themselves in all
   things. All such are traders; that is, to speak in vulgar language,
   they wish to give one thing in exchange for another, and would fain
   thus drive a traffic with our Lord; and they are deceived in their
   bargain, for all that they possess or are able to perform they have
   received from God, and consequently God does not owe them anything in
   return, nor is He bound to do anything for them, except, indeed, He
   would do it of His free bounty. What they are, they are of God; and
   what they become, they have received of God and not from themselves;
   therefore God owes them nothing in return for their works and their
   gifts, unless He do it of His own pleasure, of His grace, and not for
   the sake of their works and gifts; for they have nothing of their own
   to give, they do not even do their good works of their own power; as
   Christ said: "Without me ye can do nothing!" Those who would thus
   bargain with our Lord are thick-headed and ignorant men, who have
   little or no insight into the truth, wherefore God scourges them and
   drives them out of the temple. Light and darkness cannot dwell
   together. God is the Truth and Light in Himself; when, therefore, He
   cometh into His temple, He drives out of it ignorance and darkness, and
   reveals Himself with light and truth. Then when the truth is perceived,
   the buyers and sellers are gone; and the truth will have nothing to do
   with trafficking. God does not seek His own; all His works are done
   voluntarily and in singleness of purpose; He does them for very love.
   So likewise is it with the man who is united with God: his works also
   are done voluntarily and in singleness of mind, and he does them for
   love without any wherefore--that is, without any regard to himself--to
   the glory of God only, and seeketh not his own in them; and God works
   them through him.

   I say further, so long as a man in any of his works is seeking or
   desiring anything that God has to give, or will give hereafter, he is
   like these traffickers. But if thou wouldst be quite pure from such a
   mercenary spirit, thou must do thy utmost in good works simply for the
   praise of God, and shalt stand apart from it all, as if thou hadst not
   done it; thou shalt ask nothing in return. If thou doest thy works in
   this spirit, then are they godly and spiritual. And then the buyers and
   sellers are altogether driven out of the temple, and God alone dwelleth
   there, when thou purposest nothing but what God purposeth.

   Now mark, there is yet a higher state than that of the traders, which
   is indicated to us in this Gospel; namely, that of the men who perform
   their works with a sincerely good intent, and yet are hindered from
   coming to the closest union with God, inasmuch as they still carry on
   some traffic and converse with the creatures, and are thus like the
   money-changers and those who sold doves, whose tables and seats the
   Lord overthrew. For although this their occupation was at first begun
   by certain of them with a good intent, it was an unseemly practice, and
   was afterwards turned to the greatest abuses of covetousness, rather
   than to the service of God. So likewise it is with the persons of whom
   I am speaking; for although their intent is good, and they do their
   good works sincerely for God's sake, and do not seek their own therein,
   yet nevertheless they do them with self-appropriation, with time and
   number, with images and reference to before and after. By these things
   they are hindered from coming to the best and highest truth; for they
   ought to keep themselves free and empty of all that is accidental, from
   pleasure and pain, even as our Lord is free and alone, and receiveth
   Himself ever afresh, without interval or time, from His Heavenly
   Father, and in the same Now is ever without ceasing begotten afresh in
   perfectness, with thankful praise, into the Majesty of the Father, in
   co-equal dignity. In like manner must the man who desireth to perceive
   the highest truth, and to live therein without before or after, and
   without let or hindrance from any of the outward acts or mental images
   with which he has ever been conversant, stand free and alone in this
   eternal Now. He shall simply receive the gift of God, and bring it
   forth again and render it up to God without let or hindrance, in His
   light, and with thankful praise through our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus he
   will have done with all the doves and money-changing; that is, with all
   the hindrance and qualification which arises from those works which are
   good in themselves, but in which a man seeks something of his own. For
   which cause also the Lord would not suffer any to carry vessels to and
   fro in the temple, as St. Mark tells us; all which has to do with the
   same principle--that a spiritual man must keep himself free and aloof
   from all objects that would hinder his advance towards perfectness.

   Now when the temple is thus cleared of all that blocks it up, i.e. of
   all selfishness and ignorance, it shines forth in such beauty, and is
   so bright and resplendent above all else that God has created, that
   nothing can outshine it save the uncreated God alone. Nothing even that
   belongs to angelic existence can be compared to this temple. The
   highest angels do indeed in many respects resemble the temple of a
   noble soul, yet not wholly, for there is some measure, a certain bound,
   set to their similarity to it in knowledge and love, beyond which they
   cannot pass; but the soul is ever able to advance so long as it is in
   time. For if the soul of a man yet living in this present state were on
   a level with the highest angel, the man could yet, by virtue of his
   free self-determination, outstrip the angel at every successive moment,
   without count, that is to say without mode, and above the mode of the
   angels, and all created reason. God is alone free and uncreated; and
   therefore He alone is equal to the soul as touching freedom, and
   unequal as touching uncreatedness, for the soul is created. But when
   the soul enters into the unmixed light, she, with her created I, sinks
   so deeply into her own nothingness, that she cannot by her own power
   regain the sense of her separate existence as a creature. But God
   upholds her with His uncreated power, and keeps the soul still herself.
   The soul has dared to become naught; and yet she cannot attain
   thereunto of her own power, so entirely is she lost until God upholds
   her with His power. It must needs be so, seeing that, as I said before,
   Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out those who bought and
   sold therein, and began to speak in the temple.

   Now, dear children, know of a truth, if any one else would fain speak
   in the temple, that is in the soul, except Jesus alone, He holds His
   peace, as if He were not there; and in truth He is not at home in the
   soul, for she has strange guests with whom she desireth to hold
   converse. But if Jesus is to speak in the soul, she must be alone, and
   must be silent herself that she may hear the voice of Jesus; and then
   He enters in and begins to speak. What does He speak? He speaks that He
   is. And what is He then? He is the Word of the Father; in which Word
   the Father utters Himself, and all the divine nature, and all that God
   is, so that, in that He perceiveth it, He also is it, and He is perfect
   in His perception and in His power. Hence He is perfect through this
   His speaking, for when He uttereth this Word, He uttereth Himself and
   all things in another person, and giveth that person the same nature
   which He Himself has, and speaks all rational spirits into being in
   that Word, in the likeness of the same Word, according to the type or
   pattern which abideth continually in Him. And thus the Word shines
   forth in man, according as each word exists in God. Yet is he not in
   all respects like this same essential Word; but rather the possibility
   is granted to him of receiving a certain likeness by the grace of this
   Word, and of receiving the Word as it is in itself. This all has the
   Father Himself spoken through the Word, and all that is in the Word.

   Here the question might be asked, If the Father hath spoken this, in
   what sense doth Jesus speak in the soul? Here remember, dear children,
   what I have said of the manner of His speaking, namely, that He
   revealeth Himself and all that the Father hath uttered in Him,
   according to the measure of the soul's ability to receive it.

   In the first place He reveals the Father's sovereignty to the soul, by
   declaring His changeless, infinite Power. And when through the Son the
   soul hath experience of this power, it becomes strong and mighty in
   whatever happens, so that it grows powerful and steadfast in all
   virtues and in perfect singleness of mind, so that neither weal nor
   woe, nor any or all of the things that God has created in time, have
   power to stir him, for that he has firm and abiding footing in the
   strength of God, against which all things are weak and unavailing.

   In the second place, the Lord reveals Himself in the soul with an
   infinite Wisdom, which He Himself is. In this Wisdom the Father
   perceiveth Himself, with all His Fatherly sovereignty. And that same
   Word which is also Wisdom, and all that it comprehends, is all the
   same, sole Unity. When this Wisdom is united with the soul, all doubt
   and error and darkness utterly vanish away, and she is transported into
   a pure light, which is God Himself. As the prophet says: "Lord in Thy
   light shall we see light." That is to say: "Lord in Thy light shall we
   perceive the light in the soul." Then is God perceived in the soul by
   means of God. Then does she, by means of this Wisdom, perceive herself
   and all things, and perceiveth this Wisdom itself, and through it she
   perceiveth the Father's majesty, and His essential self-existence in
   simple oneness, without distinction.

   In the third place, Christ reveals Himself also with an infinite Love,
   sweetness and richness flowing forth from the power of the Holy Ghost,
   overflowing and streaming in a very flood of richness and sweetness
   into the heart that is waiting to receive it; and with this sweetness
   He not only reveals Himself to the soul, but unites Himself with her.
   Through this sweetness, the soul in its essence by grace flows out with
   power above all creatures back into her first origin and fount. Then is
   the outward man obedient unto the inward man, even unto death, and
   liveth in constant peace in the service of God continually. That the
   Lord may thus come into our souls also, overthrowing and casting out
   all hindrances, bodily or spiritual, that we may become one here on
   earth, and hereafter in the kingdom of heaven, may He help us evermore.
   Amen.

Sermon for Thursday in Easter Week

   How we ought to love God, and how Christ is a Master of the Eternal
   Good, wherefore we ought to love Him above all things; a Master of the
   Highest Truth, wherefore we ought to contemplate Him; and a Master of
   the Highest Perfectness, wherefore we ought to follow after Him without
   let or hindrance.

   John xx. 16.--"She turned herself and said unto Him, Rabboni; which is
   to say, Master."

   WHEN our Lord had risen from the dead, Mary Magdalene desired with her
   whole heart to behold our blessed Lord; and he revealed Himself to her
   in the form of a gardener, and so she did not know Him. Then our Lord
   said unto her "Mary;" and with that word she knew Him, and said,
   Rabboni! that is to say, Master.

   Now mark, so long as Mary stood by the grave looking at the angels,
   Christ stood behind her, concealing Himself from her. For the Lord our
   God hideth Himself from those who are full of care about the creatures,
   and grieving over the loss of earthly things and creatures; but as soon
   as man turns from the creatures to find God, God reveals Himself unto
   the soul. Thus, when Mary turned to the grave of Christ, it was said
   unto her, "Mary," which name signifies a star of the sea, a queen of
   the world, and one who is illuminated by the Holy Spirit. He who
   desireth to see God, must be as a star in the firmament, severed from
   and spurning all the things of time, and illuminated to see all
   heavenly things.

   When she heard the word that Christ spoke, "Mary," she knew our Lord,
   and said, Rabboni, which is to say, Master; for she and His other
   disciples and followers commonly address Him with this title, as He
   says: "Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am." For
   He is truly a Master of the Highest Good, and therefore should we love
   Him above all things. He is a Master of Truth, and therefore should we
   contemplate Him. He is a Master of the Highest Perfectness, and
   therefore should we follow Him without any looking backwards behind us.

   He is (as I said first) a Master of the Highest Good, and therefore
   should we love Him above all things. Now, thou mightest say, "God is
   infinite, a supreme Good without limits, and the soul and all creatures
   are finite and bounded; how, then, can the soul love and know God?"
   Hearken: God is infinite and without end, but the soul's desire is an
   abyss which cannot be filled except by a Good which is infinite; and
   the more ardently the soul longeth after God, the more she wills to
   long after Him; for God is a Good without drawback, and a well of
   living water without bottom, and the soul is made in the image of God,
   and therefore it is created to know and love God. So, because Christ is
   a Master of the Highest Good, the soul ought to love Him above all
   things; for He is love, and from Him doth love flow into us, as out of
   a well of life. The well of life is love; and he who dwelleth not in
   love is dead, as St. John says in his Epistle. Now, forasmuch as Christ
   is a well-spring and Master of the Highest Good, therefore shall the
   soul love Him without resistance. For it is her property that she must
   love that which is God; and therefore must she love that which is the
   Highest Good, without measure, without rival, and without ceasing to
   utter forth His praise.

   Without measure shall the soul love God; concerning which St. Bernard
   says: "The cause wherefore the soul shall love God, is God; but the
   measure of this love is without measure, for God is an immeasurable
   Good, because His benefits are without number or end: wherefore the
   soul shall love God without measure." Hence St. Paul says: "I pray God
   that your love may increase and abound yet more and more." And St.
   Bernard says: "In our love to God we have no rule nor direction to
   observe, but that we love Him as He hath loved us. He hath loved us
   unto the end that we might love Him world without end. Therefore, our
   inward desire ought ever to increase so long as we are here on earth;
   but although the inward work of our love to God ought ever to increase,
   yet the outward works of love ought to be meted out with due wisdom,
   that we so exercise ourselves as not to injure nature, but to subdue it
   unto the spirit."

   In the second place, the soul shall love God without a fellow; that is
   to say, in that degree of love with which the soul loveth God, shall no
   creature stand; and all whom the soul loves, she shall love in God and
   to God. Furthermore, she shall love the creatures for God's sake, to
   God and in God. She loves them for God's sake, when she loves them for
   that cause which is God; she loves them to God, when she loveth them
   for that goodness which is God; she loves them in God, when she seeks
   no other delight nor end in them but God; and thus she loveth the
   creatures in God, and God in the creatures. Hence Christ tells us:
   "Thou shalt love God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with
   all thy mind," which words are thus expounded by St. Augustine: "Our
   Lord saith that we are to love God with all our heart, with all our
   soul, and with all our mind, to the intent that man should have no
   single faculty within his soul that is empty or barren of the love of
   God; that is, from which the love of God is absent; and that all which
   it comes into our heart to love, we may love for God's sake, and enjoy
   in godly love; for God loveth the soul, and therefore shall the soul
   love Him without a fellow."

   In the third place, the soul shall love God without silence; for he who
   is in love cannot be silent, but must proclaim and utter forth his
   love. St. Gregory speaks of two sorts of crying aloud: the one is that
   of the mouth, the other that of the works. He says of the voice of the
   deeds, that it is louder than that of the mouth. Of the latter, David
   says; "I have cried unto God with my voice, and He hath heard my
   prayer." Chrysostom says: "It is the habit and custom of loving souls
   that they cannot hide their love, nor forbear to speak of it, but they
   tell it to their familiar friends, and describe the inward flames of
   love; and the faults which they have committed against God they tell to
   those whom they love, and cannot keep silence about them, but often
   speak of them, that they may obtain relief and refreshment thereby."
   The second cry is that of the actions,--the way in which a man proves
   his inward love by his outward works. St. Gregory says the witness of
   love is the proof given by the works; for where love is, it works great
   things; but if it work not, it is a sure sign that it is not there.
   Thus Mary Magdalene had good reason to exclaim "Master!" for Christ is
   a Master of all Good. Therefore we ought to love Him above all things.
   And rightly is He called a Master of Love, for three causes; for He
   rewards nothing but love, He rewards only out of love, and He rewards
   with love.

   First, I say that He rewards nothing but love. By three things may a
   man win reward: by outward acts, by inward contemplation, and by inward
   aspiration and love. The outward act has no merit unless it be wrought
   in love; for the outward act perishes and is over, and cannot merit
   that which is eternal. For Paul says: "Charity never ceases;" wherefore
   a man can never win eternal life by any works except they be done in
   love; and hence he who truly loveth God separates himself from all that
   is not God; for he who loves the uncreated good, despises the created.

   In the second place, I said that God only rewards out of love. For from
   the love wherewith He loveth man, He giveth Himself, He giveth His very
   self as a reward, He giveth Himself wholly, and not in part; for God
   hath loved man with an eternal love, and He gives a man nothing less
   than Himself. He said to Abraham: "Fear not, I am thy shield, and thy
   exceeding great reward."

   In the third place, He rewards a man with love. For this reward
   consists in being able to behold God in His clearness without a veil,
   and to enjoy the fruition of His love, and keep it for all eternity.
   Wherefore it was not without reason that Mary exclaimed "Master!" And
   thou too, O man, cry unto Him devoutly from the bottom of thy heart; "O
   Master of the Highest Good, and my God, by the love which Thou art,
   draw me to Thyself, I long after Thy favour, and that I may love Thee
   above all things."

   Now when I began I mentioned two other points: first, how that Christ
   is a Master of the Highest Truth, and therefore we ought to contemplate
   Him. Here take note that thou canst contemplate God in His creatures,
   which He has made out of nothing, whereby thou art able to discover His
   omnipotence. But when thou seest and considerest how admirably the
   creatures are fashioned and put together, and in what wonderful order
   they are arranged, thou art able to perceive and trace the Wisdom of
   God, which is ascribed to the Son. And when further thou comest to
   perceive the gentleness of the creatures, and how all creatures have
   something loving in them, then thou perceivest the loving-kindness of
   the Holy Spirit. Thus St. Paul tells the Romans that men are able to
   behold the invisible goodness of God through the things that they can
   see; that is to say, the creatures which He has made. We are also able
   to perceive God by the light of grace, as the Prophet says: "Lord, in
   Thy light shall we see the light;" that is, God Himself; for "God is
   light, and in Him is no darkness anywhere." Moreover we shall at the
   last behold God in the light of His glory, and there shall we see Him
   without a veil, bright as He is; for He is a Master of Truth, who
   giveth us to know all truth. In the third place, Christ is a Master of
   Perfection; wherefore a man shall leave all things to follow Him, for
   in God he shall find all things united in one perfectness which are
   scattered abroad among the creatures. Therefore, O man, if thou wilt be
   perfect, be a follower of Christ. He says: "Whoso will not forsake
   father and mother, and sisters and brothers, and all that he hath,
   cannot be my disciple." For father and mother, sisters and brothers,
   and all creatures, are a man's enemies if they keep him back from God
   and hinder him from treading the straight path to eternal blessedness.
   Therefore forsake the creatures, and follow after the Master of
   Perfection, even Jesus Christ, blessed for ever. May He grant us by His
   grace to do so! Amen.

Sermon for the First Sunday after Easter

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   How we are to ascend by three stages to true peace and purity of heart.

   John xx. 19.--"Peace be to you."

   PEACE be with you," said our beloved Lord to His disciples after His
   resurrection. All men by nature desire rest and peace, and are ever
   striving after it in all their manifold actions, efforts, and labours;
   and yet to all eternity they will never attain to true peace, unless
   they seek it where alone it is to be found,--in God. What, then, are
   the means and ways to find true peace, and the purest, highest, and
   most perfect truth? Now mark, I will speak unto you in a parable. As
   our blessed Lord drew His disciple St. John to Himself in a three-fold
   manner, even so does He now draw all who ever arrive at the deepest
   truth.

   The first way in which our Lord drew St. John to Himself was when He
   called him out of the world and made him an Apostle. The second was
   when He suffered him to rest on His bosom; and the third and most
   perfect was on the holy day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost was given
   unto him, and a door was opened unto him through which he was taken up
   into heaven.

   Thus, like St. John, is each man first called out of the world, when
   all his lower powers come to be governed by his highest reason, so that
   he learns to know himself and to exercise his free self-guiding power;
   so that he sets a watch over his words, saying nothing to anyone which
   he would not wish to be said to himself;--over his impulses, marking
   whether they proceed from God and tend towards Him;--over his thoughts,
   that he do not voluntarily indulge in any evil or vain imaginations, or
   that, if such suggest themselves, they should be made only an incentive
   and stepping-stone to better things;--over his works, that in his
   undertakings he may have a single eye to the glory of God and the
   welfare of mankind. On this wise does the Lord call thee out of the
   world, and make thee an apostle of Christ to thy fellow-man, and so
   thou learnest to convert the outward into the inward man, which is the
   first step in the Christian course.

   Secondly; wilt thou with St. John rest on the loving heart of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, thou must be transformed into the beauteous image of our
   Lord by a constant, earnest contemplation thereof, considering His holy
   meekness and humility, the deep, fiery love that He bore to His friends
   and His foes, and His mighty, obedient resignation which He manifested
   in all the paths wherein His Father called Him to tread. Next call to
   mind the boundless charity which He showed to all men, and also His
   blessed poverty. Heaven and earth were His, and He called them not His
   own. In all His words and deeds, He looked only to the glory of His
   Father and the salvation of mankind. And now ye must gaze much more
   closely and deeply into the glorious image of our Lord Jesus Christ
   than I can show you with my outward teaching, and maintain a continual,
   earnest effort and aspiration after it. Then look attentively at
   thyself, how unlike thou art to this image, and behold thy own
   littleness. Here will thy Lord let thee rest on Him. There is no better
   and more profitable way to this end while in our present state, than to
   receive worthily the sacrament of the body of Christ, and to follow the
   counsel of one on whom the light of grace has shone more brightly than
   it has on thee. In the glorious likeness of Christ thou wilt be made
   rich, and find all the solace and sweetness in the world.

   But there are many who, haying advanced thus far, think in their haste
   that they have conquered for their own the ground on which they stand,
   while yet they are far from the goal. Although St. John had lain on
   Christ's bosom, yet he let his cloak fall and fled when the Jews laid
   hands on Christ. Therefore, however holy may be thy walk in these two
   paths, look to it that, if thou art assailed, thou do not let thy
   mantle fall through thy hasty thought for thyself. It is good and holy
   that thou shouldst exercise thyself in these two ways, and let no
   creature turn thee aside therefrom, until God Himself draws thee up
   into a closer union with Himself. If He thus draw thee up, then let go
   all forms and images, and suffer Him to work as with His instrument. It
   is more well-pleasing to Him, and more profitable to thee, that thou
   shouldst leave Him to do as He will in thee for a moment, than that
   thou shouldst exercise thyself in lower things for a hundred years. Now
   some may ask: Art thou not yet got beyond all this? I answer: No;
   beyond the image of our Lord Jesus Christ may no man come. Thou
   shouldst ask: Art thou not got beyond the ways and works that thou hast
   called thine own? Look to it diligently and be quick to perceive the
   commands of God, and let each good work be followed by another.

   In the third place, when the Holy Spirit was given to St. John, then
   was the door of heaven opened unto him. This happens to some with a
   convulsion of the mind, to others calmly and gradually. In it are
   fulfilled those words of St. Paul: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
   nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things which
   God hath prepared for them that love Him; but God hath revealed them
   unto us by His spirit." Let no man boast that he is continually drawing
   nearer to the highest perfection possible while here on earth, unless
   the outward man have been converted into the inward man; then, indeed,
   it is possible for him to be received up on high, and to behold the
   wonders and riches of God. Believe me, children, one who would know
   much about these high matters, would often have to keep his bed, for
   his bodily frame could not support it. Further, know ye that before
   that can come to pass, of which we have here been speaking, nature must
   endure many a death, outward and inward. But to such death, eternal
   life answers. Children, this is not the work of a day or a year. Be not
   discouraged; it takes time, and requires simplicity, purity, and
   self-surrender, and these virtues are the shortest road to it. Through
   such exercises as we have described, a man obtains true purity of mind
   and body, such as St. John possessed in a high and peculiar manner;
   what our Lord meant when he said: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for
   they shall see God." A pure heart is more precious in the sight of God
   than aught else on earth. A pure heart is a fair, fitly-adorned
   chamber, the dwelling of the Holy Ghost, a golden temple of the
   Godhead; a sanctuary of the only-begotten Son, in which He worships the
   Heavenly Father; an altar of the grand, divine sacrifice, on which the
   Son is daily offered to the Heavenly Father. A pure heart is the throne
   of the Supreme Judge; the seat and secret chamber of the Holy Trinity;
   a lamp bearing the Eternal Light; a secret council-chamber of the
   Divine Persons; a treasury of divine riches; a storehouse of divine
   sweetness; a panoply of eternal wisdom; a cell of divine solitude; the
   reward of all the life and sufferings of Christ. A pure heart is a
   tabernacle of the Holy Father; a bride of Christ; a friend of the Holy
   Ghost; a delight to the eyes of all saints; a sister of the angels; a
   cause of joy to the heavenly hosts; a brother of all good men; a terror
   to the Devil; a victory and conquest over all temptation; a weapon
   against all assaults; a reservoir of divine benefits; a treasury of all
   virtue; an example to all men; a restoration of all that has ever been
   lost. Now, what is a pure heart? It is, as we have said before, a heart
   which finds its whole and only satisfaction in God, which relishes and
   desires nothing but God, whose thoughts and intents are ever occupied
   with God, to which all that is not of God is strange and jarring, which
   keeps itself as far as possible apart from all unworthy images, joys,
   and griefs, and all outward cares and anxieties, and makes all these
   work together for good; for to the pure all things are pure, and to the
   gentle is nothing bitter. Amen!

Sermon for the Fourth Sunday after Easter

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   John xvi. 7-11--"It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go
   not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will
   send Him unto you. And when He is come, He will reprove the world of
   sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they
   believe not on Me; of righteousness, because I go to the Father and ye
   see Me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is
   judged." [47]

   CHILDREN, it behoves us to give diligent heed to the meaning of this
   passage, and see how it is that the Holy Ghost could not be given to
   the dear disciples and friends of Jesus, unless He first went away from
   them.

   What is meant by Christ's going away from us? Nothing else than our
   destitution, hopelessness, and helplessness, when we are heavy and slow
   in all good things, and cold and dark; for then Christ is gone from us.
   If persons who are in this state render it useful and fruitful for
   themselves, this would be a truly noble thing for them thus to master
   and bend it; and to such an one all variety will be fused into unity,
   and he will have joy in sorrow, and be patient under reproach, in
   constant peace amid war and trouble, and all bitterness will to him
   become true sweetness.

   Now our Lord said: "When the Holy Ghost cometh, He will reprove the
   world." What is the world which He will reprove, and how will He
   reprove it? He will enable man to see clearly whether the world is
   lying concealed within him, hidden in the principle of his being: this
   he will detect and rebuke. Now what is the world in us? It is the ways,
   the workings, the imaginations of the world, the world's comfort, joy,
   love, and grief, in love, in fear, in sorrow, in care; for St. Bernard
   says: "With all wherein thou rejoicest and sorrowest, thou shalt also
   be judged." Children, this will the Holy Ghost, when He comes to us,
   clearly reveal, and rebuke us on account thereof, so that we shall
   never have rest or quiet, so long as we know and find this evil and
   noxious possession within us. And when one finds this evil inclination
   in a man, that he is possessed by any creature, be it living or dead,
   and he remains unrebuked, all this is the world. And when a man keeps
   this in himself unrebuked, this is a true and manifest sign that the
   Holy Ghost has not entered into the principle of his life; for Christ
   has said: When He comes, He will rebuke all these things.

   "He will reprove the world of sin." What is sin? Ye know well, dear
   children, that God has made all things, and appointed each thing for
   its right end. Thus He made fire that it should rise up, and stones
   that they should fall down. Thus nature has given to the eye to see, to
   the ears to hear, to the hands to work, and to the feet to walk; and
   thus each member is obedient to the natural will, without any
   opposition, whether the matter be easy or hard, sweet or sour, if so be
   that the will thoroughly wills it; thus, too, the members are
   thoroughly obedient, even when it is an affair of life and death. This
   appears often in many lovers of this world, how they merrily and
   joyfully cast away all ease, and riches, and honour, for the sake of
   what they love, to the end that their carnal lust may thus be
   satisfied. Now sinners say, Who is thus obedient to God, and thus exact
   in all His commandments? Which of you dares thus to resign for God's
   sake his body and goods, and all that he likes or fears,--nay, every
   thing save his conscience, of which God is the rightful Ruler? Now this
   is the sin which the Holy Ghost reproves, that man so greatly and so
   often resists His divine will and admonitions. This sin and many hidden
   offences the Holy Ghost rebukes when He comes to a man. This rebuke
   works a quick, sharp, hard judgment in a man, and a hellish pain, and
   an intolerable woe, whereof worldly men know little. When this judgment
   is indeed borne, the case is safe. For a thousand offences which a man
   truly acknowledges and confesses himself to be guilty of, are not so
   perilous and so mischievous to a man as a single offence which thou
   wilt not recognise nor allow thyself to be convinced of. Children,
   those who are so well pleased with themselves and others, nor have ever
   felt any anxiety about their sin, except to prove that they are in the
   right, are very wrong; they are in dangerous sin, and will never come
   to any good.

   Next: the Holy Ghost will reprove the world of righteousness. Alas,
   merciful God, what a poor miserable thing our righteousness is in the
   eyes of God! For St. Augustine says: Woe and woe to all righteousness,
   unless Almighty God judge, for He has said by the prophet Isaiah: "All
   your righteousnesses are as filthy rags;" and our Lord said: "When ye
   have done all that ye can, say, we are unprofitable servants, we have
   done that which it was our duty to do." He who thinketh somewhat of
   himself when he is nought, deceiveth himself, as St. John saith. Many a
   man is so heartily well pleased with his own ways, that he will neither
   open his heart to God nor to man, and keeps his eyes carefully shut,
   that he may not let God into his soul. If our Lord comes to him with
   his admonitions, directly or indirectly, he follows his own course, and
   heeds them not a straw. Such men are utterly untoward, both to God
   Almighty and to all His creatures: but wherever the Holy Ghost comes,
   he reproves these men's ways; for wherever he is, man perceives his
   faults plainly, and learns self-renunciation, humbleness, and all
   things that belong to eternal life.

   Thirdly: the Holy Ghost reproves man for judgment. What is this
   judgment? It means that every man passes judgment on his neighbour, and
   that they have no eyes for their own faults and sin, although Christ
   has said; "With what measure thou metest, with the same it shall be
   measured to thee again:" "Judge not that ye be not judged." A holy man
   has said: "By as many as thou hast unjustly condemned, shalt thou be
   judged." The people all want to be priests and provincials, that they
   may have a right to sit in judgment, and know not what they are
   themselves. And know that therewith ye build great thick walls between
   God and yourselves. Children, beware of judging any but yourselves, as
   ye love God and your souls and everlasting happiness. A man should
   judge nothing that is not a plain mortal sin. I would rather bite my
   tongue that it bleed, than judge any man. One should leave this to the
   eternal judgment of God; for from man's judgment upon his neighbours
   there grows a complacency in one's self, an evil arrogance, and a
   contempt for one's neighbour. This fruit is therefore truly a seed of
   the Devil, whereby many a heart is defiled, and therein the Holy Ghost
   dwelleth not. But where the Holy Ghost is truly with His presence, He
   judges by that same man where it is necessary; and then that man waits
   for the hour and occasion when it is fitting to punish. This must not
   be done so that when we would heal one wound, we inflict two in doing
   it; not with violence, or harsh words, nor so as to crush a man nor
   lower him in any other man's heart; but we should do it as from love
   and gentleness, and so as to preserve our own humility and poverty of
   spirit which we then bear within us wherever we go, and whatever we do,
   whether amid a congregation or alone. And herewith we profit no one
   else but ourselves in a true simplicity; and let all such things alone
   as do not concern us and are not committed to us.

   Children, ye shall not seek after great science. Simply enter into your
   own inward principle, and learn to know what you yourselves are,
   spiritually and naturally, and do not dive into the secret things of
   God, asking questions about the efflux and reflux of the Aught into the
   Naught, or the essence of the soul's spark, for Christ has said: "It is
   not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put
   in His own power." Therefore, let us maintain a true, entire, simple
   faith in one God in a Trinity of Persons, and yet not as manifold, but
   as one and simple. For Arius and Sabellius, who had a wonderful
   understanding of the Trinity, and the wise Solomon and Origen, who have
   marvellously instructed the holy Church, what has become of them? We
   know not. Wherefore, look to yourselves, and know that no one is
   answerable for you but yourselves. Therefore, give heed to God and His
   will, and to the calling wherewith He has called you, that ye may
   follow it in integrity and singleness of heart. And if ye know not what
   God's will is, then follow those who have been more enlightened by the
   Holy Spirit than yourselves; and if you have not these either, then go
   alone to God: without doubt He will give you purely and simply that
   which you need, if you continue instant in prayer for it. If you are
   not satisfied with this, then, in all doubtful cases, consider the
   matter with sincerity and earnestness, and choose that course which you
   see to be most bitter to nature, and to which you feel least inclined.
   Do this in the first place, for in each death of nature, God becomes
   most truly living in you, and will grow in you of a certainty.

   Now, children, since the Holy Ghost could not be given unto the dear
   disciples unless Christ went away from them, we should in reason look
   to see with what we are holding converse. Wherefore forsake all things
   for God, and then God will be truly given unto you in all things. If
   you do this in earnest, and with your eyes constantly fixed upon the
   truth, you shall receive a wonderful reward of God, even in this
   present time. And "when He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide
   you into all Truth." . . . "And He will show you things to come." Dear
   children, the Holy Ghost will not teach us all things in the sense that
   we shall be given to know whether there will be a good harvest or
   vintage, whether bread will be dear or cheap, whether the present war
   will come to an end soon. No, dear children; but He will teach us all
   things which we can need for a perfect life, and for a knowledge of the
   hidden truth of God, of the bondage of nature, of the deceitfulness of
   the world, and of the cunning of evil spirits. Children, walk in the
   ways of God diligently, earnestly, and circumspectly; and give heed to
   the calling in which God by His mercy hath called you, and follow it
   faithfully. Do not, as some do, who, when God will have them to mind
   the affairs of their soul, attend to outward things; and when God
   summons them to outward duties, want to turn their thoughts inwards.
   This is a hard, poor, perverse course.

   Thus when the Holy Ghost comes to us, He teaches us all truth; that is,
   He shows us a true picture of our failings, and confounds us in
   ourselves, and teaches us how we shall live singly and purely for the
   truth, and teaches us to sink humbly into a deep humility, and to cast
   ourselves utterly down beneath God and beneath every creature. This is
   a true art in which all art and wisdom is concluded, and which we
   indispensably need for our true perfection and felicity. This is a
   true, hearty humility, without any pretence, and not in word or outward
   show, but of a truth wrought into the substance of our souls, May God
   help us at all times to be thus prepared for the Holy Ghost to come and
   enter in to us! Amen.

Second Sermon for Fourth Sunday after Easter

   Of three hindrances which resist the coming of the Holy Ghost in three
   classes of men.

   John xvi. 7.--"It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not
   away, the Comforter will not come unto you."

   OBSERVE, dear children, how high and in what way man must be carried up
   to reach the state of his highest blessedness; for this can only be
   through a real abandonment of those things which are especially
   pleasant and lovely to him and his nature. To all these he must wholly
   die, and must let them go, however good, and holy, and spiritual, and
   precious he may deem them. For if it was necessary that Christ's
   disciples should be deprived of His lovely, holy, gracious humanity, to
   be fitted for receiving the Holy Ghost, no man, it is certain, can be a
   recipient of Divine grace whose heart is possest by any creature.

   Now we find three sorts of hindrances in three different classes of
   men. The first are sinful persons, or open sinners, who are hindered by
   the creature, in that they make use thereof against God, according to
   their own will. These people go astray in God's way. David says,
   "Cursed are they who err in God's way," that is, in the creature. There
   are also sundry good folks, who spend too much care upon the
   necessaries of this life, or look too much for pleasure to outward
   things. Against these Christ says, "He who loves his life shall lose
   it;" that is, carnal love; he who holds this too dear loses his life;
   "and he who hates his life shall receive everlasting life;" that is,
   they who resist their disorderly lusts and desires, and do not follow
   them.

   The second hindrance is when good people are kept back in true
   spirituality through the misuse of the seven sacraments. He who dwells
   with pleasure on the sign of a holy sacrament, does not get to the
   inward truth; for the sacraments all lead to the pure truth. Marriage
   is a sign of the union of the Divine and human natures, and also of the
   union of the soul with God: but he who would stop at the sign alone is
   hindered by his outward senses from reaching the eternal truth; for
   this is not a true marriage. There are also some who make too much of
   repentance and confession, and cleave to the sign, and do not strive to
   reach the pure truth. Against these Christ says, "He who is washed
   needeth not save to wash his feet;" that is, he who has once been
   washed with a hearty repentance and sincere confession needs nothing
   more than that he confess his daily sins, and not his old sins, which
   he has already repented of and confest; but he must wash his feet--that
   is, his desires and conscience; these he must purify from his daily
   sins. Moreover many good men, by spending too much anxiety on outward
   gestures towards the sacred Body of our Lord, hinder themselves in
   divers ways, so that they cannot receive Him spiritually, and enter
   inwardly into the truth; for this is a desire after a real union, and
   not in appearance merely. Hence they do not receive the sacrament
   worthily; for all sacraments are the sign of spiritual truth.

   Here it is to be remembered that we ought to worship God in all places
   and at all times. He who will worship the Father must concentrate his
   whole mind in aspiration and faith. These are the highest powers of the
   soul; for they are above time, and know nothing of time nor of the
   body. So St. Paul tells us, "that we ought to rejoice evermore, pray
   without ceasing, and in everything give thanks." Now, those pray
   without ceasing who do all their works alike for the love of God, and
   not for any selfish enjoyment, and humbly bow down before God, and let
   Him work alone. When the highest powers of the soul are thus gathered
   together in prayer, the soul becomes inspired, and if henceforward the
   spirit cleave unto God with an entire union of the will, it is "made a
   partaker of the Divine nature," and then, for the first time, does the
   man offer up true worship, for he has attained the end for which he was
   created.

   But there are some, ay, many people, who do not rightly worship the
   Father in the truth. For so soon as a man prays to God for any
   creature, he prays for his own harm; for since a creature is a
   creature, it bears its own bitterness and disquiet, pain and evil,
   about it: therefore such people meet their deserts when they have
   trouble and bitterness, for they have prayed for it. He who seeks God,
   if he seeks anything beside God, will not find Him; but he who seeks
   God alone in the truth, will find Him, and all that God can give, with
   Him.

   Again, many good people hinder themselves in their perfection by this,
   that they look solely to the humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   that they give themselves too much to visions: that is to say, that
   they are too fond of contemplating the images of outward things in
   their minds, whether it be angels or men, or the humanity of Christ,
   and believe what they are told when they hear that they are specially
   favoured, or of other men's faults or virtues, or hear that God
   purposes to do something by their means. Herein they are often
   deceived, for God never does anything through any creature, but only
   through His own pure goodness. And He even said to His disciples, "It
   is good for you that I go away;" forasmuch as to them that wish to be
   His disciples in high perfection, His humanity is a hindrance if they
   fix upon it, and cleave unto it with especial delight; for they ought
   to follow God in all His ways; therefore His humanity should lead them
   onward to His Deity. For Christ said, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and
   the Life: no man cometh unto the Father but by Me." Greatly then do
   they err who suppose that they can do anything good of themselves; for
   Christ says that of Himself He did nothing.

   Christ's true humanity we are to worship only in its union with His
   Deity; for the man Christ is truly God, and God is truly Man. Therefore
   we are not to trouble ourselves about any creature, but solely to seek
   God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who is our only Way to the Father. Now even
   if we come into the Way of truth, which is Christ, yet we are not
   perfectly blessed, although we behold the Truth of God: for while we
   are beholding, we are not one with that which we behold; so long as
   there is anything in our perceptions or understanding, we are not one
   with the One; for where there is nothing but One, we can see nothing
   but One: for we cannot see God except in blindness, or know Him except
   in ignorance. St. Augustine says that no soul can come to God unless it
   go to God without a creature, and taste Him without a likeness.
   Therefore, because the soul is a creature, it must cast itself out of
   itself, and in its hour of contemplation must cast out all saints and
   angels; for these are all creatures, and hinder the soul in its union
   with God. For it should be bare of all things, without need of
   anything, and then it can come to God in His likeness; for nothing
   unites so much as likeness, and receives its colour so soon; for God
   will then give Himself to the faculties of the soul, so that the soul
   grows in the likeness of God and takes His colour. The image lies in
   the soul's powers, the likeness in its virtues, the Divine colour in
   its union; and thus its union becomes so intimate that it does not work
   its works in the form of a creature, but in its divine form, wherein it
   is united to God; nay, that its works are taken from it, and God works
   all its works in His form. And then, while it beholds God, and thus
   becomes more united with Him, the union may become such, that God
   altogether pours Himself into it, and draws it so entirely into Himself
   that it no longer has any distinct perception of virtue or vice, or
   recognises any marks by which it knows what it is itself. But God
   regards the soul as a creature. Therefore let the light of grace
   overpower the light of nature in you; for the higher knowledge the soul
   attains in the light of grace, the darker does it deem the light of
   nature. If, then, it would know the real truth, it should observe
   whether it is drawn away from all things, whether it has lost itself,
   whether it loves God with His love, whether it be not hindered by any
   things, and whether God alone lives in it: if so, it has lost itself,
   as Mary lost Jesus, when He went into the school of His Father's
   highest doctrine; therefore He heeded not His mother. Thus it happens
   to the noblest soul that goes into God's school; there it learns to
   know what God is, in His Deity and in the Trinity, and what He is in
   His humanity, and to know the all-gracious Will of God. That man is
   most truly of God who works all his works out of love, and gives up his
   will to the will of his Heavenly Father.

   That we may attain thereunto, being delivered from all hindrances, may
   God grant us. Amen!

Sermon for Ascension Day

   This third sermon on the Ascension tells us how man ought continually
   to follow after Christ, as He has walked before us for three and thirty
   years, passing through manifold and great sufferings, before He
   returned unto His Father.

   Mark xvi. 19.--"So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, He was
   received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God."

   AFTER the Son of God, Jesus Christ, had eaten with His disciples upon
   the Mount of Olives, and reproved them, that they had been so long time
   with Him and yet were so slow of heart to believe, He was taken up into
   heaven before their face.

   Ah, children! how do you think it stood then with the hearts of the
   disciples, who regarded Him with such a strange love? For it was not
   unreasonable that they should be filled with a restless, sorrowful
   yearning to follow after Him; for where your treasure is, there will
   your heart be also. By His glorious ascension, willeth Jesus Christ to
   draw after Him the hearts and minds of all His elect Friends, and all
   their powers, inward and outward, that we may not henceforward have our
   dwelling with contentment and satisfaction among the things of time;
   but that all our walk and conversation, pleasure and satisfaction, may
   be in heaven, and nowhere else, where God dwelleth not. It cannot be
   otherwise but that the members should follow their Head, Who, as on
   this day, has ascended into heaven, and has gone before us in all
   humility to prepare a place for those who shall come after Him;
   therefore should we say with the Bride, in the Song of Songs: "Draw me,
   and I will come after Thee," blessed Lord. And who can hinder us from
   following evermore after our Head, Jesus Christ? For He Himself has
   said: "I ascend to my Father and your Father." His origin, His end, His
   blessedness and our blessedness, is truly a blessedness in Him, for we,
   with all that we are, have proceeded forth from the same source, and
   therefore we are partakers of the same End, and destined to fall into
   the same Ocean (if we for our parts will only dispose ourselves
   accordingly).

   Now let us meditate how Christ has gone before us into the glory of His
   heavenly Father. Therefore, if we desire to follow Him, we must mark
   the way which He has shown us and trodden for three and thirty years,
   in misery, in poverty, in shame, and in bitterness, even unto death. So
   likewise, to this day, must we follow in the same path, if we would
   fain enter with Him into the Kingdom of Heaven. For though all our
   masters were dead, and all our books burned, yet we should ever find
   instruction enough in His holy life. For He Himself is the Way, the
   Truth, and the Life, and by no other way can we truly and undeviatingly
   advance towards the same consummation, than in that which He hath
   walked as our Exemplar while He was yet upon earth.

   Now, as the loadstone draws the iron after itself, so doth Christ draw
   all hearts after Himself which have once been touched by Him; and as
   when the iron is impregnated with the energy of the loadstone that has
   touched it, it follows the stone uphill although that is contrary to
   its nature, and cannot rest in its own proper place, but strives to
   rise above itself on high; so all the souls which have been touched by
   this loadstone, Christ, can neither be chained down by joy or grief,
   but are ever rising up to God out of themselves. They forget their own
   nature, and follow after the touch of God, and follow it the more
   easily and directly, the more noble is their nature than that of other
   men, and the more they are touched by God's finger.

   Now let each one mark for himself, whether his soul has been touched by
   God or not. Those who have not been touched by God often begin many
   excellent undertakings from which we might expect that great things
   would come to pass; but if we watch them for a time, behold it all
   comes to nothing; for they soon fall back again, and they plunge once
   more into all their old customs, and give themselves up to their
   natural inclinations. They do just as the untrained dogs in the chase,
   which have no perception of the noble quarry, but run with all speed
   after the good dogs of nobler breed. And verily, if they kept on
   running, they would with them bring down the stag. But no; in the space
   of some short hour or so, they look about them, and lose sight of their
   companions, or they stand still with their nose in the earth, and let
   the others get ahead of them, and so they are left behind. But the dogs
   of noble breed, who have come upon the scent of this noble quarry,
   eagerly pursue after it, through fire and water, through brake and
   bush, till they have brought down their game. So do those noble-minded
   men, who have caught a glimpse of the Highest Good; they never slacken
   step till they have come up with it. Now the other sort of men remain
   at the same point, and make no progress in their whole life: but all
   such as stand still while they are in this state, and make no progress
   before death, must stand still for ever hereafter; so long as God is
   eternal.

   Children, if our souls have not been touched by God's finger, we have
   no right to lay the cause of it to the charge of the Eternal God, as
   men often do when they say, figuratively: "God does not touch me, nor
   move me, as He does such and such an one." This assertion is false. God
   touches, impels, and admonishes all men alike, and (so far as it rests
   with Him) will have all men to be saved; but His touch, His admonitions
   and His gifts, find a different reception and response in different
   men. With many when God comes to them with His touch and His gracious
   gifts, He finds the chambers of their soul occupied and defiled by
   other guests. So then, He must needs go His way, and cannot come into
   us, for we are loving and serving some one else. Therefore, His gifts,
   which He offers without ceasing to every man, remain unaccepted. This
   is the cause of our eternal loss: the guilt is ours, and not God's. How
   much useless trouble do we create for ourselves; insomuch that we
   neither perceive our own condition nor God's presence, and thereby do
   ourselves an unspeakable and eternal mischief. Against this, there is
   no better or surer remedy than an instant, resolute turning away of the
   thought, and hearty, fervent, continual prayer. Hereby we may obtain
   this steadfastness, together with a firm, and entire, and loving trust
   in the unfathomable mercy of God, in which lies all our salvation, and
   likewise a diligent and faithful watchfulness, to keep our goings ever
   in accordance with the will of God, that all we do or abstain from, and
   all our affections, spiritual and natural, may remain at all times
   agreeable to the will of God.

   Children, the place from which Christ ascended up to heaven was the
   Mount of Olives. This mountain had three sorts of light. The first was
   from the sunrise, for the hill is high and slopes towards the East; and
   when the sun no longer shone on the mountain, its rays were reflected
   from the golden roof of the temple; and, thirdly, on that hill grew the
   essential material of light, the olive-tree. So likewise the soul in
   which God shall arise sweetly as without a cloud, must be a lofty hill,
   raised above these perishable earthly things, and be illuminated by
   three kinds of light; that is to say, there must be a place whereon the
   rays of the high and holy Trinity can shine and bring forth God's high
   and noble work in the soul, according to all His will, and so that the
   brightness of the Eternal God may flow into that soul.

   This mountain lay between Jerusalem and Bethany. Now, know of a truth
   that whosoever will truly follow after Christ, must mount or climb this
   hill, toilsome or weary as the task may be; for there is no mountain on
   the face of the earth, however beautiful and delightful, but what is
   difficult and toilsome to ascend. Thus, whosoever will follow Christ,
   must surely cast off Nature and her lusts. Now we find many who would
   gladly follow Him without pain or toil and as long as the path was
   easy, and would fain be upon this mountain on the side looking towards
   Jerusalem, which signifieth peace, that it should minister to their
   peace, and they should be without contradiction. Such persons
   experience in themselves comfort, peace, and joy; yet they come to
   nought. They will not set foot on the other side that looks towards
   Bethany, which name signifies the pain of obedience or of suffering. Of
   which place the prophet says in the Psalms: "Who passing through the
   valley of Baca make it a well." Know, dear children, he who will not
   pitch his tent in this valley, remaineth unfruitful, and nothing will
   ever come of him. However great his peace, and however fair his
   seeming, it must have an end. Therefore, a devout heart shall ever have
   a sorrowful yearning after her Beloved, who has ascended to such
   distant and lofty heights, whither her eye cannot follow or trace Him.
   Hence, the more truly and deeply the ground of a man's soul has been
   touched by God, the more truly does he find this valley of tears within
   him. And had he no other cause for tears, there were need enough of
   them by reason of sin and the defilement that lies hidden in our frail
   nature, by which man is so often and so greatly hindered from a lofty
   converse with God (which might and ought by God's grace to go on
   without ceasing within the soul), and from the sweet aspirations by
   which a man should continually carry up all things to God, but that
   gross nature hinders him and turns his thoughts aside, and also often
   rules in secret where God alone ought to have His constant abode. This
   is the meaning of the other side of the mountain looking towards
   Bethany.

   But he who should experience in himself all that I have said, would
   then have his face turned towards Jerusalem, the city of peace, and
   thus would become wise as to all that he should do or leave undone, and
   able to distinguish between the promptings of God and of nature.
   Further, this would strengthen him that he might be the better able to
   bear pain and sorrow, and not grow too weak by reason of his sufferings
   and misery, when he is forsaken of God, and left without comfort or
   help in bitter desolation. The wise man says: "My son, when the evil
   days come, thou shalt not forget the goodness of God." Children, these
   two prospects towards Jerusalem and Bethany must be both at once in the
   soul of man. For Jerusalem means a city of peace; yet in this same
   city, Christ was put to death, and had to suffer all manner of
   torments. Truly, child, so must thou also in perfect peace suffer and
   die to all that is thine, for it cannot be otherwise; and commit thy
   cause simply and truly to God, and renounce thyself utterly, for thou
   too must needs fall into the hands of the wicked Jews, who will and
   must torment, scourge, and crucify thee, and cast thee out of their
   borders, as if thou wert a false traitor; and slay thee in the hearts
   of all men. Dear child, thou must utterly die, if God Himself without a
   medium is to become thy life and being. Nay, did not Christ Himself say
   to His disciples: "Whosoever slayeth you will think that he doeth God
   service?" For all those who despise and judge thee, or torment and slay
   thee, will be persuaded in their own minds that they are doing God a
   service on thee, and mean to do so. Ah! dear children, how greatly
   blessed were such a man, if he nevertheless were a dweller in
   Jerusalem, and had a perfect peace in himself, in the midst of all this
   disquiet! Then would the very peace of God be indeed brought forth in
   man.

   Children, on this Mount grows the olive-tree, by which is signified
   true godly devoutness. Ah! children, the essence of devoutness is a
   cleaving of the whole spirit to God, with a mind ready and prepared at
   all times to love and to purpose all that is of God, so that the man is
   inwardly united with God in will and purpose and all things. This is an
   oil that overflows and rises above all tasting and feeling. Hast thou
   this olive-tree growing in the ground of thy soul, thou art in truth a
   devout man. This flame of devotion shall often be refreshed and renewed
   with the fire of Divine love, and thou shalt unceasingly look at and
   through the ground of thy soul, that nothing may be concealed there
   which is not truly and merely God's; so that nature may not rule and
   work in the ground of thy soul, where God alone should dwell, and
   nought else. For, alas! we find many, both among the religious and the
   worldly, who do not simply purpose God in all things and nothing else,
   but will intend themselves in things spiritual and natural. We find
   very few who serve God for His own sake, and do not regard comfort, nor
   joy, nor divine gifts in time or eternity, but God alone, and no object
   besides.

   And now may God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, grant us to
   ascend with the eternal Son of God from this miserable state, and from
   all creatures, that we may with Him possess eternal life! Amen.

Sermon for Whit Sunday

   John vi. 44.--"No man can come to Me, except the Father which hath sent
   Me draw him."

   THUS said the blessed Jesus: "No man can come to Me except the Father
   which hath sent Me draw him." The persecuted, disheartened disciples of
   Jesus, who were held captive in the bonds of ignorance as with iron
   fetters, and in their own esteem were lying in the deep dungeons of
   their trespasses, confessing themselves stript of all their own might,
   cried with fervent prayer to the Almighty Father (as St. Luke tells us,
   that while they were waiting for the promise of the Father, they
   "continued with one accord in prayer and supplication"), praying that
   their bonds might be loosed, and that they might be delivered from
   their prison-house. Wherefore their Heavenly Father, to whom they had
   made known their requests in faith, heard their prayer, and set them
   free from all bonds, and drew them out of their dungeon by six steps
   into the glorious liberty of the Holy Spirit, where they were filled
   with all truth.

   First of all, He turned His merciful eyes upon them, and made them fit
   to receive, not only His ordinary influences, whereby He is wont to
   bring men unto Himself, but He sought to bring them unto Himself in a
   peculiar manner above other men. For we find three other ways by which
   God draws men unto Himself. The first is by means of the creatures, in
   whom He very clearly reveals Himself to men through the created light
   of their souls. Thus St. Thomas tells us how some heathen, from the
   evidences of His in-dwelling and presence in all the creatures, have
   maintained that God is the creator and ruler of the world, and how
   therefore in every part of the world honours ought to be rendered unto
   Him. In this drawing by means of the creatures, does God give a hint
   and offer of Himself to man. The second way is by His voice in the
   soul, when an eternal truth mysteriously suggests itself. So St.
   Augustine says, that the heathens have discoursed of certain truths,
   and these they have reached by virtue of the eternal laws of God which
   are working in all men when they speak what is true, and not by the
   mere light of their own nature. As Augustine says: "Whatever is true,
   by whomsoever it is spoken, proceeds from the Holy Ghost." Hence, at
   those moments when all the powers of the soul are collected and turned
   inwards, it often happens that some eternal truth presents itself with
   irresistible clearness. This happens not unfrequently in morning sleep,
   just before waking. This sort of drawing may be called a whisper of
   love, or a monition. The third way is when the human will is subdued,
   and stands waiting for the blessed Will of God, truly stript of itself
   and all things, so that the Almighty Father draws the created will
   without resistance, and it leans towards Him with peculiar delight.
   This drawing may be called a union and an embrace. This drawing of the
   will towards God comes from the Highest Good; from Him who has created
   heaven and earth, and all the creatures, for man's sake, and yet
   humbled Himself even unto death. Now it is because He has a greater
   delight in man than in all the glories of heaven and earth, and for no
   other reason, that He seeks him out and gives him monitions through all
   things. It was that He might thus draw the beloved disciples unto
   Himself that He cast His eye of mercy on them, and through blessing and
   affliction turned and disposed their wills until He fitted them to
   receive and follow His leadings. And it was because the disciples let
   Him work in them as it pleased Him, that they came at last to
   experience the full power of His drawing, as we may see in all that
   happened to them afterwards.

   Now some may ask, Why did God thus prepare the disciples for His
   leadings, and not me, or others before me, in whom He has not wrought
   after such a special manner? For this special leading there were two
   causes: the first is the sovereign will of God, who chooses some men
   above others to be partakers of His mysteries and hidden sweetness;
   just as a King, out of his mere good pleasure, chooses certain knights
   to compose his privy council and to be about his person. The second
   cause is that one man listens more attentively to God's voice, and
   takes more pains to discover God's leadings, or endeavours more
   strenuously to lay aside his faults and whatever comes between him and
   God; and for this cause also one man is more strongly drawn than
   another. Now because the dear disciples had this mind in them, that
   with hearty repentance they besought forgiveness for all their past
   life of ignorance and sin, and meditated on the sweet teachings and
   holy life and death of their beloved Master and His boundless love and
   resignation, and forsook all things, and watched continually and
   committed themselves wholly to God, ever waiting to discern His will,
   and gave heed thereto, and did without means so far as they could, and
   prayed for help when they could not; therefore this special drawing was
   given unto them, as it is still given to this day to those who follow
   in their footsteps.

   Now it may be asked, But the disciples could not have made this first
   step of their own power; for the Word of Truth says: "Without Me ye can
   do nothing." Therefore, it must have been necessary for God to draw
   them, and to influence their will, even as regards these three points
   already treated of. But if this be so, all hangs upon the first cause,
   as has been said before. To this the doctrine of Scripture answers: It
   is true that we can do no good thing without God's ordinary influence,
   except we make progress by means of a special influence from the Holy
   Spirit; yet, at the same time, man may do his part, inasmuch as his
   will has power to withstand the offers of the Holy Spirit, and to
   cleave to his own way. God does not justify a man without his own free
   will; even as our eyes cannot see except they are enlightened by the
   sun or any other light, yet even when we have the light we must open
   our eyes, or we can never see it. If the eyes were covered with a thick
   veil or screen, the man must take it away or he could see nothing,
   however brightly the sun might pour forth his rays. Now, when the
   Almighty Father came unto the disciples with his Divine light, they
   opened their eyes, and cast away the screen of outward forms, as much
   as might be; therefore, God did his part also, and drew them up unto
   Himself after a special manner. This was the work of the lovely, Divine
   Son, who is the reprover of all hearts,--clearing out all
   stumbling-blocks and rending away all evils of darkness from the inward
   eye of the soul.

   Secondly, their Heavenly Father drew them forth from the bonds of
   slavery to sense, so that they were delivered from this captivity never
   again to fall into it, but to stand ready in perfect acquiescence to
   receive His further leadings. Wherefore He gave them, by His beloved
   Son, four precepts, according to which they should order their lives,
   as St. Matthew tells us: "Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass,
   in your purses, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither
   shoes, nor yet staves." He who only considers the matter aright, will
   find that this drawing them up above the things of the body was very
   necessary, if they were to enter the school of the Eternal Light. For
   this school has four qualities. First, that it is raised far above all
   time, not only in the third heaven, physically speaking, but above all
   the movements of the heavenly bodies, and all else that is subject to
   time. In the second place, that whatever may be found still remaining
   of self-appropriation is not suffered to make itself a home and
   resting-place in the heart. In the third place, in this school is
   perfect rest; for no storms, nor rain, nor sin, nor aught that can
   bring change, is there. Fourthly, there reigns perpetual light, clear
   and unbedimmed; for the sun and moon, which set from time to time, and
   leave the earth in darkness, do not shine there. God is their eternal
   sun, shining in His brightness. Now, seeing that all material, created
   things are base, narrow, subject to change and alloy, it was needful
   that the disciples should be raised above the trammels of material
   things, for St. Jerome says: "It is as impossible for God to bestow
   Himself under the limitations of time, or temporal things, as it is for
   a stone to possess the wisdom of an angel."

   Here a question occurs: Since the Eternal Father draws some men from
   earth by happiness, and others by pain, by which were the disciples
   most strongly drawn? I answer: If you consider their life, you will
   find that they were drawn to God much more by great hardships than by
   enjoyment; for even while Christ dwelt with them, they were always
   suffering contempt, and contradiction to their self-love; and after His
   holy death, until they were lifted up as on this day, they were indeed
   well-nigh crushed to the earth with sorrow and disappointment, before
   the bonds were withdrawn from their eyes; and their Heavenly Father
   ordered it thus out of special love toward them. To be drawn to God
   through pain is in itself a surer way than by joy, as St. Gregory says,
   paraphrasing on the Psalmist: "In time of persecution and tribulation,
   a thousand shall fall by thy side; but in a time of prosperity and good
   fortune ten thousand shall fall at thy right hand." So, too, is it more
   like Christ in all His life and death; and, moreover, it is a greater
   proof of love; for it is said: "Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and
   scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. Wherefore, as the disciples were
   to receive many peculiar and mysterious favours from God, so this was
   to be paid for beforehand, and for each gift a death was to be
   suffered--a dying unto themselves; and if one trial was removed by God,
   He forthwith sent another equally severe (as He does to this day with
   His beloved friends), and they understood this, and endured to the end
   all that their Heavenly Father laid upon them, until they came to have
   their suffering turned into gladness, and rejoiced that they were found
   worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus.

   Thirdly, their Heavenly Father drew them up above all the corporeal
   ideas that they had of the humanity of Christ, making their minds as
   bare of those and all other images, as they were when first created, in
   order that henceforward, according to their necessities, they might
   learn for evermore in the school of the Holy Spirit. For this we are
   able to perceive four reasons. First; that truth and love, which are
   the end of all teaching in all schools, have no images nor any
   existence outside the soul; for no painting can, properly speaking,
   depict truth and love; for they have no images, external or internal.
   No image or type which we can devise to express love, is love itself;
   and it is the same with truth. Next; that in the school of the Spirit,
   man does not learn through books, which teach through outward images
   addressed to the senses; but here the truth, which of its nature does
   not speak by means of images, is spoken into the soul itself. Hence the
   humble St. Francis commanded the brethren of his Order not to trouble
   themselves too much with books and letters, and that those who were
   unlettered should not be anxious about acquiring learning, but remember
   to covet above all things the Spirit of God, and pray only for a pure
   heart and His influences. Thirdly; because in the school of the Spirit
   man learns wisdom through humility, knowledge by forgetting, how to
   speak by silence, how to live by dying. For St. John was sleeping when
   he looked into the fount of eternal wisdom, and St. Paul knew not
   whether he was in the body or out of the body, when he was "caught up
   to the third heaven and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful
   for a man to utter." Therefore it was needful for the disciples to be
   deprived of all images that they might learn in this school. Fourthly;
   where the mind is busied with images, time must necessarily enter into
   the operations of the imagination, and this has no place in the highest
   school of the Holy Spirit; for there neither time nor images can help
   us, but contact is all that is needed, the which may happen without
   time within the space of a moment. St. Gregory says: "The Holy Ghost is
   an admirable master-workman; He fills a fisherman, and makes a preacher
   of him; He fills a persecutor, and transforms him into a teacher of the
   Gentiles; He fills a publican, and makes of him an evangelist. Who is
   this master-workman? He needs not time for His teachings; by whatever
   means He chooses, so soon as He has touched the soul, He has taught it,
   and His mere touch is His teaching." For these four reasons we can
   perceive how that it was necessary for the disciples to have their
   souls bereft of all images. But when they were drawn upwards to this
   end, not all happened to them which happened to St. Paul, when he was
   caught up to the third heaven; for, in the opinion of St. Augustine, it
   was given to Paul in his trance, and to Moses in Sinai, to behold the
   Godhead without a veil. This was not the case with the disciples at
   this time, for they well knew that they were still in the body. Yet
   their hearts were so lifted up, and their minds so illumined with
   eternal truth, that they were enabled to receive that same thing,
   though some more and some less, which St. Paul afterwards received in
   his vision.

   In the Fourth place; the Holy Father drew them out of themselves, and
   delivered them from all natural self-seeking, so that they stood at
   rest, in true peace with themselves, and in perfect freedom. Then
   ceased all the mourning, fears, and pain which they had suffered
   hitherto; for in the lifting up of their souls, there was an act of
   such entire self-surrender, that they reached the summit of that first
   stage of the Christian course of which we have spoken above.
   Henceforward the Eternal Father could fulfil His good pleasure in them
   without any resistance from their will or natural inclinations. The
   Eternal Father thus drew them upwards, that He might reign as a master
   in them, in His omnipotence, greatness, unity, and love, and they
   should learn of Him and grow up into His likeness. Hence it was needful
   that they should be drawn out of themselves, because they could not be
   free, at one, noble and loving, so long as they were held captive to
   Self. It may be asked: When the disciples were thus drawn out of
   themselves, and all images were effaced from their souls, was there an
   extinction of their natural powers, so that they were dead to nature? I
   answer, No: their nature was not extinguished, for they were much more
   truly according to nature in their self-surrender than they had ever
   been before; for what the Lord of nature ordains for a creature, that
   it is natural for the creature to observe, and if it departs therefrom,
   it acts contrary to nature. Thus St. Augustine says, "that the rod in
   the Old Testament was turned into a serpent was not contrary to nature,
   for it was God's will." Wherefore I say too, that inasmuch as the
   disciples surrendered themselves utterly to the Divine Will, they were
   in the highest sense in harmony with nature; and their nature did not
   perish, but was exalted and brought into rightful order. There were no
   fewer images in their minds than before; but the images did not disturb
   their inward harmony or move them out of God. And when I said that
   their minds were to be emptied of images, it is to be understood in
   this sense, that it was just as when you set a lighted taper at midday
   in the sunshine, the taper continues to burn, and sheds forth no less
   light than it did before; but its light is lost in the sunshine,
   because the greater light prevails over the lesser and absorbs it, so
   that it no longer seems to shine with a separate lustre, but is
   diffused and shed forth in the greater light. Thus I said of images and
   of creatures in the case of the disciples, that henceforth they
   performed all their works by means of the Divine light, and yet were
   much more according to nature, and their minds were as full of images
   as before.

   Fifthly: the Heavenly Father drew His disciples, thus free and
   acquiescing, into so close a union that He gave Himself as truly unto
   them, as they had given themselves unto Him. Then all the desire of the
   good pleasure of God was fulfilled, and also all the desires of the
   disciples, so that God's will with them went no farther than their own
   wills. Not only did the Holy Ghost give himself unto them, but also God
   the Father and the Son gave themselves with the Spirit, as one God
   without distinction of persons. For when love is attributed to the Holy
   Spirit (as wisdom to the Son), He must be considered as a distinct
   Person, as touching his attribute of being the bond of mutual love, but
   not as otherwise distinct. Here some may ask, if the disciples were all
   drawn out of themselves, and gave themselves up to God, did God draw
   them all to Himself in the same degree, and also give Himself alike to
   all? I answer: though all the disciples were set free of self, yet one
   turned to God with warmer love and stronger desire than another; as the
   angels who kept their first estate all remained in perfect obedience to
   God, and yet one cleaved to Him with greater love than another.
   Wherefore God gave Himself more to one than to another, though all with
   like sincerity turned unto Him. Thus was it with the disciples; they
   turned unto God with unequal affections, and hence God bestowed Himself
   and His gifts upon them after an unequal manner. The beloved disciple
   John was the most highly favoured because he looked up to God with the
   greatest fervour of love. It is true, nevertheless, that in this matter
   much must be ascribed to the sovereign will of God, who giveth to every
   man as He will. Further, we must note that it was not only on the Day
   of Pentecost that God gave Himself personally to His disciples; for, as
   Richard and other doctors say, so often as that grace is given to man
   which makes the creature to find favour in the sight of God, so often
   is the Person of the Holy Ghost given unto him. Thus the disciples had
   many times before received the Person of the Holy Ghost, but they had
   never before utterly renounced themselves, and opened their hearts to
   His gifts. Hence, in this sense, He was first given unto them on the
   Day of Pentecost.

   Sixthly, the Eternal Father brought them into the highest school of the
   Holy Spirit, in the which they straightway understood the mysteries of
   the Holy Scriptures, and the simple naked truth of God, which cannot be
   understood by any of the mere earthly masters in the schools. And in
   this school the greatness of God was first laid open to them; and
   therewith the gift of childlike fear of God sank down into their
   hearts, and abode there unto their life's end. Next, all power was
   given unto them, and they were enabled always to look up to God; and
   herewith they received the gift of strength. In the third place, they
   learnt not only to obey the precepts, but also to apprehend the counsel
   of Christ, and therewith they received the gift of counsel. Fourthly,
   He taught them to feel the hidden sweetness of God, and gave them
   therewith the gift of charity. Fifthly, He taught them how to observe
   and judge the creatures, and to distinguish between the light of God
   and the suggestions of nature, and therewith bestowed on them the gift
   of science. Sixthly, He taught them to perceive aright their present
   condition, and all their previous states, and gave them therewith the
   gift of understanding. Seventhly, He taught them to be transformed into
   the likeness of God, by loving union with Him, and gave them therewith
   the gift of wisdom. These sevenfold gifts does the Holy Ghost convey to
   the disciples in His school: for as the schools of natural learning
   teach the seven sciences, and the school of doctrine the seven
   sacraments, so does the Holy Ghost, in his school, teach those seven
   things with His sevenfold gifts.

   Here a question arises: Did the disciples in this highest school of the
   Spirit obtain an insight into all those sciences which are learnt in
   the school of nature? I answer, Yes; it was given them to understand
   all science, whether touching the courses of the heavenly bodies, or
   what not, in so far as it might conduce to God's glory, or concerned
   the salvation of man; but those points of science which bear no fruit
   for the soul, they were not given to know. This in no wise abated their
   happiness, or their perfection; for, as St. Augustine says: "He is a
   miserable man who knows all things, and does not know God; and he is
   happy who knows God, even though he know nothing else. But he who knows
   God and all else beside is not made more blessed thereby; for he is
   blessed through God alone." That God may thus draw us up unto Himself,
   and shine into our inmost parts with the same truth, may He grant us of
   His grace! Amen!

Sermon for the Fourth Sunday after Trinity

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   This sermon telleth us of four measures that shall be rendered unto
   man, and of two grades of a godly life, and how we ought to love our
   neighbour.

   Luke vi. 36-42.

   WE read in the Gospel for this day that our Lord Jesus Christ said: "Be
   ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. Judge not, and
   ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned;
   forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto
   you: good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over,
   shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete
   withal, it shall be measured to you again. And He spake a parable unto
   them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the
   ditch? The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is
   perfect shall be as his master. And why beholdest thou the mote that is
   in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own
   eye? Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out
   the mote that is in thine eye, when thou beholdest not the beam that is
   in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine
   own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is
   in thy brother's eye."

   I will say a few words on the precept: "Be ye merciful, even as your
   Father in heaven is merciful." This noble virtue is, now-a-days, quite
   a stranger to the hearts of many, insomuch that it is grievous to
   behold. For each is called to exercise this mercy towards his
   neighbour, whereinsoever the latter may have need of it; not only as
   regards the giving of earthly goods, but also the bearing with his
   neighbour's faults in all gentleness and mercy. But no! each one falls
   upon his neighbour and judges him; and as soon as any mishap befalls a
   man, whether deserved or not, straightway, without waiting to take
   thought, another comes along and lends a helping hand to make matters
   worse, to put a bad face on them, and suggests the most evil
   interpretation that he can imagine; nay, it is thanks to God if he do
   not add a great piece from the stores of his own wicked imagination.
   This evil tongue (from which arise untold sorrows and vexations) is at
   work at once before a man has time to reflect and pass a deliberate
   judgment. Poor creature! as thou lovest thy eternal salvation, wait, at
   all events, till thou canst calmly reflect, and know what thou thinkest
   and sayest. For it is a base and scandalous thing for a man thus
   thoughtlessly and rashly to pass sentence, which may not even be
   deserved, upon his neighbours, with his sharp, ruthless words, whereby
   he, spiritually speaking, slays his neighbour in the hearts of others.
   And who has commanded thee to pass judgment? Wherefore Christ tells us
   that whosoever judges another shall be judged by God: "For with what
   judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with the same measure that
   ye mete, shall it be measured to you again." Of this matter no more for
   the present; but let us consider those words of Christ: "For with the
   same measure that ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."

   We read in the Gospel of four sorts of measure that shall be given to a
   man,--a good measure, one shaken together, one pressed down, and one
   running over. The doctors of divinity teach us that a good measure is
   for a man while in this present time, through the help and grace of
   God, to be in a state of salvation and holiness, whereby he may enter
   into eternal life hereafter. The second sort of measure is for the body
   of a justified man to be glorified with his soul at the day of
   judgment: this is the measure which is added to. The measure pressed
   down is, that a man should have his portion with all the saints and
   angels of God in eternal life. The measure running over is, that a man
   should have a perfect fruition of God directly without means.

   Now, dear children, we will give you yet another exposition of these
   words, and ask: First, what is the measure whereby we shall be
   measured? Secondly, who is He that measures? The measure whereby we
   shall be measured is the faculty of love in the soul--the human Will.
   This is, properly speaking, the measure whereby all human words and
   works and life are measured, for this is neither added to nor taken
   from. By so large a measure as thou hast meted withal shall be meted
   unto thee again with thine own measure in eternity. And the meter is
   thine own enlightened reason and conscience. Now let us observe first
   concerning the good measure, that it is, when a man freely and heartily
   turns to God in his will, and lives circumspectly according to the
   commands of God and the Holy Church; and moreover lives orderly in the
   communion of the holy sacraments, in the true Christian faith, being
   truly sorry for his past sins, and having a thorough and steadfast
   purpose to abstain from them henceforward, and to live in penitence and
   the fear of God, loving God and his neighbour. Alas! there be few
   now-a-days who thus do, or even desire to live in the fear of God.
   Children, one who thus lives is said to and does lead a just Christian
   life, and is a true Christian man; and this is a good measure which,
   without doubt, hath a part in eternal life. These are rules which all
   really Christian men must needs observe. There are some whom God has
   invited and called to this "good measure," and of whom He demands no
   more than this. And it may very possibly be appointed and come to pass
   that such men may walk so unspotted and godly in this way, that after
   death they may enter into eternal life without any purgatory. Yet
   nevertheless this is the lowest path by which to approach to our
   merciful God.

   After these, there is a second sort of men whom God has called to tread
   a much higher path, that they may reach a much higher goal,
   notwithstanding that some of these should have to pass through
   purgatory, inasmuch as they have not lived perfectly and faultlessly
   according to the vocation to which God had called them. These have to
   suffer such long and sharp anguish in the fire of purification as no
   human heart can fathom or express. But when they have reached the term
   of their purification, they rise a thousand degrees higher than the
   former class of men. With them it stands thus: that having set out in a
   spiritual, blessed, and holy life, they were overtaken by death ere
   they had reached their goal. Now when these men are in the beginning of
   their spiritual life, they practise many excellent outward exercises of
   piety--such as prayer, weeping, fasting, and the like; but they receive
   from God a heaped-up measure, in that they have also inward exercises,
   setting themselves with all diligence to seek God in the inmost ground
   of their souls, for therein is seated the kingdom of God. Their life is
   very far different from that of the first class I have described.

   Now, children, would a man attain to such a point that the outward
   things should not hinder the inward workings of the soul, that would be
   indeed above all a blessed thing; for two things are better than one.
   But if thou find that the outward work hinders the inward working of
   the soul, then boldly let it go, and turn thou with all thy might to
   that which is inward, for God esteemeth it far before that which is
   outward. Now we priests do on this wise: for during the fast days in
   Lent we have many services, but at Easter and Whitsuntide we shorten
   our services and say fewer prayers, for the greatness of the festival.
   So likewise do thou when thou art bidden to this high festival of
   inward converse; and fear not to lay aside outward exercises, if else
   they would be a snare and hindrance to thee, except in so far as thou
   art bound to perform them for the sake of order. For I tell thee of a
   truth, that the pure inward work is a divine and blessed life, in which
   we shall be led into all truth, if we can but keep ourselves pure and
   separate, and undisturbed by outward anxieties. So in thy hours of
   meditation, when thou turnest thy thoughts within, set before thy mind
   whatever thou shalt find most helpful to thee, whether it be the noble
   and unspotted life of our Lord Jesus Christ, or His manifold sharp and
   bitter sufferings, or His many painful wounds and His precious
   blood-shedding, or the eternal and essential Godhead, or the Holy
   Trinity, or the Eternal Wisdom, or the Divine Power, or the gentle and
   compassionate kindness of God, or the countless benefits that He has
   bestowed on thee and all men, and will bestow evermore on thee and all
   those who deserve them and are found in God's grace at their end.

   Therefore, dear children, among all these excellent things, whichever
   most stirs you up to true devoutness and fervent desire, take, and
   humbly sink down into the abyss of God, with great thankfulness, and
   wait for God with this preparation. For, by such exercises, with love,
   the soul becomes very quick to feel God's touch, far more so than by
   any outward practices of devotion. For the inward work is always better
   than the outward; and from it the outward works of virtue draw all
   their power and efficacy. It is as if thou hadst a noble excellent
   wine, of such virtue that a drop of it poured into a cask of water
   would be enough to make all the water taste like wine and turn it into
   good wine. This would be a great miracle; and so it is with the noble,
   excellent, inward work of the soul compared to the outward.

   Now, we find some men whose love is like a very broad vessel; that is
   they can meditate a great deal upon our Lord, and with great desire and
   fervour, but they are hardly two inches deep. That is to say, they lack
   humility and a common godlike love toward all mankind. For, as St.
   Augustine says, "Salvation does not depend on the length of time that a
   person has been converted to God, nor on the number of good deeds
   performed, but solely on the greatness of his love." This we see in the
   example of the husbandmen who, with great labour, till the wheat-fields
   and precious vineyards, yet partake not themselves of these best fruits
   of the earth, but have only rye to eat and water to drink. So it is
   with many persons, in a spiritual sense, with regard to the outward
   good works which they do, that other more noble-minded and devout
   persons reap the fruit and benefit thereof.

   Next comes the measure that is shaken together; and this signifies an
   overflowing love which draws all things into itself; that is to say,
   all good deeds and all sorrows, nay every good which is brought to pass
   in the world, whether by good or wicked men, does this overflowing love
   draw into its own vessel. And he who possesses this love has a much
   larger ownership and delight in the good actions of another, who does
   those actions but lacks this love, than the doer himself. Therefore, of
   all the pious acts, the masses, vigils, and psalters that are read and
   sung, the many great sacrifices that are made for God's sake,--of all
   these good things is more meted and allotted to such loving men than to
   those who may have done the good works, but do not stand in this
   overflowing love. For I tell thee that God will not accept the works of
   which He is not the beginning and the end; but, as St. Paul tells us,
   "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my
   body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."
   Hence this virtue of godly charity is the greatest of all virtues; for
   by love it draws unto itself all good deeds, customs, and services, in
   heaven or on earth, which are the fruits of grace: what evil a man has
   remains his own, but what good he has is the property of love. Even as
   when we pour corn into a vessel, all the grains do hurry forward and
   press together as though they desired to become one, so doth love
   swallow up all the goodness of angels and saints in heaven, all
   suffering and pain, and all the goodness that is found in any creature
   in heaven and on earth, whereof more than can be told is wasted and
   thrown away, as far as we are concerned, but love doth gather it all up
   into itself, and will not suffer it to be lost. The godly doctors of
   Holy Scripture tell us that in heaven the elect do ever bear such great
   love one to another that, if one soul were to perceive and see that
   another soul had a clearer vision and greater fruition of the Deity
   than herself, she would rejoice with her sister as though she herself
   had won and enjoyed this blessedness. Therefore, the more while here on
   earth we approach and are made like unto this overflowing love, the
   more shall we enjoy of its blessedness hereafter in eternal life; for
   he who most entirely rejoices in good works here on earth in a spirit
   of love, he alone shall possess and enjoy love in eternal life
   hereafter. But this same spirit of love is what the Evil One always
   hates in a man: wherefore he is ever trying to bring such as have it
   into a false self-righteousness, and into displeasure with their
   neighbours' ways and works, so that the man conceits within himself
   that his neighbour's works are not so good as they ought to be, and so
   in a moment he falleth away from this love, and begins to judge his
   neighbour and pass sentence on him. And then from the depth of this
   judging spirit darts forth a stinging venomous tongue, that wounds and
   poisons the soul unto eternal death. This same arrow of judgment will
   smite and slay all the excellent and virtuous works that thou hadst
   stored up unto thyself through an overflowing love, and thus thou wilt
   find thyself despoiled and laid waste, and thy peace destroyed within
   thee, and then thou wilt be in a miserable and dangerous condition.
   Wherefore, in godly faithfulness, I counsel thee ever to keep thy
   tongue with all diligence, if thou wouldst be, and call thyself, a
   friend of God.

   Ofttimes too does the Evil One come and seduce thee into anger with a
   pious and good man. If thou utterest this by passing a judgment on him,
   in thus cutting thyself off from the fellowship of his love, thou art
   also cut off from participation in the benefits of the gifts with which
   God has endowed him, and the works of his virtue. Of this brotherly
   fellowship the Psalmist says: "It is like the precious ointment upon
   the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went
   down to the skirts of his garments." Now the beard has many hairs, and
   the precious ointment flows into them all; but if one hair be cut off,
   it receives none of this precious ointment. In like manner, so long as
   thou hast a whole and undivided love towards all men, a share of the
   virtues and divine influences bestowed upon all flows out unto thee
   through this love. But I tell thee, if thou dost sever any one from
   this spirit of universal love, thou wilt not receive the precious
   benefits of the outflowings of love. Wherefore give diligent and
   earnest heed to yourselves in this matter of divine love, and maintain
   a hearty good-will towards all men, and bear no grudge against any, and
   despoil not the sacred temple of God, which has been sanctified by our
   highest pontiff, Christ; and beware that ye do not call down upon your
   heads God's everlasting Interdict. But, alas! now-a-days, nature is so
   perverted in many, both clergy and laymen, as touching brotherly
   faithfulness and love, that if they see their neighbour fall, they
   laugh at him, or stand by and let it go on, and care nought for it.
   Take heed to your failings, and look how it stands with your inward
   love to God and your neighbour, and keep ever alive within you the fear
   of God; for I tell you that that which you fail to obtain here through
   your own neglect, you will lose for ever. After this life nothing will
   be added to you or taken from you, but ye shall receive according to
   that ye have deserved, whether it be good or whether it be evil. I tell
   you that then, though our Lady and all the saints should intercede for
   a man with tears of blood, it would not help him. Therefore give heed
   to yourselves; for now God is alway at hand, waiting for us, and ready
   to give us much more than we are ready to desire of Him. St Paul says,
   Love never faileth, it doeth all things, and endureth all things.
   Therefore seeing that the love of God is never standing idle, so be ye
   constantly abounding in good works, enduring all that befalls you
   cheerfully, for God's sake. And then shall ye be made partakers of the
   overflowing measure, which is so full, so rich, so generous, that it
   runneth over on all sides.

   God touches this brimming vessel with His finger, and it overflows, and
   pours itself back again into its Divine source, from whence it has
   proceeded. It flows back into its source without channel or means, and
   loses itself altogether; will, knowledge, love, perception, are all
   swallowed up and lost in God, and become one with Him. Now God loveth
   Himself in these men, and worketh in them all their works. The gush and
   outflowing of this love cannot be contained within the man's own soul,
   but he hath a yearning desire, and saith: "Oh! my beloved Lord Jesus
   Christ, I beseech Thee to have compassion upon poor sinners, and to
   forgive them their sins and misdoings; and especially upon those who,
   after having done good works, have lost the same again by reason of
   sin; and grant them, dear Lord, the crumbs that fall from the rich
   table of Thy grace; and of Thy goodness turn them from their sins
   through the pains of purification, and impart unto them the
   overflowings of Thy grace, that through Thy merits they may be kept
   unto the end." Thus do these Elect men carry up all things, themselves
   and all creatures, to their true source in God, and take all things
   that are done in the holy Christian Church, and offer them up, from a
   joyful, humble, submissive heart, to their eternal, heavenly Father,
   for themselves and for all men, bad and good; for their love excludes
   none here in this time of grace, and they are always in unity with all
   men. No love or blessedness that the saints or angels possess is lost
   to them, but all is poured into their measure.

   Verily, had we none of these godlike men among us at this present time,
   we were doubtless in evil case. Therefore let us all beseech the God of
   all mercy, that we may fulfil and receive again this measure that
   runneth over. Amen.

Sermon for the Tenth Sunday after Trinity

   (From the Epistle for the day)

   Admonishing each man to mark what is the office to which he is called
   of God, and teaching us to practise works of love and virtue, and to
   refrain from self-will.

   1 Cor. xii. 6.--"There are diversities of operations, but it is the
   same God which worketh all in all."

   ST. PAUL tells us in this Epistle that there are different kinds of
   works, but that they are all wrought by the same Spirit to the profit
   and well-being of man. For they all proceed from the same God who works
   all in all. "But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man
   to profit withal. For to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom,
   to another faith;" and so Paul goes on enumerating many gifts; but
   repeats that "all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit,
   dividing to every man severally as He will." And he says many things
   for the confirmation of our faith.

   In old times the Holy Ghost has wrought very great and wondrous deeds
   through his servants for a testimony to the faith, having given us
   great signs by the raising up such a succession of prophets, and by the
   blood of His saints, and thus suffering unto death. For this kind of
   testimonies there is no longer any need. Yet, know that of true,
   living, active faith, there is, alas, as little in some Christian men
   as in Heathens or Jews!

   Now let us meditate on these words of St. Paul: "There are diversities
   of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all."
   Children, if you look around you, you see that you have bodies, and
   that these bodies have many members and many senses, and that each
   member, such as the eye, the mouth, the nose, the hands, the feet, has
   its own special office and work. No one of these takes upon itself to
   be another, nor to do anything but what God has ordained unto it. In
   like manner, we are all one body, and members one of another, and
   Christ is the head of the body. In this body there is a great diversity
   of members; the one is an eye, the other an ear, the third a hand or a
   foot or a mouth. The eyes of the body of the holy Christian Church are
   her teachers. This office is none of yours; but let us common
   Christians look to see what is our office, to the which our Lord has
   called and bidden us, and what is the gift of which our Lord has made
   us the vessels. For every art or work, however unimportant it may seem,
   is a gift of God, and all these gifts are bestowed by the Holy Spirit
   for the profit and welfare of man.

   Let us begin with the lowest. One can spin, another can make shoes, and
   some have great aptness for all sorts of outward arts, so that they can
   earn a great deal, while others are altogether without this quickness.
   These are all gifts proceeding from the Spirit of God. If I were not a
   priest, but were living as a layman, I should take it as a great favour
   that I knew how to make shoes, and should try to make them better than
   any one else, and would gladly earn my bread by the labour of my hands.
   Children, the foot or the hand must not desire to be the eye. Each must
   fulfil the office for which God has fitted him, however weighty it may
   be, and what another could not easily do. Also our sisters shall each
   have her own office. Some have sweet voices; let them sing in the
   Churches, for this also comes from the Spirit of God. St. Augustine
   says: "God is a homogeneous, divine, simple substance, and yet the
   Author of all variety, and is all in all, one in all, and all in one."
   There is no work so small, no art so mean, but it all comes from God
   and is a special gift of His. Thus, let each do that which another
   cannot do so well, and for love, returning gift for gift. Know ye,
   whoever does not exercise his gift, nor impart it, nor make use of it
   for the profit of his neighbour, lays up a heavy reckoning against the
   last day. For, as Christ tells us, a man must give account of his
   stewardship, or his office. Each shall and must restore that which he
   has received of God, and is answerable in proportion to his advantages
   over others, and the measure of the ability which God has given him.

   Whence comes it then, that we have so many complaints, each saving that
   his occupation is a hindrance to him, while notwithstanding his work is
   of God, who hindereth no man? Whence comes this inward reproof and
   sense of guilt which torment and disquiet you? Dear children, know that
   it is not your work which gives you this disquiet. No: it is your want
   of order in fulfilling your work. If you performed your work in the
   right method, with a sole aim to God, and not to yourselves, your own
   likes and dislikes, and neither feared nor loved aught but God, nor
   sought your own gain or pleasure, but only God's glory, in your work,
   it would be impossible that it should grieve your conscience. It is a
   shame for a spiritual man, if he have not done his work properly, but
   so imperfectly that he has to be rebuked for it. For this is a sure
   sign that his works are not done in God, with a view to His glory and
   the good of his neighbour. You may know and be known by this, whether
   your works are directed to God alone, and whether you are in peace or
   not. Our Lord did not rebuke Martha on account of her works, for they
   were holy and good; He reproved her on account of her anxiety. A man
   ought to busy himself in good and useful occupations of whatever kind
   they may be, casting his care upon God, and labour silently and
   watchfully, keeping a rein upon himself, and proving himself, so as to
   sift what it is that urges and impels him in his work. Further, he must
   look within, and mark whether the Holy Spirit will have him to be
   active or quiet; that he may obey His godly leadings in each instance,
   and do and have undone by the influence of the Holy Spirit; now
   resting, now working, but ever fulfilling his due task in peace.

   And wherever you see the aged, the sick, the helpless, you should run
   to their assistance, and strive with each other in fulfilling works of
   love--each helping the other to bear his burden. If thou dost not so,
   be sure that God will take thy work from thee, and give it to another
   who will do it aright, and will leave thee empty and bare at once of
   gifts and of merit.

   If, when at thy work, thou feel thy spirit stirred within thee, receive
   it with solemn joy, and thus learn to do thy work in God, instead of
   straightway fleeing from thy task. Thus should ye learn to exercise
   yourselves in virtue; for ye must be exercised if ye are to come to
   God. Do not expect that God will pour virtue into you without your own
   effort. You should never trust in virtue that has not yet been put into
   practice, nor believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost have entered
   into a man, unless the man hath given evidence thereof in his own
   labours, outward or inward. Once as a good man was standing, threshing
   his corn, he fell into a trance; and if an angel had not turned aside
   the flail, he would have struck himself with it. Now ye are all craving
   to be thus set free from your work, and this comes, for the most part,
   from sloth; each would fain be an eye, and give himself to
   contemplation rather than to work.

   I know a man who has the closest walk with God of any I ever saw, and
   who has been all his life a husbandman,--for more than forty years, and
   is so still. This man once asked the Lord in prayer if he should give
   up his occupation and go into the Church; and it was answered him, No;
   he should labour, earning his bread by the sweat of his brow, to the
   glory of Christ's precious blood, shed for him. But let each choose
   some suitable time in the course of every four-and-twenty hours, in
   which he can give his whole mind to earnest meditation, each after his
   own fashion. Those nobler men who are able to turn to God simply
   without the aid of images or forms, shall do so after their fashion,
   and others after theirs. Let each set apart a good hour for such
   exercises, each taking his own method; for we cannot all be eyes; but
   to our life's end it is most needful for us to keep up some strenuous
   exercises of piety, of whatever kind God may appoint, with loving and
   peaceful hearts, and in obedience to His will. He who serves God after
   God's will shall be rewarded according to his own will; but he who
   prays to God according to his own will shall not be answered in
   accordance with his own will, but after God's will.

   Children, it is of this coming out from our own self-will, that the
   true, solid peace is begotten and springs forth, and it is the fruit of
   long-tried virtue. Unless thy peace come from this, be sure that it is
   false; for inwardly and outwardly thou must be exercised. But the peace
   that comes from within none can take away. Now some foolish men, who
   are puffed up in their own conceit, come and say that ye ought to do
   this and that, and want to direct every man's mind according to their
   own opinion and their own notions and practices. And many of them have
   lived for forty years in the profession of religion, and to this day do
   not know what is their own real state. They are much bolder than I. I
   hold the office of an instructor; and when people come and consult me,
   I inquire how it stands with them, and how they came into this state.
   Yet I dare not pass a judgment on them; but I lay their case before the
   Lord, and if He does not give me what I shall speak, I say to them:
   Dear children, seek help yourselves from God, and He will give it you.
   But you want to judge and set an estimate on every man, trying him by
   the standard of your own usages and conceits. Thus it is that the worms
   get in and devour the good saplings that were shooting up in God's
   garden.--Then they say, "We have no such custom; this is an innovation,
   and comes from the new notions," and never reflect that the hidden ways
   of God are unknown to them. Alas! what strange things do we see among
   those who fancy themselves in an excellent way!

   Now St. Paul says, that the Holy Ghost, by His operations, teaches us
   the discerning of spirits. Children, who do you suppose are the men to
   whom God gives this power of discerning the spirits? Know ye, that the
   men who have this gift have been thoroughly exercised in all ways: by
   their own flesh and blood, and have gone through the most cruel and
   perplexing temptations: and the devil has been in them, and they in
   him, and they have been tried and tested to the very marrow; these are
   the men who can discern the spirits. When they are minded to do this,
   they consider a man, and straightway they discern his spirit, whether
   it be of God or no, and what are the nearest roads of access for him,
   and what is holding him back from God. Oh! how greatly to our hurt do
   we fall short of the noblest, highest truth through such trifling, mean
   things; for the sake of which we must suffer loss for ever and ever, so
   long as God is eternal. For what we here miss through our own neglect
   will never be made up to us hereafter. But may God help all of us truly
   to fulfil the offices and works which His Spirit has committed to us
   and taught us to perform, each doing as he is inwardly monished by the
   Holy Ghost! Amen.

Sermon for the Twelfth Sunday after Trinity

   (From the Epistle for the day)

   Teaching us that we ought to receive God, in all His gifts, and in all
   His burdens, with true long-suffering.

   2 Cor. iii. 6.--"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."

   THERE are two sorts of men among God's friends; those of the Old
   Testament, and those of the New. All the men who should be saved before
   the birth of Christ had to observe the old dispensation with all its
   rites, until the new dispensation came with its laws and its rites. The
   old law served as a way unto the new, and was a perfect foreshadowing
   of it. And this new law we have under our very eyes, but it was the old
   law that prepared us to receive it. And everything that is meant to
   receive somewhat must first be made able to receive. The old law had
   many intolerable burdens, and terrible judgments for offenders, and a
   far sterner manifestation of the justice of God, with a dark, distant
   hope of redemption. For five thousand years the gates were altogether
   closed against those who lived under the Old Covenant; so that, with
   all their pain and weary ceremonies, they could not enter into the
   Kingdom of God, but had to wait long in gloom and sorrow for the coming
   of the new law, which is peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. Now he who
   would come to the new law with full assurance of faith must first be
   made at one with the old. Man must learn to suffer, and to bear heavy
   burdens, and to bow down humbly beneath the mighty hand of God; he must
   be afflicted outwardly and inwardly, from wheresoever his pain cometh,
   and whether it be deserved or not.

   Dear children, behold! this thing must be brought to pass after a very
   different fashion from what you like to dream; but hold fast the
   doctrine of God, and let him who hath received it be wise, and hold it
   fast as long as he hath it. But submit and endure God's dealings in all
   that befalls you, through whomsoever it may come. If you would come to
   the new law, you must first suffer under the old one, and be subject to
   it in the humility of your hearts. So, whatever consolation may be
   granted you, spiritual or earthly, it will not follow you all your
   course through. And you must travel this road and no other; turn it
   which way you will, it must be even so. Therefore, dear children, learn
   to do without the Holy Sacraments, spiritual light, the sense of God's
   presence, and all human help. Dearly beloved, bow down your old man
   under the yoke of the old law, with all meekness and resignation, and
   receive all God's gifts with all their burdens. Of a truth, His burdens
   are light and His yoke is easy. Children, I commend you from the bottom
   of my heart into the captivity of the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ;
   that it may be in you, over you, behind you, and before you, lying
   heavy on you, and yet received by you with free and full acquiescence
   to the will of God, whatever it may please Him to do with you. May God,
   of His mercy, give you to bear with a good courage all the sorrow that
   is before you, and also, when ye are despised of all men, and
   slandered, and counted for nought. Thus let your old man be subject
   unto the old law, until Christ be born in you of a truth, where peace
   and joy in the truth do spring up. The patriarchs, greatly as they
   longed to see the advent of our Lord, yet had to wait five thousand
   years. But, verily, if you would thus humbly yield yourselves up, you
   need never wait a year. If you had had a quartan ague one year or two,
   you must bear it till you became well again; so you must bear the yoke
   of the old law.

   The second burden of the old law was its awful judgments, and stern
   display of God's justice. This is manifested in many ways--by
   afflictions and by the gnawings of conscience. Now some try to work
   themselves out of this by confession. But if you were to confess your
   sins a thousand times, it would avail you nothing, save indeed the
   confessing of mortal sin, accompanied by satisfaction for it. The rest
   leave humbly to God, and bear what He appoints unto you, till He of His
   mercy send you relief. But confess all to Him inwardly in your soul, to
   the very last tittle, with humble submission to His will, and
   acquiescing in His unknown judgments, without looking to yourself or to
   other men for help. Meanwhile there are some who endeavour to get rid
   of the burden of sin by asking counsel and hearing preachers, hoping to
   hear somewhat that may afford them a stay, and thus they may find
   deliverance. Behold, dear friend, if thou spend all thy years in
   running from church to church, thou must look for and receive help from
   within, or thou wilt never come to any good; however thou mayest seek
   and inquire, thou must also be willing to be tormented without succour
   from the outward help of any creature. I tell you, children, that the
   very holiest man I ever saw in outward conduct and inward life, had
   never heard more than five sermons in all his days. When he saw and
   perceived how the matter stood, he thought that was enough, and set to
   work to die to that to which he ought to die, and live to that to which
   he ought to live. Let the common people run about and hear all they
   can, that they may not fall into despair or unbelief; but know that all
   who would be God's, inwardly and outwardly, turn to themselves, and
   retire within. And know that if ever you desire to be spiritual and
   blessed men, you must cease from running outwards for help, and turn
   within; for you will never get what you want by a multitude of words,
   hear as many as you will; but only by loving and serving God from the
   bottom of your heart, and your neighbour as yourself, and leaving all
   things to stand on their own foundation. But pant after God with all
   your heart, as the holy patriarchs did, and covet that which you truly
   ought to covet, and leave all things, whether concerning yourself or
   any other creatures, to God's most blessed will.

   The third characteristic of the old law was that it had a dark hope of
   a distant redemption; for the gates were closed, and there was no
   prophet who could tell when the redemption might come to pass. So
   likewise must we simply commit ourselves to God with perfect trust in
   His eternal purpose; for when He pleases that it shall be accomplished
   to our waiting souls, then, no doubt, He will come to us, and be born
   in us. But when? Leave that to Him: to some He comes in their youth; to
   others in old age; to some in death: this leave to His Divine will, and
   do not take upon thyself to adopt any singular exercises, but keep the
   Commandments, and believe the articles of the Christian faith. Learn
   the Creed and the Commandments, and have patience, and give up thyself
   in all things according to the will of God, and assuredly Christ, the
   new law, will be born in thee with peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and
   thou wilt have a life like that of the angels, in freedom from the
   bonds of matter and in intelligence. This seems to thee a great thing!
   No; the truth is much greater. "The Spirit giveth life;"--a spark of
   His own Divine life, which is higher than all angelic life, and passes
   man's comprehension, lying beyond the sphere of sense and of reason.
   But this must come to pass in the way that I have told you, and no
   other. A man may, indeed, attain so far as to catch a glimpse of this
   glorious truth, and play upon the surface of it with his sense and
   reason; but to become and be such an one, to this none can attain but
   by this path of true self-surrender; but through that assuredly it will
   be found.

   In the Old Testament the Levites bare the ark, but here the holy ark
   bears us. Thus, whoso will not yield to God in His justice and His
   judgments, without doubt he shall fall under God's eternal justice and
   eternal condemnation; it cannot be otherwise. Turn it as thou wilt,
   thou must give thyself to suffer what is appointed thee. But if we did
   that, God would bear us up at all times in all our sorrows and
   troubles, and God would lay His shoulder under our burdens, and help us
   to bear them. For if with a cheerful courage we submitted ourselves to
   God, no suffering would be unbearable. For it is because now we are
   without God, and standing in our own weakness, that we are neither able
   to endure nor yet to act. God help us all worthily to bear His yoke!
   Amen.

Second Sermon for the Twelfth Sunday after Trinity

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   This sermon tells us how a man who truly loves God, whose ears have
   been opened to receive the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Spirit, is
   neither lifted up in joy nor cast down in sorrow.

   Mark vii. 37.--"He hath done all things well: He maketh both the deaf
   to hear and the dumb to speak."

   WE read in the Gospel for this day, that as our blessed Lord was going
   from one place to another, they brought unto Him a man who was born
   deaf and dumb; as must needs be; for he who is born deaf must also be
   dumb; for since he has never heard, he does not know what speech is.
   The Lord put His fingers into the ears of this deaf man, and touched
   his tongue with His spittle, and said, "Be opened." And when the people
   saw what was done, they came together and wondered at the miracle;
   saying: "He hath done all things well; He maketh both the deaf to hear
   and the dumb to speak."

   Children, it behoves us greatly to mark what it is that makes men deaf,
   like the man in the Gospel. From the time that the first man opened his
   ears to the voice of the Enemy, he became deaf thereby, and all we
   after him, so that we cannot hear or understand the sweet voice of the
   Eternal Word. Yet we know that the Eternal Word is still so unutterably
   nigh to us inwardly, in the very principle of our being, that not even
   man himself, his own nature, his own thoughts, nor aught that can be
   named, or said, or understood, is so nigh or planted so deep within
   him, as the Eternal Word is in man. And it is ever speaking in man; but
   he hears it not by reason of the sore deafness that has come upon him.
   Whose fault is this? I say that something has covered man's ears, and
   stopped them up that he may not hear this Word; and his sense is so
   benumbed that he has become dumb, not knowing his own self. If he
   desired to speak of what is within him, he could not; for he does not
   know how it stands with him, nor discern his own ways and works. The
   cause whereof is that the Enemy has whispered in his ear, and he has
   listened to the voice, and hence has he grown deaf and dumb. What is
   this most hurtful whispering of the Enemy? It is every disorderly image
   or suggestion that starts up in thy mind, whether belonging to thy
   creature likings and wishes, or the world and the things thereof;
   whether it be thy wealth, reputation, friends or relations, or thy own
   flesh, or whatever it be that lays hold of thy fancy, making thee to
   like or do somewhat. Through all these he has his access to thy soul;
   for he is ever at hand; and as he marks to what a man is inclined
   inwardly or outwardly, what he likes and dislikes, straightway he lays
   hold of it and attacks him with that weapon, and suggests what agrees
   with that man's inclination, and pours into the ears of his soul all
   manner of imaginations concerning that thing, that the man may not be
   able to hear the Eternal Word. If the man instantly turned his ears and
   mind away from the enemy, the assault would be easily repulsed, but as
   soon as he opens his ears so far as to dwell upon and dally with
   temptation, he is already well nigh conquered, and the strife is at the
   hardest. But as soon as thou hast bravely turned thy ear away, thou
   hast well nigh prevailed; for this enables thee to hear the inward
   voice of the Word, and takes away thy deafness. Not only worldly but
   also religious men are liable to this deafness, if they make the
   creature their idol and aim, and their hearts are possessed therewith.
   The Devil has marked this, and suggests to them the imaginations to
   which he finds them inclined. With some their ears are stopped up with
   their own inventions, and the daily routine of habit with which they go
   through certain outward acts, learnt by means of their senses from the
   creatures. All this dulls a man's hearing so that he cannot apprehend
   the Eternal Word speaking within him, nor in any wise understand what
   it says. It is true, however, that we ought to maintain the habit and
   practice of works of piety, though without a spirit of self-exaltation
   on account of them, such as prayer, or meditation, or the like, in
   order that our sluggish nature may be aroused into vigour, our minds
   raised on high, and our hearts allured and kindled. But there must be
   no claiming to ourselves thereof, but rather our ears must be left open
   to listen to the whispers of the Eternal Word. Let us not be as some
   obstinate men who never go forward, but to the day of their death
   remain standing on their outward customs, seeking for nothing further,
   and when God would say aught unto them, there is always something that
   gets into their ears, so that His Word cannot be heard. Children, at
   the last day, when all things come to be laid bare and open, it will be
   an everlasting sorrow to think of the endless variety of these things
   that have come between us and God, and how we have been entangled in
   mean bondage to our own ways and habits.

   Now the Word is spoken into no man's ear, except he have the love of
   God; for Christ says: "If ye love me, hear my words." On this point
   says St. Gregory: "Wilt thou know whether thou love God? take note when
   cares, troubles, or sorrows overtake thee (from within or from without,
   whencesoever they come), and weigh down thy spirit so that thou knowest
   not which way to turn, nor what is to become of thee, and canst find no
   counsel and art outwardly in a storm of affliction, in unwonted
   perplexity and sore distress; if thou then remainest inwardly at peace
   and unmoved in the bottom of thy heart, so that thou dost not in any
   wise falter, either by complaint, or in word, or work, or gesture, then
   there is no doubt that thou lovest God." For where there is true love,
   a man is neither out of measure lifted up by prosperity, nor cast down
   by mishap; whether you give or take away from him, so long as he keeps
   his beloved, he has a spring of inward peace. Thus, even though thy
   outward man grieve, or weep downright, that may well be borne, if only
   thy inner man remain at peace, perfectly content with the will of God.
   But if thou dost not find it thus with thee, then thou art in truth
   deaf, and hast not really heard the voice of the Eternal Word within
   thee.

   Further, thou mayest try by this test whether thou hast the right sort
   of love; namely, whether thou hast a lively thankfulness for the great
   benefits which God has bestowed upon thee and all His creatures in
   Heaven and on earth, and for His holy Incarnation, and for all the
   manifold gifts which are ever flowing out from Him to all men. And this
   thankfulness shall comprehend all men, even as it shall spring from
   love to all; whether they be clergy or laymen, monks, nuns, or in
   whatever condition of life they be, or whatever be their conduct, thou
   shalt cherish an honest, true love for them, not a concealed self-love,
   or self-seeking. This real, universal love is a source of measureless
   benefits. Know ye, children, that where men are true, glorified friends
   of God, their hearts melt with tenderness towards all mankind, living
   or dead; and if there were none such on the earth, the world were in an
   evil plight. Moreover, thou shalt let thy love shine forth before men,
   so far as in thee lies, imparting to them of thy substance, and giving
   them comfort, help, and counsel. It is true that thou must minister to
   thine own necessities; but when thou hast nothing to spare, thy love
   should be still lively, wishing that thou hadst aught to give, and
   ready to do to the utmost of thy power. These are the true signs of
   love and that a man is not spirtually deaf.

   Now when our Lord comes and puts his finger into a man's ear and
   touches his tongue, how eloquent will he become! O children, of this
   wondrous things might be said! But we will now consider the seven gifts
   of the Spirit, given to man through this touch whereby the ears of his
   mind are opened. First is given unto him the spirit of fear, which has
   power to rid him of all self-will, and teaches him to flee from
   temptation, and at all times to shun unruly appetites and licence. Next
   is given to him the spirit of charity, which makes him sweet-tempered,
   kind-hearted, merciful, nor ready to pass a harsh judgment on any one's
   conduct, but full of tolerance. Thirdly, he receives the gift of
   knowledge, so that he understands the meaning of his inward experience,
   and thus learns to guide himself according to the blessed will of God.
   The fourth gift is Divine strength: through this gift such Divine might
   is imparted unto him, that, with Paul, it becomes a small and easy
   matter to him to do or bear all things through God who strengtheneth
   him. The fifth is the gift of good counsel, which all those who follow
   become gentle and loving. Lastly, come two great gifts, understanding
   and the wisdom of insight, which are so sublime and glorious, that it
   is better to seek to experience them than to speak thereof. That our
   ears may thus be opened of a truth, that the Eternal Word may be heard
   in us, may God grant us! Amen!

Sermon for the Fifteenth Sunday after Trinity

   (From the Gospel for the day)

   This sermon forbiddeth all carefulness, and telleth in what
   righteousness consisteth, and rebukes sundry religious people and their
   works, likening their ways to simony.

   Matt. vi. 33.--"Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness,
   and all these things shall be added unto you."

   IN this passage, the Son of God gives us a similitude, bidding man, who
   is a reasonable creature, to look at the flowers that deck the face of
   the earth, and at the unreasoning fowls of the air, saying: "Consider
   the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, they spin not;
   and yet I say unto you that Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed
   like one of these!" "Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not,
   neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your Heavenly Father
   feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?" "Therefore I say unto
   you, take no thought, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we
   drink, or wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things
   do the Gentiles seek: for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
   need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His
   righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."

   Children, once before, the Son of God had said that no man could serve
   two masters, that is to say, God and Mammon, or the riches of this
   world; for he must love the one, and hate the other. It is indeed a
   wonder passing our understanding how much is comprehended in these
   words. We ought to set them up before our eyes as a mirror, and let
   them be our constant motto. How clearly does Christ here instruct us in
   the truth with plain unvarnished words and pertinent figures, when,
   forbidding us to be anxious about earthly and perishable things, he
   says: "Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
   stature? Therefore, ye of little faith, seek not what ye shall eat, or
   what ye shall drink; neither be ye of doubtful mind." Children, ye see
   well by this discourse how far we all are in common from living
   according to the simple truth of things, in all our earthly
   relationships. But know that there is an inward secret defect lurking
   under the cloak of our anxiety about daily things, a sinful, though
   unconscious covetousness, which is one of the seven deadly sins. And
   this sin, working silently and unperceived in the hearts both of
   worldly and religious people, is the cause of the greatest evils that
   afflict this earth. Let each, for instance, only mark narrowly, in
   himself and others, the marvels of labour and ingenuity invented and
   wrought on all sides, each striving to outdo his fellow for the sake of
   earthly gain. If we were to probe to the bottom the workings of this
   false principle in worldly and in religious people, it could hardly be
   told how deeply its roots have struck, and how widely they have spread
   below the surface. Think what it implies to have so little confidence
   in that God who is able to do all things, when ye are striving, and
   toiling, and wearing yourselves out with anxiety, as if you meant to
   live for ever. All this comes from that evil principle of covetousness.
   If one really looked into the matter, it were frightful to see how man
   seeks his own ends and not his neighbour's good, in all things Divine
   and human; his own pleasure, or profit, or glory, by all his words and
   works--nay, even gifts and services. Children, this great sin is so
   deeply rooted in many, that every corner of their heart is full of
   earthly, perishable things, and they are just like the crooked woman we
   read of in the Gospel, who was bent down to the earth by her infirmity,
   and could in no wise lift herself up, or raise her eyes above the
   ground.

   Thou poor blind man, spiritual in outward vesture but not in reality,
   why shouldst thou not trust that the God who has done thee so great a
   benefit in redeeming thee from the carking cares of this false, wicked
   world, that He is also willing to give thee such poor mean things as
   are needful for thy earthly sustenance? And is it not a pitiful thing
   that a religious man should spend his whole industry, and sole effort,
   and have his thoughts turned, day and night, upon his own little
   doings, and should be so full of them that he can hardly properly hold
   converse with God, or his own heart? And if what he has in hand
   succeeds, he feels no impulse urging him onwards towards eternal
   things, except in so far as it may be necessary to secure his own
   salvation, and from the delight that he may find in his own good works;
   and he is as much taken up with petty personal cares as worldly people
   are with weightier things. Wherefore our Lord says: Ye cannot serve two
   masters; ye cannot serve God and riches. But seek ye first the Kingdom
   of God, which is before all things and above all things, and His
   righteousness, and "all other things shall be added unto you." Just as
   if He had said, these are not worthy to be called a gift; but they
   shall be added over and above God's gifts. How greatly these vain,
   pitiful things are esteemed and loved and sought after, secretly and
   openly, and what anxiety they give rise to, and how eagerly men desire
   them, and heap up treasures by unlawful means, is not to be fully set
   forth, and I must not attempt it.

   St. Peter says: "Cast all your care upon God, for He careth for you."
   This carefulness concerning outward things works a man three great
   injuries. It blinds his reason and good sense; it quenches the fire of
   love, and destroys all its fervour and heat; and it blocks up the ways
   of secret access to God. It is like a noxious vapour, or thick smoke,
   that rises up and chokes a man's breath. This care is born of the sin
   and vice of covetousness. Therefore look well to your footsteps, and
   see with what ye hold converse while you are in this present state, and
   seek the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, that you may find and
   discover it where it lies hidden in the inmost depths of the soul, that
   it do not moulder away or remain unfruitful within you. But to this
   end, he who purposes manfully to withstand himself, the Devil, and the
   world, must sustain many bold, valiant conflicts, without rest or
   intermission. For the Kingdom of God will never be truly found except
   these faults be first cast off; and this is not the work of a day. For
   whatever a man shall take by force, he must first with great pains
   conquer; and thus he must make continual efforts before his outward man
   can be drawn away from the love of these perishable things. For this
   vice has struck its hidden roots so deeply into the animal nature of
   man, that he seeks himself in all things,--in his words and works, in
   his dealings with others, and in his friendships; nay, the miserable
   self-seeking of nature works in secret even as regards God, making men
   crave to enjoy, comfort, illumination, sweet emotions; in short, they
   are ever wishing to obtain something, and would fain hold converse with
   the world and yet possess the Kingdom of Heaven. But we ought to bear
   all things in the holy faith of Christ, and leave the reward to God.

   Do good works, and exercise thyself in all virtue, and God shall give
   thee a great reward, in so far as thou hast kept thyself from judging
   thy neighbour, and hast not preferred thyself before him, for that
   would ill become thee. Dear children, be on your guard against this
   subtle self-seeking of nature, that ye do not fulfil good works of
   piety for the sake of any earthly reward; for that has somewhat of the
   nature of simony, a sin which the holy Church abhors above all others,
   and which is especially contrary to God's righteousness; for God is by
   his nature the end of all things, and thou settest in His stead, as the
   end of thy works, an evil, mean, perishable thing. We should seek God's
   righteousness, but this is contrary to His righteousness; therefore,
   children, beware of this evil principle within you, and seek the
   Kingdom of God and His righteousness; that is to say, seek God alone,
   who is the true Kingdom for which we and all men daily pray when we say
   the Lord's Prayer. Children, the Lord's Prayer is a mighty prayer: ye
   know not what ye pray for in it. God is Himself the Kingdom, and in
   that Kingdom He reigns in all intelligent creatures. Therefore what we
   ask for is God Himself with all His riches. In that Kingdom does God
   become our Father, and manifests there His fatherly faithfulness and
   fatherly power. And insomuch as He finds place in us to work, is His
   name hallowed, and magnified, and made known. That His name should be
   hallowed in us, means that He should reign in us, and accomplish
   through us His rightful work. And thus is His will done here on earth
   as it is in heaven; that is, when it is done in us as it is in Himself,
   in the Heaven which He Himself is. Oh! how often does man give himself
   up in will to God, and take himself back again as quickly, and fall
   away from God! But now begin again, and give thyself to Him afresh;
   yield thyself captive to the Divine Will in rightful allegiance, and
   trust thyself to the power of thy Father, who has all power and might,
   and whose presence thou hast so often and so plainly felt, and art yet
   made to feel every day and hour. Trust Him wholly, and seek His
   righteousness. For therein is His righteousness shown, that He abideth
   ever with those who heartily seek Him, and make Him their end, and give
   themselves up to Him. In such He reigns, and all vain care falls away
   of itself in those who thus keep close to God in true self-surrender.

   Not that we should tempt God; for it is our duty to exercise a
   reasonable prudence in providing such things as are right, to the
   supply of our necessities and those of others, and profitable to
   ourselves and the community, and to see that everything be done in a
   discreet and seemly manner. But that which is your end when you sit and
   meditate in the church, should be likewise your end when you are busied
   in all the affairs of daily life; whether you work, or speak, or eat,
   or drink, waking and sleeping, do all to the glory of God, and not for
   thyself. For a noble man will make these perishing things of time a
   mere passage-way by which he will ascend through the creatures, not
   being held down by any selfish cleaving to them, up to his everlasting
   home, his eternal source from which he sprang at his creation.

   Now some may ask, how we can say that God forsakes none that trust Him,
   seeing that He often permits good men to suffer great poverty and
   affliction. This He does, as Bishop Albert says, for three causes: the
   first, that He may try them, and see whether they utterly believe and
   trust Him; thus God often suffers men to be brought into distress that
   he may teach them submission, and then succours them that they may
   perceive His hand and His friendship and help; in order that their love
   and gratitude may increase from that time forth, and they may draw
   closer to God and become dearer to Him. Or again, God will by these
   troubles shorten their purification hereafter; or again, He sends them
   distress for a judgment on those who might relieve them and do it not.
   Therefore, children, seek first the Kingdom of God, which is God
   Himself, and nought else. When this cleaving to the creature is
   altogether cast off, then will the will of God be done on earth as it
   is in heaven, and so shall the Father have the power and the glory for
   ever in heaven, that is, in His Sons. For when man stands thus, having
   no end, nor purpose, nor desire but God, then does he himself become
   God's Kingdom, and God reigns in him. And then does the Eternal King
   sit on His royal throne, and command and govern in man.

   This Kingdom is seated properly in the inmost recesses of the spirit.
   When, through all manner of exercises, the outward man has been
   converted into the inward, reasonable man, and thus the two, that is to
   say, the powers of the senses and the powers of the reason, are
   gathered up into the very centre of the man's being,--the unseen depths
   of his spirit, wherein lies the image of God,--and thus he flings
   himself into the Divine abyss, in which he dwelt eternally before he
   was created; then when God finds the man thus simply and nakedly turned
   towards Him, the Godhead bends down and descends into the depths of the
   pure, waiting soul, and transforms the created soul, drawing it up into
   the uncreated essence, so that the spirit becomes one with Him. Could
   such a man behold himself, he would see himself so noble that he would
   fancy himself God, and see himself a thousand times nobler than he is
   in himself, and would perceive all the thoughts and purposes, words and
   works, and have all the knowledge of all men that ever were.

   Now thou shouldest look into the bottom of thy heart, and see whether
   thou wouldest fain enter into this Kingdom, and partake of this high
   dignity. Then were all thy cares over and gone for ever! This is the
   Kingdom which we are told to seek first; and this is righteousness,
   that we should set God before us, the rightful end of all our purposes
   in all our doings, and trust in Him. For as we can never love God too
   well, so we can never trust Him too much, if it be but the right sort
   of trust, that casts all care upon Him, as Peter bids us do.

   Now St. Paul tells us, however, that we must be careful to keep the
   unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Children, that peace which is
   found in the spirit and the inner life is well worth our care, for in
   that peace lies the satisfaction of all our wants. In it the Kingdom of
   God is discovered and His righteousness is found. This peace a man
   should allow nothing to take from him, whatever betide, come weal or
   woe, honour or shame. But ever keep thy inward man in the bond of
   peace, which consists in the common love of all to all; and set before
   you the lovely example of our Lord Jesus Christ, and see how His love
   wrought, leading Him to endure greater sufferings than all the saints
   or all mankind ever endured. For He was all His life more utterly
   destitute of consolation than any man ever was, and ended it by the
   bitterest death that man ever died; and yet in His highest powers He
   was never less blessed than He is at this moment. Now those who are
   most truly followers of Him in emptiness of outward consolation, and in
   true poverty, inward and outward, having no refuge or stay, and in no
   wise clinging to the creature, or seeking themselves, these come to
   discover, in the truest and noblest sort, the Kingdom of God. And this
   is God's righteousness, that He will give us to find His Kingdom by
   treading in Christ's footsteps, in true self-surrender and willing
   poorness of spirit. That we may all so seek the Kingdom of God as truly
   to find it, may He help us. Amen.

Sermon for St. Stephen's Day

   Of three grades of those who learn to die unto themselves, like corn of
   wheat, that they may bring forth fruit; or of those who are beginners,
   those who are advancing, and those who are perfect in a Divine life.

   John xii. 24.--"Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
   abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."

   BY the corn of wheat we understand our Lord Jesus Christ, who by His
   death has brought forth much fruit for all men, if they are but willing
   not only to reign with Him, but also and in the first place desire to
   follow Him in a dying life. For this may be called a dying life, when a
   man for the love of God refuses to gratify his senses and take his
   natural pleasure, and follow his own will; and as many lusts as he dies
   to, so many deaths does he offer to God, and so many fruits of life
   will he receive in return. For in what measure a man dies to himself,
   and grows out of himself, in the same measure does God, who is our
   Life, enter into him.

   Now mark, dear children, that the path of a man thus dying may be
   divided into three stages. Those who have entered on the lowest stage,
   do acts of self-denial from fear of hell, and for the hope of heaven,
   with some love to God mingled therewith, which leads them to shun the
   most flagrant sins; but the love of God seldom works strongly in them,
   except it be stirred up by the contemplation of hell or heaven; for by
   reason of their blind self-love these men are terribly afraid of death,
   and by no means eager to set their hand to the work of mortifying their
   undisciplined nature, which shrinks therefrom; and they have little
   faith, which is the cause of this timorous weakness, that leads them to
   be ever fearing for their own safety: thus, just as formerly they
   sought and loved themselves in all kinds of carnal enjoyments and
   worldly vanities, and avoided bodily pain and inconvenience out of
   self-love, so now is the same motive at work leading them to shun sin
   on account of punishment, in order to escape hell, and obtain the
   rewards of heaven. And when they are still young in the love of God,
   they are apt to taste little sweetness in loving God, save when they
   hope to enjoy something from His love; as for instance, to escape hell
   and get to heaven; and if sometimes they meditate on the sufferings of
   our Lord, and weep over them with strong emotion, it is because they
   think how he was willing to suffer so much for their sakes, and to
   redeem them by his bitter death; still (because their love is small)
   they are much more inclined to dwell upon the bodily sufferings that He
   endured in His human nature, than to reflect how He manifested by His
   death the highest perfection of all virtue, as humility, love, and
   patience, and therein so greatly glorified His Heavenly Father. For
   this sort of persons set out and begin to die while as yet they love
   themselves far too well; hence they are not yet able to see truly what
   it is to resign themselves to God, and to maintain a spirit of
   submission; and although God does all things for the best, yet this
   they will never believe, and it is a perpetual stumbling-block to them.
   Thus, they often ask and wonder why our Lord chose to suffer so much,
   and why He leads His friends and followers to Himself along such a path
   of suffering. And when they are at the outset of a dying life, and only
   half-way inclined towards true perfectness, nor perceive as yet wherein
   this consists, they ofttimes torment themselves with watching and
   fasting, and an austere way of life; for whatever is outwardly painful
   to the flesh, they fancy to be greatly and mightily regarded and prized
   by God. So when they eagerly take upon themselves all the hardships
   they can, then they think they have reached the summit of perfection,
   and judge all other men, nay even those who are much more perfect than
   themselves, and think meanly of all who do not practise outward
   austerities, calling them low-minded and ignorant in spiritual things;
   and those who do not feel as they do, they think to have gone astray
   altogether from a spiritual course, and desire that all men should be
   as they are; and whatever methods of avoiding sin they have practised
   and still make use of by reason of their infirmity, they desire, nay,
   demand, that every one else should observe; and if any do not do so,
   they judge them, and murmur at them, and say that they pay no regard to
   religion. Now, while they thus keep themselves and all that belongs to
   them as it were working in their own service, and in this self-love
   unduly regard themselves as their own property, they cut themselves off
   from our Lord and from the universal charity. For they ought to cherish
   continually a general love toward all men, both good and bad; but they
   remain absorbed in their partial and separate affections, whereby they
   bring upon themselves much disquiet, and remain a prey to their
   besetting sin of always seeking and intending themselves. And they are
   very niggardly of their spiritual blessings towards their
   fellow-Christians; for they devote all their prayers and religious
   exercises to their own behoof; and if they pray or do any other kind
   act for others, they think it a great thing, and fancy they have done
   them a great service thereby. In short, as they look little within, and
   are little enlightened in the knowledge of themselves, so also they
   make little increase in the love of God and their neighbour; for they
   are so entangled with unregulated affections, that they live alone in
   heart, not thoroughly commingling their soul with any in the right sort
   of thorough love. For the love of God which ought to unite them to God
   and all mankind, is wanting in them; and although they appear to keep
   the ordinances of God and the Holy Church, they do not keep the law of
   love. What they do is more out of constraint and fear than from hearty
   love; and because they are inwardly unfaithful to God, they dare not
   trust him, for the imperfection which they find in themselves makes a
   flaw in their love to God. Hence their whole life is full of care, full
   of fear, full of toil and ignoble misery; for they see Eternal Life on
   the one side, and fear to lose it, and see hell on the other, and fear
   to fall into it; and all their prayers and religious exercises cannot
   chase away their fear of hell, so long as they do not die unto
   themselves. For the more they love themselves, and take counsel for
   their own welfare, the more the fear of hell grows upon them; insomuch
   that when God does not help them forward as much as they wish, they
   complain; and they weep and sigh at every little difficulty they
   encounter, however small, such as being tempted to vanity, wandering
   thoughts, and the like. They make long stories of what is of no
   consequence, and talk about their great difficulties and sufferings, as
   if they were grievously wronged; for they esteem their works, although
   small, to be highly meritorious, and that God Almighty owes them great
   honour and blessings in return. But our Lord will tell them (as He does
   in fact afterward, when He has enlightened them with His grace) a poor
   fool loves his own wooden stick, or any other little worthless article,
   as well as a rich and wise man does his sword or any other great and
   precious thing.

   All such are standing on the lowest steps of a dying life, and if they
   do not mortify themselves more, and come to experience more of what a
   dying life is, it is to be feared, that they will fall back from that
   little whereunto they have attained, and may plunge into depths of
   folly and wickedness, from which God keep us all! But before a man
   comes to such a fall, God gives him great spiritual delight; and upon
   this he is so greatly rejoiced that he cheerfully endures all sorts of
   austerities and penances, and then he weeneth that he hath arrived at
   perfection, and begins to judge his neighbours, and wants to shape all
   men after his own model, so greatly does he esteem himself in his own
   conceits. Then God comes in His mercy to teach him what he is, and
   shows him into what error he has fallen, and permits the Enemy to set
   before him and make him taste the sweetness of sin; and then, when he
   has thus tasted, he conceives an inclination to one sin after another,
   and he cannot rid himself of these inclinations. Then he wishes to flee
   sin that he may escape hell, and begins to do outward good works; and
   yet it is a dreadful toil to perform these good works as a mere labour,
   and to put himself to pain; thus he is brought into an agonizing
   struggle with himself, and does not know which way to turn; for he
   dimly sees that he has gone astray. Then must God of His mercy come and
   raise him up, and he shall cry earnestly to God for help, and his chief
   meditation shall be on the life and works and especially the sufferings
   of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   The second degree in which the corn of wheat dies, is when a man is
   called upon to endure insult, contempt, and such like deaths; and so
   long as his grace lasts he would fain continue to suffer, for by the
   sense of undeserved injury all his powers are but quickened and raised
   into a higher state of activity. But when he is bereft of this gracious
   sense of the Divine presence, forasmuch as he is still far from
   perfection, he cannot bear up under this spiritual destitution, and,
   through his infirmity, falls a prey to mistrust of God, and fancies
   that God has forgotten him, and is not willing to help him towards
   perfection. Often he is in a hundred minds what to do or not do, and if
   our Lord show him some kindness, then he feels as if all were well
   between his soul and God, and he feels himself so rich as if he could
   never more be poor, and thinks to enjoy the presence and favour of God
   (though as yet he is quite untried) just as if the Almighty were his
   own personal, special friend, and is ready to believe that our Lord is,
   so to speak, at his disposal, will comfort him in adversity, and enrich
   him with all virtue. But forasmuch as our gracious Lord sees that such
   a man will be very apt to rely upon his imagined powers, and thus to
   fall grievously, and sees also that the best and ripest fruit is being
   lost, inasmuch as the man has not yet attained to that perfection to
   which our Lord desires to lead him, therefore in due time He withdraws
   from him all that He had revealed to him, because the man was too much
   occupied with himself, with thinking about his own perfection, wisdom,
   holiness and virtues; He thus brings him through poverty to
   dissatisfaction with himself, and a humble acknowledgment that he has
   neither wisdom nor worthiness; then does he begin to reflect within
   himself how justly Almighty God has stayed His hand from bestowing any
   sensible tokens of His mercy, because he fancied that he was something;
   now he sees clearly that he is nothing. He was wont to care for his
   good name and honour in the world and to defend them as a man stands up
   for his wedded wife, and to count them who spoke evil of him as an
   enemy to the common good. He was wont to desire and thirst after the
   reputation of holiness, like a meadow after the dew of heaven. He
   weened that men's praises of him had proceeded altogether from real
   goodness and sympathy of heart and by God's ordination, and had
   wandered so far from self-knowledge as not to see that he was in
   himself unsound from head to foot; he fancied that he was really as he
   stood in man's opinion and knew nothing to the contrary.

   Here we must mark that he who wishes to heal himself of such like
   grievous mistakes, and subdue such an unmortified nature, must take
   note of three points in himself. First, how much he has striven to
   endure cheerfully, for the sake of goodness, all the rebuke, slander,
   and shame that has come upon him, patiently enduring it in his heart
   without outward complaint. Secondly, how much in the time of his
   rebuke, shame, and distress he has praised and glorified God and his
   fellow-men, and shown kindness to his neighbour in all ways, in spite
   of all contradiction against himself. Thirdly, let him examine himself
   whether he have loved with cheerful and willing heart the men or
   creatures who have thus persecuted him, and sincerely prayed for them;
   and if he finds that he has not done so, and is unwilling to do so, but
   is hard and bitter in his grief, then he may surely know and ought to
   feel certain that there is something false in him, and some resting in
   the praise of men and in his own spiritual pride, and that he is not
   dead. He has not yet come to the second step in a dying life.

   But our kind Lord, like a tender mother who is full of love, or a wise
   physician who desires to restore a sick man to perfect health by his
   powerful remedies, suffers him to fall many times, that he may learn to
   know himself, and thus he falls into fleshly, unspiritual temptations
   such as he never experienced in those past days, in which he fancied
   himself very good and spiritual-minded. Out of mercy God deprives him
   of all understanding, and overclouds all the light in which he walked
   aforetime, and so hedges him in with the thorns of an anguished
   conscience, that he thinks nothing else but that he is cast off from
   the light of God's countenance; and he moans greatly, and often with
   many tears exclaims: "O, my God, why hast Thou cast me off, and why go
   I thus mourning all the days of my pilgrimage?"

   And when he finds himself thus from the crown of his head to the sole
   of his foot unlike God, and at variance with Him, he is filled with the
   sense of his own unworthiness and with displeasure at himself, insomuch
   that he can hardly abide himself; and then he thinks many miserable
   things about himself from passages of Holy Scripture, and sheds many
   tears in the sense of his sinfulness, till he is weighed down to the
   earth with the pressure of God's hand, and exclaims with the Prophet:
   "My sins are more in number than the sands of the sea; they have taken
   hold upon me that I am not able to look up; for I have stirred up God's
   anger against me, and done much evil in His sight." These things he
   saith, and more of the like. And at times he is not even able thus to
   weep and lament and then he is still more tormented with tribulation
   and assaults; for on the one hand he feels a strong desire to cast
   himself down humbly and die to himself, and on the other he is
   conscious of great pride and arrogance about himself, till he is so
   exasperated at himself, that but for the dishonour to God he could fain
   kill himself. I believe that all such conflict greatly wears out the
   intellectual and natural powers, for it is so excessive, that one would
   rather suffer oneself to be put to death than endure it. Yet one grace
   is left him, namely, that he looks on it all as of no moment, whatever
   may be poured out over him, if only he may not knowingly offend God.
   After a while the grace of tears comes back to him, and he cries to God
   and says; "O Lord, arise! why sleepest thou?" and asks Him why He hath
   sealed up the fountains of His mercy. He calls upon the holy angels and
   blessed spirits to have pity on him. He asks the heavens why they have
   become as brass, and the earth wherefore she is as iron, and beseeches
   the very stones to have compassion on his woes. He exclaims: "Am I
   become as the blasted hill of Gilboa, which was cursed of David that no
   dew or rain should fall on it? And how should my wickedness alone
   vanquish the invincible God, and force Him to shut up His mercies whose
   property it is to have mercy and to help?"

   In the second stage of the dying life God leads the soul through these
   exercises and operations of His hand as through fire and water by
   turns, until the workings of self-sufficiency are driven out from all
   the secret corners of the spirit, and the man henceforward is so
   utterly ashamed of himself, and so casts himself off, that he can never
   more ascribe any greatness to himself, but thoroughly perceives all his
   own weakness, in which he now is and always has been; and whatever he
   does or desires to do, or whatever good thing may be said of him, he
   does not take it to his own credit, for he knows not how to say
   anything else of himself, but that he is full of all manner of
   infirmity. Then he has reached the end of this stage; and he who has
   arrived at this point is not far from the threshold of great mercies,
   by which he shall enter into the bride-chamber of Christ. Then when the
   day of his death shall come, he shall be brought in by the Bridegroom
   with great rejoicing.

   It is hard to die. We know that little trees do not strike their roots
   deep into the earth, and therefore they cannot stand long; so it is
   with all humble hearts, who do not take deep root in earth, but in
   heaven. But the great trees which have waxed high, and are intended to
   endure long upon the earth, these strike their roots deep, and spread
   them out wide into the soil. So it is with the men who in old times and
   now at this present have been great upon earth, they must needs through
   many a struggle and death, die unto themselves before all the
   self-sufficiency of their heart can be broken down, and they can be
   surely and firmly rooted for ever in humility. It does, however, happen
   sometimes that the Holy Spirit finds easier ways than those of which we
   have spoken, whereby He brings such souls to Himself.

   The third degree in which the corn of wheat dies belongs only to the
   perfect, who, with unflagging diligence and ceaseless desire, are ever
   striving to approach perfection. These men's state is one of mingled
   joy and sorrow, whereby they are tossed up and down; for the Holy
   Spirit is trying and sifting them, and preparing them for perfection,
   with two kinds of grief and two kinds of joy and happiness, which they
   have ever in their sight. The first grief is an inward pain and an
   overwhelming sorrow of heart, in the sense of the unspeakable wrong
   done to the Holy Trinity by all creatures, and specially by the bad
   Christians who are living in mortal sin. The second grief consists in
   their fellow-feeling for and experience of all the grief and pain which
   the human nature of Christ has undergone.

   The first of the two joys lies in this dying; it is a clear intuition
   and a perfect fruition to which they are raised in Christ by the power
   of the Holy Spirit, that they may enjoy the fruition of Him, and
   triumph in all the joys which they hope and believe after this life to
   behold in all their perfect fulness. The second triumph is that they
   are fulfilled in all the joys which the human nature of Christ
   possessed. This joy such a man hopes to share as a member of Christ;
   and even if he cannot fathom the abyss of God, he rejoices therein, for
   he sees that the overflowings of God's mercy are unspeakable, and feels
   that it is good for him that he is vanquished in the effort to
   comprehend God's power, and bends down beneath God in his self-dying.

   To this state a man cannot attain except he unite his will with God,
   with an entire renunciation and perfect denial of himself, and all
   selfish love of himself; and all delight in having his own will be
   over-mastered and quenched by the shedding abroad in his heart of the
   Holy Spirit in the love of God, so that it seem as though the Holy
   Spirit Himself were the man's will and love, and he were nothing and
   willed nothing on his own account. Yea, even the kingdom of heaven he
   shall desire for God's sake and God's glory, because Christ hath earned
   it in order to supply his needs, and chooseth to bestow it on him as
   one of His sons. When in this stage, a man loveth all things in their
   right order, God above all things,--next the blessed (human) nature of
   Christ, and after that the blessed Mother of Christ, and the saints of
   all degrees, each according to the rank which God hath enabled him to
   attain. When his affections are thus regulated, he sets himself in the
   lowest place at the wedding-feast of the Bridegroom. And when the
   Bridegroom comes who has bidden him to the feast, He saith unto him;
   "Friend go up higher." Then he is endowed with a new life, and
   illuminated with a new light, in the which he clearly perceives and
   sees, that he alone is the cause of his own evil, that he cannot, with
   truth, throw the blame either on nature, the world, or the devil. Yea,
   he confesses that God has appointed him all these exercises and
   assaults out of His great love, in order that he may glorify God in
   overcoming these, and deserve a higher crown. Further, he perceives and
   sees, that it is God alone who has upheld him, and stayed his steps, so
   that he has no longer an inclination to sin, and who has removed the
   occasion to sin that he might not fall. Yea what is still worse, he is
   forced to confess that he has often been dissatisfied that he was not
   able to derive more enjoyment from his sins. Thus all his being is
   swallowed up in sorrow and remorse for that he is still laden with his
   boundless infirmity.

   But he hath delight and joy in that he seeth that the goodness of God
   is as great as his necessities, so that his life may well be called a
   dying life by reason of such his griefs and joys which are conformable
   and like unto the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, which from beginning
   to end was always made up of mingled grief and joy. Grief, in that He
   left His heavenly throne and came down into this world; joy, in that He
   was not severed from the glory and honour of the Father. Grief, in that
   He was a Son of Man; joy, in that He nevertheless was and remained the
   Son of God. Grief, because He took upon Him the office of a servant;
   joy, in that He was nevertheless a great Lord. Grief, because in human
   nature He was mortal, and died upon the cross; joy, because He was
   immortal according to His Godhead. Grief, in His birth, in that He was
   once born of His mother; joy, in that He is the only-begotten of God's
   heart from everlasting to everlasting. Grief, because He became in Time
   subject to Time; joy, because He was Eternal before all Time, and shall
   be so for ever. Grief, in that the Word was born into the flesh, and
   hath dwelt in us; joy, in that the Word was in the beginning with God,
   and God Himself was the Word. Grief, in that it behoved Him to be
   baptized like any human sinner by St. John the Baptist in the Jordan;
   joy, in that the voice of His Heavenly Father said of Him: "This is my
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Grief, in that like others,
   sinners, He was tempted of the Enemy; joy, in that the angels came and
   ministered unto Him. Grief, in that He ofttimes endured hunger and
   thirst; joy, because He is Himself the food of men and angels. Grief,
   in that He was often wearied with His labours; joy, because He is the
   rest of all loving hearts and blessed spirits. Grief, forasmuch as His
   holy life and sufferings should remain in vain for so many human
   beings; joy, because He should thereby save His friends. Grief, in that
   He must needs ask to drink water of the heathen woman at the well; joy,
   in that He gave to that same woman to drink of living water, so that
   she should never thirst again. Grief, in that He was wont to sail in
   ships over the sea; joy, because He was wont to walk dry-shod upon the
   waves. Grief, in that He wept with Martha and Mary over Lazarus; joy,
   in that He raised their brother Lazarus from the dead. Grief, in that
   He was nailed to the cross with nails; joy, in that He promised
   paradise to the thief by His side. Grief in that He thirsted when
   hanging on the cross; joy, in that He should thereby redeem His elect
   from eternal thirst. Grief, when He said, "My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me?" joy, in that He would with these words comfort all
   sad hearts. Grief, in that His soul was parted from His body, and He
   died and was buried; joy, because on the third day He rose again from
   the dead with a glorified body.

   Thus was all His life, from the manger to the cross, a mingled web of
   grief and joy. Which life He hath left as a sacred testament to His
   followers in this present time, who are converted unto His dying life,
   that they may remember Him when they drink of His cup, and walk as He
   hath walked! May God help us so to do! Amen.

Sermon for St. Peter's Day

   Of brotherly rebuke and admonition, how far it is advisable and seemly
   or not, and especially how prelates and governors ought to demean
   themselves toward their subjects.

   2 Tim. iv. 2.--"Reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and
   doctrine."

   THIS is the lesson which St. Paul gives to his beloved disciple
   Timothy, whom he set to rule over men, and it equally behoves all
   pastors of souls and magistrates, to possess these two
   things,--long-suffering and doctrine.

   First, it is their office to rebuke all open sinners, whom they may
   possibly bring to a better way, and especially those over whom they are
   set in authority, that they may reveal the truth unto them, for this is
   needful, and in many places Scripture doth tell us how we ought to
   teach, rebuke, and exhort those who are committed to our charge, each
   according to the office which he holds, as St. Gregory has sufficiently
   shown and set forth in his Pastoral, wherefore we will refrain for the
   present from saying more on that point.

   But we will rather turn to the second point, which is more spiritual,
   teaching a man to look within and judge himself, seeing that he who
   desires to become a spiritual man must not be ever taking note of
   others, and above all of their sins, lest he fall into wrath and
   bitterness, and a judging spirit towards his neighbours. O children,
   this works such great mischief in a man's soul, as it is miserable to
   think of; wherefore, as you love God, shun this evil temper, and turn
   your eyes full upon yourselves, and see if you cannot discover the same
   fault in yourselves, either in times past or now-a-days. And if you
   find it, remember how that it is God's appointing that you should now
   behold this sin in another in order that you may be brought to
   acknowledge and repent of it; and amend your ways and pray for your
   brother that God may grant him repentance and amendment, according to
   His Divine will. Thus a good heart draws amendment from the sins of
   others, and is guarded from all harsh judgment and wrath, and preserves
   an even temper, while an evil heart puts the worst interpretation on
   all that it sees and turns it to its own hurt. Thus is a good man able
   to maintain inviolate a due love and loyalty towards his fellow-man.
   Further, this generous love makes him hold others innocent in his
   heart: even when he sees infirmity or fault in his neighbour, he
   reflects that very likely all is not as it seems on the outside, but
   the act may have been done with a good intention; or else he thinks
   that God may have permitted it to take place for an admonition and
   lesson to himself; or again, as an opportunity for him to exercise
   self-control and to learn to die unto himself, by the patient endurance
   of and forbearance towards the faults of his neighbours, even as God
   has often borne many wrongs from him, and had patience with his sins.
   And this would often tend more to his neighbour's improvement than all
   the efforts he could make for it in the way of reproofs or
   chastisements, even if they were done in love (though indeed we often
   imagine that our reproofs are given in love when it is in truth far
   otherwise). For I tell thee, dear child, if thou couldst conquer
   thyself by long-suffering and gentleness and the pureness of thy heart,
   thou wouldst have vanquished all thine enemies. It would be better for
   thee than if thou hadst won the hearts of all the world by thy writings
   and wisdom, and hadst miserably destroyed thine own soul bypassing
   judgment on thy neighbours; for the Lord says: "And why beholdest thou
   the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considereth not the beam
   that is in thine own eye?"

   In thus speaking, I except those who are bound by their office in the
   holy Christian Church to rebuke others. Let them wisely beware how they
   reprove, and for what causes, so that they rebuke none with an
   irritable demeanour, or with harsh and angry words, from which much
   trouble and toil do spring, for that they have no right to do, but it
   is permitted to them to reprove those who are under them for their own
   amendment. But alas! it happens for the most part now-a-days that those
   who occupy the highest places do often and greatly forget themselves in
   these respects, and hence their rebukes do not produce any amendment,
   but only anger and alienation of heart. For if they were to instruct
   those who are under their care in the fear of God, in such wise that
   the people could mark and be sure that it was done solely for the
   saving of their souls, they would be much the more ready to set
   themselves to amend, and would be content,--but now, alas! they see
   that their superiors are only seeking their own glory and profit, and
   taking upon themselves wrongfully to keep them down and defraud them of
   their just rights, and therefore reproof only makes them the more
   refractory and indignant. And there are many in authority who do really
   believe that they rebuke those under them from a reverence for
   righteousness, and yet are doing it from a wrathful, domineering, and
   arrogant spirit; and what they think they are doing from hatred to sin,
   they are doing from hatred to men.

   But I beseech you examine yourselves, whether you do in truth love
   those whom you are punishing so bitterly out of reverence and zeal for
   righteousness as you suppose. For when we see men punishing and
   oppressing with such vehemence those who are under them, or treating
   them so harshly with sharp words and sour looks, it is to be feared
   that there is more reproof given out of crabbed impatience, than for
   the sake of righteousness from the true ground of charity and kindness,
   especially by those who have not yet experienced the inward joy of
   hearty sweetness and godly love: for the soul that has not yet
   experienced inward love and divine sweetness does not know how to hold
   a discreet mien and just language in rebuking; but genuine love teaches
   us how we ought to treat those who are worthy of punishment.

   Now let him who has to punish in virtue of his office first take
   account of God's dishonour and the injury done to the souls of his
   flock, and then rebuke with sweet, loving words and patient demeanour
   and gestures, so that the weak shall be able to mark that he is seeking
   and purposing their welfare alone and nothing else. And if in the
   dispensations of God's Providence it should happen that those who are
   subject should at times rise up and offend by license and presumptuous
   irreverence against their superiors, the latter ought not in any wise
   to regard or revenge it, so far as that may be, without scandal to the
   rest of their subjects; for if they revenge themselves they fall under
   suspicion of selfish motives, and it is likely that God will not be
   able to work any fruit through them; but they must rather treat such
   offenders with more patience, kinder words and acts, than they do
   others. For this is commonly the greatest temptation which befalls
   those in authority, by which they for the most either win or lose the
   greatest reward of their labours; wherefore they should ever be on
   their guard, for gentleness and a readiness to forgive injuries is the
   best virtue that a ruler can possess.

   They shall show no partiality in their affections, neither for their
   own glory nor yet towards particular persons, but they shall embrace
   all their flock in the arms of a common love, as a mother does her
   children. To the weak they should ever show the greatest love and care,
   and without ceasing lift up their hearts unto God in prayer, earnestly
   beseeching Him to guard and defend the people committed to their
   charge, and not indulging in any self-glorification. Likewise, so far
   as it rests with them, let them be the first to do such works as they
   would wish to see their people do: for so it stands, that, with the
   help of God, all may be accomplished to a good end, when those in
   authority are inclined to virtue, for then their subjects must needs
   follow as they lead, even though they may have been beforehand inclined
   to all evil and vice, and hostile to their superiors.

   But for those who have received no commission to govern other men, but
   stand in a private character without office, it is needful that they
   secretly judge themselves inwardly, and beware of judging all things
   without, for in such judgments we do commonly err, and the true
   position of things is generally very far otherwise from that which it
   appears to us, as we often come to discover afterwards. On this point
   remember the proverb: "He is a wise man who can turn all things to the
   best."

   May God help us so to do! Amen.

  XXVII

Sermon on a Martyr's Day

   Of three sorts of spiritual temptation by which holy men are secretly
   assailed; to wit: spiritual unchastity, covetousness, and pride.

   James i. 12.--"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he
   is tried he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
   promised to them that love Him.

   ALL our life (says Job), so long as we are upon earth, is full of
   struggle and temptation, insomuch that this life is not called a life
   by the Saints, but a temptation. When one temptation is over,
   straightway others are awaiting us, and the cause is that our Lord will
   have us to go and bring forth fruit; and the fruit is to walk in the
   ways of God and go forward; for the fruit consists in the very
   overcoming of temptation, from which we may draw out a hidden spiritual
   sweetness, as the bees suck honey from the thorn-bushes as well as from
   all other flowers. He who has not been tempted, knows nothing, nor
   lives as yet, say the wise man Solomon, and the holy teacher St.
   Bernard. We find more than a thousand testimonies in Scripture to the
   great profit of temptation; for it is the special sign of the love of
   God towards a man for him to be tempted and yet kept from falling; for
   thus he must and shall of a certainty receive the crown, like the
   martyr whose death the Christian Church commemorates this day, singing
   of him that he is blessed because he hath endured temptation, and has
   been tried and proved therein, that he might receive the crown of life
   which the Lord has promised to them that love him.

   Now observe, dear children, that there are two kinds of temptation. The
   one is carnal, and has its sphere in the kingdom of sense in this
   present life, as when a man is tempted through his outward senses to
   seek his happiness in other men, be they friends or relations, or any
   others, or to undue fondness for the outward show of life, such as
   dress, jewels, books, instruments, a pleasant abode, and other
   transitory creatures, and wilfully cleaves thereunto with manifold
   affections, and they stick to him like burrs. At times our outward
   senses are left in peace, and are quit of assaults, yet is the man
   strangely assaulted inwardly in his flesh and blood by unseemly
   thoughts; but, however impure may be these temptations, and however
   horrible they may look, they cannot of themselves defile a man's
   purity. St. Gregory says: "Temptations do not defile a man except
   through his own slackness and want of diligence in turning aside from
   them."

   The other sort of temptation is inward and spiritual, and has its seat
   in the realm of the intellect. The workings of the Spirit and of Nature
   are so mingled together and interwoven as long as we are in this
   present life, that all our inward exercises and converse with God are
   carried on at the same time with all the motions and workings of
   nature. Moreover, our Lord has so ordained it for our good, that the
   Evil Angel, Satan, has power to transform himself before the inward eye
   of the mind into an Angel of Light; and he does it most of all at those
   times when a man gathers up all his powers to enter into communion with
   God. Observe, dear children, that St. John divides sin into three
   kinds, when he says, all that is of the world is "the lust of the
   flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." As these three
   sins that reign in the world exist together in the flesh, so do they
   also reign inwardly in the mind, under a spiritual guise. Outward sins
   are very clear and easy to see, if a man have a mind to watch himself;
   but these mental sins are in many ways more covert, and can put on such
   a good face, that we are often hardly aware of the grievous fall that
   is close at hand.

   Now mark: it is to be counted as spiritual unchastity or wantonness,
   when a man seeks himself too much, and with eager desire strives after
   warmth and sensible devoutness, to the end that he may always be in a
   state of contentment, and none may have a right to reprove him, though
   he should give himself to his own special prayers and religious
   exercises, while leaving unfulfilled the work that is his duty. When
   such an one has none of these sweet emotions, he is quite troubled and
   becomes peevish and very impatient in the trifling mishaps that befall
   him, though they are really of no importance whatever; and when he
   cannot enjoy or obtain inward peace according to his desire, he
   complains of the great grievances and temptations which he has to
   endure. St. Bernard says that our Lord bestows these graces of sensible
   emotion upon such as have done nothing to deserve them nor are worthy
   of them, but He does this in mercy, that He may draw such to His love;
   and He withholds these gifts from some who have undergone long and
   painful exercises, and were well fit to receive them; yea from some He
   withholds them all their life long, but He will give them a great
   recompense for it in the next life. The reason of His thus withholding
   sensible delight is that our spiritual fruitfulness and highest
   blessedness do not lie therein, but in our inward trusting and clinging
   to God, in our not seeking ourselves either in sorrow or joy, but
   through joy and sorrow devoting ourselves to God, and like poor
   unworthy servants offering ourselves to Him at our own costs, though we
   should have to serve him thus for ever. Yet it may indeed be permitted
   to a young, weak Christian, at the outset of his course, to pray for
   such graces or gifts from our good God, in order to be able to glorify
   Him with the greater activity, and to be grounded the more firmly in
   His love. But when we desire such inward fervours and sweet peace
   (which are His gifts and not our deserts) more for their own sakes than
   the Giver Himself, we fall into spiritual wantonness and black
   disloyalty, which our good Lord has not deserved at our hands with His
   utter renunciation of Himself outwardly and inwardly.

   Spiritual covetousness is when a man is always coveting to have more
   than bare necessaries while pursuing this earthly pilgrimage. For what
   more should a pilgrim take with him by the way than such things as are
   needful to sustain him till he come safely to his home? Believe me, it
   is a great blemish in true outward poverty to desire aught beyond
   necessaries; so likewise it is a still greater blemish in the inward
   poverty of the spirit. Ah, who has ever been so poor as He, who, in
   utter poorness of spirit, stood forsaken by Heaven and by the
   creatures, cast out alone in utter exile, when He sent forth that
   bitter cry: "My God, my God! why hast Thou forsaken me?" And this was
   all that He might be an ensample unto us, to comfort our poverty and
   bereavement by teaching us true submission. I hear thee saying: "Yes;
   if it were not my own fault, and if I had not failed to receive the
   blessing through my own heedlessness, or thrown it away by my own
   guilty folly, I could bear it all the better; what should I then have
   to mourn over? But now it is all my own doing: I have brought the
   mischief upon myself." I answer: Do not let this lead thee astray; dost
   thou not know how that it is written: "The just man falleth seven
   times, and riseth up again;" and dost thou think to stand always? Yes;
   I assert and confess with thee, that it is thine own fault, that thou
   hast brought it upon thyself, and well deserved it; yet, nevertheless,
   it is better that thou shouldst, with firm trust, pray our kind God for
   His grace (who knows thy weakness, and is ready to forgive thy
   trespasses seventy and seven times in a day), than that thou shouldst
   thus drive thyself back in thy course with such faint-heartedness. O
   child, hast thou fallen? arise, and go, with childlike trust, to thy
   Father, like the prodigal son, and humbly say, with heart and mouth:
   "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more
   worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants." And
   what will thy Heavenly Father do but what that father did in the
   parable? Assuredly He will not change His essence, which is love, for
   the sake of thy misdoings. Is it not His own precious treasure, and a
   small thing with Him to forgive thee thy trespasses, if thou believe in
   Him? for His hand is not shortened that it cannot make thee fit to be
   saved. Therefore, beware of spiritual covetousness; for the poorer thou
   art in thine own eyes when thou comest to Him, the more acceptable art
   thou in His sight, and the more richly He will endow thee and clothe
   thee out of His treasures.

   Spiritual pride is when a man is not willing to be put to shame in his
   own eyes on account of his transgressions, but is ever trying to excuse
   and gloss over his faults, and is never willing to abase himself, even
   in small matters. And this often leads people to make many useless and
   wrong speeches in order to excuse themselves and to justify themselves
   in every respect; as much as to say, I am not the man to be accused of
   this and that; and they are unwilling to remember, or consider, that he
   who cannot clear himself with the simple truth will not be helped by
   the untruths by which he often adds to his guilt; and that a man who
   humbles himself before God is more in his eyes than an arrogant,
   self-righteous man, who deems himself able to answer for all his deeds
   with his own righteousness. Hearken, dear child; what does all our
   righteousness come to at last? Isaiah says: "All our righteousnesses
   are as filthy rags;" and however great our righteousness is, or might
   become, yet, if the Lord should sit in judgment on us, without doubt we
   should have to confess ourselves His debtors, and place all our hope in
   His mercy. The Lord often disciplines a man by his own failings, if he
   is humble under them and throws himself at God's feet; for God will
   have every knee to bend before Him, and will have the praise and glory
   of all goodness. Hence we may observe that there is often a secret
   pride within us from which many unseemly fruits do grow. But he who
   gives diligence to beware of spiritual wantonness, covetousness and
   pride, shall be kept from straying out of God's ways, or falling into
   error in his inward exercises.

   But in order to keep yourselves from these sins, and withstand this
   kind of temptation, you must observe three rules which I will tell you.
   The first is: none of the inward difficulties that rise up from within,
   or the adverse circumstances that stay our hands from working, by which
   we are drawn or pressed into likeness and conformity to the humble
   image of Christ and His saints (not alone outwardly, but that of their
   inward condition), can be the work either of evil spirits or of nature,
   but without a doubt come from God. For He is the Highest Good, and from
   the Highest Good nought but what is good can flow; and all the goodness
   that God gives us of His stores, and that we render back again to Him,
   has proceeded from Him as its source; just as all streams flow back
   again to their source, the Ocean whence they have arisen, and all
   things do rejoice in their return. But all that draws us and leads us
   aside from such conformity and likeness proceeds without doubt from the
   Spirit of Evil, who is ever on the watch to disturb and draw us down,
   as our Lord said: "He who is not with me is against me, and he who
   gathereth not with me, scattereth." This rule is against the first
   spiritual vice, that of wantonness.

   The second rule is: Whatever befalls a man inwardly, whereby he is
   brought to a closer and more sensible gathering up of all his
   affections and impulses, in singleness of heart, into a steadfast trust
   in and love of the Father's loving-kindness and not his own works and
   experiences, this is from God. And he who at all times sees himself to
   be a poor beggar, however fair his works may seem, the more narrowly he
   looks into his own heart, and the more mastery he gains over himself,
   the more does he discover his own nakedness of all virtue. He becomes
   aware in himself that he is nothing but an empty, worthless vessel,
   fitted not unto honour but unto eternal destruction, which vessel God
   alone must and will fill with His grace. When we cling to Him, suffer
   Him to have access to our spirits, and do not defend ourselves with
   ourselves, that work is no doubt of God, by which a man is driven into
   himself to learn his own poverty. But the suggestions of the Enemy and
   of nature rob and despoil a man of all the benefits of his virtues; and
   this is the case whenever a man does not know his own real state, and
   thinks to possess what he never had, and says (as it is written): "I am
   rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing," and knows
   not that he is wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.
   This is the rule against spiritual covetousness.

   The third rule is: Whatever befalls a man by which he is lessened and
   humbled in his own inmost emotions, and which makes him bend under the
   Almighty Hand of God, under all creatures, abasing and annihilating
   himself in true humility, this comes no doubt from God. For as Lucifer
   and his followers desired to be great and lofty, and were therefore
   thrust down from heaven, so are we led back again to heaven by
   self-abasement, as it was said of the Kings of the East that they
   travelled back into their own land again by another way.

   Thus does every being do and teach according to that which is his
   essence, drawing into his own likeness all whom there are to draw, as
   far as in him lies. The Evil Spirit is puffed up in his own obstinate
   conceit, and in the loftiness of his pride is so hardened and unbending
   in his own stiff-necked will and purpose, that neither to win heaven
   nor for anything else, will he humble himself for one moment, so fixed
   is he in his evil mind. So likewise is it with all the proud who have
   learnt of him to trust in their own understandings above all other
   men's opinion and reason; wherefore they fall into strife and variance
   with their neighbours, which begets much trouble and disquiet of heart,
   and hence arise many breaches of brotherly love. They will take reproof
   from none, and grow so hardened in their own obstinate evil will, and
   set upon their purposes, that they rashly dare to withstand all the
   admonitions of God and His friends, as the Jewish scribes and priests
   withstood our blessed Lord; and of such the prophet Isaiah, speaking in
   the person of Christ, complains: "I have spread out my hands all the
   day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good,
   after their own thoughts."

   But our blessed Lord, on the contrary, is meek and humble, yea, He is
   himself the essence of humility, whereunto He is unceasingly drawing
   all men whom there are to draw, and who are willing to be drawn. His
   Being is the cause, the essence, and the origin of all things. He is
   the life of the living, the resurrection of the dead, the restorer of
   all deformity and unfitness, and of those who have corrupted and
   despoiled themselves through sin. He calleth back those who have fallen
   away and wandered from His fold. He raiseth up and confirmeth those who
   are in temptation. He is the bulwark of those who stand, the awakener
   and guide of all who are looking and striving upwards towards Him, the
   source of all light, the lamp of all who walk in light, the revealer of
   mysteries, in so far as it is fitting for us to know, and the beginning
   of all beginnings. His Essence is incomprehensible, unspeakable, and
   without a name. Therefore should we honour and glorify His unspeakable
   mystery with holy reverence and silence, and nevermore covet to fathom
   or to taste aught except in so far as is to His honour and to our
   profit, but ever with fit reverence and devoutness turn with all our
   might in shamefaced awe to contemplate the radiance of His bright and
   spotless mirror. It behoves man to be ever in fear and to bethink him
   of the word that God, our Lord, spake by the mouth of Moses: "If a man
   or a beast touch the mountain, he shall be stoned;" which signifies
   that our animal senses must not presume to climb the Mount of the
   Divine Essence, but must rather keep themselves below and take the
   meanest place, until the time come when it shall be said unto man:
   "Friend, come up higher." And then he shall not go up of himself, but
   he shall suffer himself to be led upwards, and his sensual nature shall
   be purified and endowed with the light of God, whereby he shall receive
   more light than he could ever win by all his great and strenuous
   labour. For the Divine Nature of Christ is a magnet that draws unto
   itself all spirits and hearts that bear its likeness, and daily unites
   them to itself through love.

   Now Richardus says: "I receive Christ not alone on the cross, but also
   in His transfiguration on Mount Tabor. But I may not receive Him there
   except I find James, Peter and John, Moses and Elias with Him, who bear
   witness to me that it is truly Christ." That is to say: in all our
   distresses, in all our painful inward destitution, we may boldly
   believe that Christ is present with us; but if He appears to us on the
   Mount of inward Contemplation, we need these witnesses that we may not
   enjoy the fruition of His gifts in a wanton spirit for the satisfaction
   of our own desires, nor too ardently covet more of His good gifts than
   we can put to a good use; but may ever abase ourselves so thoroughly
   that we fall not into any spiritual pride. These are the true witnesses
   that we may freely receive Christ in His glory on the heights of Mount
   Tabor without hindrance or error, for where these witnesses are of a
   truth, there we cannot be deceived by the Spirit of Falsehood. May
   Almighty God help us so to do! Amen.
