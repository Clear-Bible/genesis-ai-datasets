PREFACE.

   THE following devotions have already appeared in the Catholic Manual,
   edited by Ambrose Lisle Phillipps, Esq., of Grace Dieu Manor,
   Leicestershire. They are now published in the present form with the
   hope that they may make their way to, and be made use of by, those who
   have not the means of procuring that valuable work.

   It is unnecessary to speak here of the beauty of these devotions: a
   glance at them is sufficient to show that they are the outpourings of
   one whose very life was to dwell with Christ, and to hold communion
   with Him, and who consequently felt the most tender and affectionate
   love for His most Holy Mother.

   No Catholic need be told that it is ordinarily impossible to love our
   Blessed Saviour as we ought, without at the same time having a most
   intense devotion to the Blessed Virgin. The one naturally flows from
   the other, and the more we meditate upon the Mystery of the
   Incarnation, the more we dwell on and fix in our minds the great
   doctrine that God became man for us the more we shall see and feel,
   that no words, no language can adequately express the exceeding dignity
   to which the Blessed Virgin has been raised as Mother of God, the more
   shall we perceive the claim She has upon our veneration and love, and
   become convinced that no consequences are too great to follow from that
   most wonderful and incomprehensible mystery.

   This thought, as will be seen, is very remarkably brought out in the
   following devotions; and though the most ardent and rapturous
   expressions are used towards our Blessed Lady, as if the author were at
   a loss to find words at all adequate to express his ideas of what She
   really is, and of what ought to be a Christian's love and affection
   towards Her, as if he went out of himself and were lost in the
   contemplation of Her amazing dignity and position in the Church of God;
   yet in his addresses to our Blessed Redeemer we feel at once that he is
   no longer speaking to a creature, but to the Creator Himself, the
   source of all grace, before whose infinite holiness and perfections
   even the graces and gifts of the Blessed Virgin Herself fade away and
   are lost as a drop in the ocean.

   With Mary he is most affectionate, most tender, most loving, as a child
   with its mother.

   With Jesus he is loving, and tender, and affectionate, but his love,
   and tenderness, and affection, are mingled with awe, and reverence, and
   the fear of God; he is full of confidence indeed, and is open and
   unreserved, but still he speaks as a subject to his Sovereign, as a
   servant to his Master, as a creature to its Creator.

   The end which the translator of these devotions has in view in offering
   them to the faithful in their present form will be answered, if they
   tend in any way to increase amongst them a like spirit to that which
   animated the Venerable Blosius in their devotion to our Divine
   Redeemer, and his most Blessed Mother.

   May they assist in exciting a holy familiarity with Jesus. and Mary may
   they suggest thoughts and expressions of that tender and childlike
   love, that intimate intercourse, which the Catholic ought to entertain
   as the child of Jesus and Mary. May they help in their measure to
   increase amongst us that devotion to the most Holy Sacrament and to the
   Blessed Virgin, which is so special a feature in those countries where
   persecution has never forced the faithful to restrain themselves from
   giving the most full outward expression to feelings which animate and
   are the life of every Catholic soul.

   Priest of the Oratory.

BLESSED SAVIOUR

    IN THE

MOST HOLY SACRAMENT.

ADORATION OF THE MOST HOLY TRINITY.

   THEE, O Father unbegotten, Thee, O only-begotten San, Thee, O Holy
   Ghost, the Comforter, One, Almighty, Everlasting and Unchangeable God,
   Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible, I
   suppliantly adore. I confess that Thou art truly, and in an unspeakable
   manner, Three in person, and truly one in substance. I praise Thee, O
   Blessed Trinity, ever at rest in Thy glorious light, One Godhead, most
   merciful Lord, sweetest hope, most cherished light, rest deeply yearned
   after, joy, life, all and every good. I commend both my soul and body
   to Thy most tender care. I give up my whole self to Thy most sacred
   Majesty. I give and bind myself over wholly to Thy will. To Thee be
   honour and glory. Amen.

   O Heavenly Father, O Father of Mercies, my Lord and my God, have mercy
   upon me a most worthless sinner, have mercy upon all men. In full
   amendment, and expiation, and satisfaction for all mine iniquities and
   negligences, and for the sins of the whole world, and to make up in the
   most perfect manner for all the good works and merits in which I am
   wanting, I offer unto Thee Thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, in union with
   that excessive love which caused Thee to send Him to us as our Saviour.
   I offer unto Thee His most Holy Incarnation, Life, Passion, and Death.
   I offer Thee His most wonderful virtues, and whatsoever He did and
   suffered for our sakes. I offer Thee His labours, His travails, His
   torments, and precious blood. I offer Thee the merits of the most
   Blessed Virgin Mary and all the Saints. Keep me, I beseech Thee, O most
   merciful Father, by this Thy Son, in the power of the Holy Ghost. Be
   present with all miserable sinners, and of Thy mercy bring them back
   into the way of salvation. Grant unto all the living, pardon and grace,
   and to the faithful departed, rest and everlasting light. Amen.

   O Holy Spirit, most sweet Comforter, who proceedest in an ineffable
   manner from the Father and the Son, come, I beseech Thee, and glide
   into my heart. Wash me over and over, and cleanse me thoroughly from
   all sin, and hallow my soul. Look on my soul, wash its filth, bedew its
   drought, heal its wounds, bend its stiffness, warm its chill, guide its
   waywardness. Make me truly humble and resigned that I may please Thee;
   and do Thou ever rest upon me. O most blessed Light, Light of all
   loveliness, be Thou shed on me! O honied sweet of Paradise! O Fountain
   of most pure delights! Give Thyself to me, O my God, and enkindle in
   mine inmost breast the fire of Thy burning love. Teach Thou me, O my
   Lord. Guide and protect me in all things. Strengthen my spirit against
   an undue weakness of purpose, vouchsafe unto me a right faith,
   unswerving . hope, and sincere and perfect charity. Grant that I may
   always do Thy most gracious will. Amen.

SUNDAY MORNING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   Son of the living God, God most High, who hast created me, and hast
   formed, my soul after Thine own divine image and likeness, and hast
   made me capable of everlasting happiness. Grant that I may serve Thee,
   my Lord, my God, and my Father, with a faithful heart, that I may fight
   against my sins with an holy hatred, and that all sinful passions and
   affections being destroyed within me, I may be renewed in innocence of
   life.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who hast given me, for my use, the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all
   things that are therein, and hast granted them for my service and
   comfort. Vouchsafe, I beseech Thee, that I may never abuse Thy
   creatures, but that all the works of Thy hands may tell me of Thy
   goodness, and may lead me to admire, to know, and love Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, out of Thy affection for me, halt granted me to be born in the
   Catholick faith; and hast mercifully brought me up from the beginning
   of my life; and halt supplied me with food and other necessaries for
   the nourishment and support of my body. May my heart find no relish
   except in Thee. Mayest Thou alone possess my inmost soul. May I
   exceedingly hunger for Thee, the bread of heaven, and ardently thirst
   for Thee, the fountain of life, so that, this life's exile ended, I may
   deserve to be satisfied with the joys of Thy perfection.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, up to this time, heat preserved and delivered me from countless
   dangers of soul and body, and even when I abused Thy gifts, hast not
   deserted me. Illuminate my heart, I beseech Thee, with the brightness
   of Thy grace: that, truly perceiving Thy goodness to me, and my own
   ingratitude towards Thee, I may bewail myself, may be hateful in my own
   sight, but may please Thee, my Creator, and only Redeemer, in all
   things.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when I lay immersed in most loathsome vices, and was leading a
   most ungodly life, didst, in Thy longsuffering, bear with me so long a
   time, and didst bring me to repentance. Grant, that by acceptable
   contrition and holy works, I may expiate the stains of my past sins,
   and that henceforth I may lead a life of purity, and love Thee above
   all things with most burning love.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when I was on the brink of the precipice, and just within the very
   jaws of hell, didst not suffer me to perish, but didst recall me,
   though deaf, and endeavouring to fly from Thee, to the way of
   salvation. Grant, that henceforth I may follow after Thee with humble
   devotion, may, with a joyful heart, correspond to Thy holy
   inspirations, may, from my heart, bid farewell to all things visible,
   and may cleave inseparably to Thee alone.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who hast always thus directed me, the vilest of sinners, hast protected
   me, hast looked upon me with the eyes of Thy mercy, and dost still so
   fondly support and cherish me with Thy goodness, notwithstanding my
   daily transgressions, as if forgetful of all others, Thou caredst for
   me alone. Grant that I also may love Thee most ardently, may leave all
   transitory things for Thy sake, may think on Thee alone, and may, with
   a ready mind, and in all places, follow and perform Thy holy will.
   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

SUNDAY EVENING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who was pleased for my sake, to descend from Thy royal throne, and from
   the sweet bosom of the Father, into this valley of tears, and was
   conceived incarnate by the Holy Ghost, in the most chaste womb of the
   Virgin Mary, and was made man. Take, I beseech Thee, my heart as Thine
   habitation, enrich it, fill it with all spiritual gifts, make it wholly
   Thine. O that I may invite Thee to come unto me with deep humility, and
   that I may receive Thee with ardent love, and never let Thee go. O may
   I be bound to Thee by the chains of such fervent love, that I may never
   be able to depart or turn away my heart from Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst will that Thy virgin mother, when She had conceived Thee,
   should hasten to Her kinswoman Elizabeth, and didst inspire Her to
   salute and minister unto Her: in whose most chaste womb Thou didst not
   disdain to be concealed for nine months, God and man. Pour upon me the
   grace of perfect humility, and so thoroughly implant it in my heart,
   that I may be ever found ready to follow and obey Thee. Grant that my
   heart may eschew all perishable things, and that it may ever feel Thee
   to be its sole inmate and possessor.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   whom Thy Virgin Mother, without pain or the loss of her virginity,
   brought forth in a miserable stable to poverty and suffering, and whom,
   as soon as born, She humbly worshipped, O mayest Thou, by renewed
   fervour of spirit, be daily born again within me, and may I be wholly
   consumed by the fire of Thy love: mayest Thou be the only consolation
   of my heart, my only desire, my only joy: may I seek Thee alone, know
   Thee alone, love Thee alone.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst vouchsafe to be born during the cold of winter, to be wrapt
   in swaddling clothes, and to be laid with sobbings in a manger, nor
   didst refuse to hang as a little infant upon Thy mother's breasts. I
   adore Thee, O my dearest Redeemer, the King of angels: Hail, lovely
   Child, God most high, O sweetest Jesus. Hail, Prince of peace, Light of
   the Gentiles, the long-looked-for Saviour. Grant, O Lord, that I may
   for ever stand before Thee in deep humility and poorness of spirit.
   Grant that I may willingly undergo all vexations for Thy Name's sake,
   may love nothing in this world save Thee alone, may desire to possess
   nothing but Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   whom as soon as Thou wast born, the heavenly hosts praised with joyful
   hymns, and the shepherds sought with reverence, and when they had found
   Thee, worshipped with admiration and delight. Grant that I may with a
   Joyful spirit, persevere unwearied in praising and serving Thee, and
   that in purity, steadfastness, calmness, and quietness of soul, I may
   find my only joys, my only pleasures in Thy service.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who on the eighth day wast circumcised after the manner of Thy
   countrymen, and even as an infant didst shed Thy blood, and didst
   vouchsafe for our exceeding consolation to be called Jesus. O that I
   may be circumcised in heart from every wicked thought, and word, and
   deed, and may be numbered amongst Thy children. Thou, O Lord, art
   called Jesus, that is, Saviour: salvation, therefore, is Thy gift. Let
   the remembrance, I beseech Thee, of this most longed-for Name drive
   from me all inordinate weakness of purpose, and make me steadfastly
   faithful unto Thee. By the virtue of this Name, protect me, as with an
   impenetrable shield, against all the snares and plottings of my
   invisible enemies.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   whom the wise men sought for in holy faith, and found by the guiding of
   a star, and having found Thee, fell down and worshipped Thee, offering
   Thee gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. Grant, O Lord, that I
   may with these blessed men always seek for and worship Thee in spirit
   and in truth, and that I may ever offer Thee the gold of burning
   charity, the frankincense of fragrant devotion, and the myrrh of
   perfect mortification. Give me grace to spend the whole strength of my
   soul in praising and worshipping Thee, according to Thy holy will,
   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

MONDAY MORNING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who for our sakes didst vouchsafe to be subject unto Thy parents; and
   to teach us humility, vast carried by Thy mother into the temple, and
   there redeemed with the offerings of the poor, when the righteous
   Simeon and the prophetess Anna, gladdened by Thy presence, gave
   glorious testimony concerning Thee. O may the slightest breath of
   vanity never affect my inmost soul! O may all arrogance be ever cast
   down, may all longing for the praise of men be extinguished, may all
   wantonness of self-conceit be quenched within me. Give me grace, O
   Lord, to flee all honours, to hate distinction, and to submit myself
   with readiness to all men for Thy sake.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who as a little child didst, with Thy tender Mother, suffer
   persecution, and didst not refuse to be carried as an exile, and to fly
   into Egypt. Give me grace amidst the storms of adversity and the blasts
   of persecution and misfortunes, to fly for refuge unto Thee alone, to
   seek Thee, to call upon Thee. Grant that I may receive all things with
   gladness at Thy hands, may endure everything in meekness of heart, and
   may cleave with thanksgiving, without wavering, unto Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   whom, when Thou didst remain behind in the temple, Thy pious Mother
   sought for sorrowing, and at length with joy found Thee, sitting in the
   midst of the doctors hearing and asking them questions. O mayest Thou
   so give and communicate Thyself to me, that I may never be separated
   from Thee, and never be bereft of the comfort of Thy blessed
   friendship. Drive all sloth from my heart; dispel all dulness that is
   displeasing in Thy sight; grant me perfect devotion, and such an ardent
   thirst after piety, that my soul may be so affected and possessed by
   it, as never to feel satisfied with worshipping Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, who
   vouchsafedst to live concealed for thirty years, to be reputed by the
   Jews the son of Joseph the carpenter, and to be subject to the commands
   of Thy mother Mary and the same Joseph! May Thy grace, I beseech Thee,
   root out and thoroughly pluck up from the inmost recesses of my heart,
   all ambition and vain-glory, that I may be little in my own eyes, and
   may love to be unknown and considered of no account,. and may submit
   myself to all and obey them for Thine honour.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ;
   who didst not refuse to come to the river Jordan, and to be baptized
   therein by Thy servant John. O mayest Thou thoroughly cleanse me by Thy
   merits in this life, that, freed from all vices and sins, I may be
   filled with the love of Thee, and long for my heavenly country. Make
   me, I beseech Thee, ere my soul quits the body, pleasing to Thee in all
   things; that, departing this life, I may be over in Heaven with Thee,
   to see Thee, enjoy Thee, and to praise Thy Holy name for ever and ever.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who for our sakes didst dwell in the wilderness, amongst the wild
   beasts, and didst continue fasting and watching in prayer for forty
   days and forty nights, and didst suffer Thyself to be tempted by the
   devil, whom when Thou hadst overcome, angels came and ministered unto
   Thee; give me grace to discipline, overcome, and bring into subjection,
   my sinful flesh with its evil affections. Give me grace to be instant
   in prayer and all other spiritual exercises; and grant that by Thine
   assistance, I may thoroughly overcome the sin of gluttony, and may
   escape the snares and artifices of the devil. Let no temptations, I beg
   of Thee, defile me, nor separate me from Thee, but may they rather
   purify me, and unite and join me unto Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst vouchsafe to preach repentance, to call unto Thee disciples,
   and from them to choose the twelve Apostles to be the especial heralds
   of the faith, and to gather together the children of God, that were
   scattered abroad. Draw me after Thee, and powerfully excite my heart to
   love Thee. Suffer me not to neglect the grace with which Thou halt
   called me, but make me ready to despise the world and all perishable
   things, and to follow Thee, taking Thy humility and charity for my
   example. Give me grace to seek Thee alone, and with earnest longings to
   sigh continually after Thee. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

MONDAY EVENING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who for my sake didst endure the discomforts of heat and cold, of
   hunger, thirst, of sweatings, and painful labours. Grant that I may
   receive whatsoever adversity with cheerfulness from Thy hand, and may
   endure it patiently for thine honour. Whatever strait, whatever
   desolation of spirit, whatever circumstance comes upon me, grant me to
   abide immoveable in Thee. May I always consider and seek after Thee,
   and not myself; and have at heart, not my own, but Thy most Holy Will,

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst undergo many labours, whilst as the Saviour of the world, and
   thirsting for the conversion of souls, Thou didst pass whole nights in
   prayer, wert wearied with journeyings, didst run from country to
   country, from city to city, from district to district, from village to
   village. Grant, I beseech Thee, that my love for Thee may make me ready
   and active in every good work, and that I may never become slothful in
   Thy service. Make me ardently desire, and as far as in me lies,
   earnestly promote the salvation of all men. Make me at all times
   zealous for Thine honour, and ready to spend myself wholly for Thy
   sake.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, whilst Thou didst dwell with men, vouchsafedst to comfort them
   with exceeding kindness, and mercifully to cure them, by the working of
   many miracles, of their sicknesses and diseases. Give me a good heart,
   full of affection and compassion for all men, so that I may have pity
   on the afflictions of others, may feel their misfortunes as my own, may
   bear cheerfully with their failings, and according to my power, may
   with gladness minister unto their necessities. O cleanse and heal my
   soul from all evil passions and wicked desires, that, delivered from
   these evils, it may freely raise itself to Thee, and cleave to Thee
   with most spotless love.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst preach peace, mid the kingdom of heaven with singular zeal
   and unspeakable affection, earnestly longing for the salvation of all
   men, and desiring to bring all men unto Thyself, even as a hen
   gathereth her chickens under her wings. Grant me grace to long most
   earnestly for the salvation of others, grant that I may never selfishly
   spare myself, may never refuse any thing for Thy sake, and that I may
   always temper my zeal with holy discretion.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst not refuse the company of publicans and sinners, but didst
   show most condescending kindness to Matthew, Zaccheus, Mary Magdalen,
   to the woman taken in adultery, and to many other penitents, and didst
   at once grant them remission of their sins. Grant that I may most
   gladly receive all men with charity and affection, may readily forgive
   all who injure me, and may love most truly those who hate me, and may
   never be so weak as to show to any a want of sincere affection. Grant
   me the entire pardon of my sins, give me an undoubting hope of Thy
   grace, and a perpetual and holy confidence in Thy mercy.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, for my sake didst suffer so many injuries, so many blasphemies, so
   many reproaches and deceits, such innumerable persecutions from those
   very persons whom Thou hadst loaded with kindness. Give me a truly
   innocent and simple heart, that I may sincerely love my enemies, may
   pity them from my inmost soul, may lovingly excuse them, and by
   repaying their evil with good, may please Thee by charity and most
   perfect patience.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst approach Jerusalem in lowliness, meek, and sitting upon an
   ass, and amidst the songs of praise of the crowds who went forth to
   meet Thee, didst shed tears, weeping over the destruction of the city,
   and the ruin of ungrateful souls. Vouchsafe to me a perfect knowledge
   of myself, that I may see how unworthy I am, and may deeply humble and
   despise myself. O that I may never take any delight in the praise and
   applause of men, but may give myself up, to my soul's profit, to hidden
   tears of penitence and love. May I feel the wants of others as if they
   were my own, and weep over their sins with a loving heart, as I should
   over my own. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

TUESDAY MORNING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   whom Thy faithless disciple Judas, did sell for a vile sum of money to
   the Jews who were persecuting Thee, and conspiring against Thy life.
   Root out, I beseech Thee, from my heart all evil love of creatures.
   Grant that I may never prefer any thing to Thee: make me always show
   the most perfect charity towards all men, and especially to those who
   trouble me. Pardon me, O holy Redeemer, for having so often preferred
   vain and perishable things to Thee, and for having for the sake of vile
   pleasures, turned myself from Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst eat. the Passover with Thy disciples at Jerusalem, according
   to the commandment of the law, and didst give them an example of
   humility and holy love, by kneeling down upon the ground and washing
   their feet, and wiping them with a linen cloth. O that this Thy example
   may penetrate my soul, and may thoroughly destroy all haughtiness and
   pride within me. Give me, O Lord, the deepest humility, so that I may,
   without delay, perform the lowest ministry to all men. Give me perfect
   obedience, that I may, with all diligence, observe as Thy commandments
   whatsoever Thy vicars may appoint. Give me most fervent charity, that I
   may sincerely love all mankind.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who out of Thine unspeakable love, didst institute the Sacrament of the
   Eucharist, and hast in it, given Thyself to us with wondrous
   liberality, so that Thou mightest remain with us even bodily unto the
   end of the world. Give me, I beseech Thee, an earnest longing, and
   enkindle in my inmost soul, an intense hunger for this adorable
   sacrament. Grant that when I go to that table of life, I may receive
   Thee with chaste affections, great humility, and perfect purity of
   heart. May my soul so thirst for Thee now, and so languish in Thy love,
   that I may one day be found meet to enjoy the delights of Thine eternal
   kingdom, to the-glory of Thy name.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, And glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who when Thou wert about to leave the world, didst exhort and comfort
   with words of unspeakable sweetness Thy chosen disciples, and didst
   most earnestly commend them in prayer to Thy Father, thereby most
   plainly showing how tenderly Thou didst love both them and us, who were
   to believe through their word. Grant that my heart may ever relish Thy
   words, and that I may find them sweeter than honey to my taste. O that
   the spirit of that burning exhortation may so glide into my heart, that
   I may be wholly transformed into Thy love. So direct all my ways, O
   Lord my God, that Thy holy will may be done in and by me for ever and
   ever.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who went out with Thy disciples across the brook Cedron, and came into
   a garden in which Thou knewest Thou wouldst be taken. O may I entirely
   give up my own will, and always follow and love Thine. May I, for Thine
   honour, and the salvation of my brethren, boldly endure all adversity,
   and be willing even to lay down my life, if Thy divine providence
   should so ordain it.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, as Thy passion drew nigh, didst begin to be sorrowful and sad, and
   very heavy, so that by transferring the weakness of Thy members to
   Thyself, Thou mightest be able to console and strengthen them, when
   they were in fear at the approach of death, by this Thine own weakness
   which Thou hadst willingly taken upon Thee. Preserve me, I beseech
   Thee, both from immoderate sorrow, and from foolish gladness. Grant
   that the grief which I have hitherto endured, may be for Thy glory, and
   the remission of my sins. Remove mercifully from me all distrust and
   inordinate weakness, and confirm and establish my whole soul in Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst fall prostrate on the ground and prayed to Thy Father, humbly
   offering Thy whole self to Him, and saying, Thy will be done. Give me
   grace in every necessity and trouble, to fly to Thee in prayer, and
   freely to resign and give myself up to Thy will. May I never unduly
   endeavour to escape from troubles; but receive all things from Thy hand
   with a quiet mind, and may I endure every thing in meekness of spirit
   for love of Thee. Amen.

TUESDAY EVENING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to thee, O Christ,
   who, touched with compassion towards Thy disciples, preferred their
   sadness to Thine own anguish, and leaving off Thy prayer, on which Thou
   wert so intent, didst come to them for the third time, and raised them
   from their sorrow, and urged them, giving way to sleep, to the practice
   of prayer. Give me grace to avoid, in all my exercises and works, the
   vice of sloth. Grant that I may serve Thee with an active and watchful
   heart, that I may prefer the salvation of my neighbours to my own
   private devotions, may always show bowels of mercy to others in
   whatsoever necessity they may be placed; and may I never seek myself,
   but on all occasions fly from myself for love of Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when in agony didst pray the longer, and whereas Thou wert the
   Creator of heaven and earth, the King of kings, and Lord of angels,
   didst not disdain to be strengthened by the ministry of an angel. Grant
   that I may seek for Thee as my only comforter in all adversity and
   anxiety, in all sadness and heaviness of soul, and may ever find Thee
   ready to help and protect me. O that in all changes and chances I may
   trust in Thee, may submit myself wholly to Thy providence, may offer
   myself to Thy will, and cast myself entirely upon Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, by reason of the vehemence and excess of the anguish of Thy soul,
   wert bedewed over Thy whole body with a bloody sweat. O that tears of
   holy contrition may stream forth from all the members of my inward man.
   O may I worthily bewail myself before Thee, that I have so long
   continued ungrateful to Thy love and mercy. O May I bear with a quiet
   mind all trouble, both from within and from without, and may I never
   complain that I am scourged and beaten by Thy chastisements, O most
   holy Father, but receiving good and evil with cheerfulness from Thy
   hand, may I rejoice continually in Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ
   who willingly gave Thyself up into the hands of the traitor Judas, and
   the rest of Thine enemies who were thirsting for Thy blood and longing
   for Thy death; give me grace never to fly from adversities for Thine
   honour, but grant that I may readily meet them, and receive them gladly
   as precious gifts from Thee, and may I humbly and steadfastly endure
   them as long as it shall please Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst not repel the traitor Judas when he came to Thee with
   stealth, but didst fondly kiss him, and with the utmost calmness of
   countenance and sweetness of speech, didst tell him that Thou lovedst
   him, and didst exhort him to repentance. Grant me grace always to be
   gentle and full of charity to all my enemies, and howsoever they may
   sin against me, to pardon them with all my heart, and to love them as
   the ministers of Thy providence and my own salvation.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst suffer Thine enemies to lay their sacrilegious and infuriated
   hands upon Thee, and though cruelly bound by them, Thou didst not
   avenge, but didst. meekly bear all the reproaches, and blasphemies, and
   injuries, which they wantonly uttered against Thee. O mayest Thou
   deliver me from the chains of my sins, and bind me on all sides with
   the chains of Thy sweetest love! O that Thou wouldst grant me the grace
   of true patience, so that I may cheerfully bear with all my enemies,
   and may endure every kind of trouble without _the slightest desire to
   kick against it.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst restore and heal the ear of Malchus, one of Thy furious
   persecutors, which Thy disciple Peter had cut off, that by repaying
   injury with kindness Thou mightest show us the riches of Thy gentleness
   and goodness. Grant, I beseech Thee, that the desire of revenge may
   never entwine itself within my heart, and vouchsafe that I may always
   show towards my neighbours, even should they injure me, a spirit of
   deep commiseration and most perfect love. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

WEDNESDAY MORNING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when Thy disciples and friends did desert and leave Thee, didst
   remain alone in the hands of sinful men, like a most gentle lamb within
   the jaws of a ravening wolf. Strengthen my excessive weakness, and
   confirm my too great unstableness by the support of Thy grace, and so
   join me to Thyself with the bonds of love, that I may neither have the
   wish nor the power ever to depart or separate myself from Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst suffer Thyself to be led bound by an armed band to Annas, and
   didst vouchsafe to stand before him as if Thou hadst been a malefactor
   and robber. O unspeakable gentleness of my Redeemer! Behold, whilst
   they take and drag and thrust Thee forward, Thou utt4rest not a single
   complaint, or murmur, or word of resistance, but in silence Thou
   followest them whithersoever they lead Thee, obeyest their commands,
   and dost submit to their wanton injuries. Grant, O Lord, that these Thy
   virtues may shine forth in me, to the everlasting glory of Thy name.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   King of heaven and earth, who, in great humility, as poor and needy,
   and of none account, didst stand before the proud High Priest, and
   didst most sweetly endure the dreadful blow which his impious servant
   gave Thee. Restrain, I beseech Thee, in me all outbreaks of anger and
   passion, keep down all acts of indignation, and quench within me all
   desire of revenge, so that when I am provoked by injury, I may not be
   disturbed, may offer no resistance, may suffer no disquiet, but
   enduring every thing with a quiet mind, may I even repay evil with
   good.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour; and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst vouchsafe to be led bound in a shameful manner to Caiphas,
   that Thou mightest deliver us from the penalty of eternal death, and
   restore us to true liberty. Make me most ready to endure every
   reproach, and all contempt for Thy name's sake. Grant that in the very
   midst of ridicule and outrage, I may give Thee thanks with a perfect
   heart, and by means of these trials may grow and increase more and more
   in Thy love.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when thrice denied by Thine Apostle Peter, didst mercifully turn
   and look upon him with kindness, and didst bring him to repentance and
   holy sorrow for his sin. O mayest Thou turn upon me also Thine eye of
   mercy and love, that I may weep over my past sins with the tears of
   true penitence, and may never again commit them! O may I never be found
   sinning against Thy goodness in word or deed.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst stand before the elders and people of the Jews with a calm
   countenance and humble look, and didst not refuse to be falsely accused
   and to suffer divers injuries. Give me grace never to say an untrue
   word, or falsely to accuse my neighbour, but may I bear with all
   quietness of heart the calumnies that are heaped upon me; and casting
   all my troubles upon Thee, may I always in silence look for grave and
   consolation at Thy hands.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when Caiphas the High Priest adjured Thee by the Name of God,
   didst declare the truth and proclaim Thyself to be the Son of God, and
   didst not refuse to be accounted by him and the rest who stood by a
   blasphemer. O may I fully abhor this contempt and offence against Thee.
   May I in every place reverence the presence of Thy divinity and
   majesty. O may I think on Thee, adore, praise, and love Thee, above all
   things for ever and ever. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

WEDNESDAY EVENING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert declared guilty of death by the ungodly Jews, and wert
   condemned without a clause, that Thy unjust condemnation might be the
   means of freeing us from the guilt of those crimes; under which we
   justly lay. Give me grace to reject unkind and rash suspicions, and to
   bear without bitterness of spirit whatever evil may be said against me,
   or any unfavourable judgments which may be made concerning me, and
   grant that with the assistance of Thy grace I may always keep myself in
   a quiet and loving spirit.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert made for me the reproach of men and the outcast of the people,
   and didst not turn Thy most holy face, on which the angels desire to
   look, from shame and spitting. Grant that I may imitate Thy gentle
   patience; suffer me not to defile my soul by sin, but do Thou keep it
   unspotted for Thyself, so that after the darkness of this life, I may
   be wholly cleansed and found meet, to contemplate Thine eternal
   brightness.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst vouchsafe for my sake, to be most cruelly buffeted and
   struck, and to be shamefully loaded with divers insults and
   reproaches.. Grant, I beseech Thee, that I may never shrink from being
   accounted vile and worthless, nor refuse to submit to whatever injuries
   Thou mayest permit to be inflicted upon me. Give me grace to be always
   ready to endure any troubles for Thine honour; may I receive whatsoever
   Thou in Thy Fatherly love, shalt send upon me; may I in all things give
   thanks, and give myself up wholly and entirely unto Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst suffer Thyself to be laughed to scorn, and didst permit Thy
   most lovely face, the very sight of which is most perfect happiness, to
   be blindfolded for Thy greater shame. Grant, that the veil of ignorance
   being removed, I may be filled with the knowledge of Thy will; implant
   in my heart a continual remembrance of Thee grant that I may feel Thy
   presence in every place, and may love and always do that which is
   pleasing in Thy sight.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who for my sake wert for a whole night, mocked and tormented in various
   ways, by the sinful Jews. Thou knowest, O Lord, how hard I find it to
   bear even the slightest injury: Thou knowest how devoid I am of virtue,
   how sluggish is my will, how cold my desires. Mercifully therefore
   assist my weakness; and grant that I may not cowardly shrink from, or
   be wanting in any adversity. Grant that I may never lose my peace of
   mind, by reason of the wrongs that are done against me, nor become
   unsettled because of unjust accusations, but give me grace to offer
   them all up to Thee, with thanksgiving and everlasting praise.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst vouchsafe to be led, bound and loaded with scorn, to the
   profane judgment seat of Pilate, and Thyself the Judge of quick and
   dead, didst submit to be reproachfully gazed upon by him. Grant that I
   may submit myself to the powers that are ordained by Thee, may obey my
   equals, and may honour and love all mankind. Grant that I may not fear
   the judgments of others concerning me; but may hear them with a ready
   mind, and patiently endure them. May I follow Thee, I beseech Thee, not
   only when joy and prosperity smile upon me, but even when I am weighed
   down with sorrow and affliction.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ, King of
   heaven and earth, who didst testify that Thy kingdom is not of this
   world, that by this confession Thou mightest wean our hearts from the
   love of this present world. Grant I pray Thee, that I may thoroughly
   bid farewell to all affection for earthly and perishable things. May my
   heart never long after any of those things that perish, may it never
   love any thing without a holy purpose: but may I love Thee, the only
   true and everlasting good, may I continually sigh after, and cleave
   unswervingly unto Thee. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

THURSDAY MORNING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! praise and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who standing before Pilate, didst in great humility, keep silence at
   all the unjust accusations, and slanders of the Jews; and as a gentle
   lamb that openeth not its mouth, didst not contradict them when they
   brought forward their charges against Thee. Give me grace never to be
   disturbed by the false accusations of others, but may I overcome every
   injury, by silence tad meekness. Give me the grace of perfect humility;
   so that I may never desire praise, nor refuse any measure of contempt.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   Thou Lamb without spot, against whom the pious Pharisees and Scribes
   raged with obstinate hatred. For although Pilate testified that he
   found no cause of death in Thee, yet they would not be satisfied with
   any thing save Thy death. Give me grace to imitate Thine innocence and
   patience, that I may both lead a godly life, and if, for so doing, I am
   evil spoken of, that I may remain at rest in Thee, giving way to no
   indignation, but rendering Thee thanks in all adversity.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert led with the greatest ignominy, as a wicked criminal, through
   the midst of the city, from one judgment seat to another, and from
   Pilate to Herod, amidst the noise and shouts of the people. O give me
   grace never to be overcome by the injuries of my enemies, nor to be
   exasperated by any slander: may I never feel any false shame at being
   despised, but may I receive everything in meekness, and endure all
   things in silence for Thine honour, so that, by the assistance of Thy
   grace, I may in patience possess my soul.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when Herod did ask Thee many vain and foolish questions, and when
   Thou wert falsely wound in divers ways by the chief Priests and
   Scribes, didst humbly keep a meet and becoming silence. O give me grace
   to restrain my tongue in a manner well pleasing unto Thee: suffer me
   not to utter hurtful words: suffer me not to be taken up with fruitless
   stories, but give me grace to say what is right, and profitable, and
   honest, according to Thy will may . I abhor the sin of evil speaking,
   and be ever glad to think and speak well of all men.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour; and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst condemn, by Thy silence, the foolish curiosity of Herod, and
   wouldst not gratify his curious eyes by the performance of any miracle,
   because he had not his own salvation at heart, and didst thereby teach
   us to avoid all ostentation before the great ones of this world. Pour
   into my heart a spirit of deep humility, mortify and quench within me
   all desire of vain-glory. Grant that I may never do any thing in order
   to gain the praise of men, but may always act with a single eye to the
   glory of Thy most holy name, and may come before Thee day by day in a
   true spirit of humility and meekness.

   Hail, sweet Jesus I praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O
   Christ, who didst not refuse to be set at nought by Herod and his men
   of war, nor to be clothed in a white garment, and to be mocked and
   laughed at as a fool and madman. Give me grace, O Lord, to choose
   rather to be an outcast with Thee, than to be glorious with the world;
   may I think it better and more honourable to suffer reproach for Thy
   name, than to prosper in the vain honours of the world. Give me grace,
   that truly acknowledging my Own sins, and my own unworthiness, I may be
   nothing in my own sight, but may always despise and accuse myself, and
   daily lament over my own wretchedness.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert sent back with shame, clothed in a fool's garment, from Herod
   to Pilate, and didst in all things obey Thy enemies, going backwards
   and forwards according to their pleasure. Grant that I may not shrink
   from being despised, nor refuse obedience even to those who injure me.
   Give me grace to have no feeling for the things of this world, but to
   think of, and care for, and love Thee alone. Mayest Thou alone be my
   honour, my delight, my love, my glory, and my joy. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

THURSDAY EVENING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert compared with the notorious robber Barabbas, and wert judged
   to be more wicked and worthier of death than he: the murderer is
   released, and the malicious Jews demand that Thou, the Author of life
   should be put to death. Thou, therefore, art that corner-stone set at
   nought by men, but chosen by God. O that I may prefer nought to Thee,
   nor change Thee for any thing whatever. O that I may count all things
   as dross, that I may gain Thee. Grant, O Lord, that the stain of envy
   may never soil my soul, and vouchsafe unto me to be built on Thee the
   living corner-stone, and to be stablished and to find my salvation in
   Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert stripped in the judgment hall, and bound to a pillar, and
   there didst suffer Thy most holy and virginal flesh to be torn with.
   dreadful stripes, .that by Thy bruises Thou mightest heal our wounds. O
   Jesus, greatly to be loved, I choose Thee, covered as Thou art with
   wounds, to be the spouse of my soul, and I desire to be inflamed and
   thoroughly consumed by the fire of Thy sweetest love. Strip my heart, I
   beseech Thee, of every unseemly thought: take off from me the old man
   with his deeds, and put on me the new man, which is created after God
   in righteousness and holy truth. Grant that I may patiently endure in
   this life the scourges of Thy fatherly correction, that at its close, I
   may be found meet to rejoice with Thee, and to praise and glorify Thee
   for ever and. ever.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   whom the soldiers treated with unspeakable injuries and insults, when
   Thou wert standing all bloody and livid from the weals of the cruel
   lash. For they clothed Thee, O King of glory, in a scarlet robe, to Thy
   greater shame, and platted on Thy divine head a crown of thorns, and
   placed a reed by way of sceptre in Thy hands, and bowed the knee before
   Thee, and in mockery saluted Thee, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
   Fix in my heart, I beseech Thee, the continual remembrance of Thy
   passion. Wound me with the goads of love, and pierce me with the darts
   of Thy mercies. Grant that I may love Thee alone, and may cleave unto
   Thee and have my whole soul fixed on nought but Thee. May no trouble,
   may no torments, may no persecution separate me from Thee. O may I
   never be ashamed to be despised and scoffed at with Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, for my sake, didst not refuse to be smitten with a reed, to be
   buffetted, and defiled with spitting, and to be treated with every kind
   of mockery and scorn. I beseech Thee, by Thy wounds, by Thy blood, by
   Thy scornful injuries, and by all Thy sorrows, to take possession of
   myself and all that I have, and turn it all to Thy everlasting praise.
   Grant that I may perfectly deny myself. O make me accept, with a
   cheerful and peaceful-mind, sorrow and joy, weal and woe from Thy hand,
   that being dead to the world I may live unto Thee alone.

   Hail, Sweet Jesus! Prairie, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, covered with spitting, and gashes, and scars; and deformed with
   bruises, bound, and full of misery, wert led forth to be gazed at by
   the furious mob, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe.
   Grant that I may thoroughly crush within me all ambition, all show of
   worldly pomp and vanity, and that I may despise and hold in abhorrence
   all worldly honours, so that by the deepest humility and a real
   contempt of myself, I may continually be running forward to the
   attainment of the glory of the blessings of heaven.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when Thou wert declared innocent by the governor Pilate, didst not
   refuse to listen to the furious cries of the Jews, demanding Thy
   crucifixion. Grant me to lead an innocent life, and never to be
   disturbed by the ill will of others towards me. Vouchsafe unto me this
   grace, that I may never speak against others, nor willingly give ear to
   any that do so, but may, as far as possible, think well of all men,
   charitably put up with their failings, and sincerely love all mankind.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst suffer Thyself to be condemned in the face of all the people
   to the most shameful death of the cross, that Thou mightest free us
   from the sentence of everlasting death. Grant that I may never judge
   others rashly, nor wish evil to any one, nor injure any. Give me grace
   to serve Thee, in glory and in shame, through evil report, and good
   report, and always to seek Thy honour, and may I choose rather to be
   exercised in adversity by abiding with Thee, than by leaving Thee to
   have the enjoyment of all the comforts of this life. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

FRIDAY MORNING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, given up to the will of Thy persecutors, didst suffer exceeding
   torments when they took off the purple robe which stuck to Thy wounds,
   and put on Thee Thine own garments. Grant that after I have put off the
   clothing of this body, I may be clad with the robe of perfect charity,
   and that I may appear adorned with Thy merits, and may, through Thy
   mercy, be introduced as an adopted Son into the heavenly inheritance.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, in the midst of reproaches and injuries, didst bear Thy cross with
   excessive pain on Thy sacred and lacerated shoulders, and wearied and
   panting for breath didst toil exceedingly under its heavy weight. Give
   me grace to take hold of the cross of self-denial with ardent devotion,
   and to imitate, with the most fervent charity, the example of Thy
   virtues, and to follow Thee in all humility even unto death.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, led out of the city with two thieves, didst not refuse to be
   pressed on and thrust, and hastened, and to be afflicted in many other
   ways. Draw me after Thee, and O may I quickly follow Thee! Grant that
   for Thy sake I may entirely deny, forsake, and go out of myself. Give
   me grace to think of Thee alone, and to find no joy save in Thee, my
   afflicted Redeemer. Grant that I may love Thee alone, may return love
   for love, may earnestly seek after Thee, and live to Thee alone.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, bowed down with the weight of Thy cross, didst at length reach the
   place of punishment, where, quite exhausted, they offered Thee wine
   mingled with gall. O mayest Thou extinguish in me all gluttonous and
   carnal desires, and give me grace never to consent to any impure. or
   unlawful pleasure: but may I take my food in moderation to the glory of
   Thy name, and may hunger and thirst after Thee alone, and find no
   pleasure or gladness save in Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert stripped before the gaze of the people on Mount Calvary, and
   the soreness of Thy wounds being increased by the pulling off of Thy
   garments, Thou didst not refuse to undergo for my sake most dreadful
   pain. Grant me to love the spirit of poverty, and never to be disturbed
   by want or scarcity. Give me grace to bear patiently any straits or
   troubles in this life for the glory of Thy name. Strip my heart of
   every vain fancy And affection, and give me a holy intention, and pious
   desires,. and renew within me daily a most pure love for Thyself.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst vouchsafe to be extended naked upon the wood of the cross,
   and the joints of Thy most holy limbs being wrenched asunder, wert most
   cruelly nailed and fastened thereunto. And thus, for my sake, Thou
   didst suffer Thy most delicate hands and Thine undefiled feet to be
   most deeply wounded. Grant me, O Lord, to remember with a faithful and
   grateful heart, this Thine unspeakable charity, when Thou didst of
   Thine own accord stretch forth Thy hands to be bored and Thy feet to be
   pierced through and through. O Lord, enlarge and extend my heart by a
   perfect love of Thee: pierce it, and fix it to Thyself with the nail of
   Thy sweetest love, and shut up within Thyself alone all my senses, all
   my thoughts and affections. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

FRIDAY EVENING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst hang suspended for three hours upon the shameful cross with
   Thy feet and hands pierced through: and with a great loss of Thy
   precious blood, didst, of Thine own free will, undergo an unspeakable
   agony in all Thy sacred limbs. Lift up, I beseech Thee, and fasten to
   the wood of Thy cross my poor soul now lying in the dust; cleanse it
   from the dregs of vicious affections, and inflame it with earnest
   longings after Thee, and with the love of its heavenly country. O
   saving blood! O life-giving blood! O mayest Thou, O my Lord, mayest
   Thou thoroughly wash, and cleanse, and heal me, by this Thy precious
   blood. Mayest Thou offer it to Thy Father as a full satisfaction for
   all my sins! Grant that my inward soul may receive and lick up the
   life-giving drops of this same blessed blood, and may truly taste how
   sweet is Thy Spirit.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert hung upon the cross between two wicked robbers and wert
   numbered with the transgressors, that by thine unspeakable humility and
   patience Thou mightest correct our impatient pride, and at the same
   time expiate it. Raise up, I beseech Thee, my soul to heaven, that
   looking down from thence on all transitory things, I may admire nothing
   save Thee, my God, who wert crucified for me, may love Thee alone, may
   pant after Thee, think of Thee, speak of Thee, dream of Thee, relish
   nought but Thee, rejoice in nought save Thee, that thus I may be unable
   to find any consolation save in Thee alone.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert so good even to the worst of men, that Thou didst beseech Thy
   Father even for those who were crucifying Thee, and didst say, "Father,
   forgive them, for they know not what they do." Give me, I beseech, the
   grace of true gentleness and forbearance, so that according both to Thy
   command and example I may love my enemies, do good to those that hate
   me, and may pour forth before Thee humble prayers for those that hurt
   and persecute me, and May have compassion on them and heartily pardon
   them.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst will that a title written in a threefold tongue should be
   fastened to Thy cross, a trophy as it were of victory, so that we, when
   we look up to it, might vigorously war against our invisible enemies.
   Shield me by the protection of this title from all the snares and
   deceits of the devil. Teach me by this title to overcome all
   temptations, to subdue all vices, that having mastered them by the help
   of Thy grace, I may be free to praise and glorify Thee for ever and
   ever.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   for whose garments the soldiers did cast lots, but did not by Thine
   appointment, rend Thy coat which was without seam, and a type of the
   unity of the Catholic Church. May the Spirit of peace, I beseech Thee,
   descend into my heart, and so dwell within it and take possession of
   it, that I may never be the cause of the disturbing or severing of
   brotherly love, but may always strive to heal divisions, and to promote
   peace amongst those that are at variance.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   whom the Jews did wantonly insult, pouring forth from their impious
   mouths divers blasphemies, even at the very moment whilst Thou wert
   enduring unspeakable torments, and an indescribable anguish upon the
   Altar of the Cross. Grant, O Lord, that mindful of Thy humility,
   patience, and gentleness, I may patiently endure pain, reproach,
   persecution, infamy, and scorn, and may continue with Thee upon the
   cross even unto the end. May no assaults of temptation, no blasts of
   adversity, nor gathering of contempt, shake me from my holy purpose:
   may neither death nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   any other creature separate me from the love of Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst bear with one thief uttering reproaches against Thee, but
   didst most graciously promise the glory of Paradise to the other when
   he humbly acknowledged his wickedness and confessed with pious faith
   that Thou wert God and King. Look upon me, I beseech Thee, with those
   eyes of mercy which Thou didst turn upon the thief repenting for his
   sins. O may I, by the help of Thy grace, lead such an innocent life,
   and so faithfully serve, and purely love Thee, that at the close of my
   life, I may be found meet to hear from Thee, my most holy King, that
   longed-for voice, "To-day shalt Thou be with me in Paradise." Amen.

SATURDAY MORNING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, from the cross, didst look down upon Thy sweetest Mother,
   overwhelmed with grief and tears, and didst so truly take compassion on
   Her sorrow as to commend Her to the care of Thy disciple John, as also
   Thou didst commend John, and in him all of us to Her maternal care.
   Grant me to love and honour Her with the purest and most ardent love,
   that I may have Her for my Mother and be worthy to be acknowledged by
   Her as Her son. Grant that in every necessity; and specially at the
   hour of my death, I may ever find Her present and at hand to help me.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who with Thy wounds all gaping, and Thy head crowned with thorns, and
   whilst hanging in misery upon the cross, didst declare that Thou wert
   bereft of all consolation. Grant that in all adversity and times of
   temptation and desolation, I may fly with pious faith unto Thee, my
   most holy Father, and putting no confidence in myself, grant that I may
   place all my hopes in Thee alone, and entirely resign myself and trust
   in Thee. Wound my inmost soul with the remembrance of Thy wounds, write
   and imprint them upon my heart, satiate me wholly with Thy blood, that
   all my intentions may be fixed in Thee alone, and that I may seek and
   find, and hold Thee fast, and possess Thee for ever and ever.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when Thy body was exhausted from the loss of blood, didst gasp for
   breath, and didst cry out upon the cross that Thou wert tormented with
   thirst, whilst Thou didst burn with an unspeakable desire for our
   salvation. Give me grace to thirst most ardently after Thine honour and
   the salvation of souls, and to be ready cheerfully to spend myself for
   them according to Thy will. Grant that no love of transitory objects
   may possess my soul, that I may never attach myself to creatures, and
   that even what I. am bound to love I may love only in Thee, but give me
   grace to love Thee above all things, and with my whole soul, and
   quietly to rest in Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, when Thou wert athirst, even unto death, didst suffer a sponge
   filled with vinegar to be offered unto Thee, that by tasting thereof,
   Thou mightest make satisfaction for our gluttony, and leave us an
   example of poverty. Give me the grace to despise all unlawful pleasures
   and delights, and to avoid all excess in eating and drinking, and may I
   use with moderation and thanksgiving whatsoever Thou dost furnish me
   with for the support of my poor body. So cleanse, I beseech Thee, the
   taste of my heart, that it may relish nought save that which is
   pleasing unto Thee, and may find nothing but bitterness in whatever is
   displeasing in Thy sight.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   Thou greatest lover of the human race, who when Thou wert duly bringing
   the work of our redemption to a close, didst offer Thyself as a holy
   victim upon the Altar of the Cross, for the sins of all mankind. May
   this be the only end, I beseech Thee, of all my thoughts, words, and
   works; namely, to seek Thine honour with an upright and sincere
   intention, and to desire nothing save Thee alone, Grant that I may
   never grow weary or lukewarm in Thy service; but a fervent spirit being
   ever renewed within me, may I be daily more and more inflamed to love
   and praise Thee.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory, be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst willingly undergo death, when commending Thyself to Thy
   Father, and bending Thy adorable head, Thou gayest up the ghost; and
   thus by laying down Thy life for Thy sheep, didst .show Thyself to be
   the good Shepherd. Thou art dead, O only-begotten Son of God, Thou art
   dead, O my beloved one, that I might live for ever! O what hope, what
   confidence is laid up for me in Thy death, and in Thy blood! I glorify
   Thee, I give Thee thanks as far as in me lies; give me grace to die
   entirely to sin and all evil desires; and to live to Thee alone. O may
   I think of Thee alone, may my understanding exercise itself in nought
   save Thee; so that, clad with Thy grace and with holy charity, I may
   soon after the close of this life come to Thee, the true Paradise. O
   good Jesus, by Thy bitter passion and death grant to the living pardon
   and grace, and to the faithful departed rest and everlasting light,

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   at whose death the sun withdrew its light, and the veil of the temple
   was rent in twain, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent, and
   the graves opened. O may the rays of Thy grace never forsake me, I beg
   of Thee, Thou Sun of righteousness, Thou that art my God; but may they
   always lighten even the very inmost recesses of my heart, so that I may
   joyfully serve Thee. Tear away from me the veil of hypocrisy, make the
   ground of my soul quake with saving penitence, rend in twain this heart
   of stone; so that, being wholly renewed within,. I may despise all
   perishable things, and love but those that are of heaven. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

SATURDAY EVENING.

   HAIL, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst suffer Thy most holy side to be pierced with the soldier's
   lance, and forthwith there flowed out blood and water, wherewith Thou
   mightest wash and quicken our souls; Thou didst will, O my most beloved
   one, that Thy sweet heart should be wounded for my sake. O mayest Thou
   wound my heart with the lance of Thy most piercing love, so that I may
   have no will but Thine; lead my soul, O Lord, lead it through the wound
   in Thy side, into the secret recesses of Thy love, into the
   treasure-house of Thy divinity; that I may with gladness glorify Thee,
   my God, who wert crucified and diedest for me; and that all ideas of
   visible things being blotted out from my remembrance, my intention may
   be fixed in Thee alone. Lo! I salute with all the devotion in my power,
   Thy five principal wounds. Hail! O Hail, ye ruddy glorious and most
   sweet wounds of my Redeemer and my King! Hail, precious seals of my
   reconciliation and salvation, I ask to dwell and lie concealed within
   ye, and thus shall I be secure from all evil.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who wert taken down from the cross amidst the bitter lamentation of Thy
   friends, and didst vouchsafe to be anointed with spices and ointments,
   to be wrapt in a linen cloth, and to be laid in another's sepulchre.
   Bury within Thyself, I beseech Thee, all my senses, my strength, my
   affections, so that being joined to Thee by the power of Thy love, I
   may become insensible to every thing else, and may care to know and
   feel nought save Thee, my only Redeemer, Thee, my soul's only good.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who, having crushed the power of the devil, didst descend as to Thy
   soul in might and love to the abodes below, and didst gladden by Thy
   presence the ancient fathers who were there detained, and didst bring
   them out into the blessed abodes of Paradise, and to the full vision of
   God. May the virtue of Thy passion and blood descend, I beseech Thee,
   now into purgatory upon the souls of my parents, relations, friends,
   and benefactors, and all the faithful departed, that, delivered from
   punishment, they may be received into the bosom of everlasting peace.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who camest forth a Conqueror from the closed and sealed tomb, and didst
   rise in glorious triumph from the dead, and having received again that
   most bright serenity of countenance, didst pour upon the hearts of Thy
   friends exceeding gladness. Grant, O Lord, that I may rise from the
   sins of my former conversation, and may walk in newness of life, that I
   may seek those things which are above, that I may relish those alone,
   and nothing which savours of this earth, so that when Thou that art my
   life shall appear, I may also appear with Thee in glory.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who when the forty days after Thy resurrection were accomplished, didst
   ascend all glorious in the presence of Thy disciples into heaven, where
   Thou sittest at the right hand of the Father blessed for ever. O that
   my soul may ever languish for love of Thee! O may I have no taste for
   things of this world; but may I, with mine eyes fixed on Thee, sigh and
   hunger, and thirst after Thee alone! O may nothing affect me, may
   nothing give me any joy save Thou, my Lord and my God.

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who didst give Thy Holy Spirit to Thy chosen disciples as they were
   persevering in prayer, and didst send them forth into all the world to
   teach all nations. Cleanse, I beseech Thee, the inmost of my heart:
   grant me true purity and steadfastness of soul, that the Comforter may
   find a fitting abode within my breast, and may enrich me with the
   abundant treasures of His grace, may console and strengthen me, may
   fill and govern me, and wholly take possession of me.-

   Hail, sweet Jesus! Praise, and honour, and glory be to Thee, O Christ,
   who at the last day shalt come again as Judge, to render to every man
   reward or punishment according to his works. O most holy Lord, O my
   God, give me grace tango through the course of this miserable life with
   such innocence and conformity to Thy will, that when my soul shall quit
   the prison-house of this body, clad with Thy merits and Thy virtues, it
   may be mercifully received by Thee into heaven, where, with all Thy
   saints, it may laud and bless Thy name for ever and ever. Amen,
     __________________________________________________________________

   This Exercise may be used daily after each of the foregoing ones with
   great spiritual profit and advancement.

   SWEET Jesus! Alas! I have grievously offended Thee through the whole
   course of my life; I have never ceased to be ungrateful to Thee,
   hindering in many ways the workings of Thy grace, and continually
   adding new sins to old ones. My sins are many and very great, but Thy
   mercy is vast and infinite. I confess that I am altogether unworthy to
   be called Thy son, but yet I acknowledge Thee as my Father. Thou art my
   true Father; Thou art all my confidence; Thou art the fountain of
   mercy, who dost not reject poor sin-stained souls when they fly unto
   Thee, but dost mercifully wash them. Behold, O Thou that art my
   sweetest refuge, behold, I, the very off-scouring of all Thy creatures,
   come unto Thee, bringing nought with me save thee, burden of my sins. I
   humbly cast myself at the feet of Thy love; I humbly implore Thy mercy:
   pardon me, I beseech Thee, Thou that art my surest hope, and save me
   for Thy name's sake. For I believe that there are no sins, however
   dreadful and enormous, but can be expiated by the merits of Thy most
   sacred passion.

   Sweet Jesus! I offer to Thee for the remission of my sins that
   stupendous love by which Thou, the God of everlasting majesty, didst
   not disdain to become man, and capable of suffering for our sakes, and
   for more than thirty years, didst undergo the pain and weariness of
   labours and persecutions. I offer Thee that agony, that bloody sweat,
   that anguish of soul with which Thou wert afflicted, when on bended
   knees, Thou prayedst in the garden to Thy heavenly Father. I offer Thee
   that exceeding desire of suffering with which Thou didst burn, when, of
   Thine own accord, Thou gayest Thyself up into the hands of Thine
   enemies. I offer Thee the bands, the stripes, the reproaches; the
   slanders, the blasphemies, the blows, the smitings on the cheek, the
   spitting, and every other injury which, for a whole. night, Thou didst
   endure in the house of Annas and Caiaphas. These I. offer unto Thee
   with thanksgiving, beseeching Thine infinite goodness, that by the
   merits of all these Thy sufferings, Thou wouldest cleanse my soul and
   bring me to everlasting life.

   Sweet Jesus! I offer unto Thee for all mine iniquities that unheard-of
   shame which Thou didst bear when Thou wert led in the morning to
   Pilate, with blows and spittings, and bound with chains; then from him
   to Herod, and again from Herod to Pilate. I offer Thee that most holy
   silence which Thou didst observe when they wantonly insulted and
   slandered Thee. I offer Thee the scorn, and the shame of that
   ridiculous garment, with which Herod overwhelmed Thee. I offer Thee
   that most bitter punishment which Thou didst endure when Thou wert
   bound to a pillar and scourged. I offer Thee those gashes which the
   scourging made in Thy flesh, those streams of purple blood which gushed
   forth on all sides from Thy most holy limbs. These I offer unto Thee
   with thanksgiving, beseeching Thine infinite goodness, that for the
   merits of all these Thy sufferings, Thou wouldst cleanse my soul and
   bring me to everlasting life.

   Sweet Jesus! I offer Thee for all my crimes, those most dreadful
   agonies, which Thou didst suffer when the wounds on Thy most holy body
   were opened afresh by the pulling off of Thy garments, when Thy hands
   and feet were fastened to the cross, when the joints of Thy limbs were
   loosened, when Thy precious blood gushed forth in streams from Thy
   sacred wounds as from a fountain. I offer Thee each drop of that ruddy
   blood. I offer Thee that incomprehensible gentleness and kindness with
   which Thou didst most patiently bear the wanton insults of Thine
   enemies, so that Thou didst even beseech Thy Father in their behalf.
   All this I offer unto Thee with thanksgiving, beseeching Thine infinite
   goodness that for the merits of all these Thy sufferings, Thou wouldst
   cleanse my soul and bring me to everlasting life.

   Sweet Jesus! I offer Thee for all my faults, my vanity, my negligences,
   and my distractions, those incomprehensible torments which Thou didst
   endure when exposed in every way to anguish, and bereft of all
   consolation, Thou wert hanging shamefully upon the cross between two
   thieves, and when burning with excessive thirst they gave Thee to drink
   vinegar and gall. I offer Thee that most perfect charity by which Thou
   didst bend Thine adorable head, and for our sakes didst give up the
   ghost. I offer Thee that precious blood and life-giving water which
   flowed from Thy side when pierced with the lance. All this I offer unto
   Thee with thanksgiving, beseeching Thine infinite goodness, that for
   the merits of these Thy sufferings, Thou wouldst cleanse my soul and
   lead me to everlasting life.

   Sweet Jesus! I offer Thee, for the entire remission of all the sins
   that I have over at any time of my life committed against Thee, I offer
   Thee all the mysteries of our redemption which Thou hast accomplished;
   I offer Thee Thine incarnation, Thy nativity, Thy life, Thy passion,
   and Thy death, I offer Thee whatsoever was pleasing to Thee in Mary Thy
   most glorious Mother, and in all. Thy Saints. Ah! sweetest Jesus! may
   Thy most perfect innocence satisfy Thy Father for my sins. Wrap my
   whole life, unworthy and exceedingly wicked as it is, in the clean
   linen cloth of Thy merits, that what is unclean in me, when united to
   Thee, may become clean, and what is imperfect may be made perfect when
   joined to Thee. And thus may I please Thee during the course of this
   life, and when my miserable pilgrimage is accomplished, may I come to
   Thee who art eternal salvation. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

SUNDAY.

   O MY beloved Jesus, my sweet Redeemer! wash, I beseech Thee, my soul in
   Thy blood, and blot out all my sins. Quench and mortify within me
   whatever is displeasing in Thy sight: for I desire to please Thee and
   to love Thee with my whole heart. Adorn me with the merits and virtues
   of Thy most holy humanity. Create in me a clean heart, and renew a
   right spirit within me. Gave me a quiet mind, clear and bright, like
   the blue of heaven; excite in me the desire of holy love. May Thy
   heavenly breath breathe over the length and breadth of my heart, that
   its icy stupidity being thawed, the odours of Thy grace may abound
   within it,

   O depth of love! O Jesus, my God and my joy! O ancient Light! O Light
   of immeasurable loveliness, enlighten my mind with the ineffable
   brightness of Thy beaming calmness. Shine upon me, sighing after Thee,
   that the shades of death may not encompass me. Behold, O Lord, behold I
   desire to love Thee with the whole strength of my heart; help mine
   infirmity, and grant that I may taste the honied sweetness of the
   outpourings of Thy love. Inflame and thoroughly enkindle me with the
   fire of Thy love.

   O my Lord, I adore Thee, I worship Thee, I glorify Thee, by all means
   that are in my power: Thou art the beauty of the heavens; Thou art the
   loveliness of the firmament; Thou art sweet to the taste, and fragrant
   to the smell; Thou art grateful to the hearing; and in Thine embraces
   there is ineffable delight; Thou art all calmness; Thou art ever
   blooming; Thou art wholly to be loved, and wholly to be desired; Thou
   art the life, the honour, the comfort of my soul, and my only good.
   Anoint, I beseech Thee, the inmost of my heart with the sweet ointment
   of Thy grace, that overflowing with the delights of holy love, I may be
   a sweet sacrifice in Thy sight, and may for ever please Thee.

   I wholly commend myself to Thee, O Thou that art my confidence; I offer
   myself entirely unto Thee, O my most sure hope; I cast myself upon
   Thee, Thou that art my only salvation. Enlighten, teach, direct, and
   entirely possess me. Incline Thine ear of mercy, O Lord, to the
   complaints of Thy poor little one that calleth upon Thee; one thing I
   ask, one thing I earnestly beg of Thee; may the love of Thee so burn
   within me, may the overflowings of perfect charity so take possession
   of the inmost of my soul, that I may sing sweet melodies unto Thee in
   my heart.

   O strength unvanquished, and everlasting firmament! Jesus Christ, whose
   love overcomes the sharpness of death, quicken, confirm, and strengthen
   my whole soul in Thee. May the sweet fragrance of Thy love breathe upon
   me in all inward troubles and poorness of spirit; that, gladdened by
   the remembrance of Thy sweetness, I may be strong and faint not. Adorn
   the garden of my heart with the flowers of most holy charity, that when
   Thou comest down into it, Thou mayest find it beauteous in Thy sight.

   O good Jesus! O heavenly Spouse of surpassing beauty! O most silent
   comforter of holy souls, who dost protect in dangers those that trust
   in Thee, hiding them under the shadow of Thy wings, who in time of
   sorrow dost refresh with the sweetness of Thy spiritual delights those
   that love Thee; kindle my heart with that fire which Thou didst come on
   earth to send, and didst will that it should burn exceedingly, that I
   may love Thee from the depths of my inmost soul.

   O dazzling Fire! O devouring and consuming Fire! How brightly dost Thou
   shine though unseen, how sweetly dost Thou burn. After Thee alone do I
   thirst, O my Jesus; for Thee alone do I hunger, for Thee do I cry out
   with great longings of heart, exceedingly desiring to see Thy most
   gracious countenance. Nothing is so sweet to me as to be with Thee, and
   to cleave unto Thee. O may I at all times and in all places stand
   before Thee with a pure heart, that perfectly loving Thee, I may
   joyfully embrace Thee with the arms of my soul. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

MONDAY.

   DRAW me after Thyself, O my God, disentangle my heart from the love of
   creatures, and lift it up to Thee, who art over all things, and in all
   things. O may the noise of this fleeting world be silent in my ears,
   may vain imaginations, and fancies, and all distraction of thought be
   far from me. May my soul pass by all sensible delights, and fix the
   eyes of faith on Thee, her Creator, who art every where present. Grant,
   O Lord, that I may rest on Thee alone, and may find no delight, and
   seek for no consolation save in Thee.

   O most lovely Jesus, pierce the inmost of my soul with the sweetest
   dart of Thy love; penetrate me through and through with the fire of
   charity; transfix my spirit with Thy sharpest arrows, that, wounded by
   Thee, I may languish for Thy love, and may swoon away as it were on
   Thee, and so be intimately united to Thee, to the glory of Thy name. O
   may Thy sweetest perfumes be wafted on my heart, and may the
   unspeakable fragrance of Thy love be so outpoured upon me, that it may
   excite within me everlasting longings after Thee.

   O most gracious Jesus, give me true contrition of heart, and floods of
   tears that may be pleasing in Thy sight. Grant that I may ever behave
   myself in Thy presence with great reverence, and have Thee continually
   in my heart, and in my mouth, and before mine eyes, and thus may no
   room be found within me for strange love. Grant, that, being wholly
   filled with the sweetness of Thy most holy charity, and consumed by the
   fire of Thy love I may love Thee, my God, with my whole heart, and with
   all the force of my inmost soul.

   I love Thee, O my Jesus, and I desire to love Thee more and more. Give
   me grace, by the power of Thy love, to shake off from me every weight
   of earthly affection, and to run after the sweetness of Thy delights.
   Write on the tablet of my heart a holy remembrance of Thyself, that I
   may indulge in no carnal or unworthy thoughts, but may seek after Thee
   alone; and ever feel the presence of Thy grace within me.

   O fountain of mercy, whose streams never cease to flow, come and give
   Thyself unto my soul. For Thee do I long with my whole heart, the whole
   intention of my mind is fixed on Thee. Grant that I may love Thee with
   such purity, courage, and steadfastness, that Thou mayest wholly fill
   me, and change me into Thyself, and thus may I be continually a
   sacrifice of sweet savour ever acceptable unto Thee.

   O eternal Shepherd, feed Thy poor famished beggar, enlighten the
   darkness of my soul with the brightness of Thy presence; enkindle the
   coldness of my heart with the fire of Thy love. May the sweet violence
   of Thy charity absorb, and purify, and penetrate my whole soul, and may
   the flame of chaste affections so seize my inmost heart, that I may
   think on Thee, long after Thee, and cleave unto Thee for ever.

   I call upon Thee, O my God, I cry after Thee, my salvation, with all
   the powers of my soul. Come into my inmost heart: fit my soul unto
   Thyself, so that Thou mayest possess it wholly without spot, for a
   clean dwelling becomes Thee, who art the Lord of all purity. Grant that
   I may be wholly enkindled with Thy love, that I may lose myself in
   Thee, and know Thee, and feel Thee alone, and rejoice and rest in Thee.
   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

TUESDAY.

   SANCTIFY, O Lord, I beseech Thee, my heart which Thou hast created, and
   cast out from it all wickedness, fill it and keep it filled with Thy
   grace, that I may be made a temple worthy for Thee to dwell in, Thou
   that art sweeter than honey, brighter than the sun, more pleasant to
   the taste than nectar, more precious than gold and fine jewels. O
   mayest Thou alone give pleasure to my soul, mayest Thou be the only
   object of my earnest longings and desire.

   O pleasant calmness! O calm delight! O Thou most gladsome light, which
   lighteneth every man that cometh into the world! shake off the darkness
   from my soul, enlighten my mind, that I may know myself and Thee, and
   may love Thee more than myself. May I love Thee, sweet Jesus, above
   heaven and earth, and all things that are therein; mayest Thou alone be
   my only aim, and Thou the single desire of my heart. May I meditate on
   Thee by. day, with a ready and grateful heart; may I think on Thee by
   night when I am asleep, and may my soul at all times hold sweet
   converse with Thee.

   O true-love! O lovely truth! O everlasting God! I desire to cleave unto
   Thee, my thoughts are fixed on Thee, I pant after Thee, I sigh for
   Thee, I seek Thee; Thee do I desire to embrace, in Thee alone do I wish
   to find any consolation. So do I. desire to leave all save Thee alone,
   as if my . soul were separated from the body and stood before Thee, and
   enjoyed in all perfection, the amiable presence of Thy countenance.

   O my sweetest Lord God, give rest to the wearied, strengthen the
   feeble, feed the hungry, gather the dispersed abroad, heal the maimed,
   open to him that knocks, stretch forth the hand of Thy goodness to me,
   Thy wretched creature; bid me come unto Thee, bid me remain with Thee,
   may my soul forget itself, may it, whether in prosperity or adversity,
   cleave inseparably. unto Thee, and thoroughly refuse all other
   consolation.

   O light which always shineth and never groweth dull, do Thou enlighten
   me; O fire ever burning and that never waneth, do Thou enkindle me. O
   love that art ever burning, and that never groweth lukewarm, do Thou
   absorb and transform me into Thyself. Grant that I may long unceasingly
   after Thee. with my whole heart. May my every breath be drawn in Thee,
   who art full of sweetness. O Thou that art my joy, engladden my soul.
   Come into it, O Thou that art sweetness itself, let it taste of Thy
   delights, and find no pleasure save in Thee.

   O Lord, comfort me in my affliction, pour into my heart the streams of
   Thy holy love. May the unspeakable virtue of Thy love penetrate and
   take possession of the inmost of my soul.

   Great is my weariness in this my pilgrimage, great is my toil during
   the troubles of this present world. Grant that with renewed strength I
   may fly up to Thee on the wings of pure contemplation, even to the
   place where Thy glory dwelleth. May I there rest under the shadow of
   Thy wings, far from the noise and tumult of earthly thoughts that
   trouble me.

   Wound, O my Lord, wound the very inmost of my inward man, with the dart
   of Thy love, and kindle the marrow of my drooping soul with Thy
   life-giving flame. Write with Thy finger on my breast a sweet
   remembrance of Thyself, which no forgetfulness may obliterate. O may I
   seek and follow Thee for ever, may I find Thee and for all eternity
   delight in nought but Thee. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

WEDNESDAY.

   CAST Thy bright beams upon my heart, O Thou that art the light of mine
   eyes; give Thyself unto me, O life of my soul, my exceeding delight, my
   much desired consolation. Thou that art my sweet rest, my glory, my
   honour and my only desire; may I hold Thee, Thou that art the object of
   all my wishes; may I draw Thee closely to myself, O heavenly spouse.
   May I feel Thee within and without, O Thou that art my glory; may I
   possess Thee, O blessed one, from all eternity; may I enjoy Thee within
   my heart, O everlasting life.

   O that I may love Thee, O Lord my strength; may I love Thee, my God, my
   refuge, and my deliverer. May I cleave to Thee, O my sweet hope, in
   every trouble; may I embrace Thee, O Thou everlasting good, apart from
   whom there is nothing good. Open the recessess of my ears, O word
   sharper than a two-edged sword, that I may hear Thy voice within me,
   and having heard it that I may live and rejoice in Thee.

   Visit the forsaken, console the mourner, O my Jesus, show to the
   wretched one the bowels of Thy mercy. Grant me Thy grace which may
   plunge me in Thy love, wholly crucified to this world; blind my eyes, O
   light unfathomable, blind my eyes with the rays of Thy brightness, that
   they behold no vanity. Strike them with the sweet lightning of Thy
   divinity, and grant that with heartfelt tears, I may seek Thee day and
   night.

   Give me sight, O Lord my God, that I may every where behold Thy lovely
   countenance: give me hearing to listen always to Thy sweetest voice:
   give me smelling whereby I may perceive the odour of Thy pace: heal my
   taste that I may relish the abundance of Thy sweetness. Give me a heart
   to fear Thee, a memory to be ever recollected in Thee, a will to cleave
   unswervingly unto Thee, that art the chiefest good. May my whole spirit
   be possessed by Thee alone, and rest for ever in Thee.

   May the mighty force, I beseech Thee, of Thy love wean my heart from
   every thing that is under heaven. Grant that I may burn with such a
   perfect charity, which no torrents of waters could quench within me.
   Grant that for the greatness of my love for Thee, I may thoroughly
   forget all transitory things, and that I may never improperly grieve
   for them, nor foolishly rejoice because of them, but may I be
   strengthened and rest in Thee alone.

   May all vicious affections, O Lord, wither within my heart, may all
   desires of the flesh die within me, that Thou alone mayest dwell in me,
   and the burning coals of holy desires be ever kindled in my inmost
   soul. Wound, O Lord, wound my sinful soul with the sharpest weapon of
   perfect charity pierce it with the darts of Thy most fervent love, that
   I may have the happiness to be smitten by Thee, and to breathe forth my
   soul as it were within Thy arms. Ah! most pleasant depth of inestimable
   pleasures, ravish and absorb my spirit in Thine. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

THURSDAY.

   RECEIVE me, O sweet Jesus, to the embraces of Thy sweetest love, by
   which my cold and drooping spirit may be inflamed and bound to Thee.
   Open unto me, O Lord, open to one that knocketh, and admit my orphan
   soul unto the sweet conclave of Thy divine heart. O my beloved, my
   beloved, I long after Thee, I desire Thee; introduce me to Thyself, and
   come Thou unto me, that I may be Thine, and Thou mayest be mine for
   ever and ever.

   May I draw from Thee, Thou fountain of honied sweetness, living water,
   by the very taste of which may I never thirst again save for Thee:
   sprinkle me with the dew of heavenly wisdom, so that, being penetrated
   with it, I may keep myself pure from all .earthly desires.

   Bless, I beseech Thee, bless this poor and piteous exile, O most
   bounteous God; kindle my inmost heart with the fire of Thy love, that I
   may perfectly love Thee, and desire nought but Thee. Hide me, O Thou
   dearest of all dear ones, hide me in the lovely, pleasant, and sweet
   opening of Thy side, that I may sweetly sleep in Thee, and be warmed to
   life again, by the influence of Thy honied love. I offer and give
   myself up wholly unto Thee: take Thou me up and wholly possess me, O
   sweet comfort of my soul: so join me, so fasten me unto Thyself, that I
   may never be separated from Thee: so give Thyself, so communicate
   Thyself unto me, that I may for ever rejoice in Thy most Holy Spirit,
   to the praise of Thy name.

   O my Lord, O that Thou wouldst vouchsafe to open the inner room of Thy
   love to me, the vilest, the most unworthy of sinners, and admit me to
   the sanctuary of Thy sweetest heart. For my soul desireth exceedingly
   to be united unto Thee, in the closest ties of love. But never would
   there be in me any desire of loving, didst not Thou implant it in my
   heart. May I therefore obtain through Thee, what I desire of Thee, O
   day of vernal calmness. O my God! I thirst after Thee, I sigh for Thee,
   I languish for love of Thee. Join me closer to Thyself, O Thou most
   brilliant sun, that, by the heat of Thy countenance, the flowers of
   holy charity may bud forth in the soil of my heart. Light within me the
   lamp of Thy love, pour upon my heart Thy soothing peace, and in all
   things unite me to Thy grace, that I may please Thee.

   O my Jesus, clothe me in the brilliant purple of Thy precious blood:
   crown me with the sparkling diadem of Thy death, and receive me into
   the fragrant chamber of Thy love. Remove from me whatsoever is
   displeasing unto Thee. Re-fashion my wicked, unclean, and vain heart
   according to Thine. Give me simple affections and a pure mind; embrace
   me with the arms of Thy love; draw me closely within the embraces of
   Thy divinity, that my soul may wholly melt away through the force of
   Thy burning love, and pour itself forth into the depths of Thy heavenly
   delights. Thy sweetness, O Lord, Thy goodness, Thy beauty, Thy
   loveliness, exceedingly entice me unto Thee: but unless Thou lettest
   Thyself down to me, I cannot ascend unto Thee. Bend Thyself, therefore,
   O fountain of mercy, unto the valley of my misery, that I may love Thee
   with all my heart, with all my soul, and with all my strength.

   Ah! Jesus! my honour, my joy, and my true pleasure: kindle, I beseech
   Thee, such a fire in my inmost heart, that I may henceforth choose
   nothing under the sun save Thee, nor desire aught but Thee. May the
   heaven and earth and all that are therein, be to me without Thee but a
   winter ice-drop. O most lovely flower! O my beloved Jesus! Adorn my
   soul with that graceful charity in which Thou delightest; enrich it
   with the plenteousness of that love which is pleasing unto Thee. So
   smooth and burnish my heart, that nothing earthly may be able to cleave
   unto it. May the droppings of Thy blessing flow continually upon me, by
   which I may be washed and cleansed from all the filth of sin, and may
   for ever bring forth the fruits of holiness well pleasing unto Thee.

   O sweet light of my soul, shine upon me, that the thick shades of my
   blindness may be turned into the brightness of noon-day. Grant me to
   repose under the shadow of Thy charity; suffer me to slumber on the
   bosom of Thy love, and there to forget entirely all earthly things. May
   nothing be more pleasant, nothing more profitable to me than to love
   Thee, and to be intimately united to Thee. Press me to Thy divine
   heart, and may I lose myself in the enjoyment of the freshness of Thy
   delights. Ah, sweetest fire! my God, consume and entirely devour my
   whole substance, which is but a grain of dust. Transfer my heart unto
   Thyself, that I may cleave unto Thee with the closest union, and live
   by Thee, and flourish for ever like a lily in Thy presence.

   O sea of all sweetness, let the waters of Thy goodness fall upon my
   soul; open the fountains of the great deep, and let the waves of Thy
   mercy flow in upon me. Drown me in the deluge of Thy lively love, may
   the depth of Thy blessed charity absorb me. Break down, O Lord, the
   hateful wall of my wicked and lukewarm life: and grant that I may
   follow Thee with a love that nothing can quench. Send forth the blast
   of Thy most fervent love, which may impel me so violently unto Thee,
   that, carried out of myself, and dead as it were to myself, I may
   henceforth never draw even a single breath apart from Thee. Imprint on
   me the kiss of Thy forgiveness, that being sealed by it, I may love
   nothing henceforth but Thee: for Thou art my possession, Thou art my
   inheritance, Thou art the only expectation of my soul. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

FRIDAY.

   SWEET Jesus! may Thy holy love surround me, as a graceful garment, that
   I may not come into Thy presence unclad, but adorned with Thy grace.
   Raise me aloft by the power of Thy love, to divine contemplation: carry
   my spirit to the heights of the everlasting hills, that I be not
   involved in the darkness of this world, far away from Thee.

   Gladden my sorrowing heart, by the wished-for presence of Thy grace.
   Send forth Thy most gladsome light, that my inmost soul may be renewed
   by its rays to joyousness of spirit. Be present in my heart, be present
   in my mouth, be present in every deed, and in my daily duties; for I
   earnestly long for Thee, and I pine away through my eager expectation
   of Thy coming.

   O Lord, who hast entirely created and redeemed me, and hast a hundred
   thousand times brought me out when I was wholly lost, from the jaws of
   hell: give me grace to love Thee with the whole strength of my soul,
   because Thou hast first loved me. Inebriate me with the sober abundance
   of Thy love, that, detained here only as to my body, I may fly unto
   Thee, my only treasure, with a free unburdened soul.

   O my Jesus, so strike, I beseech Thee, my soul with the sweetest
   violence of Thy love, that, overcome by holy fervour and amazement, and
   ravished out of itself, it may happily pass unto Thee. O Lord, may my
   whole spirit and body, and my very life praise Thee, that I may be an
   acceptable sacrifice unto Thee, every moment that I enjoy the gifts of
   Thy mercy.

   O love that sweetly bindest and joinest all unto Thyself; O love that
   gently woundest and penetratest inmost souls; O love that wonderfully
   makest them to languish and faint in Thee; O Jesus Christ my God, come
   and tarry not, for continually do I desire Thee, and my spirit pants
   after Thee, with deep groans and piercing sighs.

   Enlarge my heart, O Lord, with the immensity of Thy sweet love, and
   raise it to that abyss of Thy dazzling light, that by rapid
   contemplation it may even touch Thee, the eternal wisdom; mercifully
   look down upon me, struggling in the midst of the troubles of this
   life. Place my weary soul in the spots of that wished-for pasture, and
   by those purest streams of Thy pleasures, that quickened there by the
   warmth of heavenly delights, it may soon forget all its miseries.

   O Thou that art every good, Christ Jesus, excite within me most ardent
   desires, that I may always seek after Thee, and continually sigh for
   the blessed abodes of my everlasting country.

   O Thou that art my only salvation, may I love Thee more than myself,
   and myself only in Thee and for Thee. May Thy holy love overshadow me;
   may my soul, enticed by Thy sweetness, wholly melt away through love;
   and going out of itself, and passing wholly into Thee, may it taste of
   the crumbs of those unspeakable banquets, and the smallest drops of
   those incomprehensible delights, which Thou hast prepared for them that
   love Thee.

   O my God and my all, may my soul, I beseech Thee, seek for nothing but
   Thee, may it even forsake itself for Thee, may it long after Thee, and
   be inflamed with Thy love; that, carried out of itself, and absorbed in
   the abyss of the riches of Thy glory, perceiving may it not perceive,
   and understanding may it not understand, but sleep entranced in Thee,
   and be joined to Thee by pure love. May my sighs and manifold sorrows
   on this earth move Thee; O my Lord, grant that meanwhile, during the
   toil and misery of this present exile, I may find refreshment and rest
   in Thee, and that whenever I shall put off this body, then may I be
   received into heaven by Thee. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

SATURDAY.

   O LORD, I have loved the glory of Thine house, the Strength of my soul
   faints within me when I call to mind the brightness and riches of Thy
   kingdom, and the everlasting happiness which the blessed enjoy there.
   For one day with Thee is better than a thousand here, with Thee, and in
   Thee, is every good. O when shall I come and appear before Thy dazzling
   and gracious face, when wilt Thou satisfy the desires of my soul with
   the presence of Thy divine countenance? O love of my heart, my God,
   when shall I perfectly possess Thee? when wilt Thou unite me more
   closely unto Thyself, that I may clearly see Thee? when wilt thou draw
   me to Thyself, all snares being broken, and dangers and temptations
   removed, so that I may be no longer stained with sin or offend Thee
   more, but may sing in safety a hymn to Thy majesty, to extol the
   multitude of Thy mercies? Ah! my beloved one, raise me from the dust,
   poor as I am, and in misery; lead me forth when it shall please thee
   from my prison, and carry me up mercifully into heaven, that there my
   soul may with never-ending songs of joy praise and thank Thee for all
   the benefits which Thou, my only salvation, hast freely bestowed upon
   me.

   Sweet Jesus! O most blessed life, my heart pants and burns for Thee:
   for Thou art great, and exceedingly to be praised: Thou art all
   beautiful, and overflowing with unspeakable delights. O when shall I
   contemplate Thee face to face? O when shall I see Thee, Thou that are
   lovely beyond all men and angels? Thine unspeakable loveliness, O Lord,
   very greatly invites and draws me unto Thee, and excites within me
   chaste desires. Thy pleasant and admirable light, and Thy dazzling
   brightness, wonderfully gladden my spirit. Already is this corruptible
   body to me like a most sorrowful shell, and gladly would I choose to
   put it off, and throw it aside by death, so that my soul, that grain
   which is so dear unto Thee, might be gathered into Thy heavenly garner,
   and be ever with Thee, its true possessor. Ah! Thou beloved object of
   my wishes, listen to the voice of my prayer, for I seek Thee with a
   sighing heart, and I long to contemplate openly the spring-like
   loveliness of Thy divinity. The clear vision of Thee, O Lord,
   infinitely surpasses all beauty, and every delight which eye hath seen
   in this world, or ear heard, or hath entered into the heart of man to
   conceive. O when wilt Thou show Thyself unto me? When wilt Thou fill me
   with joy by the sight of Thy desirable countenance? When wilt Thou
   fully enlighten me with the wished-for rays of Thy divine brightness?
   When wilt Thou cause me to drink and fill myself with the torrent of
   Thy sweetest pleasures? When shall I gently embrace Thee, Thou spouse
   of my soul, and kiss Thee, and praise Thee, with Thy Saints in those
   realms above of joy and happiness? Behold, my soul is weary, and faints
   for love of Thee. Ah! my God, have mercy upon me, listen to my manifold
   groanings, and grant that, as soon as I shall put off this body, I may
   quickly come to Thee, and may glorify Thee for all eternity: since for
   this end hast Thou created and redeemed me.

   O my sweetest God, I earnestly desire to be with Thee, and to behold
   Thy lovely face. And when will that happen unto me? When shall I return
   from this exile into that true and heavenly country? O blessed land,
   where light is ever shining in perfect calmness, where spring with all
   its loveliness, and summer with its delights, endure for ever; where
   verdure ever lasteth, and the most lovely flowers never fade; where the
   sweetest perfumes are ever breathing, and the wondrous melody of songs,
   and well-tuned instruments, is echoed forth for ever and ever. O Lord,
   with Thee is there a Paradise of intellectual delights, a Paradise
   greatly to be desired, flowing unceasingly with streams of purest
   pleasures, and soothing all around with the unspeakable loveliness of
   every kind of beauty. With Thee is the fountain of life, and the lovely
   noon-day brightness, and the calm expanse of air, and the undisturbed
   peace. With Thee, and in Thee, there is found in all abundance, and in
   the highest degree, whatever can please or gratify the heart of man.
   What, therefore, do I wish for beside Thee? Thou art sufficient for me.
   Grant that I may love nought but Thee, and that at length I may fully
   possess Thee. Thou art my only true and unchangeable good.

   I believe, O Lord, that which I do not see. I believe that the riches,
   the delights, the pleasures of heaven, are immense and everlasting. I
   believe that Thou art the chiefest, and the uncreated loveliness and
   sweetness, from whom all that is lovely, all that is sweet, proceeds.
   Grant, O Lord, that by dwelling upon that which I believe, but do not
   see, I may one day be found meet to behold that which I believe. O my
   dear Jesus, when, I ask of Thee, shall my body be destroyed by Thee,
   and return again unto its dust, and my soul flow back unto Thee its
   original source? When shall I rest and sleep in Thee, O sweetest peace,
   and openly behold Thy ineffable glory? When will the sweet fragrance of
   Thy divinity waft itself upon me, and the everlasting day, when I shall
   see Thee for ever, dawn upon my soul? O how good, my beloved one, is it
   to see Thee clearly, to hold Thee, to possess Thee for ever and ever!
   Ah! grant unto me to end this miserable life happily in thy grace and
   friendship.

   O sweet Jesus, at the hour of my departure, bless Thou my soul, and
   unite my death to Thine, which is life, and the dearest pledge and
   firmest token of my reconciliation with Thee. Send to me at that hour,
   that faithful helper, the Virgin Mary, Thy beloved mother, that bright
   star of the sea, that, having seen this bright and lovely morning beam,
   I may know that Thou, the Sun of Righteousness, art near me. Say then
   unto my soul, I am thy Creator, thy Redeemer; thy lover, I have sought
   thee through the anguish of death and have found thee: fear not, thou
   shalt be ever with me.

   Ah! most lovely jewel of divine greatness, and most graceful flower of
   human dignity, my sweetest Jesus, do Thou mercifully receive me as I
   pass from hence into the blessed abode of everlasting peace, and of the
   brightness of Thy presence. There console me, O my salvation, with the
   sweetest sweetness of that presence. There re. fresh me with the taste
   of that dear price with which Thou didst redeem me. There overwhelm and
   penetrate me with the gentle gales of Thy sweet spirit. There plunge me
   by the kiss of perfect union with Thee, into the depths of perpetual
   enjoyment of Thee, and may I live by Thee, and rejoice in Thee, and
   offer Thee the sacrifice of praise, for ever and ever. Amen.

    TO

OUR BLESSED LADY.
     __________________________________________________________________

I.

   HAIL, sweet Mary! Hail, most Holy Virgin! whom God did choose from all
   eternity to be His Mother. Thou art that blessed mediatress between God
   and men, by whom what is lowest is united to that which is most
   sublime. Thou art the source of life; Thou art the gate of life; Thou
   art the haven from the shipwreck of this world. Obtain for me, I
   beseech Thee, perfect forgiveness of my sins, and the full grace of the
   Holy Spirit, that I may with all diligence serve, and most ardently
   love, Thy Son, my Saviour, and Thee, the Mother of mercy.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whom, prefigured under many types and images, and
   promised by divers sayings of the prophets, the ancient fathers sighed
   after with earnest longings. Take me, O my Lady, for Thy poor servant:
   adopt me, O my Mother, for Thy son. Grant that I may be amongst the
   number of those who are written in the remembrance of Thy virgin heart,
   and whom Thou dost teach, direct, and cherish, and love.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whom God did honour with so great a privilege as to
   preserve Thee free from original sin, and whom He adorned with singular
   graces, and precious gifts. O Virgin most renowned! O Virgin most
   peaceful! O Virgin most pure! O Thou who art the one chosen child among
   a thousand, reject me not by reason of mine iniquities, and because I
   am stained with the filth of sin; but hear me crying out to Thee in
   misery: comfort me who earnestly desire Thee, and help me, for I hope
   in Thee.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whose birth was for ages desired and expected by the
   nations; Thou didst enlighten the world with a new light, and didst
   gladden it with an unheard of joy. O tender Virgin of most perfect
   innocence! obtain for me true holiness of life: remove from me whatever
   is displeasing to Thy virgin eyes. Have pity on me, O Lady, have pity
   upon me: for Thy compassion increased with Thy tender years.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whom the Lord adorned with every beauty of form, and
   with all virtues, and made most lovely. O most elegant, O most graceful
   Virgin! adorn, I beseech Thee, my soul with spiritual beauty: implant
   in my heart the lively affections of holy chastity, that I may please
   Thee, and render unto Thee acceptable service.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whom Thy holy parents brought into the temple and
   offered to the Lord, and gave up entirely to the divine service. There
   didst Thou lead an angel's life, all humble, all pious, all meek, all
   kind, and didst wonderfully entice all that beheld Thee to purity and
   integrity of life. Obtain for me the grace of showing forth before all
   men the sweet odour of a holy life like unto Thine, that, as far as in
   me lies, I may annoy no one, may give no offence; but may comfort all
   men, and invite them to the love of God, and contempt of the world.

   Hail, sweet Mary! hail, Thou that art the first fruits of virgins, who
   didst consecrate Thyself entirely to God, and with a grateful heart
   didst offer to Him Thy vow of virginity. Thou art the perfect example
   of modesty and all sanctity: Thou art that Virgin, at once most
   beautiful, and that inspireth none but the chastest love, whose most
   pure and perfect manner of life penetrated the hearts of those that saw
   it, as it were with a ray of light from heaven, and made them at once
   more chaste. Obtain for me, I beseech Thee, a clean heart and body,
   that I may never cherish within me anything that is impure, or
   entertain any vicious thought, or give consent to any enticement of
   evil desire; but passing by, both in my heart and in my reason, all the
   incitements of the flesh, may I rejoice and rest in God alone.
     __________________________________________________________________

II.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whom, as Thou went giving Thyself up to holy
   exercises and contemplations, Almighty God did console with the
   frequent visits and intercourse of angels, and with the unspeakable joy
   of a pure conscience. Obtain for me, I beseech Thee, through Thy
   merits, that I may love silence and quiet, and that I may be constant
   in prayer and other spiritual exercises, with a sincere heart, and a
   calm and cheerful spirit. May these be my dearest pleasures as long as
   I am detained in the wretched prison. house of this body.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who as a virgin wert betrothed by the divine counsels
   to the virgin Joseph, suffer me not, O Thou who art the comforter of
   hearts, suffer me not to wander far from Thee: look upon me with those
   benignant eyes of Thine, upon me who desire to please Thee. For as he
   cannot be saved and live for ever from whom Thou dost turn away Thy
   face, so he cannot perish everlastingly, whom, when he turns to Thee,
   Thou dost regard. Come out to meet me, O my Lady, as I seek for Thee,
   direct and preserve me, for I love Thee, and put my confidence in Thee.
   Be Thou ever propitious unto me, that I may find salvation through
   Thee.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whom when Thou wert intent on heavenly things, the
   angel Gabriel having secretly entered Thy chamber, did respectfully
   salute, and did instruct in the secrets of the divine counsels. O that
   I may frequently salute Thee, and ever be glad to pay Thee all due
   reverence. May nothing ever be found cleaving unto me which may
   displease Thy more than angelic countenance.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who by the power of the Holy Ghost, didst conceive in
   Thy most chaste womb the Son of God. O happiest of women! O what were
   Thy feelings at that moment in Thine inmost virgin breast? With what
   sweetness did Thy soul melt away for joy, when God, the Fountain and
   Source of all sweetness, entered the chamber of Thy womb, and took upon
   Him flesh of Thee? praise and glorify Thee, O Mary: I reverence in all
   humility Thy most holy womb. Preserve and increase in me the pious wish
   of serving Thee.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who, when Thou wert carrying the King of glory in Thy
   womb, didst ascend, by the counsel of the Holy Ghost, to the hill
   country of Judea to visit Thy kinswoman Elizabeth, and didst salute her
   and give her Thy services. Visit, I beseech Thee, my soul, and grant
   that I may most fervently serve Thee all the days of my life, and love
   Thee with the chastest love.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who didst not refuse to suffer a tedious journey in
   company with Thy most holy partner Joseph, when, though but a young
   girl, and withal with child, Thou didst go to Bethlehem. Obtain for me
   the grace to suffer patiently all the miseries of this exile, and
   continually to sigh after that heavenly Bethlehem where is the bread of
   life, Christ Jesus, the author of our salvation.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who, when wearied with the labours of Thy journey,
   hadst no place of abode! but didst meet with a stable for an inn.
   Direct all the affections of my soul, that I may love nothing wrongly
   in this world, may cleave to no sensible thing; but as a stranger and
   pilgrim having no abiding city here, may I sigh after the Eternal One
   with all my heart, and repose myself in my God alone.
     __________________________________________________________________

III.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who, amidst the rejoicings of the angels, didst bring
   forth the Saviour without pain or injury to Thy virginity. O Virgin
   Mother, Thou art the temple of the true Solomon, Thou art the ark of
   God and the mercy-seat, Thou art the closed door which Ezekiel saw,
   Thou art the closed garden and the sealed fountain. Fill, I beseech
   Thee, my heart and all my senses with heavenly grace, that a good
   spirit being renewed within me, I may lead a life that shall be
   well-pleasing to Thee and to Thy Son.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who didst wrap in swaddling clothes Jesus, the fruit
   of Thy most chaste womb, and didst place Him sobbing in the manger. O
   may the love of Thee so possess me, may purity of life be in me as in a
   new-born babe, that I may be meet to be assisted by Thee in whatever
   adversity, and to be refreshed by the sweet favour of Thy visits.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who didst nourish the infant Jesus from thy virgin
   breasts, and didst carry Him in Thy arms, and didst sweetly press Him
   to Thy bosom through Thy ardent love, and didst bathe Him with kisses.
   Grant that when I am cast down by the troubles and temptations of this
   exile, I may always take refuge in the bosom of Thy maternal goodness,
   and that, strengthened with the milk of spiritual consolation, I may
   eschew every impure delight.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who didst carefully watch over our Saviour's infancy
   and childhood with a mother's love, and didst follow Him with great
   devotion when He grew up to manhood, and began to preach the gospel.
   Grant that I may love and follow Thee, that I may long for Thy
   presence, and thoroughly despise all transitory things.

   Hail, sweet Mary! who wert afflicted with the keenest sorrow in thy
   inmost soul, by reason of the labours and persecutions, and the
   atrocious and most shameful Passion which Thy only-begotton Son
   endured. Grant that I may always praise Him, my God, for all that He
   has done anti suffered for my sake, and truly have pity on all who are
   in misery and trouble.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whose blessed soul the sword of grief did pierce,
   when Thou didst stand overwhelmed with tears under that cross on which
   Thy Son was hanging, and was suffering the most dreadful tortures, and
   shedding forth His blood, and breathing out His soul unto death. Grant
   that I may stand with Thee, and call to mind with a grateful heart the
   Passion and death of Jesus Thy only-begotten Son, my Redeemer.

   Hail, sweet Mary! whom Jesus Christ did gladden by His triumphant
   resurrection, and after His ascension to His Father, did take up with
   unspeakable glory into heaven, where Thou, O glorious Queen, dolt sit
   exalted above the angelic choirs. We humbly ask of Thee that Thou
   wouldest take the care of our salvation on Thyself, and wouldest
   mercifully plead for us by Thy prayers to Thy Son, the Judge of quick
   and dead. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

IV.

   Hail, most glorious Lady! Mary, most holy after God of all the Saints,
   who didst in wonderful manner, as a fruitful Virgin, and with virginal
   fecundity, bring forth Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world. Thou art
   the most acceptable temple of God. Thou art the venerable sanctuary of
   the Holy Ghost. Thou art the glorious resting-place of the adorable
   Trinity. Through Thee, O Lady, the whole world lives: at the
   remembrance of Thee the hearts of the faithful are refreshed and
   cheered. Graciously incline Thine ears, I beseech Thee, to the prayers
   of this Thy servant, this miserable sinner, and scatter by the rays of
   Thy holiness the darkness of my sins, that I may please Thee.

   Hail, most gracious mother of mercy! hail, O Mary greatly longed for,
   that obtainest for us pardon and grace! Who does not love Thee? Who
   does not honour Thee? for thou art a blessed light in doubt, a comfort
   in sorrow, a refreshment in anguish, a refuge in dangers and
   temptations. Thou, after Thy only-begotten Son, art the certain
   salvation of all the faithful. Thou art called, and truly Thou art, the
   most excellent of women, the most gracious of all, the loveliest of
   all. Blessed are they that love Thee, O Lady: Blessed are they that
   revere Thee: thrice and four times blessed are they who are intimately
   united to Thee by holiness of life, I commend to Thy goodness my soul
   and body: direct, teach, and protect me at every moment, in every hour,
   O my sweet refuge.

   Hail, Mary, majestic hall and splendid palace of the Eternal King!
   hail, Thou perfumed resting-place of the Divinity! Thou art that lovely
   woman, holy, prudent, generous, and elegant, and greatly to be revered.
   Thou art that Queen of heaven and earth, that cometh forth as the
   rising morn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, and terrible to the
   devils as an army set in array. Grant, O Lady, that, amidst the storms
   of this life, I may always wait for Thee, and that, despising all
   visible things, I may contemplate the loveliness and beauty of
   Paradise.

   Hail, Mary! most brilliant star, and brightest sunbeam, from whom did
   arise Christ our God, the sun of righteousness. Thou art that Virgin,
   lovely beyond all loveliness. Thou art that Mother, graceful beyond all
   grace, who, with loving eyes, lookest down upon the pious children of
   the Church throughout the whole world. Thy sweet name refreshes the
   wearied, Thy peaceful brightness giveth sight to the blind, the sweet
   odour of Thy perfumes gladdens the righteous, the blessed fruit of Thy
   womb satisfies the Saints. Thou, after the Lord, art the first to merit
   the praise of angels and of men. Pray for me, O Lady, that, assisted by
   Thy prayers, I may be found meet to see and glorify Christ the God of
   gods, and Thee, the Queen of angels, in the heavenly Sion.

   Hail, Mary, most blessed parent of exceeding joy, through whom the
   blessing of heaven and everlasting happiness have flowed even unto us.
   Thou art blessed among women, and abounding with spiritual gifts, Thou
   gayest birth to our Redeemer. He, the infant Jesus Christ, took flesh
   of Thee, and came forth from Thy virgin womb, the only Author of
   salvation, than whom nothing is sweeter, nothing is more lovely,
   nothing is more excellent: after whom nothing can be thought of more
   worthy, more divine, more desirable than Thee. The pious remembrance of
   Thee gladdens the sorrowful, the chaste contemplation of Thee soothes
   the saints, the faithful veneration of Thee cleanses sinners: all the
   children of God find a welcome peace of mind in Thee. Obtain for me, I
   beseech Thee, O my Lady, perfect purity of heart, that I may be of the
   number of those who shall be found worthy to behold and praise Thy
   only-begotten Son, and Thee the Queen of heaven.

   Hail, Mary, most lovely virgin, O virgin brighter than the sun, and
   more brilliant than the stars, sweeter than honey, more pleasant than
   balsam. O Virgin ruddier than the rose, whiter than the lily. Thou art
   the fountain that watereth the springtide flowers; Thou art the well of
   living waters; Thou art the golden throne of the true Solomon; Thou art
   that purest vessel free from all bitterness; Thou art that cell of
   wondrous cleanness which sendeth forth on all sides the most grateful
   perfumes. The Lord created Thee a spotless virgin: He chose Thee for
   His humble handmaiden, and desired Thee for His lovely spouse. Thou art
   the glory of the human race, and the wondrous miracle of the whole
   world. Turn not away Thy face, O my Lady, from me, a wretched sinner;
   but make me clean instead of unclean, diligent instead of slothful, and
   devout instead of cold and lukewarm.

   Hail, Mary, welcome hope of the desponding and ever-present helper of
   the destitute, to whom Thy Son doth pay so great an honour, as to grant
   at once whatever Thou askest for, and to fulfil whatever Thou dost
   desire. To Thee are committed the treasures of the heavenly kingdom.
   Thou art more honourable than the cherubim, nearer to God than the
   seraphim. Thou art the singular glory of Thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
   and Jacob. Every age, and sex, and tongue, confess the glory of Thy
   name, the splendour of Thy dignity, the abundance of Thy goodness. Thou
   art exalted, O Lady, above the angelic choirs. Rose-blossoms and lilies
   of the valley encompass Thee, as in the time of spring. Heal me, O
   blessed one, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be safe, and I
   will bless Thee for ever and ever. Amen.

   Hail Mary, in whom the heavens exult, and the earth rejoices: hail,
   fair lily of the glorious Trinity, and blooming rose of heavenly
   loveliness. Thou, after Thy Son, art the Mistress of all creation: so
   that at Thy name, also, every knee doth bow, of things in heaven, and
   things on earth, and things under the earth: Thee do the angelic hosts
   most reverently obey. Thou art that Mother of peaceful light, which
   lovingly enlighteneth the souls of them that love Thee. Thou art that
   sweetest parent of goodness, who dost happily lead thy faithful
   servants to the pleasant abodes of Paradise. Thou art that lovely
   dove,, rising above the water courses, from whose features exhale the
   sweetness of precious perfumes. The hosts of the blessed praise and
   continually bless Thy name. To Thee, O Lady, do I raise my countenance,
   on Thee do I cast the eyes of my heart, in Thee doth my soul confide.
   Have pity on me, for my salvation is in Thy hands.

   Hail, undefiled, and free from all spot or stain, Thou virgin Mother of
   God: Hail Mary, most sure refuge of all that run to Thee. Thou art that
   strong tower, whose bulwarks protect all that are within it. Thou art
   the faithful protector of all that praise Thee. Thou art that fair
   cloud which cooleth the intensity of the heat. Thou art that timely dew
   which quencheth the fiery furnace. Thou art the pure grain, threshed
   from the straw. Thou art the lily among thorns, and the flower of the
   valley. Thou art wholly meek and lovely, and all beaming, and all
   bounteous. Those that are far from Thee, Thou enlightenest with the
   rays of mercy; those that are near, Thou cherishest with the sweets of
   devotion. Keep me, O sweetest advocate, and after the waves of this
   life are passed, lead me to the harbour of everlasting salvation.

   Hail Mary, the theme of prophets, and glory of apostles, martyrs,
   confessors, and virgins. Thou art the most lovely palm of
   righteousness. Thou art the most fragrant spikenard of modesty. Thou
   art the blooming garden full of heavenly delights. Thou art the ark of
   the covenant, containing that sweetest manna. Thou art that blessed
   soil which bringeth forth a blessed fruit. Thou art the spiritual rock
   gushing forth with plenteous streams. Thou art that sacred fountain,
   swelling into the largest river. O Mary, how holy art thou; how sinful
   am I! how humble art Thou; how proud am I! how sublime art Thou; how
   unworthy am I! O undefiled one, how vast a distance is there between
   Thine angelic purity and my intolerable uncleanness Purify, I beseech
   Thee, my heart from the filth of sin: take from me whatever is
   displeasing to Thy virgin eyes. Separate my heart from earthly desires,
   and establish it in the love of heavenly things, to the everlasting
   praise and honour of Thy Son.

   Hail Mary, most precious pearl, and after Thy Son, the choicest jewel
   of the human race. Thou art all beautiful, O Virgin, all lovely art
   Thou, and free from all spot of sin. Nothing impure ever clave unto Thy
   most chaste soul: no spiritual grace was ever wanting in it. Thou
   excellent the prophets in faith, the apostles in holy zeal, martyrs in
   patience, confessors in humility, virgins in innocence. Thou art
   decorated with ineffable ornaments: all the citizens of the heavenly
   palace are lost in admiration of Thee. Thou art the brightest sun which
   never sets. On earth Thou kindlest heaven with Thy rays; in heaven Thou
   enlightenest the earth, Thou Sun that scatterest the clouds of sin.
   When I consider, O Lady, the dazzling brightness of Thy holiness, I
   blush exceedingly at the darkness of my impurity; but, humbly prostrate
   at Thy feet, I acknowledge my sinfulness. Despise me not, I beseech
   Thee, Thou that art my sweetest hope. O may the vast and exceeding
   compassion of my most loving mother alleviate. the misery of me, a most
   worthless sinner.

   Hail, most holy Virgin, hail Mary, Thou that art among all blessed
   women, remarkable for the greatness of Thy own blessedness. Thou art
   that pleasant valley blooming with the lilies of all virtues; Thou the
   blessed Paradise flowing with delicious consolations; Thou that lovely
   rose wafting forth unspeakable sweetness; Thou the chosen shell,
   dropping with the richness of most honied love; Thou the brilliant star
   of Jacob, the ornament of the heaven of heavens. Thou art the budding
   rod of Jesse, gladdening the whole world. Thy loveliness, Thy grace,
   Thy dignity, are the wonder and amazement of all blessed spirits. O
   Virgin of passing elegance, of exceeding holiness! O Lady most
   renowned, that sittest above the angelic choirs, having the throne
   nearest to Almighty God, attend, I beseech Thee, to my sorrows and my
   groanings. Visit and console me, Thy useless servant, and absolved from
   my sins, make me all pleasing unto Thee.

   Hail Mary, singular ornament of heaven, and precious refuge of the
   earth. Hail, Mother of the everlasting King, blessed a thousand times:
   rejoice, O Thou that wert so greatly longed for to restore us to the
   grace that we had lost. Thou art the Mistress of all things, and
   sharest a common empire with Thy Son. To Thee every age and sex justly
   bow the head: at Thy feet the whole world is justly prostrate. For
   after the ineffable Trinity, after Thy beloved Son, the court of heaven
   possesses nought more wonderful than Thee. At Thy name the devils
   tremble, at Thy brightness the powers of darkness take their flight, at
   thy bidding the gates of Paradise are opened. Thou, after Thy Son, art
   the hope of all Christians. O Queen of mercy! O sweetness of life! to
   Thee do I cry, poor miserable child of Eve! to Thee do I sigh, a
   piteous exile in this valley of tears! Turn not away Thy face, I
   beseech Thee, O my Lady; but keep me in my toils, protect me in my
   struggles, strengthen me when I am weak and falter; and after this
   exile is ended, show unto me the blessed fruit of Thy womb, Jesus.

   Hail, purest abode of the Holy Ghost, and spotless sanctuary of the
   Word of God! hail, most holy Mother and Virgin, Mary! who didst bring
   forth Christ Jesus, the joy of men and angels, and didst wrap Him in
   poor rags, and wind Him in swaddling clothes, didst bear Him in Thy
   arms, and cherish him in Thy bosom, didst suckle Him at Thy breast, and
   didst cover Him with kisses and fond embraces. I ask of Thee, O Lady,
   and beseech Thy everlasting, heart, by Thy mother's care and zealous
   watchings which Thou spentest over the cradle and infancy of Thy
   only-begotten Son, that Thou wouldst be my patron before Him, and would
   blot out my sins, obtain for me grace, and pour light upon my soul.
   Amen.

VI.

   Hail, Mary, brightest and sweetest Mother of the Messiah and our King!
   O Lady, Thou art that most chaste turtle dove whose note doth
   wondrously soothe the ears of the Almighty. Thou art that purest dove
   whose plaintive notes do in all things please the Holy Ghost. O
   gracious Virgin, O Virgin of most amazing loveliness, cast out from my
   inmost heart whatever is impure or wanting in comeliness. Enlighten the
   darkness that reigns within me by a ray of Thy brightness, that my sins
   being chased away and blotted out, I may be able purely to contemplate
   Thy loveliness. Listen, O Lady, listen to my sighs and groanings after
   Thee. Come, thou desired, a thousand times, and out of the multitude of
   Thy graces pour somewhat on my soul, that I may intimately and most
   devoutly love Thee.

   Hail, Mary, lonely handmaid of God, and most secret bride of a most
   secret spouse! Hail, lovely maiden, and chosen daughter of grace! O
   bashful virgin! O most beautiful of all women, show me, I beg of Thee,
   Thy lovely countenance, at the sight of which the most chaste
   affections that nought can quench, arise within me! Thy sweet voice
   soundeth in my ears, at the sound of which my spirit revives within me,
   and rises from the death of sin, and the slumber of a lukewarm life.
   May the unspeakable perfumes of Thy sweetness continually refresh my
   soul. May the unalloyed love of Thee enter the chamber of my heart, and
   happily take possession of all that is within, so that I may feel
   nothing but disgust for all worldly things.

   Hail, Mary, spotless bosom friend of the blessed Trinity! Hail, O woman
   most pure in body and in soul. O virgin that delightest in silence, O
   virgin most humble, O virgin most beloved of God, cast, I beseech Thee,
   the dazzling beams of Thy most peaceful countenance upon my inmost
   soul, that my heart may rejoice and exult in Thee. Draw me after Thee,
   that I may cheerfully run after the odour of Thine ointments. Gladden
   my spirit, O Thon that art kind, that I may cheerfully serve Thee and
   love Thee from my inmost heart. Visit Thy poor little one, as he sighs
   and mourns: touch the lyre of my heart, that it may echo forth the
   praises of Thy sweet name. May my soul love Thee, and venerate and
   bless Thee for ever.

   Hail, Mary, daughter of Sion, million times blessed! Hail, sweetest
   Mother of God! O virgin most holy, O virgin before the birth of Thy
   Son, O virgin in His birth, O virgin after His birth, clothe, I beseech
   . Thee, and adorn my soul with the grace of heavenly beauty. O most
   illustrious Queen, look down from the glory of thy lofty throne upon
   this poor wretched creature: draw nigh, O Lady, to the abode of me, a
   miserable sinner, and comfort me with Thy wished-for presence. May my
   spirit rejoice in Thee, may my heartstrings praise Thee, and may my
   soul melt away by reason of my love for Thee.

   Hail, Mary, sweet and holy virgin! hail, eastern gate inviolate,
   through which He that is beautiful beyond the sons of men, hath come
   unto us! Turn, O glorious one, turn those gentlest eyes of Thy virgin
   countenance towards me: enlighten the shades of my blindness by the
   brightness of Thy approach. Listen to the complaints of my soul that
   longs to love Thee: satiate the desire of my heart, which day and night
   pineth and languisheth for Thee. Separate, O Lady, my soul from all
   things that are under heaven, and fix it in the purest contemplation of
   Thyself, and cause it to have a foretaste of the honied drops of the
   pleasures of eternity.

   Hail, thou lover of solitude! hail, thou gentle cultivator of inward
   peace! hail, O woman wonderful for thine uprightness. O Mary, adorned
   with unspeakable wisdom, O chosen virgin, O virgin most beautiful among
   the daughters of Jerusalem, collect, I beseech Thee, the wandering
   thoughts of Thy poor servant, and compose my distracted mind, that I
   may give myself to pure and peaceful meditations upon Thee. May the
   vision of Thy lovely beauty, that inspirer of chastity, cleave to my
   soul; may the purest love of Thee for ever penetrate my heart's very
   core. Thou art the most fragrant tabernacle of the Divinity, Thou the
   closed garden from which that loveliest and most rare flower came
   forth, Jesus Christ, the Saviour of our souls: may every age praise and
   venerate Thee.

   Hail, Mary, Thou fragrant violet of lowliest humility, and deep red
   rose of most fervent charity! Hail, most generous Mother of our great
   Creator! O sweet virgin, O most beloved for Thy delights, may the
   perfumes of Thy precious spices come unto me, may my spirit feel Thee
   in the night, may my heart-strings yearn for Thee by day, may my breast
   feel Thy sweet influence, may the inmost marrow of my soul love Thee,
   may my tongue for ever, and at all times, be occupied in singing
   cheerfully Thy praises. Thou art the flowery bridal-chamber of the
   heavenly bridegroom; Thou art the pleasant paradise of holy delights;
   Thou art the perfumed storehouse of the divine sacraments; Thou art the
   mother, the daughter, the spouse of God; Thou art, and always shall be,
   my sweet hope, and the glad comfort of my soul. Be present with me,
   Thou holy Guide, whilst I traverse the dangerous ocean of this world;
   but especially be Thou present at the closing of my life, that by the
   beacon of Thy brightness, of Thy guidance, of Thy leading, I may
   happily arrive at the haven of the heavenly Jerusalem, where I may love
   and praise Thee, world without end. Ah, my Lady! show unto me, at the
   hour of my death, Thy most gladsome presence, assuage my pains and
   sorrows by Thy rosy and beaming countenance, and the glance of Thy
   gentle eyes, and for the glory of God secure for me the blessedness of
   eternal life for ever and ever. Amen.

Laus Deo
