EDITORIAL NOTE.

   THE present volume is the first of three, which will reproduce in
   English the contents of Vol. III. of Harnack's great work in the German
   original, third Edition. The author's prefaces to the first and second
   Editions and to the third Edition are here translated. This volume
   deals with the epoch-making service of Augustine as a reformer of
   Christian piety and as a theological teacher, and with the influence he
   exercised down to the period of the Carlovingian Renaissance. The
   following volume will complete the history of the Development of Dogma
   by telling the story of Mediæval Theology. The concluding volume will
   treat of the Issues of Dogma in the period since the Reformation, and
   will contain a General Index for the whole work.

PREFACE TO FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS.

   There does not yet exist a recognised method for presenting the History
   of Dogma of the Mediæval and more modern period. There is no agreement
   either as to the extent or treatment of our material, and the greatest
   confusion prevails as to the goal to be aimed at. The end and aim, the
   method and course adopted in the present Text-Book, were clearly
   indicated in the introduction to the first volume. I have seen no
   reason to make any change in carrying out the work. But however
   definite may be our conception of the task involved in our branch of
   study, the immense theological material presented by the Middle Ages,
   and the uncertainty as to what was Dogma at that time, make selection
   in many places an experiment. I may not hope that the experiment has
   always been successful.

   After a considerable pause, great activity has been shown in the study
   of our subject in the last two years. Benrath, Hauck, Bonwetsch, and
   Seeberg have published new editions of older Text-Books; Loofs has
   produced an excellent Guide to the History of Dogma; Kaftan has given a
   sketch of the study in his work on the Truth of the Christian Religion;
   Möller and Koffmane have devoted special attention to the sections
   dealing with it in their volumes on Ancient Church History. The study
   of these books, and many others which I have gratefully made use of,
   has shown me that my labours on this great subject have not remained
   isolated or been fruitless. The knowledge of this has outweighed many
   experiences which I pass over in silence.

   This concluding volume counts, to a greater extent than its
   predecessors, on the indulgence of my learned colleagues; for its
   author is not a "specialist," either in the history of the Mediæval
   Church or in the period of the Reformation. But the advantage possessed
   by him who comes to the Middle Ages and the Reformation with a thorough
   knowledge of ecclesiastical antiquity perhaps outweighs the defects of
   an account which does not everywhere rest on a complete induction. One
   man can really review all the sources for the history of the Ancient
   Church; but as regards the Middle Ages and the history of the
   Reformation, even one more familiar with them than the author of this
   Text-Book will prove his wisdom simply by the most judicious choice of
   the material which he studies independently. The exposition of
   Augustine, Anselm, Thomas, the Council of Trent, Socinianism, and
   Luther rests throughout on independent studies. This is also true of
   other parts; but sections will be found in which the study is not
   advanced, but only its present position is reproduced.

   I have spent a great deal of time on the preparation of a Table of
   Contents. I trust it will assist the use of the book. But for the book
   itself, I wish that it may contribute to break down the power that
   really dictates in the theological conflicts of the present, viz.,
   ignorance. We cannot, indeed, think too humbly of the importance of
   theological science for Christian piety; but we cannot rate it too
   highly as regards the development of the Evangelical Church, our
   relation to the past, and the preparation of that better future in
   which, as once in the second century, the Christian faith will again be
   the comfort of the weak and the strength of the strong.

PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.

   Since this volume first appeared, there may have been published about
   fifty monographs and more extensive treatises on the Western History of
   Dogma, most of which have referred to it. I have tried to make use of
   them for the new Edition, and I also proposed to make other additions
   and corrections on the original form of the book, without finding
   myself compelled to carry out changes in essential points. I have
   thankfully studied the investigations, published by Dilthey in the
   Archiv f. Gesch. d. Philosophie, Vols. V. to VII., on the reformed
   system of doctrine in its relation to Humanism and the "natural
   system." He has examined the reformed conceptions in connections in
   which they have hitherto been seldom or only superficially considered,
   and he has, therefore, essentially advanced a knowledge of them.

   Among the many objections to the plan of this work, and the critical
   standards observed in it, four are especially of importance. It has
   been said that in this account the development of Dogma is judged by
   the gospel, but that we do not learn clearly what the gospel is. It has
   further been maintained that the History of Dogma is depicted as a
   pathological process. Again, the plan of Book III., headed "The
   threefold outcome of Dogma," has been attacked. And, lastly, it has
   been declared that, although the account marks a scientific advance, it
   yet bears too subjective or churchly a stamp, and does not correspond
   to the strictest claims of historical objectivity.

   As to the first objection, I believe that I have given a fuller account
   of my conception of the gospel than has been yet done in any text-book
   of the History of Dogma. But I gladly give here a brief epitome of my
   view. The preaching of Jesus contains three great main sections.
   Firstly, the message of the approaching Kingdom of God or of the future
   salvation; secondly, the proclamation of the actual state of things and
   of thoughts, such as are given in Matthew VI. 25-34; VII. 7-11; IX. 2;
   X. 28-33, etc. (see Vol. I., p. 74 f.); thirdly, the new righteousness
   (the new law). The middle section connected with Matthew XI. 25-30, and
   therefore also combined with the primitive Christian testimony
   regarding Jesus as Lord and Saviour, I hold, from strictly historical
   and objective grounds, to be the true main section, the gospel in the
   gospel, and to it I subordinate the other portions. That Christ himself
   expressed it under cover of Eschatology I know as well (Vol. I., p. 58)
   as the antiquarians who have so keen an eye for the everlasting
   yesterday,

   As to the second objection I am at a loss. After the new religion had
   entered the Roman Empire, and had combined with it in the form of the
   universal Catholic Church, the History of Dogma shows an advance and a
   rise in all its main features down to the Reformation. I have described
   it in this sense from Origen to Athanasius, Augustine, Bernard, and
   Francis, to mystic Scholasticism and to Luther. It is to me a mystery
   how far the history should nevertheless have been depicted as a
   "process of disease." Of course superstitions accumulated, as in every
   history of religion, but within this incrustation the individual ever
   became stronger, the sense for the gospel more active, and the feeling
   for what was holy and moral more refined and pure. But as regards the
   development from the beginnings of the evangelic message in the Empire
   down to the rise of the Catholic Church, I have not permitted myself to
   speculate how splendid it would have been if everything had happened
   differently from what it did. On the other hand, I grant that I have
   not been able to join in praising the formation of that tradition and
   theology which has lowered immediate religion to one that is mediated,
   and has burdened faith with complicated theological and philosophical
   formulas. Just as little could it occur to me to extol the rise of that
   ecclesiastical rule that chiefly means obedience, when it speaks of
   faith. But in this there is no "pathology"; the formations that arose
   overcame Gnosticism.

   My critics have not convinced me that the conception followed by me in
   reference to the final offshoots of the History of Dogma is
   unhistorical. But I readily admit that the History of Dogma can also be
   treated as history of ecclesiastical theology, and that in this way the
   account can bring it down to the present time. Little is to be gained
   by disputing about such questions in an either-or fashion. If we regard
   Protestantism as a new principle which has superseded the absolute
   authority of Dogmas, then, in dealing with the History of Dogma, we
   must disregard Protestant forms of doctrine, however closely they may
   approximate to ancient Dogma. But if we look upon it as a particular
   reform of Western Catholicism, we shall have to admit its doctrinal
   formations into that history. Only, even in that case, we must not
   forget that the Evangelical Churches, tried by the notion of a church
   which prevailed for 1300 years, are no churches. From this the rest
   follows of itself.

   Finally, as regards the last objection, I may apply chiefly to my
   account a verdict recently passed by a younger fellow-worker:--"The
   History of Dogma of to-day is, when regarded as science, a half thing."
   Certainly it is in its beginnings, and it falls far short of
   perfection. It must become still more circumspect and reserved; but I
   should fear, lest it be so purified in the crucible of this youngest
   adept--who meantime, however, is still a member of the numerous company
   of those who only give advice--that nothing of consequence would
   remain, or only that hollow gospel, "religion is history," which he
   professes to have derived from the teaching of four great prophets,
   from whom he could have learnt better. We are all alike sensible of the
   labours and controversies which he would evade; but it is one of the
   surprises that are rare even in theology, that one of our number should
   be trying in all seriousness to divide the child between the contending
   mothers, and that by a method which would necessarily once more
   perpetuate the dispute that preceded the division. The ecclesiastics
   among Protestants, although they arrogate to themselves the monopoly of
   "Christian" theology on the title-pages of their books, will never give
   up the claim to history and science; they will, therefore, always feel
   it their duty to come to terms with the "other" theology. Nor will
   scientific theology ever forget that it is the conscience of the
   Evangelical Church, and as such has to impose demands on the Church
   which it serves in freedom.

CHAPTER I.

  HISTORICAL SITUATION. [1]

   The history of piety and of dogmas in the West was so thoroughly
   dominated by Augustine from the beginning of the fifth century to the
   era of the Reformation, that we must take this whole time as forming
   one period. It is indeed possible to doubt whether it is not correct to
   include also the succeeding period, since Augustinianism continued to
   exert its influence in the sixteenth century. But we are compelled to
   prefer the views that the Reformation had all the significance of a new
   movement, and that the revolt from Augustine was marked even in
   post-tridentine Catholicism, as well as, completely, in Socinianism.
   [2] In this second Book of the second Section, therefore, we regard the
   history of dogma of the West from Augustine to the Reformation as one
   complete development, and then, in accordance with our definition of
   dogma and its history, [3] we add the "final stages of dogma" in their
   triple form--Tridentine Catholicism, Socinianism, and Protestantism.

   2. In order rightly to appreciate the part played by Augustine, it is
   necessary first (Chap. II.) to describe the distinctive character of
   Western Christianity and Western theologians anterior to his
   appearance. It will then appear that while the West was prepared to
   favour Augustinianism, those very elements that especially
   characterised Western Christianity--the juristic and
   moralistic--resisted the Augustinian type of thought in matters of
   faith. This fact at once foreshadows the later history of
   Augustinianism in the Church.

   3. Augustine comes before us, in the first place, as a reformer of
   Christian piety, altering much that belonged to vulgar Catholicism, and
   carrying out monotheism strictly and thoroughly. He gave the central
   place to the living relation of the soul to God; he took religion out
   of the sphere of cosmology and the cultus, and demonstrated and
   cherished it in the domain of the deepest life of the soul. On the
   other hand, we will have to show that while establishing the
   sovereignty of faith over all that is natural, he did not surmount the
   old Catholic foundation of the theological mode of thought; further,
   that he was not completely convinced of the supremacy of the religious
   over the moral, of the personal state of faith over ecclesiasticism;
   and finally, that in his religious tendencies, as generally, he
   remained burdened by the rubbish of ecclesiastical tradition. (Chap.
   III.)

   4. Augustine falls next to be considered as a Church teacher. The union
   of three great circles of thought, which he reconstructed and connected
   absolutely, assured him, along with the incomparable impression made by
   his inexhaustible personality, of a lasting influence. In the first
   place, he built up a complete circle of conceptions, which is marked by
   the categories, "God, the soul, alienation from God, irresistible
   grace, hunger for God, unrest in the world and rest in God, and
   felicity," a circle in which we can easily demonstrate the co-operation
   of Neoplatonic and monastic Christian elements, but which is really so
   pure and simple that it can be taken as the fundamental form of
   monotheistic piety in general. Secondly, he gave expression to a group
   of ideas in which sin, grace through Christ, grace in general, faith,
   love, and hope form the main points; a Paulinism modified by popular
   Catholic elements. Thirdly, he constructed another group, in which the
   Catholic Church is regarded as authority, dispenser of grace, and
   administrator of the sacraments, and, further, as the means and aim of
   all God's ordinances. Here he always constructed, along with a wealth
   of ideas, a profusion of schemes--not formulas; he re-fashioned
   Dogmatics proper, and, speaking generally, gave the first impulse to a
   study which, as an introduction to Dogmatics, has obtained such an
   immense importance for theology and Science since the Scholastics.

   5. On the other hand, Augustine always felt that he was, as regards
   Dogma, an Epigone, and he submitted himself absolutely to the tradition
   of the Church. He was wanting in the vigorous energy in Church work
   shown, e.g., by Athanasius, and in the impulse to force upon the Church
   in fixed formulas the truths that possessed his soul. Consequently the
   result of his life-work on behalf of the Church can be described thus.
   (1) He established more securely in the West the ancient ecclesiastical
   tradition as authority and law. (2) He deepened and, comparatively
   speaking, Christianised the old religious tendency. (3) In the thought
   and life of the Church he substituted a plan of salvation, along with
   an appropriate doctrine of the sacraments, for the old dogma [4] and
   the cultus, and instilled into heart and feeling the fundamental
   conception of his Christianity that divine grace was the beginning,
   middle, and end; but he himself sought to harmonise the conception with
   popular Catholicism, and he expressed this in formulas which, because
   they were not fixed and definite, admitted of still further concessions
   to traditional views. In a word, he failed to establish without
   admixture the new and higher religious style in which he constructed
   theology. Therefore the ancient Greek dogma which aimed at deification,
   as well as the old Roman conception of religion as a legal
   relationship, could maintain their ground side by side with it.
   Precisely in the best of his gifts to the Church, Augustine gave it
   impulses and problems, but not a solid capital. Along with this he
   transmitted to posterity a profusion of ideas, conceptions, and views
   which, unsatisfactorily harmonised by himself, produced great friction,
   living movements, and, finally, violent controversies.

   6. As at the beginning of the history of the Latin Church Cyprian
   followed Tertullian, and stamped the character of ancient Latin
   Christianity, so Gregory the Great succeeded Augustine, and gave
   expression to the mediæval character of Latin Christianity, a form
   which, under Augustinian formulas, often differs in whole and in
   details from Augustine. Dogma remains almost throughout, in the Middle
   Ages, the complex of Trinitarian and Christological doctrines which was
   handed down with the Symbol. But, besides this, an immense series of
   theological conceptions, of church regulations and statutes, already
   possessed a quasi-dogmatic authority. Yet, in acute cases, he could
   alone be expelled as a heretic who could be convicted of disbelieving
   one of the twelve articles of the Symbol, or of sharing in the
   doctrines of heretics already rejected, i.e., of Pelagians, Donatists,
   etc. Thus it remained up to the time of the Reformation, although the
   doctrines of the Church--the Pope, and the sacraments, the
   ecclesiastical sacrament of penance, and the doctrine of
   transubstantiation--claimed almost dogmatic authority, though only by
   being artificially connected with the Symbol.

   7. The consolidation of the ecclesiastical and dogmatic system into a
   legal order, in harmony with the genius of Western Christianity, was
   almost rendered perfect by the political history of the Church in the
   period of the tribal migrations. The Germans who entered the circle of
   the Church, and partly became fused with the Latins, partly, but under
   the leadership of Rome, remained independent, received Christianity in
   its ecclesiastical form, as something absolutely complete. Therefore,
   setting aside the Chauvinistic contention that the Germans were
   predisposed to Christianity, [5] no independent theological movement
   took place for centuries on purely German soil. No German Christianity
   existed in the Middle Ages in the sense that there was a Jewish, Greek,
   or Latin form. [6] Even if the Germans may have attempted to make
   themselves more thoroughly familiar with Latin Christianity, as e.g.,
   the Slays did with the Greek--we may recall the old Saxon harmony of
   the Gospels, etc.-- [7] yet there was a complete absence of any
   independence in consciously appropriating it, up to the settlement of
   the Begging orders in Germany, properly speaking, indeed, up to the
   Reformation. Complaints of Papal oppressions, or of external
   ceremonies, cannot be introduced into this question. The complainers
   were themselves Roman Christians, and the never-failing sectaries paid
   homage, not to a "German" Christianity, but to a form of Church which
   was also imported. If up to the thirteenth century there existed in
   Germany no independent theology or science, still less was there any
   movement in the history of dogma. [8] But as soon as Germans, in
   Germany and England, took up an independent part in the inner movement
   of the Church, they prepared the way, supported indeed by Augustine,
   for the Reformation. The case was different on Roman territory. We need
   not, of course, look at Italy, for the land of the Popes steadily
   maintained its characteristic indifference to all theology as theology.
   Apocalyptic, socialistic, and revolutionary movements were not wanting;
   Hippocrates and Justinian were studied; but the ideals of thinkers
   seldom interested Italians, and they hardly ever troubled themselves
   about a dogma, if it was nothing more. Spain, also, very soon passed
   out of the intellectual movement, into which, besides, it had never
   thrown any energy. For eight centuries it was set the immense practical
   task of protecting Christendom from Islam: in this war it transformed
   the law of the Catholic religion into a military discipline. The
   Spanish history of dogma has been a blank since the days of Bishop
   Elipandus.

   Thus France alone remains. In so far as the Middle Ages, down to the
   thirteenth century, possessed any dogmatic history, it was to a very
   large extent Frankish or French. [9] Gaul had been the land of culture
   among Latin countries as early as the fourth and fifth centuries. 'Mid
   the storms of the tribal migrations, culture maintained its ground
   longest in Southern Gaul, and after a short epoch of barbarism, during
   which civilisation seemed to have died out everywhere on the Continent,
   and England appeared to have obtained the leadership, France under the
   Carlovingians--of course, France allied with Rome through
   Boniface--came again to the front. There it remained, but with its
   centre of gravity in the North, between the Seine and the Rhine. Paris
   was for centuries only second to Rome, as formerly Alexandria and
   Carthage had been. [10] The imperial crown passed to the Germans; the
   real ruler of the world sat at Rome; but the "studium"--in every sense
   of the term--belonged to the French. Strictly speaking, even in France,
   there was no history of dogma in the Middle Ages. If the Reformation
   had not taken place, we would have been as little aware of any mediæval
   history of dogma in the West as in the East; for the theological and
   ecclesiastical movements of the Middle Ages, which by no means
   professed to be new dogmatic efforts, only claim to be received into
   the history of dogma because they ended in the dogmas of Trent on the
   one hand, and in the symbols of the Reformed Churches and Socinian
   Rationalism on the other. The whole of the Middle Ages presents itself
   in the sphere of dogmatic history as a transition period, the period
   when the Church was fixing its relationship to Augustine, and the
   numerous impulses originated by him. This period lasted so long, (1)
   because centuries had to elapse before Augustine found disciples worthy
   of him, and men were in a position even to understand the chain of
   ecclesiastical and theological edicts handed down from antiquity; (2)
   because the Roman genius of the Western Church and the Augustinian
   spirit were in part ill-assorted, and it was therefore a huge task to
   harmonise them; and (3) because at the time when complete power had
   been gained for the independent study of Church doctrine and Augustine,
   a new authority, in many respects more congenial to the spirit of the
   Church, appeared on the scene, viz., Augustine's powerful rival, [11]
   Aristotle. The Roman genius, the superstition which, descending from
   the closing period of antiquity, was strengthened in barbarous times,
   Augustine, and Aristotle--these are the four powers which contended for
   their interpretation of the gospel in the history of dogma in the
   Middle Ages.

   8. The Middle Ages experienced no dogmatic decisions like those of
   Nicaea or Chalcedon. After the condemnation of Pelagians and
   Semipelagians, Monothelites, and Adoptians, the dogmatic circle was
   closed. The actions in the Carlovingian age against images, and against
   Ratramnus and Gottschalk were really of slight importance, and in the
   fights with later heretics, so many of whom disturbed the mediæval
   Church, old weapons were used, new ones being in fact unnecessary. The
   task of the historian of dogma is here, therefore, very difficult. In
   order to know what he ought to describe, to be as just to ancient dogma
   in its continued influence as to the new quasi-dogmatic Christianity in
   whose midst men lived, he must fix his eyes on the beginning,
   Augustine, and the close, the sixteenth century. Nothing belongs to the
   history of dogma which does not serve to explain this final stage, and
   even then only on its dogmatic side, and this again may be portrayed
   only in so far as it prepared the way for the framing of new doctrines,
   or the official revision of the ancient dogmas.

   If my view is right, there are three lines to which we have to turn our
   attention. In the first place we must examine the history of piety, in
   so far as new tendencies were formed in it, based on, or existing side
   by side with Augustinianism; for the piety which was determined by
   other influences led also to the construction of other dogmatic
   formulas. But the history of piety in the Middle Ages is the history of
   monachism. [12] We may therefore conjecture that if monachism really
   passed through a history in the Middle Ages, and not merely endless
   repetitions, it cannot be indifferent for the history of dogma. As a
   matter of fact, it will be shown that Bernard and Francis were also
   doctrinal Fathers. We may here point at once to the fact that
   Augustine, at least apparently, reveals a hiatus in his theology as
   dominated by piety; he was able to say little concerning the work of
   Christ in connection with his system of doctrine, and his impassioned
   love of God was not clearly connected in theory with the impression
   made by Christ's death, or with Christ's "work." What a transformation,
   what an access of fervour, Augustinianism had to experience, when
   impassioned love to the Eternal and Holy One found its object in the
   Crucified, when it invested with heavenly glory, and referred to the
   sinful soul, all traits of the beaten, wounded, and dying One, when it
   began to reflect on the infinite "merits" of its Saviour, because the
   most profound of thoughts had dawned upon it, that the suffering of the
   innocent was salvation in history! Dogma could not remain unaffected by
   what it now found to contemplate and experience in the "crucified"
   Saviour of Bernard, the "poor" Saviour of Francis. [13] We may say
   briefly that, by the agency of the mediæval religious virtuosi and
   theologians, the close connection between God, the "work" of Christ,
   and salvation was ultimately restored in the Tridentine and ancient
   Lutheran dogma. The Greek Church had maintained and still maintains it;
   but Augustine had loosened it, because his great task was to show what
   God is, and what salvation the soul requires.

   In the second place, we have to take the doctrine of the Sacraments
   into consideration; for great as were the impulses given here also by
   Augustine, yet everything was incomplete which he transmitted to the
   Church. But the Church as an institution and training-school required
   the sacraments above all, and in its adherence to Augustine it was
   precisely his sacramental doctrine, and the conception connected
   therewith of gradual justification, of which it laid hold. We shall
   have to show how the Church developed this down to the sixteenth
   century, how it idealised itself in the sacraments, and fashioned them
   into being its peculiar agencies. In the third place, we have to pursue
   a line which is marked for us by the names of Augustine and
   Aristotle--fides and ratio, auctoritas and ratio intelligentia and
   ratio. To investigate this thoroughly would be to write the history of
   mediæval science in general. Here, therefore, we have only to examine
   it, in so far as there were developed in it the same manifold
   fashioning of theological thought, and those fundamental views which
   passed into the formulas, and at the same time into the contents of the
   doctrinal creations, of the sixteenth century, and which ultimately
   almost put an end to dogma in the original sense of the term. But we
   have also to include under the heading "Augustine and Aristotle" the
   opposition between the doctrine of the enslaved will and free grace and
   that of free will and merit. The latter shattered Augustinianism within
   Catholicism.

   We cannot trace any dogma regarding the Church in the Middle Ages until
   the end of the thirteenth century, but this is only because the Church
   was the foundation and the latent co-efficient of all spiritual and
   theological movement. [14] Our account has to make this significance of
   the Church explicit, and in doing so to examine the growth of papal
   power; for in the sixteenth century the claim of the Pope was in
   dispute. On this point the Western Church was split up. But further,
   Augustine had given a central place to the question of the personal
   position of the Christian, confusing it, however, by uncertain
   references to the Church and to the medicinal effect of the means of
   grace. And the mediæval movement, in proportion as the Church and the
   sacraments came to the front without any diminution of the longing for
   an independent faith, [15] was led to the question of personal
   assurance. On this point also--justification--the Western Church was
   rent asunder. [16] Thus an account of the history of dogma in the
   Middle Ages will only be complete if it can show how the questions as
   to the power of the Church (of the Pope, the importance of the Mass and
   sacraments) and justification came to the front, and how in these
   questions the old dogma, not indeed outwardly, but really, perished. In
   Tridentine Catholicism it now became completely, along with its new
   portions, a body of law; in Protestantism it was still retained only in
   as far as it showed itself, when compared with the Divine Word, to
   express the Gospel, to form a bond with the historical past, or to
   serve as the basis of personal assurance of salvation.

   There can be no doubt about the division into periods. After an
   introduction on Western Christianity and Theology before Augustine,
   Augustinianism falls to be described. Then we have to discuss the
   epochs of (1) the Semipelagian controversies and Gregory I.; (2) the
   Carlovingian Renaissance; (3) the period of Clugny and Bernard (the
   eleventh and twelfth centuries); and (4) the period of the mendicant
   orders, as also of the so-called Reformers before the Reformation,
   i.e., of revived Augustinianism (thirteenth and fifteenth centuries).
   The Middle Ages only reached their climax after the beginning of the
   thirteenth century and, having grown spiritually equal to the material
   received from the ancient Church, then developed all individual
   energies and conceptions. But then at once began the crises which led
   to the Renaissance and Humanism, to the Reformation, Socinianism and
   Tridentine Catholicism. It is, therefore, impossible to delimit two
   periods within the thirteenth to the fifteenth century; for
   Scholasticism and Mysticism, the development of the authoritative,
   Nominalist, dogmatics, and the attempts to form new doctrines, are all
   interwoven. Reformation and Counter-reformation have a common root.

   candet veritas et rubet caritas."

   [14] The opposition to a sacerdotal Church which existed at all times,
   and was already strong in the thirteenth century, left no lasting
   traces down to the fourteenth. In this century movements began on the
   soil of Catholicism which led to new forms of the conception of the
   Church and compelled it to fix definitively its own.

   [15] In the Middle Ages every advance in the development of the
   authority and power of the Church was accompanied by the growing
   impression that the Church was corrupt. This impression led to the
   suspicion that it had become Babylon, and to despair of its
   improvement.

   [16] On this most important point the schism went beyond Augustine; for
   in the Middle Ages, as regards the ground and assurance of faith,
   Augustine of the Confessions and doctrine of predestination was played
   off against Augustine the apologist of the Catholic Church. Luther,
   however, abandoned both alike, and followed a view which can be shown
   to exist in Augustine and in the Middle Ages at most in a hidden
   undercurrent.

CHAPTER II.

  WESTERN CHRISTIANITY AND WESTERN THEOLOGIANS BEFORE AUGUSTINE.

   The distinctive character of Western Christianity has been frequently
   referred to in our earlier volumes. We may now, before taking up
   Augustine and the Church influenced by him, appropriately review and
   describe the Christianity into which he entered, and on which he
   conferred an extraordinarily prolonged existence and new vital energies
   by the peculiar form and training to which he subjected it. It was the
   Roman Church that transmitted Christianity to the Middle Ages. But it
   might almost be named the Augustinian-Gregorian [17] with as much
   justice as that of the Augsburg Confession is called the Lutheran.

   If, however, we ascend the history of the Latin Church to as near its
   origin as we can, we find ourselves confronted by a man in whom the
   character and the future of this Church were already announced, viz.,
   Tertullian. Tertullian and Augustine are the Fathers of the Latin
   Church in so eminent a sense that, measured by them, the East possessed
   no Church Fathers at all. [18] The only one to rival them, Origen,
   exerted his influence in a more limited sphere. Eminently
   ecclesiastical as his activity was, his Christianity was not really
   ecclesiastical, but esoteric. His development and the import of his
   personal life were almost without significance for the mass; he
   continued to live in his books and among theologians. But with
   Tertullian and Augustine it was different. It is true that only a
   fraction of Tertullian's teaching was retained, that he was tolerated
   by posterity only in Cyprian's reduced version, and that Augustine
   became more and more a source of uneasiness to, and was secretly
   opposed by, his Church. Yet both passed into the history of the Western
   Catholic Church with their personality, with the characteristics of
   their Christian thought and feeling. The frictions and unresolved
   dissonances, in which they wore themselves out, were transmitted to the
   future as well as the concords they sounded, and the problems, which
   they could not master in their own inner experience, became the themes
   of world-historical spiritual conflicts. [19] We can exhibit the
   superiority of Western to Eastern Christianity at many points; we can
   even state a whole series of causes for this superiority; but one of
   the most outstanding is the fact that while the East was influenced by
   a commonplace succession of theologians and monks, the West was moulded
   by Tertullian and Augustine.

   Roman Christianity, still (c. 180) essentially Greek in form, but
   already with important features of its own, [20] had won the Great
   African to its service. [21] It had already transmitted to him Latin
   translations of Biblical books; but on this foundation Tertullian
   laboured, creating both thought and language, because he was able
   thoroughly to assimilate the new faith, and to express his whole
   individuality in it. [22]

   In doing so he adopted all the elements which tradition offered him.
   First, as a Christian Churchman, he took up the old enthusiastic and
   rigorous, as well as the new anti-heretical, faith. He sought to
   represent both, and in his sovereign law to verify the strict lex of
   the ancient disciplina, founded on eschatological hopes, and allied
   with unrestrained pneumatic dogmatics, and also the strict lex of the
   new rule of faith, which seemed ancient, because the heretics were
   undoubtedly innovators. He sought to be a disciple of the prophets and
   an obedient son of his Episcopal teachers. While he spent his strength
   in the fruitless attempt to unite them, [23] he left both forces as an
   inheritance to the Church of the West. If the history of that Church
   down to the sixteenth century exhibits a conflict between orthodox
   clerical and enthusiastic, between biblical and pneumatic elements, if
   monachism here was constantly in danger of running into apocalyptics
   and enthusiasm, and of forming an opposition to the Episcopal and
   world-Church, all that is foreshadowed in Tertullian.

   A further element, which here comes before us, is the juristic. We know
   that jurisprudence and legal thought held the chief place in mediæval
   philosophy, theology, and ethics. [24] Post-apostolic Greek Christians
   had, indeed, already put Christianity forward as the "law," and the
   Roman community may have cultivated this view with peculiar energy;
   [25] but in and by itself this term is capable of so many meanings as
   to be almost neutral. Yet through the agency of Tertullian, by his
   earlier profession a lawyer, all Christian forms received a legal
   impress. He not only transferred the technical terms of the jurists
   into the ecclesiastical language of the West, but he also contemplated,
   from a legal standpoint, all relations of the individual and the Church
   to the Deity, and vice versâ, all duties and rights, the moral
   imperative as well as the actions of God and Christ, nay, their mutual
   relationship. He who was so passionate and fanciful seemed never to be
   thoroughly satisfied until he had found the scheme of a legal
   relationship which he could proclaim as an inviolable authority; he
   never felt secure until he had demonstrated inner compulsions to be
   external demands, exuberant promises to be stipulated rewards. But with
   this the scheme of personal rights was applied almost universally. God
   appears as the mighty partner who watches jealously over his rights.
   Through Tertullian this tendency passed into the Western Church, which,
   being Roman, was disposed to favour it; there it operated in the most
   prejudicial way. If we grant that by it much that was valuable was
   preserved, and juristic thought did contribute to the understanding of
   some, not indeed the most precious, Pauline conceptions, yet, on the
   whole, religious reflection was led into a false channel, the ideas of
   satisfaction and merit becoming of the highest importance, and the
   separation of Western from primitive and Eastern Christianity was
   promoted. [26]

   Another element is closely connected with the legal, viz., the
   syllogistic and dialetical. Tertullian has been extolled as a
   speculative theologian; but this is wrong. Speculation was not his
   forte; we perceive this very plainly when we look at his relation to
   Irenaeus. Notice how much he has borrowed from this predecessor of his,
   and how carefully he has avoided, in doing so, his most profound
   speculations! Tertullian was a Sophist in the good and bad sense of the
   term. He was in his element in Aristotelian and Stoic dialectics; in
   his syllogisms he is a philosophising advocate. But in this also he was
   the pioneer of his Church, whose theologians have always reasoned more
   than they have philosophised. The manner in which he rings the changes
   on auctoritas and ratio, or combines them, and spins lines of thought
   out of them; the formal treatment of problems, meant to supply the
   place of one dealing with the matter, until it ultimately loses sight
   of aim and object, and falls a prey to the delusion that the certainty
   of the conclusion guarantees the certainty of the premises--this whole
   method only too well known from mediæval Scholasticism, had its
   originator in Tertullian. [27] In the classical period of eastern
   theology men did not stop at auctoritas and ratio; they sought to reach
   the inner convincing phases of authority, and understood by ratio the
   reason determined by the conception of the matter in question. In the
   West, auctoritas and ratio stood for a very long time side by side
   without their relations being fixed--see the mediæval theologians from
   Cassian--and the speculation introduced by Augustine was ultimately
   once more eliminated, as is proved by the triumph of Nominalism. Stoic,
   or "Aristotelian" rationalism, united with the recognition of empirical
   authority under cover of Augustinian religious formulas, remained the
   characteristic of Roman Catholic dogmatics and morality. [28]

   But the Western type of thought possessed, besides this, an element in
   which it was considerably superior to the Eastern, the psychological
   view. The importance due to Augustine in this respect has been better
   perceived in recent years, and we may look for better results as
   regards the share of Scholasticism in the development of modern
   psychology. [29] In Augustine himself Stoic rationalism was thrust
   strongly into the background by his supreme effort to establish the
   psychology of the moral and immoral, the pious and impious on the basis
   of actual observation. His greatness as a scientific theologian is
   found essentially in the psychological element. But that also is first
   indicated in Tertullian. As a moralist he indeed follows, so far as he
   is a philosopher, the dogmatism of the Stoa; but Stoic physics could
   lead into an empirical psychology. In this respect Tertullian's great
   writing, "De anima," is an extremely important achievement. It contains
   germs of insight and aspirations which developed afterwards; and
   another Western before Augustine, Arnobius, also did better work in
   grasping problems psychologically than the great theologians of the
   East. [30] This side of Western theology undoubtedly continued weak
   before Augustine, because the eclecticism and moralism to which Cicero
   had especially given currency held the upper hand through the reading
   of his works. [31]

   Finally, still another element falls to be mentioned which
   distinguishes the features of Western Christianity from the Eastern,
   but which it is hard to summarise in one word. Many have spoken of its
   more practical attitude. But in the East, Christianity received as
   practical a form as people there required. What is meant is connected
   with the absence of the speculative tendency in the West. To this is to
   be attributed the fact that the West did not fix its attention above
   all on deification, nor, in consequence, on asceticism, but kept real
   life more distinctly in view; it therefore obtained to a greater extent
   from the gospel what could rule and correct that life. Thus Western
   Christianity appears to us from the first more popular and biblical, as
   well as more ecclesiastical. It may be that this impression is chiefly
   due to our descent from the Christianity in question, and that we can
   never therefore convey it to a Greek [32] ; but it is undeniable that
   as the Latin idiom of the Church was from its origin more popular than
   the Greek, which always retained something hieratic about it, so the
   West succeeded to a greater extent in giving effect to the words of the
   gospel. For both of these facts we have to refer again to Tertullian.
   He had the gift, granted to few Christian writers, of writing
   attractively, both for theologians and laymen. His style, popular and
   fresh, must have been extremely effective. On the other hand, he was
   able, in writings like De patientia, De oratione, De pænitentia, or De
   idololatria, to express the gospel in a concrete and homely form; and
   even in many of his learned and polemical works, which are full of
   paradoxes, antitheses, rhetorical figures, frigid sentences, and wild
   exaggerations, we do not fail to find the clear and pertinent
   application of evangelical sayings, astonishing only by its simplicity,
   and reminding us, where the thought takes a higher flight, not
   infrequently of Augustine. [33]

   The Christianity and theology of Tertullian, whose elements we have
   here endeavoured to characterise, were above all headed by the
   primitive Christian hope and morality. In these was comprehended what
   he felt to be his inmost thought. Both phases recur in a large section
   of Latin literature of the third and of the first half of the fourth
   century. [34] There it is hardly possible to find any traces of
   Antignostic dogmatics; on the contrary, Apocalyptics were developed
   with extreme vividness, and morality, often Stoic in colouring,
   received a stringent form. [35] The whole of the abundant literary
   labours and dogmatic efforts of Hippolytus seem to have been lost on
   the West from the first and completely.

   But Tertullian also was deprived by his Montanism of the full influence
   which he might have exerted on the Church. [36] The results of his work
   passed to Cyprian, and, though much abbreviated and modified, were
   circulated by him. For the period from A.D. 260 down to
   Ambrose--indeed, properly speaking, to Augustine and Jerome--Cyprian
   became the Latin Church author par excellence. All known and unknown
   Latin writers of his time, and after him, had but a limited influence:
   he, as an edifying and standard author, dictated like a sovereign to
   the Western Church for the next 120 years. His authority ranked close
   after that of the Holy Scriptures, and it lasted up to the time of
   Augustine. [37]

   Cyprian had hardly one original theological thought; for even the work
   "De unitate ecclesiæ" rests on points of view which are partly derived
   from the earlier Catholic Fathers, and partly borrowed from the Roman
   Church, to which they were indigenous. In the extremely authoritative
   work, "De opere et eleemosynis" the Tertullian conceptions of merit and
   satisfaction are strictly developed, and are made to serve as the basis
   of penance, almost without reference to the grace of God in Christ.
   Cyprian's chief importance is perhaps due to the fact that, influenced
   by the consequences of the Decian storm he founded, in union with the
   Roman bishop Cornelius, what was afterwards called the sacrament of
   penance; in this, indeed, he was the slave rather than the master of
   circumstances; and in addition, he was yielding to Roman influences
   which had been working in this direction since Calixtus. He established
   the rule of the hierarchy in the Church in the spheres of the
   sacrament, sacrifice, and discipline; he set his seal on
   Episcopalianism; he planted firmly the conceptions of a legal relation
   between man and God, of works of penance as means of grace, and of the
   "satisfactory" expiations of Christ. He also created clerical language
   with its solemn dignity, cold-blooded anger, and misuse of Biblical
   words to interpret and criticise contemporary affairs--a metamorphosis
   of the Tertullian genius for language. Cyprian by no means inherited
   the interest taken by Tertullian in Antignostic theology. Like all
   great princes of the Church, he was a theologian only in so far as he
   was a catechist. He held all the more firmly by the symbol, and knew
   how to state in few words its undoubted meaning, and to turn it
   skilfully even against allied movements like that of Novatian.

   This had been learnt from Rome, where, since as early as the end of the
   second century, the "Apostles'" creed had been used with skill and tact
   against the motley opinions held about doctrine by Eastern immigrants.
   The Roman Bishops of the third century did not meddle with dogmatic
   disputes; the only two who tried it, and undoubtedly rendered great
   services to the Church, Hippolytus and Novatian, could not keep the
   sympathies of the clergy or the majority. In the West men did not live
   as Christians upon dogma, but they were obedient to the short law (lex)
   presented in the Symbol; [38] they impressed the East by the confidence
   with which, when necessary, they adopted a position in dogmatic
   questions, following in the doctrine of the Trinity and in Christology
   an original scheme formed by Tertullian and developed by Novatian; [39]
   while at the same time they worked at the consolidation of the
   constitution of the Church, the construction of a practical
   ecclesiastical moral code, as also the disciplining and training of the
   community through Divine Service and the rules of penance. [40] The
   canons of Elvira, which, for the rest, are not lax, but are even
   distinguished by their stringency, show how strictness and clemency
   were united, Christendom being marked off from the world, while at the
   same time a life in the world was rendered possible, and even the
   grossest sins were still indulged in. The result was a complete
   ecclesiastical constitution, with an almost military organisation. At
   its head stood the Roman Bishop, who, in spite of the abstract equality
   of all Bishops, occupied a unique position, not only as representative,
   but also as actual defender of the unity of the Church, which,
   nevertheless, was severely shaken, first by Novatianism, and afterwards
   by Donatism.

   When Constantine granted toleration and privileges to the Church, and
   enabled the provincial Churches to communicate with all freedom, Rome
   had already become a Latin city, and the Roman community was thoroughly
   Latinised; elsewhere also in the West the Greek element, once so
   powerful, had receded. Undoubtedly, Western Christians had no other
   idea than that they formed a single Church with the East; they were
   actually at one with the Eastern tendency represented by Athanasius in
   the fundamental conceptions of the doctrines of God, Christ, and
   eternal salvation. But their interests were often divided, and, in
   fact, there was little mutual understanding, particularly after
   Cappadocian orthodoxy triumphed in the East. From the middle of the
   third century the weakening of the central power had once more restored
   their independence to all the provinces, and had thus set free the
   principle of nationality; and this would have led to a complete
   reaction and wholesale particularism had not some energetic rulers, the
   migrations of the tribes, and the Church set up a barrier, which,
   indeed, ultimately proved too weak in the East.

   It was the great dogmatic controversies which compelled the provincial
   Churches to look beyond their own borders. But the sympathy of the West
   for the East--there never developed any vital interest in the opposite
   direction [41] --was no longer general or natural. It sprang, as a
   rule, from temporary necessities or ambitious purposes. Yet it became
   of incalculable importance for Western theology; for their relations
   with the East, into which the Western Church was brought by the Arian
   conflict, led Western Christians to observe more closely two great
   phenomena of the Eastern Church, the scientific theology (of Origen)
   and monachism.

   It may here be at once said that the contact and influence which thus
   arose did not in the end change the genius and tendency of the Western
   Church to its depths. In so far as a lasting change was introduced in
   the fifth century, it is not to be derived from this quarter. But for
   their suggestiveness, the capital and impulse which were received from
   the East cannot be highly enough appreciated We need only compare the
   writings of the Latin theologians who were not influenced by the
   Greeks, [42] with Hilary, Victorinus Rhetor, Ambrose, Jerome, Rufinus,
   and the others dependent on them, in order to perceive the enormous
   difference. The exegetical and speculative science of the Greeks was
   imported into the West, and, besides monachism and the ideal of a
   virginity devoted to God, as the practical application of that science.

   The West was not disposed to favour either of these, and since it is
   always hardest to carry through changes in the rules of practical life,
   the implanting of monachism cost embittered conflicts. [43] But the
   ideal of virginity, as denoting the love-bond with Christ, very soon
   established itself among the spiritual leaders of the West. (Even
   before this, Cyprian says, De hab. virg. 22: and you virgins have no
   husband, your lord and head is Christ in the similitude and place of a
   man.) [44] It then won through Ambrose the same significance for the
   West as it had obtained through Origen's expositions of the Song of
   Songs and Methodius in the East. Nay, it was in the West that the ideal
   was first, so to speak, individualised, and that it created a profusion
   of forms in which it was allied with or excited the impassioned love of
   Christ. [45] The theological science of the Greeks could not have
   domesticated itself, even if the time had been less unfavourable; just
   then its authority was tottering even in the East, after the
   Cappadocians seemed to have reconciled faith and knowledge for a brief
   period. Where one has once been accustomed to regard a complex of
   thoughts as an inviolable law, a legal order, it is no longer possible
   to awaken for it for a length of time the inner sympathy which clings
   to spheres in which the spiritual life finds a home; and if it does
   succeed in obtaining an assured position, its treatment assumes a
   different character; there is no freedom in dealing with it. As a
   matter of fact, the West was always less free in relation to dogma
   proper than the East in the classic period of Church theology. In the
   West men reflected about, and now and again against, dogma; but they
   really thought little in it.

   But how great, nevertheless, were the stores rescued to the West from
   the East [46] by Greek scholars, especially Hilary, Ambrose, and
   Jerome, at a time when the Greek sun had already ceased to warm the
   West! In the philosophical, historical, and theological elements
   transplanted by them, we have also one of Augustine's roots. He learned
   the science of exegetical speculation from Ambrose, the disciple of the
   Cappadocians, and it was only by its help that he was delivered from
   Manichæism. He made himself familiar with Neoplatonic philosophy, and
   in this sphere he was apparently assisted by the works of another Greek
   scholar, Victorinus Rhetor. He acquired an astonishing amount of
   knowledge of the Egyptian monks, and the impression thus received
   became of decisive importance for him. These influences must be weighed
   if we are to understand thoroughly the conditions under which such a
   phenomenon as that which Augustine offers us was possible. [47] But, on
   the other hand, Augustine continues the Western line represented by
   Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrosiaster, Optatus, Pacian, Prudentius, and
   also by Ambrose. Extremely characteristic is his relation to the Stoic
   Christian popular philosophy of Western teachers. We shall see that he
   retained a remnant of it. But his importance in the history of the
   Church, and of dogma, consisted essentially in the fact that he gave to
   the West, in place of Stoic Christian popular morality as that was
   comprised in Pelagianism, a religious and specifically Christian ethic,
   and that he impressed this so strongly on the Church that its formulas
   at least maintain their supremacy up to the present day in the whole of
   Western Christendom. In getting rid, however, of Stoic morals, he also
   thrust aside its curious complement, the realistic eschatology in which
   the ancient Latin Christians had given specific expression to their
   Christian faith.

   Ambrose was sovereign among Western Bishops, and at the same time the
   Greek trained exegete and theologian. In both qualities he acted on
   Augustine, who looked up to him as Luther did to Staupitz. [48] He
   comes first to be considered here in the latter respect. His education,
   his Episcopal chair in Milan, the Arian and Apollinarian conflict into
   which he had to enter, directed him to Greek theological literature.
   Philo, Hippolytus, Origen, and Basil were industriously read by him; he
   made extracts from them, and edited them in Latin. [49] He was united
   with Basil, not only by similiarity of situation, but above all by
   agreement in character and attitude. Basil was his real teacher in
   doctrine, and while the former was met with distrust in Alexandria and
   Rome, Ambrose highly honoured him, and fully recognised his orthodoxy.
   The importance of this attitude of the Milanese Bishop for the closing
   of the Arian controversy, and for the reconciliation of Roman and
   Alexandrian orthodoxy with that of the Cappadocians, has been described
   in an earlier volume. [50] It has indeed been recently shown, beyond
   dispute, that, in spite of his dependence on the Greeks, Ambrose
   preserved and further developed the Western system in his Christology.
   [51] Tertullian, Novatian--directly or indirectly--and Hilary
   influenced him. But on the other hand there is no mistake that he
   emphasised more strongly than Augustine the fundamental position of the
   Nicene decision, [52] and that he was confirmed in his doctrine of the
   Two Substances by the Cappadocians, who had been involuntarily led to
   something approaching it in their fight against Apollinaris. Further,
   he treats the Logos in Jesus Christ so much as the subject, the human
   substance so much as form and matter, that here again Greek
   influence--as in Hilary, who was similarly dependent on the
   Greeks--cannot be overlooked; for his own conception of the work of
   Christ conflicts with this stunted view of his human nature. But the
   most important influence of the East upon Ambrose does not lie in the
   special domain of dogmatics. It consists in the reception of the
   allegorical method of exegesis, and of many separate schemes and
   doctrines. It is true Ambrose had his own reservations in dealing with
   Plato and Origen; he did not adopt the consequences of Origen's
   theology; [53] he was much too hasty and superficial in the sphere of
   speculative reflection to appropriate from the Greeks more than
   fragments. But he, as well as the heavier but more thorough Hilary,
   raised the West above the "meagreness" of a pedantically literal, and,
   in its practical application, wholly planless exegesis; and they
   transmitted to their countrymen a profusion of ideas attached to the
   text of Holy Scripture. Rufinus and, in his first period, Jerome also
   completed the work. Manichæism would hardly have been overcome in the
   West unless it had been confronted by the theosophic exegesis, the
   "Biblical alchemy" of the Greeks, and the great theme of virginity was
   praised with new tongues after Western Christians heard of the union of
   the soul with its bridegroom, Christ, as taught by Origen in his
   commentary on the Song of Songs. [54] The unity, so far as at all
   attainable, of ecclesiastical feeling in East and West, was restored in
   the loftiest regions of theology about A.D. 390. But the fight against
   Origen, which soon broke out with embittered hatred, had, among other
   sad consequences, the immediate result that the West refused to learn
   anything further from the great theologian. The West never attained a
   strict system in the science of allegorical exegesis.

   The sacred histories of the Old Testament were also transformed into
   spiritual narratives for the West by Hilary, [55] Ambrose, Jerome, and
   Rufinus. [56] In this transformation Western Christians obtained a
   multitude of separate mystical Neoplatonic conceptions, though they
   failed to obtain any insight into the system as a whole. Another
   Western, the rhetorician Victorinus, that "aged man, most learned and
   skilled in the liberal sciences, who had read and weighed so many works
   of the philosophers; the instructor of so many noble Senators, who
   also, as a monument of his excellent discharge of his office, had
   deserved and obtained a statue in the Roman Forum," had initiated his
   fellow-countrymen into Neoplatonism by translations and original works.
   [57] That happened before he became a Christian. Having gone over to
   Christianity at an advanced age, and become a prolific ecclesiastical
   writer, he by no means abandoned Neoplatonism. If I am not mistaken,
   Augustine made him his model in the crucial period of his life, and
   although he understood enough Greek to read Neoplatonic writings, yet
   it was substantially by Victorinus that he was initiated into them.
   Above all, he here learned how to unite Neoplatonic speculation with
   the Christianity of the Church, and to oppose Manichæism from this as
   his starting-point. We do not require to describe in detail what the
   above combination and polemic meant to him. When Neoplatonism became a
   decisive element in Augustine's religious and philosophical mode of
   thought, it did so also for the whole of the West. The religious
   philosophy of the Greeks was incorporated in the spiritual assets of
   the West, along with its ascetic and monachist impulses. [58] But,
   unless all signs deceive, Augustine received from Victorinus the
   impulse which led him to assimilate Paul's type of religious thought;
   for it appears from the works of the aged rhetorician that he had
   appropriated Paul's characteristic ideas, and Augustine demonstrably
   devoted a patient study to the Pauline epistles from the moment when he
   became more thoroughly acquainted with Neoplatonism. Victorinus wrote
   very obscurely, and his works found but a slender circulation. But this
   is not the only case in history where the whole importance of an able
   writer was merged in the service he rendered to a greater successor. A
   great, epoch-making man is like a stream: the smaller brooks, which
   have had their origin perhaps further off in the country, lose
   themselves in it, having fed it, but without changing the course of its
   current. Not only Victorinus, [59] but ultimately also Ambrose himself,
   Optatus, Cyprian, and Tertullian were lost to view in Augustine; but
   they made him the proud stream in whose waters the banks are mirrored,
   on whose bosom the ships sail, and which fertilises and passes through
   a whole region of the world. For not only the work of those Greek
   Latins, but also the line of representatives of genuine Western
   theology and ecclesiasticism ended in Augustine. [60]

   Augustine studied, above all, very thoroughly, and made himself
   familiar with Cyprian's work. Cyprian was to him the "saintly," the
   Church Father, kat' exochen, and his view of heresy and the unity of
   the Church was dependent on Cyprian. But standing as a Bishop,
   unassailed, on the foundation which Cyprian had created, Augustine did
   not find it necessary to state Episcopalianism so uncompromisingly as
   the former, and being occupied with putting an end to a schism which
   was different from the Novatian, he learned to take a different view of
   the nature of schisms from the Bishop whom he venerated as a hero. [61]
   Cursory remarks show, besides, that Augustine had made himself familiar
   with the literature of the Novatian controversy, and had learned from
   it for his notion of the Church. Some works quoted by him we no longer
   possess--e.g., that of Reticius against the Novatians. [62] What has
   been preserved to us of this literature, [63] proves that the Western
   Church was continually impelled, by its opposition to the Novatians in
   the course of the fourth century, to reflect on the nature of the
   Church. [64]

   But even when he entered into the Donatist controversy, Augustine did
   so as a man of the second or indeed of the third generation, and he
   therefore enjoyed the great advantage of having at his disposal a fund
   of conceptions and ideas already collected. In this sphere Optatus had
   especially wrought before him. [65]

   This is not the place to describe the rise of Donatism; for the dispute
   did not originate in a dogmatic controversy. [66] It arose in the first
   place out of Cæcilian's action against the exaggerated veneration of
   martyrs, which disturbed the order and endangered the existence of the
   Church. Some of the clergy who did not desire a strong episcopal power
   seem to have made common cause with the discontented and refractory
   enthusiasts, to whom Cæcilian had been obnoxious even when Deacon. In
   any case, a point of principle did not immediately emerge in the
   controversy. But it was soon introduced, and indeed there is no doubt
   that Cyprian was played off against himself. [67] The Donatist party,
   which was at the same time, it appears, the African national party,
   found support both in Cyprian's conception that the Bishop was only a
   Bishop if he possessed a certain Christian and moral quality, and in
   his defence of heretical baptism. The opposition, also carrying out
   ideas taught by Cyprian, gave such prominence to the official character
   of the episcopate, and the objective efficacy of the sacrament, that
   the personal quality of the official or dispenser became indifferent.
   [68] It may be that those martyrs and relic-worshipping enthusiasts in
   Carthage were inclined from the first to the conception once held by
   Cyprian against Calixtus and his successors, and that they thus
   required a standard of active, personal holiness for bishops, which
   could no longer be sustained in the great Church and during the
   devastating storms of the last persecution. But this cannot be proved.
   On the other hand, it is indisputable that, after the Synod of Arles,
   the controversy had reached a point where it must be regarded as the
   last link in the chain of the great phenomena (Encratites Montanists,
   adherents of Hippolytus and Novatians) in which Christendom strove
   against the secularisation that was imposed upon it by the removal of
   the attribute of holiness, and with it of the truth of the Church, from
   persons to institutions--the office and mysteries; [69] this change
   being due to the fact that otherwise men would have had to despair of
   the Christian character of the Church as Catholic. The Donatists denied
   the validity of any ordination conferred by a traditor, and therefore
   also of sacraments administered by a bishop who had been consecrated by
   a traditor. As a last remnant of a much more earnest conception, a
   minimum of personal worthiness was required of the clergy alone, and
   received into the notion of the Church itself: it was no longer
   Christian if this minimum was wanting, if the clergy--nothing being now
   said of the laity--were not free from every idolatrous stain. Compared
   with the measure of agreement which prevailed between Catholics and
   Donatists, the separate thesis of the latter looks like a caprice, and
   certainly much obstinacy, personal discontent, and insubordination
   lurked behind it. But we may not overlook the question of principle any
   more here than in the case of Novatianism. The legend of the Sybilline
   Books is constantly repeating itself in the history of spiritual
   conflicts. The remnant saved from the flames stands at as high a price
   as the whole collection. And what a price the Church has paid in order
   to escape the exhortations of separatists! The Novatian crisis--after
   the Decian persecution--drew from it the sacrament of penance, and
   thereby gave the impulse in general to substitute a system of
   sacraments for the sacrament that blotted out sin. (The formal
   establishment of the new sacrament had, indeed, still to be waited for
   for a long time.) The Donatist crisis--after the Diocletian
   persecution--taught the Church to value ordination as imparting an
   inalienable title (character indelebilis) and to form a stringent view
   of the "objectivity" of the sacraments; or, to use a plainer
   expression, to regard the Church primarily as an institution whose
   holiness and truth were inalienable, however melancholy the state of
   its members.

   In this thought Catholicism was first complete. By it is explained its
   later history down to the present day, in so far as it is not a history
   of piety, but of the Church, the Hierarchy, sacramental magic, and
   implicit faith (fides implicita). But only in the West did the thought
   come to be deliberately and definitely expressed. It also made its way
   in the East, because it was inevitable; but it did so, as it were,
   unconsciously. This was no advantage; for the very fact that this
   conception of the Church was definitely thought out in the West, led
   over and over again to the quest for safeguards, or a form which could
   be reconciled with living faith, and the requirements of a holy life.
   Even Augustine, who stated it definitely and fully, aimed at
   reconciling the Christian conscience with it. But he was not the first
   to declare it; he rather received it from tradition. The first
   representative of the new conception known to us, and Augustine also
   knew him, was Optatus.

   The work of Optatus, "De schismate Donatistarum," was written in the
   interests of peace, and therefore in as friendly and conciliatory a
   tone as possible. This did not, indeed, prevent violent attacks in
   detail, and especially extremely insulting allegorical interpretations
   of texts from Scripture. But the author every now and then recalls the
   fact that his opponents are after all Christian brethren (IV., I., 2),
   who have disdainfully seceded from the Church, and only decline to
   recognise what is gladly offered them, Church fellowship. At the very
   beginning of his book, which, for the rest, is badly arranged, because
   it is a reply point by point to a writing by the Donatist, Parmenian,
   Optatus (I., 10 sq.)--differing from Cyprian--indicates the distinction
   in principle between heretics and schismatics, and he adheres firmly to
   the distinction--already drawn by Irenæus--to the end of his statement.
   [70] Heretics are "deserters from or falsifiers of the Symbol" (I., 10,
   12; II., 8), and accordingly are not Christians; the Donatists are
   seditious Christians. Since the definition holds (I., 11) that "a
   simple and true understanding in the law (scil. the two testaments),
   the unique and most true sacrament, and unity of minds constitute the
   Catholic (scil. Church)," [71] the Donatists only want the last point
   to be genuinely Catholic Christians. The heretics have "various and
   false baptisms," no legitimate office of the keys, no true divine
   service; "but these things cannot be denied to you schismatics, [72]
   although you be not in the Catholic Church, because you have received
   along with us true and common sacraments" (I., 12). He says afterwards
   (III., 9): "You and we have a common ground in the Church
   (ecclesiastica una conversatio), and if the minds of men contend, the
   sacraments do not." Finally, we also can say: "We equally believe, and
   have been stamped with one seal, nor did we receive a different baptism
   from you; nor a different ordination. We read equally the Divine
   Testament; we pray to one God. Among you and us the prayer of our Lord
   is the same, but a rent having been made, with the parts hanging on
   this side and on that, it was necessary that it should be joined." And
   (III., 10) he remarks very spiritually, founding on a passage in
   Ezechiel: "You build not a protecting house, like the Catholic Church,
   but only a wall; the partition supports no corner-stone; it has a
   needless door, nor does it guard what is enclosed; it is swept by the
   rain, destroyed by tempests, and is unable to keep out the robber. It
   is a house wall, but not a home. And your part is a quasi ecclesia, but
   not Catholic." V., 1: "That is for both which is common to you and us:
   therefore it belongs also to you, because you proceed from us;" that is
   the famous principle which is still valid in the present day in the
   Catholic Church. "Finally, both you and we have one ecclesiastical
   language, common lessons, the same faith, the very sacraments of the
   faith, the same mysteries." Undoubtedly Optatus also held ultimately
   that those things possessed by the schismatics were in the end
   fruitless, because their offence was especially aggravated. They merely
   constituted a "quasi ecclesia." For the first mark of the one, true,
   and holy Church was not the holiness of the persons composing it; but
   exclusively the possession of the sacraments. II., 1: "It is the one
   Church whose sanctity is derived from the sacraments, and not estimated
   from the pride of persons. This cannot apply to all heretics and
   schismatics; it remains that it is (found) in one place." The second
   mark consists in territorial Catholicity according to the promise: "I
   will give the heathen for an inheritance, and the ends of the world for
   a possession." II., 1: "To whom, then, does the name of Catholic
   belong, since it is called Catholic because it is reasonable and
   diffused everywhere?" [73]

   Optatus did not succeed in clearly describing the first mark in its
   negative and exclusive meaning; we could indeed easily charge him with
   contradicting himself on this point. The second was all the more
   important in his eyes, [74] since the Donatists had only taken hold in
   Africa and, by means of a few emigrants, in Rome. In both signs he
   prepared the way for Augustine's doctrine of the Church and the
   sacraments, in which Optatus' thought was, of course, spiritualised.
   Optatus has himself shown, in the case of Baptism (V., 1-8), what he
   meant by the "sanctity of the sacraments." In Baptism there were three
   essentials: the acting Holy Trinity ("confertur a trinitate"), the
   believer ("fides credentis"), and the administrator. These three were
   not, however, equally important; the two first rather belonged alone to
   the dogmatic notion of Baptism ("for I see that two are necessary, and
   one as if necessary [quasi necessariam] [75] "), for the baptisers are
   not "lords" (domini), but "agents or ministers of baptism" (operarii
   vel ministri baptismi). (Ambrosiaster calls them advocates who plead,
   but have nothing to say at the end when sentence is passed.) They are
   only ministering and changing organs, and therefore contribute nothing
   to the notion and effect of Baptism; for "it is the part of God to
   cleanse by the sacrament." But if the sacrament is independent of him
   who, by chance, dispenses it, because the rite presupposes only the
   ever the same Trinity and the ever the same faith, [76] then it cannot
   be altered in its nature by the dispenser (V. 4: "the sacraments are
   holy in themselves, not through men: sacramenta per se esse sancta, non
   per homines"). That is the famous principle of the objectivity of the
   sacraments which became so fundamental for the development of the
   dogmatics of the Western Church, although it never could be carried out
   in all its purity in the Roman Church, because in that case it would
   have destroyed the prerogatives of the Clergy. It is to be noticed,
   however, that Optatus made the holiness of the sacraments to be
   effective only for the faith of the believer (fides credentis), and he
   is perfectly consistent in this respect, holding faith to be all
   important, to the complete exclusion of virtues. Here again he prepared
   the way for the future theology of the West by emphasising the
   sovereignty of faith. [77] It is all the more shocking to find that
   even Optatus uses the whole reflection to enable him to depreciate
   claims on the life of the members of the Church. We see clearly that
   the Catholic doctrine of the sacraments grew out of the desire to show
   that the Church was holy and therefore true, in spite of the irreligion
   of the Christians belonging to it. But in aiming at this, men lit,
   curiously, upon a trace of evangelical religion. Since it was
   impossible to point to active holiness, faith and its importance were
   called to mind. A great crisis, a perplexity, in which, seeing the
   actual condition of matters, the Catholic Church found itself involved
   with its doctrine of Baptism, virtue, and salvation, turned its
   attention to the promise of God and faith. Thus the most beneficent and
   momentous transformation experienced by Western Christianity before
   Luther was forced upon it by circumstances. But it would never have
   made its way if it had not been changed by the spiritual experiences of
   a Catholic Christian, Augustine, from an extorted theory [78] into a
   joyful and confident confession.

   Parmenian gave Optatus occasion to enumerate certain "endowments"
   (dotes) of the Church, i.e., the essential parts of its possession.
   Parmenian had numbered six, Optatus gives five: (1) cathedra (the
   [Episcopal] chair); (2) angelus; (3) spiritus; (4) fons; (5) sigillum
   (the symbol). The enumeration is so awkward that one can only regret
   that it is adapted to the formula of an opponent. But we learn, at
   least, in this way that Cyprian's ideal of the unity of the Episcopate,
   as represented in Peter's chair, had been received and fostered
   unsuspiciously in Africa. "Peter alone received the keys" (I., 10, 12).
   "You cannot deny your knowledge that on Peter, in the city of Rome, was
   first conferred the Episcopal chair, in which he sat, the head of all
   the Apostles, whence he was also called Cephas, in which one chair
   unity might be observed by all, lest the rest of the Apostles should
   severally defend one, each for himself, in order that he might now be a
   schismatic and sinner, who should appoint a second as against the one
   unique chair" (II., 2). The connection with Peter's chair was of
   decisive importance, not only for Optatus, but also for his opponent
   (II., 4), who had appealed to the fact that Donatists had also
   possessed a Bishop in Rome. Optatus, besides, discusses the second
   point, the angelus, who is the legitimate Bishop of the local
   community, the chair (cathedra) guaranteeing the oecumenical unity, and
   he emphasises the connection of the African Catholic Churches with the
   Oriental, and especially the seven-fold ecclesia of Asia (Rev. II., 3),
   almost as strongly as that with the Roman Church (II., 6; VI., 3). His
   disquisitions on spiritus, [79] fons, and sigillum, are devoid of any
   special interest (II., 7-9). On the other hand, it is important to
   notice that he expressly subordinates the consideration of the
   endowments (dotes) of the Church, to the verification of "its sacred
   members and internal organs" (sancta membra ac viscera ecclesia), about
   which Parmenian had said nothing. These consisted in the sacraments and
   the names of the Trinity "in which meet the faith and profession of
   believers" (cui concurrit fides credentium et professio). Thus he
   returns to his natural and significant line of thought. [80]

   If Ambrosiaster and Optatus prepared the way for Augustine's doctrines
   of the sacraments, faith, and the Church, [81] Ambrose did so for those
   of sin, grace, and faith. We have endeavoured above to estimate his
   importance to Augustine as a disciple of the Greeks; we have now to
   regard him as a Western. [82] But we have first of all to consider not
   the theologian, but the Bishop. It was the royal priest who first
   opened Augustine's eyes to the authority and majesty of the Church.
   Only a Roman Bishop--even if he did not sit in the Roman chair--could
   teach him this, and perhaps the great work, De civitate Dei, would
   never have been written had it not been for the way in which this
   majesty had been impressed on Augustine by Ambrose; for great
   historical conceptions arise either from the fascinating impression
   made by great personalities or from political energy; and Augustine
   never possessed the latter. It was, on the contrary, in Ambrose, the
   priestly Chancellor of the State, that the imperial power (imperium) of
   the Catholic Church dawned upon him, [83] and his experiences of the
   confusion and weakness of the civil power at the beginning of the fifth
   century completed the impression. Along with this Ambrose's sermons
   fall to be considered. [84] If, on one side, they were wholly dependent
   on Greek models, yet they show, on the other hand, in their practical
   tone, the spirit of the West. Augustine's demand that the preacher
   should "teach, sway, and move" (docere, flectere, movere) is as if
   drawn from those sermons. in spite of the asceticism and virginity
   which he also mainly preached, he constantly discussed all the concrete
   affairs of the time and the moral wants of the community. [85] Thus
   Ambrose represents the intimate union of the ascetic ideal with
   energetic insistence on positive morality, a union which the Western
   mediæval Church never lost, however much practical life was
   subordinated to the contemplative.

   Three different types of thought are interwoven in Ambrose's doctrine
   of sin and grace. First, he was dependent on the Greek conception that
   regarded evil as not-being, but at the same time as necessary. [86]
   Secondly, he shows that he was strongly influenced by the popular
   morality of Ciceronian Stoicism, [87] which was widespread among
   cultured Western Christians, and which had, by its combination with
   monastic morality, brought about, in Pelagianism, the crisis so
   decisive for the dogmatics of the West. Thirdly and finally, he carried
   very much further that view taken by Tertullian of the radical nature
   of evil and the guiltiness of sin which was made his fundamental
   principle by Augustine. Evil was radical, and yet its root was not
   found in the sensuous, but in "pride of mind" (superbia animi); it
   sprang from freedom, and was yet a power propagating itself in mankind.
   The Greeks had looked on the universal state of sinfulness as a more or
   less accidental product of circumstances; Ambrose regarded it as the
   decisive fact, made it the starting-point of his thought, and referred
   it more definitely than any previous teacher--Ambrosiaster excepted--to
   Adam's Fall. [88] Passages occur in his works which in this respect do
   not fall a whit behind the famous statements of Augustine. [89]

   But important as this phase was, in which thought was no longer
   directed primarily to sin's results, or to the single sinful act, but
   to the sinful state which no virtue could remove, yet it is just in
   this alone that we can perceive the advance made by Ambrose. As regards
   religion, none is to be found in his works; for his doctrine of the
   traducian character and tenacity of sin was in no way connected with
   the heightened consciousness of God and salvation. Ambrose did not
   submit evil to be decided upon in the light of religion. Therefore he
   merely groped his way round the guilty character of sin, without
   hitting upon it; he could once more emphasise the weakness of the flesh
   as an essential factor; and he could maintain the proposition that man
   was of himself capable of willing the good. For this reason, finally,
   his doctrine of sin is to us an irreconcilable mass of contradictions.
   But we must, nevertheless, estimate very highly the advance made by
   Ambrose in contemplating the radical sinful condition. It was
   undoubtedly important for Augustine. And to this is to be added that he
   was able to speak in a very vivid way of faith, conceiving it to be a
   living communion with God or Christ. The religious individualism which
   shines clearly in Augustine already does so faintly in Ambrose: "Let
   Christ enter thy soul, let Jesus dwell in your minds. . . . What
   advantage is it to me, conscious of such great sins, if the Lord do
   come, unless He comes into my soul, returns into my mind, unless Christ
   lives in me?" [90] And while in many passages he distinctly describes
   the merit gained by works, and love as means of redemption, yet in some
   of his reflections, on the other hand, he rises as strongly to the
   lofty thought that God alone rouses in us the disposition for what is
   good, and that we can only depend on the grace of God in Christ. [91]
   St. Paul's Epistles occupied the foreground in Ambrose's thought, [92]
   and from them he learned that faith as confidence in God is a power by
   itself, and does not simply fall into the realm of pious belief.
   However much he adds that is alien, however often he conceives faith to
   be an act of obedience to an external authority, he can speak of it in
   different terms from his predecessors. Faith is to him the fundamental
   fact of the Christian life, not merely as belief in authority ("faith
   goes before reason," fides prævenit rationem), [93] but as faith which
   lays hold of redemption through Christ, and justifies because it is the
   foundation of perfect works, and because grace and faith are alone
   valid before God. "And that benefits me because we are not justified
   from the works of the law. I have no reason, therefore, to glory in my
   works, I have nothing to boast of; and therefore I will glory in
   Christ. I will not boast because I am just, but because I am redeemed.
   I will glory, not because I am without sins, but because my sins have
   been remitted. I will not glory because I have done good service, or
   because anyone has benefited me, but because the blood of Christ was
   shed for me." [94] That is Augustinianism before Augustine, nay, it is
   more than Augustinianism. [95]

   In the dogmatic work of Western theologians of the fourth century, the
   genius of Western Christianity, which found its most vigorous
   expression in Cyprian's De opere et eleemosynis, fell away to some
   extent. But it only receded, remaining still the prevailing spirit. The
   more vital notion of God, the strong feeling of responsibility to God
   as judge, the consciousness of God as moral power, neither restricted
   nor dissolved by any speculation on nature--all that constituted the
   superiority of Western to Eastern Christianity is seen in its worst
   form under the deteriorating influence of the legal doctrine of
   retribution, and the pseudo-moral one of merit. [96] In view of this,
   the inrush of Neoplatonic mysticism was highly important; for it
   created a counterpoise to a conception which threatened to dissolve
   religion into a series of legal transactions. But the weightiest
   counterpoise consisted in the doctrine of faith and grace as proclaimed
   by Augustine. However, it will be shown that Augustine taught his new
   conception in such a form that it did not shatter the prevailing
   system, but could rather be admitted into it; perhaps the greatest
   triumph ever achieved in the history of religion by a morality of
   calculations over religion.

   The conception of religion as a legal relationship, which was concerned
   with the categories lex (law) delictum (fault) satisfactio, poena
   (punishment) meritum, præmium, etc., was not destroyed by Augustine.
   Grace was rather inserted in a legal and objective form into the
   relationship, yet in such a way that it remained possible for the
   individual to construe the whole relationship from the point of view of
   grace.

   We have attempted, in the above discussion, to exhibit the different
   lines existing in the West which meet in Augustine. Let us, in
   conclusion, emphasise further the following points.

   1. Along with Holy Scripture, the Symbol, the Apostolic "law" (lex),
   was placed in the West on an unapproachable height. This law was framed
   in opposition to Marcionitism, Sabellianism, Arianism, and
   Apollinarianism, without essential variations, and without any process
   of reasoning, as a confession of faith in the unity of God in three
   persons, as also in the unity of Christ in two substances. The Western
   Church, therefore, apparently possessed a lofty certitude in dealing
   with Trinitarian and Christological problems. But with this certitude
   was contrasted the fact, of which we have many instances, that under
   cover of the official confession many more Christological heresies
   circulated, and were maintained in the West than in the Churches of the
   East, and that in particular the Christological formula, where it was
   not wholly unknown, was, for the laity and for many of the clergy,
   simply a noumenon. [97] This fact is further confirmed when we observe
   that Western theologians, as long as they were not directly involved in
   Eastern controversies, did not turn their attention to the principles
   contained in the above "law," but to quite different questions.
   Augustine was not the first to write "expositions of the Symbol," in
   which questions, wholly different from what his text would lead us to
   expect, were discussed. On the contrary, Western theologians from
   Cyprian show that they lived in a complex of ideas and questions which
   had little to do with the problems treated by Antignostics and
   Alexandrians, or with dogma.

   2. In connection with the development of penance on the basis of works
   and merits (in the sense of satisfactions), and in harmony with the
   legal spirit characteristic of Western theological speculation,
   Christ's expiatory work came now to the front. It was not so much the
   Incarnation--that was the antecedent condition--as the death of Christ,
   which was regarded as the salient point (punctum saliens); [98] and it
   was already treated from all conceivable points of view as a
   sacrificial death, atonement, ransom, and vicarious consummation of the
   crucifixion. At the same time, Ambrose discussed its relationship
   (reconciliatio, redemptio, satisfactio, immolatio, meritum) to sin as
   guilt (reatus). In such circumstances the accent fell on the human
   nature of Christ; the offerer and offering was the mediator as man, who
   received his value through the divine nature, though quite as much so
   by his acceptance on the part of the Deity. Thus the West had a
   Christological system of its own, which, while the formula of the two
   natures formed its starting-point, was pursued in a new direction: the
   mediator was looked on as the man whose voluntary achievement possessed
   an infinite value in virtue of the special dispensation of God. [99]
   (Optat I., 10: "the world [was] reconciled to God by means of the flesh
   of Christ": mundus reconciliatus deo per carnem Christi.) From this we
   can understand how Augustine, in not a few of his arguments, opposed,
   if in a veiled fashion, the doctrine of the divine nature of Christ,
   discussing the merits of the historical Christ as if that nature did
   not exist, but everything was given to Christ of grace. [100] The same
   reason further explains why afterwards modified Adoptianism was
   constantly re-emerging in the West, [101] it being from the stand-point
   of the consistent Greek Christology the worst of heresies because it
   dislocated the whole structure of the latter, and threw its purpose
   into confusion. Finally, the same fact also explains why, in later
   times, Western Christians, particularly such as had acquired the
   mystical monachist observance of intercourse with Christ, the chaste
   bridegroom, substantially reduced the Christological conception to
   "Ecce homo." The vividness and thrilling power which this figure
   possessed for them, raising them above sorrow and suffering, cannot
   deceive us as to the fact that the Church Christology was no longer
   anything to them but a formula. But while the ancient Western form had
   become the basis of a view which left fancy and disposition to fix the
   significance of Christ's Person, that must not be described as a
   necessary deduction from it. That form--in which Christ was the object
   of the Father's grace, carried out what the Father entrusted him with,
   and by Him was exalted--rather corresponded to the clearest passages of
   the New Testament, and was the only protection against the
   superstitious conceptions of the Greeks which emptied the Gospel of all
   meaning. Of decisive value, however, are not the various mediæval
   attempts to appraise Christ's work, but rather the whole tendency to
   understand Christianity as the religion of atonement; for in this
   tendency is expressed characteristically the fear of God as judge,
   which, in the East, disappeared behind mystic speculations. [102]

   3. An acute observer perceives that the soteriological question--How
   does man get rid, and remain rid, of his sins and attain eternal
   life?--had already, in the fourth century, actively engaged the earnest
   attention of thinkers in the Western Church, and, indeed, in such a way
   that, as distinguished from the East, the religious and moral sides of
   the problem are no longer found separate. But the question was not
   clearly put before the Pelagian conflict, since the controversies with
   Heraclius and Jovinian were not followed by a lasting movement.
   Opinions were still jumbled together in a motley fashion, sometimes in
   one and the same writer. If I see aright, five different conceptions
   can be distinguished for the period about 400 A.D. First we have the
   Manichæan which insinuated its way in the darkness, but was widely
   extended, even among the clergy; according to it evil was a real
   physical power, and was overcome in the individual by goodness, equally
   a physical force which was attached to natural potencies and Christ.
   [103] Secondly, we have the Neoplatonic and Alexandrian view which
   taught that evil was not-being, that which had not yet become, the
   necessary foil of the good, the shadow of the light, the transitoriness
   cleaving to the "many" in opposition to the "one." It held that
   redemption was the return to the one, the existent, to God; that it was
   identification with God in love; Christ was the strength and crutches
   for such a return; for "energies and crutches come from one hand."
   [104] Thirdly, there was the rationalistic Stoic conception; this held
   that virtue was the supreme good; sin was the separate evil act
   springing from free will; redemption was the concentration of the will
   and its energetic direction to the good. Here again the historical and
   Christological were really nothing but crutches. [105] All these three
   conceptions lay the greatest stress on asceticism. Fourthly, there was
   the sacramental view, which may be characterised partly as morally lax,
   partly as "evangelical"; we find it, e.g., in Heraclius [106] on the
   one hand, and in Jovinian [107] on the other. According to it he who
   was baptised possessing genuine faith obtained the guarantee of
   felicity; sin could not harm him; no impeachment of sin (reatus
   peccati) could touch him. It is proved that really lax and
   "evangelical" views met: a man could always rely as a Christian on the
   grace of God; sin did not separate him from God, if he stood firm in
   the faith. Nay, from the second century, really from Paul, there
   existed in the Gentile Church movements which deliberately defended
   reliance on faith alone (the "sola fide") and "the most assured
   salvation through grace granted in baptism" (salus per gratiam in
   baptismo donatam certissima.) [108] A fifth conception was closely
   related to, yet different from, the last. We can call it briefly the
   doctrine of grace and merit. We have pointed out strong traces of it in
   Victorinus, Optatus, and Ambrose. According to it, evil as the inherent
   sin of Adam was only to be eradicated by divine grace in Christ; this
   grace produced faith to which, however, redemption was only granted
   when it had advanced and become the habitual love from which those good
   works spring that establish merit in the sight of God. Evil is
   godlessness and the vice that springs from it; goodness is the energy
   of grace and the good works that flow from it. Here, accordingly,
   nature and grace, unbelief and faith, selfishness and love of God are
   the antitheses, and the work of the historical Christ stands in the
   centre. Nevertheless, this view did not exclude asceticism, but
   required it, since only that faith was genuine and justified men which
   evinced itself in sanctification, i.e., in world-renouncing love. Thus
   a middle path was here sought between Jovinian on the one side and
   Manichæan and Priscillian asceticism on the other. [109]

   These different conceptions met and were inextricably mingled. The
   future of Christianity was necessarily to be decided by the victory of
   one or other of them.

   4. In the West, interest in the question of the relation of grace and
   means of grace to the Church was awakened by the Novatian, heretical
   baptism, and Donatist controversy. This interest was, however, still
   further strengthened by the fact that the Church detached itself more
   forcibly from the State than in the East. The fall of the West Roman
   Empire, opposition to the remains of a still powerful heathen party in
   Rome, and finally dislike to the new Arian German forms of government
   all contributed to this.

   One perhaps expects to find here by way of conclusion a
   characterisation of the different national Churches of the West; but
   little can be said from the standpoint of the history of dogma. The
   distinctive character of the North African Church was strongly marked.
   A darkness broods over the Churches of Spain, Gaul, and Britain, in
   which the only clear spot is the conflict of the priests with the
   monachism that was establishing itself. The conflict with
   Priscillianism in Spain, the attacks on Martin of Tours in Gaul, and,
   on the other hand, Vigilantius, come in here. It is not unimportant to
   notice that Southern Gaul was distinguished by its culture and taste
   for aesthetics and rhetoric about A.D. 360 (see Julian's testimony) and
   A.D. 400 (see Sulp. Severus, Chron. init.). Rome only became a
   Christian city in the fifth century, but even in the time of Liberius
   and Damasus the Roman Bishop was the foremost Roman. What was wrested
   by Damasus, that unsaintly but sagacious man, from the State and the
   East, was never again abandoned by his energetic successors; they also
   tried vigorous intervention in the affairs of the provincial Churches.
   Holding faithfully to its confession, the Roman Church was, not only
   from its position, but also by its nature, the connecting link between
   East and West, between the monachist leanings of the former, and the
   tendency to ecclesiastical politics and sacramentarianism of the
   latter. It also united South and North in the West. Rome, again, from
   the time of Liberius pursued and explained that religious policy
   towards paganism, "by which the Catholic Church gained the means not
   only of winning but of satisfying the masses of the people who were,
   and, in spite of the confession, remained heathen" (Usener, Relig.
   Unters., I., p. 293): "it rendered heathenism harmless by giving its
   blessing to it, i.e., to all that belonged to the pagan cultus." But
   that magnanimous way of opposing paganism, which has been rightly
   adduced, and which Usener (op. cit.) has begun to exhibit to us so
   learnedly and instructively, concealed within it the greatest dangers.
   In such circumstances it was of supreme value both for the contemporary
   and future fortunes of the Church that, just when the process of
   ethnicising was in full swing, Augustine, equally at home in North
   Africa, Rome, and Milan, appeared and reminded the Church what
   Christian faith was.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [17] After Gregory I.

   [18] Möhler says very justly, from the Catholic standpoint (Patrologie,
   p. 737): "We are often surprised for a moment, and forget that in
   Tertullian we have before us a writer of the beginning of the third
   century, we feel so mush at home in reading the language, often very
   familiar to us, in which he discusses difficult questions concerning
   dogmatics, morals, or even the ritual of the Church."

   [19] Ultimately men were content, indeed, with preserving the
   inconsistencies, treating them as problems of the schools, and ceasing
   to attempt to solve them; for time makes even self-contradictions
   tolerable, and indeed to some extent hallows them.

   [20] See the 1 Ep. of Clement, also the tractate on The Players, and
   the testimonies of Ignatius, Dionysius of Corinth and others as to the
   old Roman Church.

   auctoritas quoque praesto est."

   valuable, Gesch. des Kirchenlateins, 1879-1881.

   [23] See our expositions of this in Vol. II., p. 67 ff., 108 ff., 128

   and Reform d. jurist. Studiums, 1881: "The science of law was in
   practice the leading factor in Church and State from the twelfth
   century." That it is so still may, to save many words, be confirmed by
   a testimony of Döllinger's. In a memorable speech on Phillips he says,
   (Akad. Vorträge, Vol. II., p. 185 f.): "Frequent intercourse with the
   two closely-allied converts, Iarcke and Phillips, showed me how an
   ultramontane and papistical conception of the Christian religion was
   especially suggested and favoured by legal culture and mode of thought,
   which was dominated, even in the case of German specialists like
   Phillips, not by ancient German, but Roman legal ideas."

   [25] On the designation of Holy Scripture as "lex" in the West, see
   Zahn, Gesch. d. neutestamentlichen Kanous, I. 1, p. 95 f.

   [26] Consider, e.g., a sentence like this of Cyprian De unit. 15:
   "Justitia opus est, ut promereri quis possit deum judicem."

   [27] A series of legal schemes framed by Tertullian for his dogmatics
   and ethics have been given in Vol. II., 279 f., 294 f., Vol. IV. pp.
   110, 121. In addition to his speculation on substantia, persona, and
   status, the categories offendere, satisfacere, promereri, acceptare,
   and rependere, etc., play the chief part in his system. Most closely
   connected with the legal contemplation of problems is the abstract
   reference to authority; for one does not obey a law because he finds it
   to be good and just, but because it is law. (Tertullian, indeed, knows
   very well, when defending himself against heathen insinuations, that
   the above dictum is not sufficient in the sphere of religion and
   morals, see e.g., Apolog. 4.) This attitude of Tertullian, led up to by
   his dialectical procedure and his alternations between auctoritas and
   ratio, produces in many passages the impression that we are listening
   to a mediæval Catholic. In regard to the alternation above described,
   the work De corona is especially characteristic; but so is Adv. Marc.
   I., 23 f. He writes, De pænit. 4: "Nos pro nostris angustiis unum
   inculcamus, bonum atque optimum esse quod deus præcipit. Audaciam
   existimo de bono divini præcepti disputare. Neque enim quia bonum est,
   idcirco auscultare debemus, sed quia deus præcepit. Ad exhibitionem
   obsequii prior est majestas divinæ potestatis, prior est auctoritas
   imperantis quam utilitas servientis." (Compare Scorp. 2, 3; De fuga, 4;
   De cor. 2.) But the same theologian writes, De pæn. 1: "Res dei ratio,
   quia deus nihil non ratione providit, nihil non ratione tractari
   intellegique voluit." The work De pænit. is in general peculiarly
   fitted to initiate us into Tertullian's style of thought. I shall in
   the sequel pick out the most important points, and furnish parallels
   from his other writings. Be it noticed first that the work emphasises
   the three parts, vera poenitentia (deflere, metus dei), confessio and
   satisfactio, and then adds the venia on the part of the effensus deus.
   In chap. II. we already meet with the expression "merita pænitentiæ."
   There we read: "ratio salutis certam formam tenet, ne bonis umquam
   factis cogitatisve quasi violenta aliqua manus injiciatur. Deus enim
   reprobationem bonorum ratam non habens, utpote suorum, quorum cum
   auctor et defensor sit necesse est, proinde et acceptator, si
   acceptator etiam remunerator     bonum factum deum habet debitorem,
   sicuti et malum, quia judex omnis remunerator est causæ." (De orat. 7:
   "pænitentia demonstratur acceptabilis deo;" we have also
   "commendatior"). Chap. III.; "Admissus ad dominica præcepta ex ipsis
   statim eruditur, id peccato deputandum, a quo deus arceat." (The
   distinction between præcepta and consilia dominica is familiar in
   Tertullian; see Ad. uxor. II. 1; De coron. 4; Adv. Marc. II. 17. In
   Adv. Marc. I. 29, he says that we may not reject marriage altogether,
   because if we did there would be no meritorious sanctity. In Adv. Marc.
   I. 23, the distinction is drawn between "debita" and "indebita
   bonitas"). Chap. III.: as "Voluntas facti origo est;" a disquisition
   follows on velle, concupiscere, perficere. Chap. V.: "Ita qui per
   delictorum pænitentiam instituerat dominus satisfacere, diabolo per
   aliæ pænitentié pænitentiam satisfaciet, eritque tanto magis perosus
   deo, quanto æmulo ejus acceptus." (See De orat. 11; "fratri
   satisfacere," 18; "disciplinæ satisfacere," 23; "satisfacimus deo
   domino nostro"; De jejun. 3; De pud. 9, 13; De pat. 10, 13, etc., etc.:
   "peccator patri satisfacit," namely, through his penances; see De pud.
   13: "hic jam carnis interitum in officium pænitentiæ interpretantur,
   quod videatur jejuniis et sordibus et incuria omni et dedita opera malæ
   tractationis carnem exterminando satis deo facere"). In ch. V. it is
   explained quite in the Catholic manner that timor is the fundamental
   form of the religious relation. Here, as in countless other passages,
   the "deus offenses" moves Tertullian's soul (see De pat. 5: "hinc deus
   irasci exorsus, unde offendere homo inductus.") Fear dominates the
   whole of penitence. (De pænit. 6: "metus est instrumentum pænitentiæ."
   In general "offendere deum" and "satisfacere deo" are the proper
   technical terms; see De pæn. 7: "offendisti, sed reconciliari adhuc
   potes; habes cui satisfacias et quidem volentem." Ch. X.: "intolerandum
   scilicet pudori, domino offenso satisfacere." Ch. XI.: "castigationem
   victus atque cultus offenso domino præstare." Along with satisfacere we
   have "deum iratum, indignatum mitigare, placare, reconciliare." Ch. VI:
   "omnes salutis inpromerendo deo petitores sumus." Compare with this
   "promereri deum" Scorp. 6: "quomodo multæ mansiones apud patrem, si non
   pro varietate meritorum . . . porro et si fidei propterea congruebat
   sublimitati et claritatis aliqua prolatio, tale quid esse opportuerat
   illud emolumenti, quod magno constaret labore, cruciatu, tormento,
   morte . . . eadem pretia quæ et merces." De orat. 2: "meritum fidei."
   3: "nos angelorum, si meruimus, candidati"; 4: "merita cujusque." De
   pænit. 6: "catechumenus mereri cupit baptismum, timet adhuc delinquere,
   ne non mereretur accipere." De pat. 4: "artificium promerendi obsequium
   est, obsequii vero disciplina morigera subjectio est." De virg. vel.,
   13: "deus justus est ad remuneranda quæ soli sibi fiunt." De exhort. 1:
   "nemo indulgentia dei utendo promeretur, sed voluntati obsequendo;" 2:
   "deus quæ vult præcipit et accepto facit et æternitatis mercede
   dispungit." De pud. 10: "pænitentiam deo immolare . . . magis merebitur
   fructum pænitentiæ qui nondum ea usus est quam qui jam et abusus est."
   De jejun. 3: "ratio promerendi deum" [jejunium iratum deum homini
   reconciliat, ch. VII.]; 13: "ultro officium facere deo." How familiar
   and important in general is to Tertullian the thought of performing a
   service, a favour to God, or of furnishing him with a spectacle! He
   indeed describes as a heathen idea (Apolog. 11) the sentence: "conlatio
   divinitatis meritorum remunerandorum fuit ratio"; but he himself comes
   very near it; thus he says (De exhortat. 10): "per continentiam
   negotiaberis magnam substantiam sanctitatis, parsimonia carnis spiritum
   acquires." He sternly reproves, Scorp. 15, the saying of the "Lax":
   Christus non vicem passionis sitit; he himself says (De pat. 16):
   "rependamus Christi patientiam, quam pro nobis ipse dependit." De
   pænit. 6: "Quam porro ineptum, quam pænitentiam non adimplere, ei
   veniam delictorum sustinere? Hoc est pretium non exhibere, ad mercem
   manum emittere. Hoc enim pretio dominus veniam addicere instituit; hac
   pænitentiæ compensatione redimendam proponit impunitatem," (see Scorp.
   6: "nulli compensatio invidiosa est, in qua aut gratiæ aut injuriæ
   communis est ratio"). In Ch. VI. Tertullian uses "imputare," and this
   word is not rarely found along with "reputare"; in Ch. VII. we have
   "indulgentia" (indulgere), and these terms are met somewhat frequently;
   so also "restituere" (ch. VII. 12: "restitutio peccatoris"). De pat. 8:
   "tantum relevat confessio delictorum, quantum dissimulatio exaggerat;
   confessio omni satisfactionis consilium est." Further, ch. IX.: "Hujus
   igitur pænitentiæ secundæ et unius quanto in arte negotium est, tanto
   operosior probatio (that sounds quite mediæval), ut non sola
   conscientia præferatur, sed aliquo etiam actu administretur. Is actus,
   qui magis Græco vocabulo exprimitur et frequentatur, exomologesis est,
   qua delictum domino nostro confitemur, non quidem ut ignaro, sed
   quatenus satisfactio confessione disponitur, confessione pænitentia
   nascitur, pænitentia deus mitigator. Concerning this exhomologesis,
   this tearful confession, he goes on: "commendat pænitentiam deo et
   temporali afflictatione æterna supplicia non dicam frustratur sed
   expungit." ("Commendare" as used above is common, see e.g., De virg.
   vel. 14, and De pat. 13: "patientia corporis [penances] precationes
   commendat, deprecationes affirmat; hæc aures Christi aperit, clementiam
   elicit."). The conception is also distinctly expressed by Tertullian
   that in the ceremony of penance the Church completely represents Christ
   himself, see ch. X.: "in uno et altero ecclesia est, ecclesia vero
   Christus. Ergo cum te ad fratrum genua protendis, Christum contrectas,
   Christum exoras." De pudic. 10, shows how he really bases pardon solely
   on the "cessatio delicti"; "etsi venia est pænitentiæ fructus, hanc
   quoque consistere non licet sine cessatione delicti. Ita cessatio
   delicti radix est veniæ ut venia sit pænitentiæ fructus." Further ch.
   II.: "omne delictum aut venia dispungit aut poena, venia ex
   castigatione, poena ex damnatione"; but "satisfactio" is implied in the
   "castigatio." In De pudic. 1 the notorious lax edict of Calixtus is
   called "liberalitas" (venia) i.e., "indulgence." Let us further recall
   some formulas which are pertinent here. Thus we have the often-used
   figure of the "militia Christi," and the regimental oath--sacramentum.
   So also the extremely characteristic alternation between "gratia" and
   "voluntas humana," most clearly given in De exhort. 2: "non est bonæ et
   solidæ fidei sic omnia ad voluntatem dei referre et ita adulari unum
   quemque dicendo nihil fieri sine nutu ejus, ut non intellegamus, esse
   aliquid in nobis ipsis. . . . Non debemus quod nostro expositum est
   arbitrio in domini referre voluntatem"; Ad uxor. 1, 8: "quædam enim
   sunt divinæ liberalitatis, quædam nostræ operationis." Then we have the
   remarkable attempt to distinguish two wills in God, one manifest and
   one hidden, and to identify these with præcepta and consilia, in order
   ultimately to establish the "hidden" or "higher" alone. De exhort. 2
   f.: "cum solum sit in nobis velle, et in hoc probatur nostra erga deum
   mens, an ea velimus quæ cum voluntate ipsius faciunt, alte et impresse
   recogitandum esse dico dei voluntatem, quid etiam in occulto velit. Quæ
   enim in manifesto scimus omnes." Now follows an exposition on the two
   wills in God, the higher, hidden, and proper one, and the lower: "Deus
   ostendens quid magis velit, minorem voluntatem majore delevit.
   Quantoque notitiæ tuæ utrumque proposuit, tanto definiit, id te sectari
   debere quod declaravit se magis velle. Ergo si ideo declaravit, ut id
   secteris quod magis vult, sine dubio, nisi ita facis, contra voluntatem
   ejus sapis, sapiendo contra potiorem ejus voluntatem, magisque offendis
   quam promereris, quod vult quidem faciendo et quod mavult respuendo. Ex
   parte delinquis; ex parte, si non delinquis, non tamen promereris. Non
   porro et promereri nolle delinquere est? Secundum igitur matrimonium,
   si est ex illa dei voluntate quæ indulgentia vocatur, etc., etc." On
   the other hand, see the sharp distinction between sins of ignorance
   ("natural sins") and sins of "conscientia et voluntas, ubi et culpa
   sapit et gratia," De pud. 10.

   [28] Augustine has also employed both notions in countless places since
   the writings De Ordine (see II. 26: ad discendum necessarie dupliciter
   ducimur, auctoritate atque ratione) and De vera religione (45: animae
   medicina distribuitur in auctoritatem atque rationem).

   [29] See Kahl, Die Lehre vom Primat des Willens bei Augustin, Duns
   Scotus and Descartes 1886, as also the works of Siebeck; cf. his
   treatise "Die Anfänge der neueren Psychologie in der Scholastik" in the
   Ztschr. f. Philos. u. philosoph. Kritik. New series. 93 Vol., p. 161
   ff., and Dilthey's Einl. in d. Geisteswiss. Vol. I.

   [30] See Franke, Die Psychologie and Erkenntnisslehre des Arnobius,
   1878, in which the empiricism and criticism of this eclectic theologian
   are rightly emphasised. The perception that Arnobius was not original,
   but had taken his refutation of Platonism from Lucretius, and also that
   he remained, after becoming a Christian, the rhetorician that he had
   been before (see Röhricht Seelenlehre des Arnobius, Hamburg, 1893),
   cannot shake the fact that his psychology is influenced by the
   consciousness of redemption.

   [31] Compare especially Minucius Felix and Lactantius.

   [32] Conversely it is quite intelligible that he who has started with
   the ideals of classic antiquity, and has assimilated them, should
   derive more pleasure from men like Clemens Alex. Origen and Gregory of
   Nazianzus than from Tertullian and Augustine. But this sympathy is less
   due to the Christianity of the former scholars. We are no longer
   directly moved by the religious emotions of the older Greeks, while
   expressions of Tertullian and Augustine reach our heart.

   [33] Not only is the distinction between "natura" and "gratia" (e.g.,
   De anima 21), or between "gratia" and "virtus" common in Tertullian,
   not only has he--in his later writings--laid great stress on the
   continued effect of Adam's sin and the transmission of death, but there
   also occur many detached thoughts and propositions which recall
   Augustine. (For the transmission of sin and death see De exhort. 2;
   Adv. Marc. I., 22; De pud. 6, 9; De jejun. 3, 4: "mors cum ipso genere
   traducto," "primordiale delictum expiare," cf. the expression "vitium
   originis"; further, also, the writing De pascha comput. 12, 21.)--De
   orat. 4: "summa est voluntatis dei salus eorum, quos adoptavit." De
   pat. 1: "Bonorum quorundam intolerabilis magnitudo est, ut ad capienda
   et præstanda ea sola gratia divinæ inspirationis operetur. Nam quod
   maxime bonum, id maxime penes deum, nec alius id, quam qui possidet,
   dispensat, ut cuique dignatur." De pænit. 2: "Bonorum unus est titulus
   salus hominis criminum pristinorum abolitione præmissa." De pat. 12:
   "Dilectio summum fidei sacramentum, Christiani nominis thesaurus." De
   orat. 4: In order to fulfil the will of God "opus est dei voluntate
   . . . Christus erat voluntas et potestas patris." 5; "quidquid nobis
   optamus, in illum auguramur, et illi deputamus, quod ab illo
   exspectamus." 9: "Deus solus docere potuit, quomodo se vellet orari."
   De pænit. 2: "Quod homini proficit, deo servit." 4: "Rape occasionem
   inopinatæ felicitatis, ut ille tu, nihil quondam penes deum nisi stilla
   situlæ et areæ pulvus et vasculum figuli, arbor exinde fias ills quæ
   penes aquas seritur, etc." 4: "Obsequii ratio in similitudine animorum
   constituta est." De orat. 7: "debitum in scripturis delicti figura
   est." De bapt. 5: exempto reatu eximitur et poena. De pud. 22: "Quis
   alienam mortem sua solvit nisi solus dei filius." Tertullian imputed
   the proposition "peccando promeremur" (De pud. 10) to his
   ecclesiastical opponents. The religious elements in his mode of thought
   seem to have been decided--apart from the New Testament books--by the
   reading of Seneca's writings. In these Stoic morality seems to have
   been deepened, and in part transcended, by a really religious feeling
   and reflection, so that it was possible to pass from them to Pauline
   Christianity. Seneca, however, influenced Western thinkers generally:
   see Minucius Felix, Novatian, and Jerome De inl. vir. 12. Even in
   Cyprian there occur traits that might be termed Augustinian: notice how
   he emphasises the immanence of Christ in believers, e.g., Ep. 10, 3,
   and cf. the remarkable statement Ep. 10, 4: "Christus in certamine
   agonis nostri et coronat pariter et coronatur." Add Ep. 58, 5:
   "Spiritus dei, qui cum a confitentibus non discedit neque dividitur,
   ipse in nobis loquitur et coronatur." See also the Roman epistle Ep. 8,
   3.

   [34] Compare especially also the writings which are falsely headed with
   the name of Cyprian, and have begun to be examined in very recent
   years.

   [35] Compare the characteristics of the Christianity taught by
   Commodian, Arnobius, and Lactantius, vol. III. p. 77 ff. Novatian was
   accused of Stoicism by his opponents. Several of the writings headed by
   the name of Cyprian are very old and important for our knowledge of
   ancient Latin Christianity. I have verified that in the tractates De
   aleatoribus (Victor), Ad Novatianum (Sixtus), and De laude mart.
   (Novatian) (Texte and Unters, VI., 1; XIII., 1 and 4; see also the
   writings, to be attributed to Novatian, De spectac, and De bono
   pudic.); but let anyone read also "De duobus montibus" in order to gain
   an idea of the theological simplicity and archaic quality of these
   Latins. And yet the author of the above treatise succeeded in
   formulating the phrase (c. 9): "Lex Christianorum crux est sancta
   Christi filii dei vivi." Most instructive are the Instructiones of
   Commodian. The great influence of Hermas' Pastor, and the interest
   directed accordingly to the Church, are characteristic of this whole
   literature. Even unlearned authors continued to occupy themselves with
   the Church, see the Symbol of Carthage: "credo remissionem peccatorum
   per sanctam ecclesiam."

   [36] See my treatise on "Tertullian in der Litteratur der alten Kirche"
   in the Sitzungsber. d. K. Preuss. Akad. d. Wissensch, 1895, p. 545 ff.

   [37] See a short demonstration of this in my Texten und Unters, V 1, p.
   2, and elaborated in my Altchristl. Litt.-Gesch., Part I., p. 688 ff.
   Pitra has furnished new material for the acquaintance also of the East
   with Cyprian in the Analecta Sacra. Cyprian's unparalleled authority in
   the West is attested especially by Lucifer, Prudentius, Optatus,
   Pacian, Jerome, Augustine, and Mommsen's catalogue of the Holy
   Scriptures. The see of Carthage was called in after times "Cathedra
   Cypriani," as that of Rome "Cathedra Petri." Optat. I., 10.

   [38] The perversions adopted in order to represent the Christians as
   being bound to the "lex" are shown, e.g., by the argument in the, we
   admit, late and spurious writing attributed to Cyprian De XII.,
   abusivis sæculi, chap. 12: "Dum Christus finis est legis, qui sine lege
   sunt sine Christo sunt; igitur populus sine lege populus sine Christo
   est." As against this, verdicts such as that cursorily given by
   Tertullian (De spect. 2), that the natural man "deum non novit nisi
   naturali jure, non etiam familiari," remained without effect.

   [39] See on this Vol. II., p. 279 f., 312 f., and Vol. III. and IV. in
   various places; cf. Reuter, Augustin. Studien, pp. 153-230. Since the
   West never perceived clearly the close connection between the result of
   salvation (aphtharsia) and the Incarnation, there always existed there
   a rationalistic element as regards the person of Christ, which
   afterwards disclosed itself completely in Pelagianism. The West only
   completed its own theory as to Christ after it had transferred to His
   work conceptions obtained in the discipline of penance. But that took
   place very gradually.

   [40] Here again the Instructiones of Commodian are very instructive.

   [41] An exception of short duration is formed by the interest taken by
   the Antiochenes in the Western scheme of Christology during the
   Eutychian controversy: see the epistolary collection of Theodoret and
   his Eranistes, as also the works of Theodore of Mopsuestia.

   [42] E.g. Lucifer, so far as he does not simply imitate the Greeks. See
   on his "theology" Krüger's Monograph, 1886.

   [43] See Jovinian and Vigilantius, as also the conflicts of monachism
   in Spain and Gaul (cf. the works of Sulpicius Severus).

   [44] "Virginibus nec maritus dominus, dominus vester ac caput Christus
   est ad instar et vicem masculi." Before this he says of the Church
   (Cypr., de unit. 6): "sponsa Christi, unius cubiculi sanctitatem casto
   pudore custodit." Afterwards this far from beautiful thought was
   transferred to the individual soul, and thus erotic spiritualism was
   produced.

   [45] See details in Vol. III., p. 129 f. The conception of Methodius
   was quite current in Latin writers at the end of the fourth century,
   viz., that Christ must be born in every Christian, and that only so
   could redemption be appropriated. Thus Prudentius sings, "Virginitas et
   prompta fides Christum bibit alvo cordis et intactis condit paritura
   latebris." Ambrose, Expos. in ev. sec. Luc. I. II., c. 26: "Vides non
   dubitasse Mariam, sed credidisse et ideo fructum fidei consecutam.
   . . . Sed et vos beati, qui audistis et credidistis; quæcunque enim
   crediderit anima et concipit et generat dei verbum et opera ejus
   agnoscit. Sit in singulis Mariæ anima, ut magnificet dominum; sit in
   singulis spiritus Mariæ, ut exultet in deo. Si secundum carnem una
   mater est Christi, secundum fidem tamen omnium fructus est Christus.
   Omnis enim anima accipit dei verbum, si tamen immaculata et immunis a
   vitiis intemerato castimoniam pudore custodiat."

   [46] We must pass by the older importer of Greek exegesis, Victorinus
   of Pettau, since, in spite of all his dependence on Origen, the Latin
   spirit held the upper hand, and his activity seems to have been
   limited.

   [47] We may disregard Jerome; he had no importance for Augustine, or if
   he had any, it was only in confirming the latter in his conservative
   attitude. This, indeed, does not refer to Jerome's learning, which to
   Augustine was always something uncanny and even suspicious. Jerome's
   erudition, acquired from the Greeks, and increased with some genius for
   learned investigations, became a great storehouse of the mediæval
   Church; yet Jerome did not mould the popular dogmatics of the Church,
   but confirmed them, and as a rhetorician made them eloquent, while his
   ascetic writings implanted monachism, and held out to it ideals which
   were in part extremely questionable. At the first glance it is a
   paradoxical fact that Jerome is rightly regarded as the doctor ecclesiæ
   Romanæ katexochen, and that we can yet pass him over in a history of
   dogma. The explanation of the paradox is that after he threw off the
   influence of Origen, he was exclusively the speaker and advocate of
   vulgar Catholicism, and that he possessed a just instinct for the
   "ecclesiastical mean" in controversies which were only to reveal their
   whole significance after his time (see the Semipelagian question and
   his relation to Augustinianism.) If that is a compliment to him, it is
   none to his Church. After Augustine's time influences from the East
   were very scanty; yet we have to recall Junilius and Cassiodorus.

   [48] See Augustine's testimony as to Ambrose in the Ballerinis' ed. of
   the latter's works. Contra Jul. I. 4, 10: "Audi excellentem dei
   dispensatorem, quem veneror ut patrem; in Christo Jesu enim per
   evangelium me genuit et eo Christi ministro lavacrum regenerationis
   accepi. Beatum loquor Ambrosium cujus pro Catholica fide gratiam,
   constantiam, labores, pericula sive operibus sive sermonibus et ipse
   sum expertus et mecum non dubitat orbis prædicare Romanus." Op. imperf.
   c. Julian. I., 2: "Quem vero judicem poteris Ambrosio reperire
   meliorem? De quo magister tuus Pelagius ait, quod ejus fidem et
   purissimum in scripturis sensum ne inimicus quidem ausus est
   reprehendere." Pelagius' own words in De gratia Christi et lib. arb. 43
   (47): "Beatus Ambrosius episcopus, in cujus præcipue libris Romana
   elucet fides, qui scriptorum inter Latinos flos quidam speciosus
   enituit, cujus fidem et purissimum in scripturis sensum ne inimicus
   quidem ausus est reprehendere" (see c. Jul. I., 30). The fame of
   Ambrose is also proclaimed by Rufinus, who defends him against Jerome,
   "who, as an envious Augur, censured Ambrose's plagiarisms from the
   Greeks, while he himself was much more culpable since he always posed
   as original."

   [49] See detailed references in Förster, Ambrosius, p. 99 ff.

   [50] See Vol. IV., p. 93.

   [51] See Reuter, August. Studien, pp. 207-227.

   [52] See Ambrose de fid. I. prol et al. loc. in Reuter, 1.c. p. 185; on
   Augustine's neutral position, id. p. 185 f.

   [53] Not a few passages might here he quoted from Ambrose's works. He
   rejects questionable principles held by Origen with tact and without
   judging him a heretic, always himself holding to the common Christian
   element. In a few important questions, the influence of
   Origen--Plato--is unmistakable; as in the doctrine of souls and the
   conception of hell. Greek influence appears to me to be strongest in
   the doctrine of the relative necessity and expediency of evil ("amplius
   nobis profuit culpa quam nocuit"). Therefore, I cannot see in this
   doctrine a bold theory of evil peculiar to Ambrose, like Deutsch (Des
   Ambrosius Lehre von der Sünde, etc., 1867, p. 8) and Förster (l.c. pp.
   136, 142, 300). The teleological view from the standpoint of the fuller
   restoration is alone new perhaps.

   [54] Ambrose, De Isaac et anima.

   [55] On Hilary's exile in the East, epoch-making as it was for the
   history of theology, and his relation to Origen, see Reinken's
   IIilarius, p. 128, 270, 281 ff. Augustine held him in high honour.

   [56] In the interpretation of the New Testament, Ambrose kept more
   faithfully to the letter, following the Western tradition, and
   declining the gifts of the Greeks. He describes Origen (Ep. 75) as
   "Longe minor in novo quam in veteri testamento." But Western Christians
   were first made familiar with the Old Testament by the Greeks.

   [57] Aug. Confess. VIII., 2. See there also the story of his
   conversion.

   [58] If we disregard the fragments which reached the West through
   translations of Origen's works, and plagiarisms from the Cappadocians,
   Neoplatonism, and with it Greek speculation in general, were imparted
   to it in three successive forms:--(1) By Victorinus and Augustine, and
   by Marius Mercator in the fourth and fifth centuries; (2) by Boethius
   in the sixth; (3) by the importation of the works of the
   Pseudo-Areopagite in the ninth century. Cassiodorus praises Boethius
   (Var. epp. 1, 45) for having given the Latins by translations the works
   of Pythagoras, Ptolemy, Nicomachus, Euclid, Plato the theologian,
   Aristotle the logician, Archimedes, and other Greeks. It seems now to
   me proven (Usener, Anecdoton Holderi, 1877) that Boethius was a
   Christian, and that he also wrote the frequently-suspected writings De
   sancta trimitate, Utrum pater et filius et spiritus s. de divinitate
   substantialiter prædicentur, Quomodo substantiæ in eo quod sint bonæ
   sint, cum non sint substantialia bona, De fide Catholica and Contra
   Eutychen et Nestorium. But he has influenced posterity, not by his
   Christian writings, but by his treatise, wholly dependent on Aristotle,
   "De consolatione philosophiæ." which for that very reason could have
   been written by a heathen, and by his commentaries on Aristotle. He was
   really, along with Aristotle, the knowledge of whom was imperfect
   enough, the philosopher of the early Middle Ages. On the system of
   Boethius, see Nitzsch's monograph, 1860. Many of his ideas recall
   Seneca and Proclus; an examination of his relation to Victorious would
   be desirable. "In his system the foundation is formed by Platonism,
   modified by certain Aristotelian thoughts; besides this we have
   unmistakably a Stoic trait, due to the Roman and personal character of
   the philosopher and the reading of Roman thinkers. In this eclecticism
   Christianity occupies as good as no position. For that reason we must
   renounce the attempt to give a place to the system of Boethius among
   those which represent or aim at a harmonising or fusion of Christianity
   with Platonism (e.g., Synesius, Pseudo-Dionysius)"; compare Nitzsch,
   l.c. p. 84 f. The fact that this man, who, in view of death, consoled
   himself with the ideas of heathen philosophers, wrote treatises on the
   central dogma of the Church, affords us the best means of observing
   that the dogma of Christ presented a side on which it led to the
   forgetting of Christ himself.

   [59] It is to the credit of Ch. Gore that he has described, in his
   article "Victorinus" (Dict. of Christ. Biog. IV., pp. 1129-1138), the
   distinctive character of the theology of Victorinus and its importance
   for Augustine. He says rightly: "His theology is Neoplatonist in tone
   . . . he applied many principles of the Plotinian philosophy to the
   elucidation of the Christian mysteries. His importance in this respect
   has been entirely overlooked in the history of theology. He preceded
   the Pseudo-Dionysius. He anticipated a great deal that appears in
   Scotus Erigena." In fact, when we study the works of Victorinus (Migne
   T. VIII., pp. 999-1310), we are astonished to find in him a perfect
   Christian Neoplatonist, and an Augustine before Augustine. The writings
   "Ad Justinum Manichæum," and "De generatione verbi divini, and the
   great work against the Arians, read like compositions by Augustine,
   only the Neoplatonic element makes a much more natural appearance in
   him than in Augustine, who had to make an effort to grasp it. If we
   substitute the word "natura" for "deus" in the speculation of
   Victorinus, we have the complete system of Scotus Erigena. But even
   this exchange is unnecessary; for in Victorinus the terminology of the
   Church only rests like a thin covering on the Neoplatonic doctrine of
   identity. God in himself is "motus"--not mutatio: "moveri ipsum quo est
   esse"; but without the Son he is conceived as ho me o (speculation on
   the four-fold sense of the me einai as in the later mystics). The Son
   is ho on. It appears clearly in the speculation on the relation of
   Father and Son, that consequent--pantheistic--Neoplatonism is
   favourable to the doctrine of the Homoousia. Because the Deity is
   movere, the Father finds himself in a "semper generans generatio." So
   the Son proceeds from him, "re non tempore posterior." The Son is the
   "potentia actuosa"; while the Father begets him, "ipse se ipsum
   conterminavit." The Son is accordingly the eternal object of the divine
   will and the divine self-knowledge; he is the form and limitation of
   God, very essence of the Father; the Father in perceiving the Son
   perceives himself ("alteritas nata"). "In isto sine intellectu
   temporis, tempore . . . est alteritas nata, cito in identitatem
   revenit;" therefore the most perfect unity and absolute
   consubstantiality, although the Son is subordinate. Victorinus first
   designated the Spirit as the copula of the Deity (see Augustine); it is
   he who completes the perfect circle of the Deity; "omnes in alternis
   exsistentes et semper simul homoousioi divina affectione, secundum
   actionem (tantummodo) subsistentiam propriam habentes." This is
   elaborated in speculations which form the themes of Augustine's great
   work "De trinitate." The number three is in the end only apparent;
   "ante unum quod est in numero, plane simplex." "Ipse quod est esse,
   subsistit tripliciter." While anyone who is at all sharp-sighted sees
   clearly from this that the "Son" as "potentia actuosa" is the
   world-idea, that is perfectly evident in what follows. All things are
   potentially in God, actually in the Son; for "filius festinat in
   actionem." The world is distinguished from God, as the many from the
   one, i.e., the world is God unfolding himself and returning to unity
   sub specie æternitatis. That which is alien and God-resisting in the
   world is simply not-being, matter. This is all as given by Proclus, and
   therefore, while the word "cream" is indeed retained, is transformed,
   in fact, into an emanation. The distinction between deus ipse and quæ a
   deo is preserved; but, in reality, the world is looked at under the
   point of view of the Deity developing himself. Ad Justinum 4: "Aliter
   quidem quod ipse est, aliter quæ ab ipso. Quod ipse est unum est
   totumque est quidquid ipse est; quod vero ab ipso est, innumerum est.
   Et hæc sunt quibus refletur omne quod uno toto clauditur et ambitur.
   Verum quod varia sunt quæ ab ipso sunt, qui a se est et unum est,
   variis cum convenit dominare. Et ut omnipotens apparet, contrariorum
   etiam origo ipse debuit inveniri." But it is said of these "varia,"
   that "insubstantiata sunt omnia onta in Jesu, hoc est, en to logo. He
   is the unity of nature, accordingly elementum, receptaculum,
   habitaculum, habitator, locus naturæ. He is the "unum totum" in which
   the universum presents itself as a unity. And now follows the process
   of emanation designated as "creation," in whose description are
   employed the Christian and Neoplatonic stages: deus, Jesus, spiritus,
   nous, anima (as world-soul) angeli et deinde corporalia omnia
   subministrata." Redemption through Christ, and the return ad deum of
   all essences, in so far as they are a deo, is Neoplatonically
   conceived, as also we have then the doctrine of the pre-existence of
   souls and their pre-temporal fall. The Incarnation is admitted, but
   spiritualised, inasmuch as side by side with the conception of the
   assumption of a human form, which occurs once, the other prevails that
   Christ appears as burdened with humanity in its totality; "universalis
   caro, universalis anima; in isto omnia universalia erant" (Adv. Arian.
   III., 3). "Quia corpus ille catholicum ad omnem hominem habuit, omne
   quod passus est catholicum fecit; id est ut omnis caro in ipso
   crucifixa sit" (Ad Philipp, pp. 1196-1221; Adv. Arian. III., 3). But
   the most interesting features, because the most important for Augustine
   are (1), that Victorinus gives strong expression to the doctrine of
   Predestination--only he feels compelled in opposition to Manichæism to
   maintain the freedom of the will; and (2), that, especially in his
   commentaries, he places the highest value on justification by faith
   alone in opposition to all moralism. Neoplatonism had won his assent,
   or had prepared him in some measure to assent, to both these doctrines;
   we know, indeed, from other sources, that heathen Neoplatonists felt
   attracted to John and Paul, but not to the Synoptics or James. Thus
   Victorinus writes: "non omnia restaurantur sed quæ in Christo sunt" (p.
   1245), "quæ salvari possent" (p. 1274), "universos sed qui sequerentur"
   (p. 1221). In a mystical way Christ is believing humanity (the Church),
   and believing humanity is humanity in general. Everything undergoes a
   strictly necessary development; therefore Victorious was a
   predestinationist. The passages in which Victorinus expresses himself
   in a strictly Pauline, and, so to speak, Antipelagian sense, are
   collected by Gore, p. 1137; see Ad Gal. 3, 22; Ad Philipp, 3, 9; "non
   meam justitiam' tunc enim mea est vel nostra, cum moribus nostris
   justitiam dei mereri nos putamus perfectam per mores. At non, inquit,
   hanc habens justitiam, sed quam? Illam ex fide. Non illam quæ ex lege;
   væ in operibus est et carnali disciplina, sed hanc quæ ex deo procedit
   justitia ex fide;'" Ad Phil. 4, 9; Ad Ephes. 2, 5: "non nostri laboris
   est, quod sæpe moneo, ut nos salvemus; sed sola fides in Christum nobis
   salus est . . . nostrum pene jam nihil est nisi solum credere qui
   superavit omnia. Hoc est enim plena salvatio, Christum hæc vicisse.
   Fidem in Christo habere, plenam fidem, nullus labor est, nulla
   difficultas, animi tantum voluntas est . . . justitia non tantum valet
   quantum fides"; Ad Ephes. 1, 14; 3, 7; Ad Phil. 2, 13: "quia ipsum
   velle a deo nobis operatur, fit ut ex deo et operationem et voluntatem
   habeamus." Victorinus has been discussed most recently by Geiger
   (Programme von Metten, 1888, 1889), and Reinhold Schmid (Marius
   Victorinus Rhetor u. s. Bez. z. Augustin. Kiel, 1895)--compare also the
   dissertation by Koffmane, De Mario Victorino, philosopho Christiano,
   Breslau, 18So. Geiger has thoroughly expounded the complete Neoplatonic
   system of Victorious; Schmid seeks, after an excellent statement of his
   theological views, to show (p. 68 ff.), that he exerted no, or, at
   least, no decisive influence on Augustine. I cannot see that this proof
   has really been successful; yet I admit that Schmid has brought forward
   weighty arguments in support of his proposition. The name of Victorinus
   is not the important point for the history of dogma, but the
   indisputable fact that the combination of Neoplatonism and highly
   orthodox Christianity existed in the West, in Rome, before Augustine,
   under the badge of Paulinism. Since this combination was hardly of
   frequent occurrence in the fourth century, and since Augustine gives a
   prominent place to Victorinus in his Confessions, it will remain
   probable that he was influenced by him. The facts that he was less
   Neoplatonic than Victorine, and afterwards even opposed him, do not
   weigh against the above contention. But it is positively misleading to
   argue like Schmid (p. 68) against Augustine's Neoplatonism by appealing
   to the fact that from the moment of his rejection of Manichæism and
   semi-scepticism, he was a "decided Christian."

   [60] Little is yet known regarding the history of ecclesiastical
   penance in the East; but I believe I can maintain that in the West the
   shock was less violent in its effect, which all official Church
   discipline received through the rapid extension of Christianity after
   Constantine. Here confidence in the Church was greater, the union of
   "sancta ecclesia" and "remissio peccatorum" closer ("credo remissionem
   peccatorum per sanctam ecclesiam": Symbol. Carthag. ), and the sense of
   sin as guilt, which was to be atoned for by public confession and
   satisfactio, more acute. Whence this came, it is hard to say. In the
   East it would appear that greater stress was laid on the operations of
   the cultus as a collective institution, and on the other hand on
   private self-education through prayer and asceticism; while in the West
   the feeling was stronger that men occupied religious legal
   relationships, in which they were responsible to the Church, being
   able, however, to expect from the Church sacramental and intercessory
   aid in each individual case. The individual and the Church thus stood
   nearer each other in the West than in the East. Therefore,
   ecclesiastical penance asserted a much greater importance in the former
   than in the latter. We can study this significance in the works of the
   Africans on the one hand, and of Ambrose on the other. They have little
   else in common, but they agree in their view of penance (Ambrose, De
   pænitentia). The practice of penance now acquired an increasing
   influence in the West on all conditions of the ecclesiastical
   constitution and of theology, so that we can ultimately construct from
   this starting-point the whole of Western Catholicism in the Middle Ages
   and modern times, and can trace the subtle workings of the theory of
   penance to the most remote dogmas. But Augustine once more marks the
   decisive impetus in this development. With him began the process by
   which what had long existed in the Church was elevated into theory. He
   indeed created few formulas, and has not even once spoken of a
   sacrament of penance; but, on the one hand, he has clearly enough
   expressed the thing itself, and, on the other, where he has not yet
   drawn the theoretical consequences of the practice of penance, he has
   left such striking gaps (see his Christology) that they were filled up
   by unostentatious efforts, as if inevitably, in after times.

   [64] From Pacian's Ep. I. ad Sempron. comes the famous sentence:
   "Christianus mihi nomen est, catholicus cognomen." In the tractate of
   Ambrosiaster against Novatian, the objectivity of the Divine Word and
   of baptism, and their independence in their operation of the moral
   character of the priest, are consistently argued. In some of the
   sentences we imagine that we are listening to Augustine. On the whole,
   there is not a little in Ambrosiaster's commentary and questions which
   must be described as leading up to Augustine, and is therewith
   genuinely Western.

   [67] See Vol. II., p. 114 ff.

   [68] Here these Africans abandoned the position, in the question of
   heretical baptisms, taken up by Cyprian; see the 8th Canon of Arles
   (A.D. 316): "De Afris quod propria lege sua utuntur, ut rebaptizent,
   placuit, ut si ad ecclesiam aliquis de hæresi venerit, interrogent eum
   symbolum; et si perviderint eum in patre et filio et spiritu sancto
   esse baptizatum, manus ei tantum imponatur ut accipiat spiritum
   sanctum. Quod si interrogatus non responderit hanc trinitatem,
   baptizetur." Can. 13: "De his, qui scripturas s. tradidisse dicuntur
   vel vasa dominica vel nomina patrum suorum, placuit nobis, ut quicumque
   eorum ex actis publicis fuerit detectus, non verbis nudis, ab ordine
   cleri amoveatur. Nam si iidem aliquos ordinasse fuerint deprehensi et
   hi quos ordinaverunt rationales (able? capable?) subsistunt, non illis
   obsit ordinatio" (that is the decisive principle; even ordination by a
   traditor was to be valid).

   [69] Crises, similar to that of the Donatists, also arose elsewhere--as
   in Rome and Alexandria--at the beginning of the fourth century; but our
   information regarding them is wholly unsatisfactory; see Lipsius,
   Chronologie der römischen Bischöfe, p. 250 ff., where the epitaphs by
   Damasus on Marcellus and Eusebius are copied, and rightly compared with
   the passage in the Liber praedest., c. 16 on Heracleon (who is really
   Heraclius). Heraclius appears already (A.D. 307-309) to have
   exaggerated the view of the "objectivity" and power of the sacraments
   to such an extent as to declare all sins by baptised persons to be
   "venial," and to hold a severe public penance to be unnecessary.
   Therefore it was said of him, "Christus in pace negavit" and "vetuit
   lapsos peccata dolere"; more precisely in Lib. prædest.: "Baptizatum
   hominem sive justum sive peccatorem loco sancti computari docebat
   nihilque obesse baptizatis peccata memorabat, dicens, sicut non in se
   recipit natura ignis gelu ita baptizatus non in se recipit peccatum.
   Sicut enim ignis resolvit aspectu suo nives quantæcunque juxta sint,
   sic semel baptizatus non recipit peccatorum reatum, etiam quantavis
   fuerint operibus ejus peccata permixta." In this we can truly study the
   continuity of Western Christianity! How often this thought has cropped
   up on into the nineteenth century, and that precisely among
   evangelicals! It marks positively the "concealed poison," which it is
   hard to distinguish from the wholesome medicine of evangelic comfort.
   But it is very noteworthy that this phase in the conception of the
   favoured position of the baptised can he first proved as existing in
   Rome. Developments always went furthest there, as the measures taken by
   Calixtus also show. Yet this one was rejected, after a schism had
   broken out in the community, and that is perfectly intelligible; for
   apart from the ruinous frivolity which had come in with the above view,
   what importance could the priestly class retain if every baptised
   person might, without further ceremony, and if he only willed it, feel
   and assert himself to be a member of the congregation even after the
   gravest sin? It is not very probable that Heraclius developed his
   ecclesiastical attitude on the basis of the Pauline theory of baptism
   and of the faith that lays hold of Christ. If we were to understand the
   matter so, he would have been a Luther before Luther. We have probably
   to suppose that he saw in baptism the magical bestowal of a stamp, as
   in the conception taken of certain heathen mysteries. In the Meletian
   schism in Egypt, the difference in principles as to the renewed
   reception of the lapsed, co-operated with opposition to the monarchial
   position of the Alexandrian Bishop. The dispute, which thus recalls the
   Donatist controversy, soon became one of Church politics, and personal.
   (Compare Meletius and the later Donatists; the limitation of the whole
   question to the Bishops is, however, peculiar to the Donatists.) See
   Walch, Ketzerhistorie, Vol. IV., and Möller in Herzog's R.-E. IX., p.
   534 ff.

   [70] Parmenian denied this distinction.

   [71] "Catholicam (scil. ecclesiam) facit simplex et verus intellectus
   in lege (scil. duobus testamentis) singulare ac verissimum sacramentum
   et unitas animorum."

   [72] Cyprian would never have admitted that. He accused the Novatians
   (Ep. 68) of infringing the Symbol like other heretics, by depriving the
   "remissio peccatorum" of its full authority; and he commanded all who
   had not been baptised in the Catholic Church to be re-baptised. Cyprian
   had on his side the logical consequence of the Catholic dogma of the
   Church; but since this consequence was hurtful to the expansion of the
   Church, and the development of its power, it was rejected with a
   correct instinct in Rome (see Ambrosiaster), and afterwards in Africa.

   [73] Compare l.c.: "Ecclesiam tu, frater Parmeniane, apud vos solos
   esse dixisti; nisi forte quia vobis specialem sanctitatem de superbia
   vindicare contenditis, ut, ubi vultis, ibi sit ecclesia, et non sit,
   ubi non vultis. Ergo ut in particula Africæ, in angulo parvæ regionis,
   apud vos esse possit, apud nos in alia parte Africa non erit?"

   [74] In connection with the territorial catholicity of the Church,
   Optatus always treats the assertion of its unity. Here he is dependent
   on Cyprian; see besides the details in Book 2 those in Book 7: "Ex
   persona beatissimi Petri forma unitatis retinendæ vel faciendæ
   descripta recitatur;" ch. 3 "Malum est contra interdictum aliquid
   facere; sed pejus est, unitatem non habere, cum possis . . . " "Bono
   unitatis sepelienda esse peccata hinc intellegi datur, quod b. Paulus
   apostolus dicat, caritatem posse obstruere multitudinem peccatorum"
   (here, accordingly, is the identification of unitas and caritas). . . .
   "Hæc omnia Paulus viderat in apostolis ceteris, qui bono unitas per
   caritatem noluerunt a communione Petri recedere, ejus scil. qui
   negaverat Christum. Quod si major esset amor innocentiæ quam utilitas
   pacis unitatis, dicerent se non debere communicare Petro, qui negaverat
   magistrum." That is still a dangerous fundamental thought of
   Catholicism at the present day.

   [75] Notice that there already occur in Optatus terms compounded with
   "quasi" which were so significant in the later dogmatics of
   Catholicism.

   [76] Here stands the following sentence (V., 7): "Ne quis putaret, in
   solis apostolis aut episcopis spem suam esse ponendam, sic Paulus ait:
   Quid est enim Paulus vel quid Apollo? Utique ministri ejus, in quem
   credidistis. Est ergo in universis servientibus non dominium sed
   ministerium."

   [77] At this point there occur especially in V., 7, 8, very important
   expositions anticipating Augustine. "Ad gratiam dei pertinet qui
   credit, non ille, pro cujus voluntate, ut dicitis, sanctitas vestra
   succedit."--"Nomen trinitatis est, quod sanctificat, non opus
   (operantis)."--"Restat jam de credentis merito aliquid dicere, cujus
   est fides, quam filius dei et sanctitati suæ anteposuit et majestati;
   non enim potestis sanctiores esse, quam Christus est." Here follows the
   story of the Canaanitish woman, with the remarkable application: "Et ut
   ostenderet filius dei, se vacasse, fidem tantummodo operatam esse:
   vade, inquit, mulier in pace, fides tua te salvavit." So also faith is
   extolled as having been the sole agent in the stories of the Centurion
   of Capernaum and the Issue of Blood. "Nec mulier petiit, nec Christus
   promisit, sed fides tantum quantum præsumpsit, exegit." The same
   thoughts occur in Optatus' contemporary, Ambrosiaster.

   [78] This it was in the case of Ambrosiaster as well as in that of
   Optatus.

   [79] The Donatist had said (II., 7): "Nam in illa (catholica) ecclesia
   quis spiritus esse potest, nisi qui pariat filios gehennæ?" That is the
   genuine confession of separatists.

   [80] We may here select a few details from the work of Optatus as
   characteristic of Western Christianity before Augustine. He regularly
   gives the name of "lex" to both the Testaments; he judges all dogmatic
   statements by the symbolum apostolicum, in which he finds the doctrine
   of the Trinity, to him the chief confession, without therefore
   mentioning the Nicene Creed; he confesses "per carnem Christi deo
   reconciliatus est mundus" (I., 10); he declares (VI., 1): "quid est
   altare, nisi sedes et corporis et sanguinis Christi, cujus illic per
   certa momenta corpus et sanguis habitabat?" He speaks of the reatus
   peccati and meritum fidei; he has definitely stated the distinction
   between præcepta and consilia (VI., 4) in his explanation of the
   parable of the Good Samaritan. The innkeeper is Paul, the two pence are
   the two Testaments, the additional sum still perhaps necessary are the
   consilia. He describes the position of the soteriological dogma in his
   time by the following exposition (II., 20):--"Est Christiani hominis,
   quod bonum est velle et in eo quod bene voluerit, currere; sed homini
   non est datum perficere, ut post spatia, quæ debet homo implere, restet
   aliquid deo, ubi deficienti succurrat, quia ipse solus est perfectio et
   perfectus solus dei filius Christus, cæteri omnes semi-perfecti sumus."
   Here we perceive the great task that awaited Augustine. But even as
   regards Church politics Optatus betrays himself as an Epigone of the
   Constantinian era, and as a precursor of the Augustinian. See his
   thesis on the disloyalty of the Donatists to the State (III., 3): "Non
   respublica est in ecclesia, sed ecclesia in republica est, id est in
   imperio Romano."

   [81] In the West, before Augustine, the conception of gratia exhausted
   itself in that of the remissio peccatorum. We can see this in
   propositions like the following from Pacian, sermo de bapt. 3:--"Quid
   est gratia? peccati remissio, i.e., donum; gratia enim donum est."

   [82] In this respect Ambrose takes an isolated position; thus it is,
   e.g., characteristic that he does not seem to have read Cyprian's
   works.

   [83] I express myself thus intentionally; for Ambrose never, in words,
   thrust the actual, hierarchical Church into the foreground.

   [84] See proofs by Förster, l.c., p. 218 ff.

   [85] See at an earlier (late the Instructiones of Commodian. Ambrose
   was not such an advocate of Monachism as Jerome.

   [86] See above, p. 31.

   [87] See Ewald, Der Einfluss der stoisch-ciceronianischen Moral auf die
   Darstellung der Ethik bei Ambrosius, 1881. "De officiis," with all its
   apparent consistency, shows merely a considerable vacillation between
   virtue as the supreme good (in the Stoic sense) and eternal life--which
   latter term, for the rest, is not understood in its Christian meaning.
   The moralism of antiquity, as well as the eudaimonist trait of ancient
   moral philosophy dominate the book, in which ultimately the "true wise
   man" appears most clearly. In such circumstances the distinction drawn
   between præcepta and consilia, in itself so dangerous to evangelical
   morality, constitutes an advantage; for specifically Christian virtues
   appear in the form of the consilia.

   [88] Hilary also speaks of the vitium originis.

   [89] See Deutsch, Des Ambrosius Lehre von der Sünde and Sündentilgung,
   1867. Förster,1.c., p. 146 ff. All human beings are sinners, even Mary.
   The "hæreditarium vinculum" of sin embraces all. "Fuit Adam, et in illo
   fuimus omnes; periit Adam, et in illo omnes perierunt." It is not only
   an inherited infirmity that is meant, but a guilt that continues
   active. "Quicunque natus est sub peccato, quem ipsa nosciæ conditionis
   hæreditas adstrinxit ad culpam." No doctrine of imputation, indeed, yet
   occurs in Ambrose; for as he conceived it, mankind in Adam was a unity,
   in which took place a peccatrix successio, a continuous evolution of
   Adam's sin. Accordingly no imputation was necessary. Ambrosiaster (on
   Rom. V., 12) has also expressed Ambrose's thought: "Manifestum itaque
   est, in Adam omnes peccasse quasi in massa; ipse enim per peccatum
   corruptus, quos genuit, omnes, nati sunt sub peccato. Ex eo igitur
   cuncti peccatores, quia ex eo ipso sumus omnes." In the West this
   thought was traditional after Tertullian. See Cyprian, Ep. 64, 5; De
   opere 1, and Commodian, Instruct. I., 35.

   [90] "Intret in animam tuam Christus, inhabitet in mentibus tuis
   Jesus. . . . Quid mihi prodest tantorum conscio peccatorum, si dominus
   veniat, nisi veniat in meam animam, redeat in meam mentem, nisi vivat
   in me Christus." In Ps. CXIX., exp. IV., 26: in Luc. enarr., X., 7; in
   Ps. XXXVI., exp. 63. The passages are collected by Förster (see esp. De
   poenit., II., 8). See also Vol. III., p. 130. For the rest, the author
   of the Quæstiones ex Vet. et. Nov. Testam. (Ambrosiaster) could also
   speak in tones whose pathetic individualism recalls Augustine; cf.
   e.g., the conclusion of the inserted tractate c. Novat.: "ego . . . te
   (scil. deum) quæsivi, te desideravi, tibi credidi; de homine nihil
   speravi . . . ego verbis antistitis fidem dedi, quæ a te data dicuntur,
   quæque te inspirant, te loquuntur, de te promittunt; huic de se nihil
   credidi nec gestis ejus, sed fidei quæ ex te est, me copulavi."

   [91] On Ps. CXIX., exp. XX., 14: "Nemo sibi arroget, nemo de meritis,
   nemo de potestate se jactet, sed omnes speremus per dominum Jesum
   misericordiam invenire--quæ enim spes alia peccatoribus?"

   [92] The interrogation mark in Reuter, August. Studien, p. 493, is due
   to exaggerated caution. The antithesis of nature and grace, which,
   wherever it occurs, has one of its roots in Paulinism, and was already
   familiar to Tertullian, is anew proclaimed in Ambrose; see De off. I.,
   7, 24; see also the address on the death of his brother. Ambrosiaster,
   too, makes use of the natura-gratia antithesis.

   [95] A detailed account would here require to discuss many other
   Western writers, e.g., Prudentius (see monographs by Brockhaus, 1872,
   and Rosier, 1886), Pacian, Zeno, Paulinus of Nola, etc.; but what we
   have given may serve to define the directions in which Western
   Christianity moved. As regards Hilary, Förster has shown very recently
   (Stud. u. Krit., 1888, p. 645 ff.) that even he, in spite of his
   dependence on the Greeks, did not belie the practical ethical interest
   of the Westerns.

   [96] The East knew nothing of this excessive analysis; it took a man
   more as a whole, and judged him by the regular course taken by his
   will.

   [97] I have already discussed this briefly in Vol. III., p. 33 ff.
   Augustine (Confess. VII., 19) believed, up to the time of his
   conversion, that the doctrine of Christ held by the Catholic Church was
   almost identical with that of Photinus; his friend Alypius thought, on
   the contrary, that the Church denied Christ a human soul. We see from
   Hilary's work, De trinitate, how many Christological conceptions
   circulated in the Western communities, among them even "quod in eo ex
   virgine creando efficax Dei sapientia et virtus exstiterit, et in
   nativitate ejus divinæ prudentiæ et potestatis opus intellegatur,
   sitque in eo efficientia potius quam natura sapientiæ." Optatus (I., 8)
   had to blame Parmenian for calling the body of Christ sinful, and
   maintaining that it was purified by his baptism. Further, in spite of
   the doctrine of "two natures," and the acceptance of Greek
   speculations, the thought of Hippolytus (Philos. X., 33): ei gar ho
   theos theon se ethelese poiesai, edunato; echeis tou logou to
   paradeigma, runs like a concealed thread through the Christological
   utterances of the West. We shall see that even in Ambrose and Augustine
   there is to be found a hidden, but intentionally retained, remnant of
   the old Adoptian conception. (How this is to be regarded, see above
   under 2). We may here pass over the influence of Manichæan Christology
   on many secondary minds in the Western Churches.

   Jesus Christ there comes to the front the "individual" man, who,
   without previous merit, was of grace received into the Deity.

   [107] Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine and Siricius give us information
   regarding him.

   [108] I have demonstrated this in the Ztschr. f. Theol. u. Kirche I.
   (1891), pp. 82-178, and cannot repeat the proof here. From the I. Ep.
   of John onwards undercurrents can be traced in the Gentile Church which
   required to have the saying addressed to them: "Be not deceived, he who
   does righteousness is righteous." My main references are to the
   erroneous views opposed in the Catholic Epistles; the lax Christians
   mentioned by Tertullian; the edict on penance of Calixtus, with its
   noteworthy evangelical basis (see also Rolffs in the Texten u. Unters,
   Vol. XI., part 3); Heraclius in Rome; the counter-efforts of the lax
   against the monachism which was establishing itself in the West;
   Jovinian; and to the opponents assailed by Augustine in his very
   important writing, "De fide et operibus." This writing is, along with
   Jovinian's discussions, the most important source. There can be no
   doubt that in the majority of cases an unbridled and accommodating
   trust in the sacrament--accordingly a strained form of the popular
   Catholic feeling--was the leading idea, and that the reference to
   Gospel texts, which bore witness to the unlimited mercy of God, was
   only a drapery; that accordingly the "sola fide"--the catchword
   occurs--was not conceived evangelically, but really meant "solo
   sacramento"--i e., even if the life did not correspond to the Christian
   demand for holiness. But there were Christian teachers who had really
   grasped the evangelical thesis, and Jovinian is to be counted one of
   them, even if his opponents be right (and I am doubtful of this) in
   taking offence at his conduct; and even if it be certain that his
   doctrine, in the circumstances of the time, could and did promote
   laxity. His main positions were as follows:--1. The natural man is in
   the state of sin. Even the slightest sin separates from God and exposes
   to damnation. 2. The state of the Christian rests on baptism and faith;
   these produce regeneration. 3. Regeneration is the state in which
   Christ is in us, and we are in Christ; there are no degrees in it, for
   this personal relationship either does or does not exist. Where it
   does, there is righteousness. 4. It is a relation formed by love that
   is in question: Father and Son dwell in believers; but where there is
   such an indweller, the possessor can want for nothing. 5. Accordingly
   all blessings are bestowed with and in this relationship; nothing can
   be thought of as capable of being added. 6. Since all blessings issue
   from this relationship, there can be no special meritorious works; for
   at bottom there is only one good, and that we possess as the best
   beloved children of God, who now participate in the divine nature, and
   that good will be fully revealed in Heaven. 7. In him who occupies this
   relationship of faith and love there is nothing to be condemned; he can
   commit no sin which would separate him from God; the devil cannot make
   him fall, for he ever recovers himself as a child of God by faith and
   penitence. The relationship fixed in baptism through faith is something
   lasting and indissoluble. 8. But such an one must not only be baptised;
   he must have received baptism with perfect faith, and by faith evince
   baptismal grace. He must labour and wrestle earnestly--though not in
   monkish efforts, for they are valueless--not in order to deserve
   something further, but that he may not lose what he has received. To
   him, too, the truth applies that there are no small and great sins, but
   that the heart is either with God or the devil. 9. Those who are
   baptised in Christ, and cling to Him with confident faith, form the
   one, true Church. To her belong all the glorious promises: she is
   bride, sister, mother, and is never without her bridegroom. She lives
   in one faith, and is never violated or divided, but is a pure virgin.
   We may call Jovinian actually a "witness of antiquity to the truth,"
   and a "Protestant of his time," though we must not mistake a point of
   difference: the indwelling of God and Christ in the baptised is more
   strongly emphasised than the power of faith. The Spaniard, Vigilantius,
   even surpassed Jovinian, both in range and intensity, in the energy
   with which he attacked the excrescences of monkery, relic-worship,
   virginity, etc.; but he does not belong to this section, for he was
   moved by the impression made upon him by the superstition and idolatry
   which he saw rising to supremacy in the Church. Jerome's writing
   against him is miserable, but is surpassed in meanness by the same
   author's books against Jovinian.

   [109] The puzzling phenomenon of Priscillianism has not been made much
   clearer by the discovery of Priscillian's homilies. I believe we may
   pass them over, since, important as were the points touched on in the
   Priscillian controversy (even the question as to the claims of the
   "Apocrypha" compared with the Bible), they neither evoked a dogmatic
   controversy, nor obtained a more general significance. The meritorious
   work by Paret, Priscillianus, ein Reformator des 4 Jahrh. (Würzburg,
   1891) is not convincing in its leading thoughts (see on the other side
   Hilgenfeld in his Zeitschr. Vol. 35, 1892, pp. 1-85).

CHAPTER III.

  THE HISTORICAL POSITION OF AUGUSTINE AS REFORMER OF CHRISTIAN PIETY. [110]

   "Virtues will so increase and be perfected as to conduct thee without
   any hesitation to the truly blessed life which only is eternal: where
   evils, which will not exist, are not discriminated from blessings by
   prudence, nor adversity is borne bravely, because there we shall find
   only what we love, not also what we tolerate, nor lust is bridled by
   temperance, where we shall not feel its incitements, nor the needy are
   aided justly, where we will have no need and nothing unworthy. There
   virtue will be one, and virtue and the reward of virtue will be that
   spoken of in sacred phrase by the man who loves it: "But to me to cling
   to God is a good thing." This virtue will be there the full and eternal
   wisdom, and it will also truly be the life that is blessed. Surely this
   is to attain to the eternal and supreme blessing, to which to cling for
   ever is the end of our goodness. Let this (virtue) be called prudence,
   because it will cling to the good too eagerly for it to be lost, and
   fortitude, because it will cling to the good too firmly for it to be
   torn away, and temperance, because it will cling to the good too
   chastely to be corrupted, and justice, because it will cling to the
   good too justly to be inferior in any merit. Although even in this life
   the only virtue is to love what ought to be loved. But what should we
   choose chiefly to love except that than which we find nothing better?
   This is God, and if we prefer anything or esteem anything equal to love
   to him we fail to love ourselves. For it is the better for us, the more
   we enter into him, than whom there is nothing better. But we move not
   by walking, but by loving. We may not go (to him) afoot, but with our
   character. But our character is wont to be judged, not from what anyone
   knows, but from what he loves. Nothing makes character good or bad but
   good or bad affections. Therefore, by our corruption, we have been far
   from the righteousness of God. Whence we are corrected by loving the
   right, that being just we may be able to cling to the right." [111]

   Augustine reveals his soul in these words; they therefore also mark his
   importance in the history of dogma. If, as we have attempted in the
   preceding chapter, we pursue and let converge the different lines along
   which Western Christianity developed in the fourth and fifth centuries,
   we can construct a system which approximates to "Augustinianism";
   indeed we can even deduce the latter, as a necessary product, from the
   internal and external conditions in which the Church and theology then
   found themselves. But we cannot, for all that, match the man who was
   behind the system and lent it vigour and life. Similarly we can
   attempt--and it is a remunerative task--to make Augustine's Christian
   conception of the world intelligible from the course of his education,
   and to show how no stage in his career failed to influence him. His
   pagan father, and pious, Christian mother, Cicero's Hortensius,
   Manichæism, Aristotelianism, Neoplatonism, with its mysticism and
   scepticism, the impression produced by Ambrose and monachism--all
   contributed their share. [112] But even from this stand-point we cannot
   finally do complete justice to the distinctive character of this man.
   That is his secret and his greatness, and perhaps all or any analysis
   itself is an injury: he knew his heart to be his worst possession, and
   the living God to be his highest good; he lived in the love of God, and
   he possessed a fascinating power of expressing his observations on the
   inner life. In doing this, he taught the world that the highest and
   sweetest enjoyment was to be sought in the feeling that springs from a
   soul that has triumphed over its pain, from the love of God as the
   fountain of good, and therefore from the certainty of grace.
   Theologians before him had taught that man must be changed in order to
   be blessed; he taught that man could be a new being if he let God find
   him, and if he found himself and God, from the midst of his distraction
   and dissipation.

   He destroyed the delusion of ancient popular psychology and morality;
   he gave the final blow to the intellectualism of antiquity; but he
   resuscitated it in the pious thought of the man who found true being
   and the supreme good in the living God. He was the first to separate
   nature and grace, two spheres which men had long attempted
   unsuccessfully to divide; but by this means he connected religion and
   morality, and gave a new meaning to the idea of the good. He was the
   first to mark off the scope and force of the heart and will, and to
   deduce from this what moralists and religious philosophers imagined
   they had understood, but never had understood; he set up a fixed goal
   for the aimless striving of asceticism: perfection in the love of God,
   suppression of selfish ambition, humility. He taught men to realise the
   horror of the depth of sin and guilt which he disclosed, at the same
   time with the blessed feeling of an ever-comforted misery, and a
   perennial grace. He first perfected Christian pessimism, whose
   upholders till then had really reserved for themselves an extremely
   optimistic view of human nature. But while showing that radical evil
   was the mainspring of all human action, he preached also the
   regeneration of the will, by which man adapted himself to the blessed
   life. He did not bridge for feeling and thought the gulf which
   Christian tradition disclosed between this world and the next; but he
   testified so thrillingly to the blessedness of the man who had found
   rest in God, that nothing was reserved for the future life but an
   indescribable "vision." But above all and in all, he exhibited to every
   soul its glory and its responsibility: God and the soul, the soul and
   its God. He took religion--a transfigured and moulded monachism,
   dominated by positive conceptions and trust in Christ--out of its
   congregational and ritualistic form, and set it in the hearts of
   individuals as a gift and a task. He preached the sincere humility
   which blossoms only on ruins--the ruins of self-righteousness; but he
   recognised in this very humility the charter of the soul, and even
   where he assigned an imperious power to the authority of the Church, he
   only did so in the end in order to give the individual soul an
   assurance which it could not attain by any exertion, or any individual
   act of pardon. Therefore, he became not only a pedagogue and teacher,
   but a Father of the Church. He was a tree, planted by the waters, whose
   leaves do not fade, and on whose branches the birds of the air dwell.
   His voice has pealed forth to the Church through the centuries, and he
   preached to Christendom the words "Blessed is the man whose strength
   Thou art; in whose heart are Thy ways."
     __________________________________________________________________

   We do not require to prove that, for a man with such a personality, all
   that tradition offered him could only serve as material and means, that
   he only accepted it in order to work it into the shape that suited him.
   In this respect Augustine was akin to the great Alexandrians, and
   plenty of evidence can be adduced in support of this affinity, which
   was conditioned on both sides by the same loftiness of soul, as well as
   by dependence on Neoplatonic philosophy. But in spite of all they
   possessed in common, the distinction between them was extremely
   significant. It did not consist merely in the fact that while the
   former lived about A.D. 200, Augustine was a member of the Theodosian
   imperial Church, nor that he had passed through Manichæism, but it was
   due in a much greater degree to his having, in spite of his
   Neoplatonism, a different conception of the nature of the Christian
   religion, and also other ideas about the nature and authority of the
   Church.

   I. He thought of sin, when he reflected on God and Christ, and he
   thought of the living God, who has created and redeemed us, when he
   reflected on evil: the steadfastness with which he referred these
   factors to each other was the novel feature which distinguished him
   above all his predecessors. But not less novel was the energy with
   which he combined the categories God, Christ, the word of God, the
   sacraments, and the Catholic Church for practical piety, compressing
   what was fullest of life and freest, the possession of God, into, as it
   were, an objective property, which was transferred to an institution,
   the Church. As he accordingly begot the feeling that Christian piety
   was grief of soul comforted, so, on the other hand, he created that
   inter-weaving, characteristic of Western Catholicism, of the freest,
   most personal surrender to the divine, with constant submission to the
   Church as an institution in possession of the means of grace.

   According to this he is, in the first place, to be estimated, even for
   the history of dogma, not as a theologian, but as a reformer of
   Christian piety. The characteristic feature of the old Christian piety
   was its vacillation between hope and fear (Tertull., De uxor. II., 2:
   "Fear is the foundation of salvation, confidence is the barrier against
   fear": timor fundamentum salutis est, præsumptio impedimentum timoris).
   [113] It was known that Jesus accepted sinners; but in that case men
   were accepted through baptism. The action of God was, as it were,
   exhausted. [114] The whole Dogmatic (Trinity, Christology, etc.) had
   its practical culmination, and therewith its end, in the merely
   retrospective blessing received in baptism. What next? Men feared the
   judge, and hoped in an uncertain fashion for a still existent grace.
   The fear of the judge led to fasting, almsgiving, and prayer, and the
   uncertain hope groped after new means of grace. Men wavered between
   reliance on their own powers and hope in the inexhaustibility of
   Christ's grace. But did they not possess faith? They did, and prized it
   as a lofty possession; but they valued it as a condition, as an
   indispensable card of admission. In order actually to enter, there were
   other and wholly different conditions to be fulfilled. Piety, when it
   concerned itself with the task of the present, did not live in faith.
   The psychological form of piety was unrest, i.e., fear and hope. [115]
   Reliance was placed on free-will; but what was to be done if it led to
   one defeat after another? Repentance and amendment were required. No
   doubt was felt that repentance was sufficient wherever sins "against
   our neighbour" were in question, and where the injury could be made
   good. Repentance and compensation had the widest possible scope in
   relation to sin. Sin consisted in evil action; the good action united
   with repentance balanced it. One's neighbour could forgive the offence
   committed against him, and the sin no longer existed; the Church could
   forgive what affected its constitution, and guilt was effaced.

   But he who was baptised sinned also "against God." However widely the
   Church might extend the circle of sins in which she was the injured
   party, the judge, and the possessor of the right to pardon, there were
   sins against God, and there were transgressions which could not be made
   good. Who could cancel murder and adultery, or a misspent life on the
   part of the baptised? Perhaps even these sins were not in such evil
   case; perhaps God did not impute them to the baptised at all--though
   that would be an Epicurean error; perhaps the power of the Church did
   not break on the rock of accomplished facts; perhaps there were other
   means of grace besides baptism. But who could know this? The Church
   created a kind of sacrament of penance in the third and fourth
   centuries; but it did not say clearly what was to be expected of this
   sacrament. Did it reconcile with the Church or with God; did it do away
   with sin, guilt, or punishment; was it effective through the penances
   of the penitent, or through the power of grace? [116] Was it necessary?
   Was there in that case a sinful state, one that lasted, when the
   disposition had changed, when the will strove with all its powers after
   the good? Was there such a thing as guilt? Was not everything which man
   could do in accordance with his nature involved in the eternal
   alternation marked by good and evil actions, by knowledge, repentance,
   and striving? Knowledge and action decide. The man of to-day, who does
   the good, has no longer anything in common with the man of yesterday
   who did evil. But sins against God persisted in troubling them. Whence
   came fear, lasting fear? The Church threw its doors wider and wider; it
   forgave sin, all sin; but the earnest fled into the desert. There they
   tried to succeed by precisely the same means they had used in the
   world, and their mood remained the same--one of hope and fear. There
   was no consolation which was not confronted by a three-fold horror.

   That was the temper of the ancient Christians from the day when we can
   first observe them in the wide framework of the Roman Empire until the
   epoch with whose dawn we are here concerned. The "evangelical" ideas
   which are sometimes formed of the nature of their piety are not at all
   appropriate. The two most restless elements which can agitate a human
   breast, hope and fear, ruled over those Christians. These elements
   shattered the world and built the Church. Men, indeed, had a faith, and
   created a dogmatic for themselves; but these were insufficient to
   satisfy them regarding their daily life, or any life. They gave wings
   to hope, but they did not eradicate fear. They did not tell what the
   sins were with which the Christian daily fights, and what Christ had
   done for these sins. They left those questions to the individual
   conscience, and the answers given in ecclesiastical practice were not
   answers to soothe the heart. The only sure issue of the whole system of
   dogmatics was in the benefits of baptism. He who rose from the font had
   henceforth to go his way alone. If he reflected earnestly he could not
   doubt that all the Church could afterwards give him was a set of
   crutches.

   "Against Thee only have I sinned." "Thou, Lord, hast made us for
   Thyself, and our heart is restless, until it finds rest in Thee."
   "Grant what Thou dost command, and command what Thou dost desire" (da
   quod jubes, et jube quod vis). [117] "The just by faith will live." "No
   one enjoys what he knows, unless he also loves it, nor does anyone
   abide in that which he perceives unless by love" (eo quod quisque
   novit, non fruitur, nisi et id diligit, neque quisquam in eo quod
   percipit permanet nisi dilectione). [118] These are the new tones
   sounded by Augustine, that is the mighty chord which he produced from
   Holy Scripture, from the most profound observations of human nature,
   and speculations concerning the first and last things. Everything in
   the mind that was without God was absolutely sinful; the only good
   thing left to it was that it existed. Sin was the sphere and form of
   the inner life of every natural man. It had been maintained in all
   theological systems from Paul to Origen, and later, that a great revolt
   lay at the root of the present state of the human race. But Augustine
   was the first to base all religious feeling and all theological thought
   on this revolt as still existent and damning in every natural man. The
   Apologists regarded the revolt as an uncertain datum; Origen looked
   upon it as a premundane fatality. To Augustine it was the most vital
   fact of the present, one which, at work from the beginning, determined
   the life of the individual and of the whole race. Further, all sin was
   sin against God; for the created spirit had only one lasting
   relationship, that to God. Sin was self-will, the proud striving of the
   heart (superbia); therefore it took the form of desire and unrest. In
   this unrest, lust, never quieted, and fear revealed themselves. Fear
   was evil; but in this unrest there was also revealed the inalienable
   goodness of the spirit that has come from the hand of God: "We wish to
   be happy, and wish not to be unhappy, but neither can we will." [119]
   We cannot but strive after blessings, after happiness. But there is
   only one good, one happiness, and one rest. "It is a good thing that I
   should cling to God." All is included in that. Only in God as its
   element does the soul live. "Oh! who will give me to repose in Thee?
   Oh! that Thou wouldest enter into my heart, and inebriate it, that I
   may forget my ills, and embrace Thee, my only good! What art Thou to
   me? Of Thy mercy teach me to declare it. What am I to Thee that Thou
   demandest my love, and if I give it not, art angry with me, and
   threatenest me with grievous miseries? . . . For Thy mercies' sake tell
   me, O Lord my God, what Thou art to me. Say unto my soul: I am thy
   salvation.' Say it so, that I may hear. Behold, Lord, the ears of my
   heart are before Thee; open Thou them, and say to my soul: I am thy
   salvation. I will run after this voice, and take hold on Thee. Hide not
   Thy face from me; let me die seeing it-- only let me see it. Narrow is
   the tenement of my soul; enlarge Thou it, that it may be able to
   receive Thee. It is ruinous; repair Thou it. Within, it has these
   things that must offend Thine eyes; I confess and know; but who will
   cleanse it? or to whom shall I cry save Thee?" [120]

   The same God who created us has redeemed us through Jesus Christ. That
   simply means that he has restored us to communion with himself. This
   takes place through grace and love, and in turn through faith and love.
   Through grace which lays hold of us and makes the unwilling willing (ex
   nolentibus volentes), which gives us an incomprehensibly new nature by
   imparting a new birth; and through love, which strengthens the weak
   spirit, and inspires it with powers of goodness. Through faith which
   holds to the saying, "He who is just by faith will live," "which was
   written and confirmed by the all-powerful authority of apostolic
   teaching" (quod scriptum est et apostolicæ disciplinæ robustissima
   auctoritate firmatum); and through love, which humbly renounces all
   that is its own and longs for God and his law. Faith and love spring
   from God; for they are the means by which the living God enables us to
   appropriate him. The soul regards those possessions, in which it has
   obtained all that God requires of us, as an everlasting gift and a
   sacred mystery; for a heart equipped with faith and love fulfils the
   righteousness that is accepted by God. The peace of God is shed upon
   the soul which has the living God for its friend; it has risen from
   unrest to rest, from seeking to finding, from the false freedom to the
   free necessity, from fear to love; for perfect love casts out fear. It
   cannot for a moment forget that it is entangled in worldliness and sin,
   as long as it lives in this world; but it does not let its thoughts
   rest for a moment on sin, without remembering the living God who is its
   strength. The misery of sin overcome by faith, humility and love--that
   is Christian piety. In this temper the Christian was to live. He was
   constantly to feel the pain caused by sin, separation from God; but he
   was at the same time to console himself with the conviction that the
   grace of God had taken possession of him, that the Lord of heaven and
   earth had instilled His love into his heart, and that this love worked
   as mightily after as in baptism. [121] Thus Augustine dethroned the
   traditional feelings of the baptised, fear and hope, the elements of
   unrest, and substituted the elements of rest, faith, and love. For an
   uncertain and vacillating notion of sin he substituted the perception
   of its power and horror, for a still uncertain notion of grace he
   substituted the perception of its omnipotence. He did not abolish hope,
   he rather confirmed with all his power the old feeling that this life
   is not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed. But
   in realising and preaching the rest bestowed by faith and love, he
   transformed the stormy and fanatical power of hope into a gentle and
   sure conviction. [122]

   I have here reproduced Augustine's teaching, as we find it chiefly in
   his Confessions. This book has the advantage of giving us an account
   which is not influenced by any particular aims. Our exposition is by no
   means complete; we should require to add more than one caution, in
   order to be perfectly just. [123] Further, the description has
   intentionally only considered the fundamental lines, and given
   expression to but one direction in which the epoch-making importance of
   Augustine comes to the front. But there can be no doubt that it is the
   most decisive. If we Western Christians are shut up to the conviction
   that religion moves between the poles of sin and grace--nature and
   grace; if we subordinate morality to faith, in so far as we reject the
   thought of an independent morality, one indifferent to religion; if we
   believe that it is necessary to pay much greater heed to the essence of
   sin than to the forms in which it is manifested--fixing our attention
   on its roots, not on its degrees, or on sinful actions; if we are
   convinced that universal sinfulness is the presupposition of religion;
   if we expect nothing from our own powers; if we comprise all means of
   salvation in the thought of God's grace and of faith; if the preaching
   of faith and the love of God is substituted for that of fear,
   repentance, and hope; [124] if, finally, we distinguish between law and
   gospel, gifts and tasks appointed by God--then we feel with the
   emotions, think in the thoughts, and speak with the words of Augustine.
   [125]

   Who can deny that in this way religion disclosed deeper truths to
   feeling and thought, that the disease was recognised more surely, and
   the means of healing were demonstrated more reliably? Who can mistake
   the gain in laying bare the living heart, the need of the soul, the
   living God, the peace that exists in the disposition to trust and love?
   Even if he merely seeks to study these phenomena as a disinterested
   "historian of culture," who can escape the impression that we have here
   an advance, at least in psychological knowledge, that can never again
   be lost? In fact, history seems to teach that the gain can never perish
   within the Christian Church; nay, it attests more, it would appear,
   than this: it tells us that a limit has been reached, beyond which the
   pious mood cannot receive a further development. If we review all the
   men and women of the West since Augustine's time, whom, for the
   disposition that possessed them, history has designated as prominent
   Christians, we have always the same type; we find marked conviction of
   sin, complete renunciation of their own strength, and trust in grace,
   in the personal God who is apprehended as the Merciful One in the
   humility of Christ. The variations of this frame of mind are indeed
   numerous--we will speak of these later on; but the fundamental type is
   the same. And this frame of mind is taught in sermons and in
   instruction by truly pious Catholics and Evangelicals; to it youthful
   Christians are trained, and dogmatics are framed in harmony with it. It
   always produces so powerful an effect, even where it is only preached
   as the experience of others, that he who has once come in contact with
   it can never forget it; it accompanies him as a shadow by day and as a
   light in the dark; he who imagines that he has long shaken it off sees
   it rising up suddenly before him again. Since the days of Leibnitz,
   indeed, and the "Illumination," a powerful opponent has grown up, an
   enemy that seemed to have mastered it during a whole century, that
   reduced the Christian religion, when it gave any countenance to it at
   all, once more to energetic action, and furnished it with the foil of a
   cheerful optimism, a mode of thought which removed the living God afar
   off, and subordinated the religious to the moral. But this opponent
   succumbed in our century, at least, within the Churches, before the
   power of the old frame of mind. Whether this triumph of Augustine is
   guaranteed to last, none but a prophet could tell. It is only certain
   that the constellation of circumstances in the fray has been favourable
   to the victor.

   On the part of the Church no doubt prevails that the Augustinian
   feeling and type of thought are alone legitimate in Christianity, that
   they are alone Christian; for the conception of redemption (by God
   himself), in the sense of regeneration, dominates everything. But we
   cannot fail to be puzzled when we consider that it cannot by any means
   be directly deduced from the surest words of Jesus, and that the
   ancient and Greek Church was ignorant of it. Further, we cannot but be
   doubtful when we weigh its consequences; for their testimony is not all
   favourable. A quietistic, I might almost say a narcotic, element is
   contained in it, or is, at least, imperceptibly associated with it.
   There is something latent in it which seems to enervate the vital
   energies, to hinder the exertion of the will, and to substitute
   feelings for action. Is there no danger in substituting a general
   consciousness of sin for evident evil tendencies, heartless words and
   shameful deeds? [126] Is it safe to rely on the uniform operation of
   Grace, when we are called to be perfect and holy like God? Are all the
   energies of the Will actually set free, where the soul lives constantly
   in the mood shown in the "Confessions"? Are fear and hope really
   phases, necessarily to be superseded by faith and love? Perhaps it is
   correct to answer all these questions in accordance with the type of
   thought here considered; but even then a doubt remains. Is it
   advisable--apart from the variety in men's temperaments--to present
   this ideal as the aim at all stages of spiritual development? Here, at
   least, the answer cannot be doubtful. That which is the last stage
   reached by the advanced Christian who has passed through a rich
   experience is a refinement to him who is in process of development. But
   a refined piety or morality is always pernicious; for it no longer
   starts at the point of duty and conscience. It deceives regarding our
   need and its satisfaction. And since it is strong enough to fascinate,
   and can also be comprehended as a doctrine by an intelligence that is
   far from advanced, in order, once comprehended, never to pass away
   again, so it can become dangerous to morality, and therefore also to
   piety. For, after all, in both these spheres, that only has any value
   which heightens the power to be and do good; everything else is a
   poisonous fog. Perhaps, if we consider the matter fairly, no feeling or
   mood, and no theory of the factors in the religious process, are alone
   legitimate. As man requires sleep and wakefulness, so also he must, if
   he is to preserve his moral and religious life in health, alternate
   between the sense of his freedom and power and that of his bondage and
   helplessness, between the sense of full moral responsibility and the
   conviction that he is a favoured child of God. Or is there a way of so
   grasping Augustine's type of feeling and thought, that it may fashion
   faith into the strongest lever of moral energy and action? Are not the
   difficulties that rise against his type of piety due perhaps just to
   his not having developed it forcibly and absolutely enough?

   This question will obtain its answer later on. Here we have to point
   out that the dissemination of the religious views, peculiar to
   Augustine, was not in every respect beneficial. They constituted his
   greatness; they conducted him to the wonderful path he trod; they led
   him to conceive redemption no longer as a solitary intervention, by
   means of baptism, in the course of human life, but as the element in
   which the soul lived--baptismal grace being therefore a continuously
   operative force. "Personal characteristics" lie beyond the sphere of
   errors and truths; they may be erroneous, looked at from without, true
   from within. They may for that very reason be even hurtful as
   influences, for "when they introduce disproportionately what is
   foreign, the question arises, how these adventitious peculiarities
   harmonise with those that are native to the soul, and whether by the
   very act of mingling they do not produce a sickly condition." [127]
   Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that Augustine submitted the
   traditional religious feeling to as thorough-going a revision as is
   conceivable, and even he who is not in a position to praise it
   unreservedly will not seek to minimise its benefits. [128]

   II. No one was further than Augustine from intending to correct the
   tradition of the Church. If he has done this so emphatically, he was
   himself merely actuated by the feeling that he was thus assimilating
   more and more thoroughly the faith of the Church. Having forced his way
   through scepticism to the truth of the Catholic Church, he regarded the
   latter as the rock on which his faith was founded. We should
   misunderstand him were we to blink this fact. He rather sets us
   reflecting how it was possible for the most vital piety to have a
   double ground of conviction, inner experience, and external, nay,
   extremely external, attestation. We can make a still stronger
   assertion. Augustine first transformed the authority of the Church into
   a factor in religion; he first expressed pious contemplation, the view
   of God and self, in such a way that the religious man always found the
   authority of the Church side by side with sin and grace. [129] Paul and
   post-apostolic teachers, especially Tertullian, had, indeed, already
   introduced the Church into the religious relationship itself; [130] but
   they were not thinking of its authority.

   When we fix our attention on Augustine's distinctive type of Christian
   piety as the foundation of his significance for Church and dogmatic
   history, we must not only consider the decisive tendency of his
   doctrine of sin and grace, but we must also review his reception and
   characteristic revision of traditional elements. For from these his
   piety, i.e., his sense of God, and sin and grace, obtained the form
   which is familiar to us as specifically Catholic. In addition to (l)
   the above-mentioned element of the authority of the Church, there are,
   if my view is correct, other three; (2) the confusion of personal
   relationship to God with a sacramental communication of grace; (3)
   uncertainty as to the nature of faith and the forgiveness of sins; (4)
   uncertainty as to the significance of the present life. Even in the way
   he felt and wrote about these things he created new states of feeling;
   but they appear merely to be modifications of the old; or, rather, he
   first enabled the old moods fully to understand themselves, in other
   words, enriched them from the dead material which they brought with
   them. This exerted in turn a very strong influence on the fundamental
   feeling--the sense of sin and grace, and first gave it the form which
   enabled it to take possession of souls, without creating a revolution,
   or producing a violent breach with tradition.

   In the sequel we only discuss the fundamental features of these four
   elements. [131]

   1. Augustine introduced the authority of the Church as a religious
   factor for two reasons. Like the thought of redemption, the
   significance of the Church seems, on a superficial examination, to have
   received so sovereign and fixed an impress in the conception formed by
   the ancient Catholic and Greek Fathers, that any further accentuation
   of it is impossible. But, if we look more closely, redemption was
   presented as a solitary intervention, and the significance of the
   Church was exhausted in the fact that, while it was the presupposition
   of Christian life and the guarantee of Christian truth, it did not
   enter into the separate acts in which the religious and moral life ran
   its spiritual course. Here also Rothe's saying is true that Christians
   tacitly "laid their plans to meet the chance that in the end everything
   might require to be done by men alone." These "plans" were based since
   the days of the Apologists on the optimistic conception of the
   inalienable goodness of human nature, and the demonstrability
   (clearness and intelligibility) of the Christian religion. The course
   of a spontaneously moral life was ultimately modified, neither by the
   doctrine of redemption nor by that of the Church.

   In both these respects Augustine's experience had led to wholly
   different conclusions. His conflict with himself had convinced him of
   the badness of human nature, and Manichæism had left him in complete
   doubt as to the foundations and truth of the Christian faith. [132] His
   confidence in the rationality of Christian truth had been shaken to the
   very depths, and it was never restored. In other words, as an
   individual thinker he never gained the subjective certitude that
   Christian truth and as such everything contained in the two Testaments
   had to be regarded, was clear, consistent, and demonstrable. [133] When
   he threw himself into the arms of the Catholic Church, he was perfectly
   conscious that he needed its authority, not to sink in scepticism or
   nihilism. [134] For example, nothing but the authority of the Church
   could remove the stumbling-blocks in the Old Testament. The thousand
   doubts excited by theology, and especially Christology, could only be
   allayed by the Church. As regards the former case, allegorical
   interpretation, of course, helped to get one over the difficulties; but
   it (as contrasted with the literal which solves everything) did not
   justify itself; the Church alone gave the right to apply it. The Church
   guaranteed the truth of the faith, where the individual could not
   perceive it; that is the new thought whose open declaration proves the
   thinker's scepticism, as well as the man's love of truth. He would not
   impose upon himself; he would not become the sophist of his faith.
   Openly he proclaimed it: I believe in many articles only on the
   Church's authority; nay, I believe in the Gospel itself merely on the
   same ground. [135] Thereby the Church had gained an enormous
   importance, an importance which it was henceforth to retain in Western
   Catholicism; upon it, an entity above all incomprehensible--for what
   and where is the Church?--a great part of the responsibility was
   rolled, which had hitherto to be borne by the individual. Thus
   henceforth the Church had its part in every act of faith. By this,
   however, a vast revolution was brought about in the relation to the
   "faith which is believed" (fides quæ creditur). Acts of faith were, at
   the same time, acts of obedience. The difficulties were recognised
   which the Alexandrians overcame by distinguishing between exoteric and
   esoteric religion, but this distinction was itself rejected. In its
   place was now openly proclaimed what had long--especially in the West
   (see ch. I., Scripture and Dogma as Law)--been secretly the expedient
   of thousands: partial renunciation of independent faith, and the
   substitution for it of obedience. It is obvious that thus a great body
   of dogmas, or of the contents of Scripture, was placed beyond the reach
   of the believing subject, that a wholly different relation to them was
   introduced, that, in a word, the doctrines of Scripture and the Church
   obtained a new meaning. Augustine was the father of the conception of
   implicit faith (fides implicita), by associating with the individual
   believer the Church, with which he believes and which believes for him,
   in as far as it takes the place for him in many points of a
   psychological element of faith, namely, inner conviction. In openly
   proclaiming this conception, which, as has been said, already lurked in
   darkness, Augustine, on the one hand, disburdened individual faith, and
   directed it more energetically to those spheres in which it could rest
   without difficulties, but, on the other hand, introduced all the evil
   consequences which spring from faith in authority. [136]

   However, this championship of faith in authority had an additional
   root, in the case of Augustine, besides scepticism. Tradition and grace
   are connected by secret ties. A genius, who was never a sceptic, and
   who was therefore never possessed by a mania for authority, has
   confessed: "The dew in which I bathe and find health is tradition, is
   grace." Augustine was also led, both as a psychologist and a Christian
   of living faith, to tradition and therewith to the Church. In breaking
   with moralism, he broke too with the individualism and atomism of the
   ancient school. The "mass of perdition" (massa perditionis) was always
   confronted for him by grace (gratia) as a force working in history. I
   will not here yet go into his notion of the Church; it is certain that
   he possessed a lively sense that all great benefits, even communion
   with God himself, were attached to historical tradition, and it is
   manifest that religious individualism, as developed by him, was
   paralleled by and compatible with a conception, according to which the
   individual was supported by other persons, and by forces in the
   direction of goodness which he received through a visible medium.
   Augustine concentrated this correct historical conception in the idea
   of the Church. It was to him the organism and--for the individual--the
   womb of grace; it was further the communion of righteousness and love;
   and he felt this significance of the Church in his most personal piety
   much more acutely than any one before him.

   But the sceptic who needs the authority of the Church, and the
   Christian of quick feeling and sure observation, who perceives and
   prizes the value of Church communion, do not part company. There has
   never yet existed in the world a strong religious faith, which has not
   appealed, at some decisive point or other, to an external authority. It
   is only in the colourless expositions of religious philosophers, or the
   polemical systems of Protestant theologians, that a faith is
   constructed which derives its certitude exclusively from its own inner
   impulses. These undoubtedly constitute the force by which it exists and
   is preserved. But are not conditions necessary, under which this force
   becomes operative? Jesus Christ appealed to the authority of the Old
   Testament, ancient Christians to the evidence of prophecy, Augustine to
   the Church, and Luther himself to the written Word of God. Only
   academic speculation thinks that it can eliminate external authority;
   life and history show that no faith is capable of convincing men or
   propagating itself, which does not include obedience to an external
   authority, or fails to be convinced of its absolute power. The only
   point is to determine the rightful authority, and to discover the just
   relationship between external and internal authority. Were it
   otherwise, we should not be weak, helpless beings. We cannot think too
   highly of the nobility of human talents; but they are not lofty enough
   to enable men so to appropriate the sum of all the ideal elements which
   compose the inner life, that these simply grow with the growth of the
   soul, or become its product. Above all, the thought of God, the thought
   of the love of God, can never receive an irrefragable certainty,
   without being supported by an external authority. It is not a false
   view of religion that the restless quest of the soul only ceases when
   there has dawned upon it an authority whose validity is independent of
   the degree of strength with which its justification is felt within the
   breast. [137]

   All this Augustine perceived and expressed. Therefore "the traditional,
   exclusively authoritative doctrine" of the Church was transformed by
   him into a conception, according to which the Church is a religious
   factor. By this, however, the distinctive character of piety itself
   received a new definition. [138]

   2. The perception that religion is the possession of the living God, a
   personal relationship between the soul and God, is conspicuous in
   Augustine's Confessions, but also in other writings by him. That
   nothing but God himself could give the soul rest and peace is the
   fundamental note of the Confessions: "Say unto my soul: I am thy
   salvation." His great place in the history of piety is bound up with
   this perception, as we find it attached to Rom. VIII., 31-39. He is to
   be compared, in this also, to the great Alexandrians, especially
   Clement. But as Augustine did not merely reach this conclusion by means
   of a laborious speculation, so it assumed a much more forcible and
   purer form in his life and works than in theirs. [139]

   But the sure application of what is simplest in dogma is ever the
   hardest thing. Augustine found himself confronted by a tradition which
   taught that men enjoyed intercourse with God through laws and
   communications of grace; nay, the prevailing tradition was constantly
   in danger of reducing the latter to the former. In opposition to this,
   a great advance was at once made by insisting on the distinction
   between law and gospel, commands and grace. We now perceive that
   Augustine substantially limited himself to this in his polemical
   dogmatic writings. That is, he was not in a position to translate into
   his dogmatic theory the vital perception that God himself, as he
   appeared in Christ, was the possession of the soul. He substantially
   left standing the old scheme that God came to man's assistance, like a
   benevolent judge with acts of pardon, or like a physician with
   medicines. In other words, he gave the force of absolute conviction to
   what had been uncertain, viz., that God operates continuously by a
   mysterious and omnipotent impartation of grace, i.e., by powers of
   grace. [140] Thus grace (gratia per Christum) preserved even with him
   an objective character, and in his controversy with Donatists and
   Pelagians he completely developed this view of grace in connection with
   his doctrines of the Church and sacraments. He understood how to
   harmonise this, in his own feeling and self-criticism, with the
   conviction that the question involved was the possession of the living
   God. But as teacher of piety he did not succeed in doing so; indeed, we
   can say that, just because he laid all emphasis on grace through
   Christ, while conceiving it to consist in portions or instalments of
   grace, he was the means of establishing, along with the perception of
   its importance as beginning, middle, and end, the delusion that grace
   had an objective character. His age could understand, though with a
   great effort, his exposition of grace, as something imparted by the
   sacraments or the Church. It could bring that down to its own level.
   The magical element which adhered to this conception, the external
   solidity which the notion of grace received. in the sacrament, the
   apparent clearness of the view, the possibility of instituting
   theological computations with sin and grace--all these phases in the
   Augustinian doctrine of grace were greedily seized. Thus, in making
   grace the foundation and centre of all Christian theological
   reflection, it was due to his way of thinking that the living God and
   the personality of Christ lost ground in the consciousness of the
   Church he influenced. The believer had to do with the inheritance left
   by Christ, with what he had gained, with his merit, but not with Christ
   himself. The love of God was instilled into the soul in portions; but
   Augustine did not perceive that dogmatic was imperfect, nay, formed a
   hindrance to religion, as long as the supreme place was withheld from
   the principle: "Our heart is restless, until it rests in Thee." The
   violent agitation which he had himself experienced, the crisis in which
   the sole question was whether he should or should not find God to be
   his God, he has extremely imperfectly expressed in the dogmatic theory
   of his later period. He poured the new wine into old bottles, and was
   thus partly to blame for the rise of that Catholic doctrine of grace,
   which is perhaps the most dreadful part of Catholic dogmatics; for "the
   corruption of the best is the worst" (corruptio optimi pessima). When a
   Roman Catholic dogmatist very recently called the doctrine of grace
   "thorny ground," this description alone must have sufficed to show
   every common-sense Christian that the whole treatment of this main
   article had stumbled on a false path since the days of Augustine. Could
   there be a sadder admission than this, that reflection on what God
   grants the soul in Christ leads us among nothing but thorns? And could
   we conceive a greater contrast than that which exists between the
   sayings of Jesus and the Catholic doctrine of grace? But Protestantism,
   in its actual form, need not boast of having surmounted this pernicious
   Catholic doctrine. As it rests on the Augustinian doctrine of grace in
   the good sense of the term, and is distinguished thereby as Western
   Christianity from Eastern, it also bears the greatest part of the
   burden of this doctrine, and is therefore subject to the same dangers
   as Catholicism. It runs the risk of concealing the personal Christ by
   grace and the sacraments, of hedging in the living God through grace
   itself, and of setting up calculations about grace which make an
   account out of what is freest and holiest, and either dull the soul or
   leave it in unrest.

   But as Augustine knew, for his part, by what his soul lived, and was
   able to testify to it in words that lived, and, indeed, in some of his
   discussions also doctrinally, he exerted a powerful influence in this
   respect, too, on posterity. He became the father not only of the
   Catholic doctrine of grace, but also of that mysticism which was
   naturalised in the Catholic Church, down to the Council of Trent,
   indeed, till the Jansenist controversy. In more than a hundred passages
   of his works, above all by his Christian personality, he incited men to
   gain a life with God, within which they apprehended the personal God in
   grace. We may here also recall his doctrine of predestination. One of
   its roots indisputably grew out of the thought of the supremacy of
   personal relationship to God. It was understood, too in this way,
   wherever it was the means in after-times of obviating the pernicious
   consequences of the Church doctrine of grace and sacraments. But there
   can undoubtedly be no mistake, that wherever Augustine threw into the
   background his questionable doctrine of grace, he at once also incurred
   the danger of neutralising Christ's general significance. According to
   him, Christ's work referred to, and exhausted itself in the forgiveness
   of sins. But, as we shall see in what immediately follows, forgiveness
   did not bestow all that the Christian requires for salvation. Therefore
   the doctrine of grace was relatively independent of the historical
   Christ. This danger of conceiving positive grace without reference to
   Christ, or of connecting it with him only in the form of esthetic
   observations, continued to exert an influence. Luther, who started from
   Augustinianism, first overcame it, in as far as, in his relation to
   God, he only thought of God at all as he knew him in Christ. Augustine
   was prevented from doing so by his religious philosophy, and also his
   Biblicism, both of which had established independent claims upon him.
   Thus it happened that he influenced the piety of Western Christians by
   a doctrine of grace which met their lower inclinations, as well as by a
   promulgation of the immediateness of the religious relationship which
   failed to do justice to Christ's significance as mirror of God's
   fatherly heart and as the eternal mediator. In the latter as the former
   case, he set his seal on and gave vitality to elements which existed in
   the traditional doctrine only as dead material or stunted germs.

   3. Augustine shared with the whole of contemporary Christendom the
   thought, held to be all-important, that a time would come when at the
   judgment-seat of Christ "every one would receive in accordance with his
   actions"; and none will impugn the Christian character of this thought.
   But he went a step further, and also accepted the conception of merits
   current in the Church from the days of Tertullian and Cyprian. He did
   not get beyond the idea that in the final decision merits could alone
   be considered. He reconciled this principle, however, with his doctrine
   of grace, by teaching that God crowned his gifts (munera) in crowning
   our merits (merita). [141] This seemed to correspond to both
   considerations, and the certainty with which this conception
   established itself in the Church appeared to guarantee that the correct
   view had now been reached. But, first, the question arises whether the
   ambiguity of the reconciliation did not contribute to its being
   received; secondly, it cannot fail to surprise us that there is not a
   word about faith in the principle. We are once more at a point where
   Augustine, in reforming the prevailing piety, paid it a very
   considerable tribute. He certainly expressed the importance and power
   of faith in a striking and novel fashion. He who disregards the
   formulas, but looks to the spirit, will everywhere find in Augustine's
   works a stream of Pauline faith. None before him but his teachers
   Victorinus and Ambrose, in some of their expositions, had used similar
   language. Numerous passages can be cited in which Augustine extolled
   faith as the element in which the soul lives, as beginning, middle, and
   end of piety. But in the sphere of dogmatic reflection Augustine spoke
   of faith with extreme uncertainty, and, indeed, as a rule, not
   differently from his predecessors.

   Different points meet here. Firstly, it was simply the power of
   tradition which prevented him from perceiving more in faith than the
   act of initiation. Secondly, Scriptural texts led him to the assumption
   that something else than faith, namely, habitual goodness
   (righteousness), must finally fall to be considered at the divine
   tribunal. Thirdly and lastly, he limited the significance of the
   forgiveness of sins. The last point is in his case the most
   paradoxical, but here the most important. He for whom the supreme thing
   was the certainty of possessing a God, and who called to his whole
   period: "You have not yet considered of how great weight sin is"
   (nondum considerasti, quanti ponderis sit peccatum), never realised the
   strict relation that exists between faith and forgiveness, nor could
   explain clearly that the assurance of forgiveness is life and
   salvation. At this point the moral element suddenly entered with
   sovereign power into religious reflection. It is as if Augustine had
   here sought to escape the quietistic consequences of his doctrine (see
   above), and, in his inability to deduce positive virtue from faith in
   forgiveness of sin, turned from faith to works. Or was he prevented by
   the remnants of religious philosophy and cosmology that still clung to
   his theory of religion from perceiving absolutely that religion is
   bound up in faith in forgiveness of sins? [142] Or, again, is this
   perception itself erroneous and untenable, one that paralyses the power
   of moral exertion? We do not intend to examine these questions here.
   The fact is that Augustine conceived faith to be a preliminary stage,
   because he regarded forgiveness of sins as preliminary. If we look
   closely, we find that in his dogmatic theory sin was not guilt, but
   loss and infirmity. The very man who strove for, and found, a lasting
   relationship with God, was not capable of reproducing and stating his
   experience correctly in the shape of doctrine. He came back to the
   customary moralistic view, in so far as in his doctrine of grace he
   thought not of enmity to God, but the disease of sin, not of divine
   sonship, but of the restoration of a state in which man was rendered
   capable of becoming good, i.e., sinless. Therefore faith was merely
   something preliminary, and it is this that makes it so difficult to
   define Augustine's conception of the forgiveness of sins. It appears to
   have been really identical with the external and magical idea of his
   predecessors, with the exception that he had a firmer grasp of the
   forgiveness being an act of God, on which the baptised might constantly
   rely. But his reflection rarely took the form of regarding assurance of
   forgiveness as something whereby the soul receives energy and wings. He
   substantially never got beyond the impression that something was
   actually swept away by it, though that was indeed the gravest of facts,
   sin.

   The impossibility of carrying out this conception will always, however,
   leave a latent doubt. In spite of his new feeling, Augustine, for this
   reason, moved entirely in the lines of the old scheme when he sought to
   supplement and to build upon forgiveness of sin, and looked about him
   for a positive force which was required to take its place alongside of
   the negative effect. This he found in love. It was not in faith, but
   only in love, that he could recognise the force that really changed a
   man's nature, that set him in a new relationship. But then, in spite of
   the empirical objections that confronted him, he did not doubt that
   love could be infused like a medicine. Certain that God alone effects
   everything, he transferred to love the conception applicable to faith
   (trust)--that it ceases to be itself where it is felt to be other than
   an assimilative organ (organon leptikon)--as if love could also be as
   simply regarded as a gift of God through Christ (munus dei per
   Christum). The result of these reflections is that Augustine held that
   the relation of the pious soul to God was most appropriately described
   as a gradually advancing process of sanctification. To this he believed
   he could reduce all legitimate considerations, the fundamental
   importance of faith, the conception of (sacramental) grace as
   beginning, middle, and end, the need of positive forces capable of
   changing man's state, the view that only the just could be saved, and
   that no one was righteous whose works were not perfect, i.e., the
   necessity of merits, etc. He believed that he had found a means of
   adjusting the claims of religion and morality, of grace and merits, of
   the doctrine of faith and eschatology. Omnipotent love became for him
   the principle that connected and supported everything. Faith, love, and
   merit were successive steps in the way to final salvation, and he has
   impressed this view on the Catholic Church of after times, and on its
   piety up to the present day. It is the ancient scheme of the process of
   sanctification leading to final salvation, but so transformed that
   grace acts upon all its stages. Excellent and--for many stages of
   development--appropriate as this conception appears, yet it cannot be
   mistaken that in it Augustine lagged behind his own experience, and
   that against his will he subordinated the religious sphere to moral
   goodness; for this subordination was by no means precluded by the
   equation "our merits, God's gifts" (nostra merita, dei munera). Where
   merits play a part there is a failure to understand that there is a
   relationship to God which is maintained mid weakness and sin, as well
   as in misery and death. [143]

   Of this even Augustine had a presentiment, and he therefore also
   imparted to the Church, to which he transmitted his doctrine of faith,
   love, and merit, germs of a conception which could not but be fatal to
   that doctrine. They are not only included in his doctrine of
   predestination, but at least as much so in every passage of his
   writings, where he gives voice to the confession, "To me to cling to
   God is a good thing." In this avowal the religious possession and moral
   goodness coincide, and are referred to God, their source. But even
   apart from this, his idea of love: "in this life also virtue is nothing
   but loving what ought to be loved; good affections make a good
   character," [144] was so excellent and forcible that all criticism
   looks like impudent coxcombry. Nevertheless, we must criticise it from
   the standpoint of the gospel. We have already remarked above that
   Augustine's doctrine of infused love is indifferent to the work of the
   historical Christ. Therefore he had a two-fold Christology: on the one
   hand, Christ is God, a member of the Trinity (unus ex trinitate); on
   the other hand, the chosen man, who was as much under grace as we are.
   All that leads us back ultimately to the fact that he under-estimated
   the significance of the forgiveness of sins and of the publican's
   faith: that his piety was not yet simple enough. [145]

   4. Finally, it is to be pointed out that Augustine in his reformation
   of Christian piety did not disturb its character as a preparation for
   the next world. He could have changed nothing here without wounding the
   Christian religion itself; for the view of some Protestants, that
   Christianity can be transformed into a religion of this world, is an
   illusion. Augustine lived as much in the future world as Justin and
   Irenæus. His eschatological reflections are inexhaustible, and if, as
   will be shown afterwards, he set aside a few of the older ideas, yet
   that affords no standard of the whole trend of his piety. He only
   intensified the pessimistic view of this life, this mortal life and
   living death (vita mortalis, mors vitalis), by his doctrine of sin.
   "What flood of eloquence would ever suffice to portray the tribulations
   of this life, to describe this wretchedness, which is, as it were, a
   kind of hell in our present existence? Verily, the new-born infant
   comes to our mortal light, not laughing but weeping, and by its tears
   prophesies in some fashion, even without knowing it, to what great
   evils it has come forth. . . . A heavy yoke burdens all the children of
   Adam from the day of birth to that of burial, when they return to the
   common mother of all. . . . And the sorest thing of all is that we
   cannot but know how, just by the grievous sin committed in Paradise,
   this life has become a punishment to us." [146] Just as he has retained
   the pessimistic view of our present life, he has also described
   blessedness as the state of the perfect knowledge of God. He has done
   so in one of his earliest writings, De vita beata, and he substantially
   adhered to it.

   But the very perception, that misery was not a mere fatality, but was
   incurred by guilt, and the confidence that grace could make man free
   and happy even upon this earth, exerted a certain counterpoise. He
   undoubtedly does not call the present life of the Christian "joy of
   felicity," "but comfort of misery," and declares that to be an
   extremely false felicity which is devised by men who seek here another
   happiness than that entertained by hope. [147] But in not a few
   passages he yet speaks of the joy in God which creates blessedness even
   here. He seldom obeyed this feeling. For that very reason he found this
   life in itself objectless, and there are only a few indications,
   especially in the work, De civitate dei, in which he tried to show that
   a kingdom of Christ may be built up even in this world, and that the
   just, who live by faith, constitute it, and have a present task to
   perform (see also De trinit. I., 16 and 21). Speaking generally, he
   propagated the feeling shown in ancient Christian eschatology in every
   respect, and prepared the ground for monachism. If he seems to have
   instigated the development of the Catholic Church in its tendency to
   masterful rule over this world, yet external circumstances, and the
   interpretation they produced of his work "De civitate dei," contributed
   much more to the result than any intentional impulses given by him.
   [148] Where, however, there has developed in Catholicism in after times
   a strong sense of the blessedness which the Christian can receive even
   in this state, it has always assumed a mystical and ecstatic character.
   This is a clear proof that in any case this life was disregarded; for
   the mystical feeling of blessedness, even as Augustine knew it, really
   exists, by means of an excess, already in the future state.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In the preceding pages the attempt has been made to show how the piety
   was constituted in which Augustine lived, and which he transmitted to
   posterity. It is extraordinary difficult to understand it aright; for
   experience and tradition are interwoven in it in the most wonderful
   way. Yet we cannot understand him as teacher of the Church, until we
   have formed our estimate of him as reformer of piety; for, besides
   Scripture and tradition, his theories have their strongest roots in the
   piety that animated him. They are in part nothing but states of feeling
   interpreted theoretically. But in these states of feeling there
   gathered round the grand experience of conversion from bondage to
   freedom in God all the manifold religious experiences and moral
   reflections of the ancient world. The Psalms and Paul, Plato and the
   Neoplatonists, the Moralists, Tertullian and Ambrose, we find all again
   in Augustine, and, side by side with the new psychological view
   constructed by him as disciple of the Neoplatonists, we come once more
   upon all the childish reflections and absolute theories which these men
   had pursued.

   [111] August. Ep. 155 c. 12. 13. "Virtutes ita crescent et
   perficientur, ut te ad vitam vere beatam, quæ nonnisi æterna est, sine
   ulla dubitatione perducant: ubi jam nec prudenter discernantur a bonis
   mala, quæ non erunt, nec fortiter tolerentur adversa, quia non ibi erit
   nisi quod amemus, non etiam quod toleremus, nec temperanter libido
   frenetur, ubi nulla ejus incitamenta sentiemus, nec juste subveniatur
   ope indigentibus, ubi inopem atque indignum non habebimus. Una ibi
   virtus erit, et idipsum erit virtus præmiumque virtutis, quod dicit in
   sanctis eloquiis homo qui hoc amat: Mihi autem adhærere deo bonum est.
   Hæc ibi erit plena et sempiterna sapientia eademque veraciter vita jam
   beata. Perventio quippe est ad æternum ac summum bonum, cui adhærere
   est finis nostri boni. Dicatur hæc et prudentia quia prospectissime
   adhærebit bono quod non amittatur, et fortitudo, quia fermissime
   adhærebit bono unde non avellatur, et temperantia, quia castissime
   adhærebit bono, ubi non corrumpatur, et justitia, quia rectissime
   adhærebit bono, cui merito subjiciatur. Quamquam et in hac vita virtus
   non est nisi diligere quod diligendum est. Quid autem eligamus quod
   præcipue diligamus, nisi quo nihil melius invenimus? Hoc deus est, cui
   si diligendo aliquid vel præponimus vel æquamus, nos ipsos diligere
   nescimus. Tanto enim nobis melius est, quanto magis in illum imus, quo
   nihil melius est. Imus autem non ambulando, sed amando. Ad eum non
   pedibus ire licet, sed moribus. Mores autem nostri, non ex eo quod
   quisque novit, sed ex eo quod diligit, dijudicari solent. Nec faciunt
   bonos vel malos mores, nisi boni vel mali amores. Pravitate ergo nostra
   a rectitudine dei longe fuimus. Unde rectum amando corrigimur, ut recto
   recti adhærere possimus."

   [112] Compare my lecture "Augustin's Confessionen," 1888. See also
   Essay by G. Boissier in the Rev. de deux mond., 1 Jan., 1888.

   [113] In what follows the fundamental tendency is alone characterised.
   It is not to be denied that in some cases evangelical features were
   more marked.

   [114] After the exposition given in Vols. I.-IV., and the indications
   in Chap. II. of this vol., I need not adduce further evidence that for
   the ancient Church the grace of God in Christ was exhausted in the
   gifts received in baptism. All other grace, which was hoped for, was
   beset with uncertainty.

   [115] Read the striking avowals of II. Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas,
   Tertullian, the confessions of monks, and of the great theologians of
   the fourth century who were prevented by circumstances from becoming
   monks.

   [116] Rothe says very truly, Kirchengesch., II., p. 33: "Men secretly
   distrusted inevitably the presupposed purely supernatural and
   accordingly magical operation of God's grace, and they therefore
   arranged their plans on the eventuality that in the end everything
   might still require to be done by man alone."

   [117] De pecc. mer. et remiss., II., 5; De spiritu et lit., 22; see
   Confessions, X, 40, and De dono persever., 53. The substance is given
   already in Soliloq., I., 5: "Jube quæso atque impera quidquid vis, sed
   sana et aperi aures meas." Enchir., 117, "Fides impetrat quod lex
   imperat."

   [118] De fide et symb., 19.

   [119] De Trinit., XIII., 4: "Felices esse volumus et infelices esse
   nolumus, sed nec velle possumus." De civit. dei, XI., 26: "Tam porro
   nemo est qui esse se nolit, quam nemo est qui non esse beatus velit.
   Quo modo enim potest beatus esse, si nihil sit?"

   [120] Confess., I., 5: Quis mihi dabit acquiescere in te? Quis mihi
   dabit ut venias in cor meum et inebries illud, ut obliviscar mala mea
   et unum bonum amplectar te? Quid mihi es? Miserere, ut loquar. Quid
   tibi sum ipse, ut amari te jubeas a me, et nisi faciam irascaris mihi
   et mineris ingentes miserias? . . . Dic mihi per miserationes tuas,
   domine deus meus, quid sis mihi. Dic animæ meæ: Salus tua ego sum. Sic
   dic, ut audiam. Ecce aures cordis mei ante te, domine; aperi eas, et
   dic animæ meæ: Salus tua ego sum. Curram post vocem hanc et apprehendam
   te. Noli abscondere a me faciem tuam; moriar ne moriar, ut eam videam.
   Angusta est domus animæ meæ quo venias ad eam; dilatetur abs te.
   Ruinosa est; refice eam. Habet quæ offendant oculos tuos; fateor et
   scio; sed quis mundabit eam? aut cui alteri præter te clamabo?

   [121] Enchir., 64: "Excepto baptismatis munere ipsa etiam vita cetera,
   quantalibet præpolleat foecunditate justitiæ, sine peccatorum
   remissione non agitur."

   [122] We will afterwards discuss how far Augustine failed to surmount
   this uncertainty and unrest, owing to the reception of popular Catholic
   elements into his piety.

   [123] The most important caution--that Augustine fitted his new form of
   feeling and reflection into the old--will be discussed later on; it has
   been only mildly suggested in the above exposition.

   [124] I need hardly guard against the misapprehension that I represent
   faith as not having been of fundamental importance to the
   Pre-Augustinian and Greek Church. The question here is as to the
   feeling and disposition of the Christian. The Pre-Augustinian Christian
   regarded faith as the self-evident presupposition of the righteousness
   which he had to gain by his own efforts.

   [125] It need not be objected that this is the doctrine of Scripture.
   In the first place, Scripture has no homogeneous doctrine; secondly,
   even Paul's range of thought, to which Augustine's here most closely
   approximates, does not perfectly coincide with it. But we must
   undoubtedly recognise that the Augustinian reformation was quite
   essentially a Pauline reaction against the prevailing piety. Augustine,
   to some extent, appears as a second Marcion, see Vol. I., p. 136,
   Reuter, August. Studien, p. 492 "We can perhaps say that Paulinism,
   which the growing Catholic Church only half-learned to understand,
   which Marcion attempted to open up in an eccentric one-sidedness that
   the Church, in its opposition to him, had all but rejected, was
   exploited by our Church Father for the second time, in such a way, that
   much hitherto belonging to popular Catholicism was remodelled." This is
   followed by a parallel between Augustine and Marcion. The triad "Faith,
   Love, and Hope," is Pauline, and occurs in almost all Church Fathers;
   but Augustine first made it fruitful again (perhaps he learned here
   from Jovinian).

   [126] I say nothing of the arrogant habit of those who, because they
   agree with the Augustinian doctrine, not only openly credit themselves
   with possessing "positive" Christianity, but also denounce their
   opponents as "half-believers." For this nonsense Augustine is not
   responsible, and it only made its appearance in the nineteenth century.
   It is only in our days that evangelical Christendom has permitted
   itself to be terrorised by people who bear the deeper "knowledge of
   sin" as a motto, and with this shield guard themselves against the
   counsel to be just and modest.

   [127] Compare Goethe in his wonderful reflections on Sterne, Werke
   (Hempel's Ed.), Vol. XXIX., p. 749 f.

   [128] Augustine's Exposition of the Church I neither count one of his
   greater achievements, nor can I hold it to be the central idea which
   determines what is essential to him.

   [129] Reuter says excellently (l.c., p. 494): "Many phases of the
   hitherto traditional and authoritative doctrine were transformed by him
   into really religious factors; he effected a revolution in the
   religious consciousness in those circles in and upon which he worked,
   yet without seeking to endanger its Catholicity." Cf., also p. 102
   (71-98): "Much, but very far from all, that belonged to popular
   Catholicism was revised by Augustine."

   [130] See De bapt., 6: "Cum antem sub tribus et testatio fidei et
   sponsio salutis pignerentur, necessario adicitur ecclesiæ mentio,
   quoniam ubi tres, id est pater et filius et spiritus sanctus, ibi
   ecclesia, quæ trium corpus est." De oral., 2: "Pater . . . filius . . .
   ne mater quidam ecclesia præteritur. Si quidem in filio et patre mater
   recognoscitur, de qua constat et patris et filii nomen." De monog., 7:
   "Vivit enim unicus pater noster et mater ecclesia." All this is based
   on the Symbol.

   [131] We don't need now to say for the first time that Augustine was as
   closely as possible united to the past of the Church in all else
   (Scripture, doctrinal confession, etc.). Besides this, he shared with
   his contemporaries in the conception of the Church's science in its
   relation to faith, and had on many points as naïve ideas as they of the
   limits and scope of knowledge. If he possessed the faculty of
   psychological observation in a much higher degree than his
   predecessors, he retained the absolute type of thought, and, with all
   the sceptical reserve which he practised in single questions, he
   further developed that conglomerate of cosmology, ethics, mythology,
   and rationalism, which was then called science. So also he was
   implicated in all the prejudices of contemporary exegesis. It is to be
   added, finally, that, although less credulous than his contemporaries,
   he was, like Origen, involved in the prejudices, the mania for
   miracles, and the superstition of the age. His works, sober in
   comparison with many other elaborations of the epoch, are yet full of
   miracles. A slave learns to read in answer to prayer, in three days,
   and without human help; and we have divine judgments, miracle-working
   relics, etc. He certainly made the absurd indispensable to the Church.
   Since Augustine's time there are wholly absurd Church doctrines, whose
   abandonment would not be without danger, because they have excited, or
   at least have supported, like the vine-pole, the virtues of
   conscientiousness, strictness in self-examination, and tenderness of
   soul (see, e.g., his doctrine of original sin). But like all
   absurdities, they have also excited blind fanaticism and fearful
   despair.

   [132] See Reuter, l.c. p. 490 f.

   [133] The few tendencies to this conception, which are also found in
   his works, are always combined with that neutralising of the historical
   displayed by the Apologists. We cannot here discuss more fully this
   undercurrent in his writings. But it is important to show clearly the
   main current, namely, that scholars were by no means confident of the
   rationality of the Catholic faith. The attacks made by heathens and
   Manichæans had shaken them. Some speak, partly with self-satisfaction,
   partly with pain, of "modern" doubts of the faith of the Church. But
   these doubts are so far from modern that the creation of the
   Augustinian and mediæval authority of the Church is their work. That
   ecclesiasticism is so powerful, nay, has become a dogmatic quantity, is
   due to the defective morality of Christians in the second and third
   centuries, and to their defective faith in the fourth and fifth. The
   distinction between Justin and Augustine is in this respect much
   greater than that between Augustine and a Christian of the sixteenth or
   nineteenth centuries.

   [134] See the middle Books of the Confessions, e.g., VI., 11:
   "Scripturæ sanctæ, quas ecclesiæ catholicæ commendat auctoritas." VI.,
   7: "Libris tuis, quos tanta in omnibus fere gentibus auctoritate
   fundasti. . . . Non audiendos esse, si qui forte mihi dicerent; unde
   scis illos libros unius veri et veracissimi dei spiritu esse humano
   generi ministratos? idipsum enim maxime credendum erat." VI., 8:
   "Ideoque cum essemus infirmi ad inveniendam liquida ratione veritatem,
   et ob hoc nobis opus esset auctoritate sanctarum litterarum, jam
   credere coeperam nullo modo te fuisse tributurum tam excellentem
   scripturæ per omnes jam terras auctoritatem, nisi et per ipsam tibi
   credi et per ipsam te quæri voluisses. Jam enim absurditatem quæ me in
   illis litteris solebat offendere, cum multa ex eis probabiliter
   exposita audissem, ad sacramentorum altitudinem referebam." See also
   the treatise De utilit. credendi, and, in general, the writings against
   Manichæism.

   [135] Contra Ep. Manichæi, 5: "Ego vero evangelio non crederem, nisi me
   catholicae (ecclesiæ) commoveret auctoritas." Innumerable parallels
   exist, especially in the writings against Manichæism, but also
   elsewhere.

   [136] Reuter, who by no means over-values the importance of the idea of
   the Church in Augustine, declares (p. 499): "By Augustine the idea of
   the Church was rendered the central power in the religious state of
   mind and ecclesiastical activity of the West in a fashion unknown to
   the East." "Central power" is almost saying too much (see Theol.
   Lit.-Zeit., 1887, No. 15).

   [137] This argument has been very badly received by some critics, but I
   find nothing to change in it. Perhaps it will help to its being
   understood if I add that the spiritual man is directly conscious of the
   Divine Spirit as his Lord--who constrains him to obedience, even where
   he himself does not perceive the inner authority--but the non-spiritual
   require some sort of intervening authority, whether consisting in
   persons, or a book, or Church. But in both cases we are dealing with a
   controlling power, whose authority rises above one's own individuality
   and knowledge. I hope that in disclosing this state of the case I am
   safe from being (wrongly) understood to draw a fixed line between the
   spiritual and non-spiritual. Throughout it is only a question of the
   proportion in which the apocalyptic and mediated elements appear and
   are connected in personal religion. Even the spiritual man who holds
   direct communion with God has, as history shows, extremely seldom,
   perhaps never entirely, freed himself from all intermediate authority;
   on the contrary, he has clung to it firmly, in spite of his intercourse
   with the Deity. This is not the place to explain this phenomenon; but
   personal religion is not shown to be valueless by its being proved that
   its authorities are not sound (against Baumann, Die Grundfrage der
   Religion, 1895, p. 22 f.). The important point is what the pious man
   has derived from his authorities.

   [138] It is only to a superficial observer that Eastern Christians seem
   to cling more strongly to the Church than Western. In the East the
   historical course of events welded ecclesiasticism and nationality into
   one, and the internal development made the cultus of the Church the
   chief matter. But what other rule does the Church play in personal
   piety than being the scene of Christian life, the teacher of doctrine,
   and the administrator of the mysteries? All these are, in fact,
   presupposed conditions; in the West, on the contrary, the Church has
   thrust itself into all relations and points of contact of the pious
   soul to God and Christ, as far as the Augustinian tradition is
   accepted.

   [139] Let anyone read attentively the Confessions B. VII. and VIII., as
   also the writings and epistles composed immediately after his
   conversion, and he will find that Augustine's Neoplatonism had
   undoubtedly a share in giving him this perception. But he was brought
   to it in a much higher degree by his inner experience, and the reading
   of Paul and the Psalms. The Psalmists' piety was revived in him (see
   esp. Confess., IX., 8-12). His style even was modelled on theirs. In
   Clement of Alex. and Origen, Neoplatonic speculation, on the contrary,
   prevailed. Even in the most glorious of their expositions, in which the
   power of feeling is clearly conspicuous, we cannot forget the
   speculative path by which they thought they had attained to the
   possession of God.

   [140] The final ground of this view with Augustine consists naturally
   in the fact that he never wholly got rid of the old Catholic scheme
   that the ultimate concern of Christianity was to transform human nature
   physically and morally for eternal life. He took a great step forward;
   but he was not able to give clear expression to the Pauline thought
   that the whole question turned on forgiveness of sins and sonship to
   God, or to frame all dogmatics in harmony with it.

   [141] See e.g., Confess. IX. 34: "Quisquis tibi enumerat vera merita
   sua, quid tibi enumerat nisi munera tua." Ep. 194, n. 19: "cum deus
   coronat merita nostra, nihil aliud coronat quam munera sua." De gratia
   et lib. arb., 15: "Dona sua coronat deus non merita tua . . . si ergo
   dei dona sunt bona merita tua, non deus coronat merita tua tamquam
   merita tua sed tamquam dona sua." De gestis Pelag., 35: "Redditur
   quidem meritis tuis corona sua, sed dei dona sunt merita tua." De
   trinit., XIII., 14: "Et ea quæ dicuntur merita nostra, dona sunt eius,"
   etc. XV. 21: "Quid animam faciet beatam, nisi meritum suum et præmium
   domini sui? Sed et meritum ejus gratia est illius, cujus, præmium erit
   beatitudo ejus." De prædest. sanct., 10. For this very reason the
   fundamental principle holds good, that grace is not granted secundum
   merita nostra.

   [142] In his 177th letter, e.g. (Ad Innocent., c. 4), he expressly
   declares that it is an error to say that gratia is liberum arbitrium or
   remissio peccatorum.

   [143] But, besides, the final and supreme question as to assurance of
   salvation is not less misunderstood.

   [144] Et in hac vita virtus non est nisi diligere quod diligendum est;
   faciunt boni amores bonos mores.

   [145] It has seemed necessary to concede to Augustine's conception of
   sanctification that it had the merit of correcting the quietistic phase
   that clung dangerously to his doctrine of grace. But, on a closer
   inspection, we find that love did not certainly mean to him the
   exemplification of morality in serving our neighbour, but sentiments,
   or such works of love, as owed their value to reflex action at least as
   strongly as to philanthropy. Here again, in very many expositions, he
   did not advance beyond the old Catholic Christians, or Cyprian and
   Ambrose; man attends best to his own interests by means of caritas, and
   pleases God in divesting himself of what is worldly.

   [146] See also the thrilling description, De civitat, XIX., 4.

   [147] In his Soliloquies, one of his earliest writings, he awards
   felicity to the soul that perceives God here below. But in his
   Retractations, I., 4, he says expressly, "Nec illud mihi placet, quod
   in ista vita deo intellecto jam beatam esse animam (in Soliloquiis)
   dixi, nisi forte spe." In general, Augustine at a later date disavowed
   many arguments in his works written immediately after his conversion;
   nay, even in his Confessions, in which he is disposed to describe his
   conversion as instantaneous, he has admitted in one important sentence
   how imperfect his Christian thought was at that time: IX. 7, "Ibi (in
   Cassiciacum) quid egerim in litteris, jam quidem servientibus tibi, sed
   adhue superbiæ scholam tanquam in pausatione anhelantibus, testantur
   libri disputati cum præsentibus (libr. c. Academ.--de beata vita--de
   ordine) et cum ipso me solo (Soliloquia) coram te; quæ autem cum
   absente Nebridio, testantur epistolæ"). But our judgment must here be
   divided. What was written earlier was undoubtedly in many respects less
   complete, less churchly, more Neoplatonic; but on the other hand it was
   more direct, more personal and determined to a smaller degree by regard
   for the Catholicism of the Church. Yet he was already determined to
   have nothing to do with a felicity of inquiry and seeking; but only saw
   it in its possession (Adv. Acad. lib., I.).

   [148] On Augustine's pessimistic and eschatological tendency, his view
   of the secular and clerical life, as also the efforts to surmount the
   popular Catholic conception, see Reuter, l.c., Studie VI. We return
   briefly to these subjects further on.

CHAPTER IV.

  THE HISTORICAL POSITION OF AUGUSTINE AS TEACHER OF THE CHURCH.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The ancient Church before Augustine only possessed a single great
   dogmatic scheme, the Christological. Augustine also knew it and made
   use of it; but in inserting it into a greater and more living group, he
   deprived it of its original meaning and object. It has been said of
   Socrates that he brought philosophy down from heaven; we may maintain
   of Augustine that he did the same for dogmatics, by separating it from
   speculations about the finite and infinite, God the Logos and the
   creature, mortal and immortal, and connecting it with questions as to
   moral good, freedom, sin, and blessedness. Goodness became for him the
   point on which turned the consideration of blessings; moral goodness
   (virtue) and the possession of salvation were not merely to occupy
   corresponding positions, but to coincide (ipsa virtus et præmium
   virtutis). If we may use a figure, we can say that Augustine formed
   into one the two centres of popular Catholic theology, the renewing
   power of redemption and the free effort to attain virtue; of the
   ellipse he made a circle--God, whose grace delivers the will and endows
   it with power to do what is good. In this is comprehended his
   significance in the history of the Christian religion. He did not,
   however, vindicate the new portion consistently, but built the old into
   it. Indeed, in the new cathedral erected by him, the old building
   formed, as it were, the holy of holies, which is seldom entered.

   When we seek to determine what has been accomplished by an ancient
   Church theologian as teacher of the Church, we must examine his
   expositions of the Symbol. We possess several by Augustine. It is
   extremely instructive to compare the earliest (De fide et symbolo, A.D.
   393) with one of the latest (De fide, spe et caritate, A.D. 421, or
   later). In the former Augustine is still substantially a theologian of
   the ancient Church. The questions discussed by him are the same as were
   then dealt with, in both halves of the Church, in the Symbol, and are
   suggested by its language. Even the manner in which he discusses them
   is but slightly distinguished from the customary one. Finally, the
   polemic is the one that was usual: Arians, Manichæans, Apollinarians,
   Pneumatomachoi occupy the foreground; the last named especially are
   very thoroughly refuted. On the other hand, Augustine's characteristics
   declare themselves even in this early exposition. [149] Thus we have,
   above all, his love of truth and frankness in the sections on the Holy
   Spirit, and his sceptical reserve and obedient submission to Church
   tradition. Further, in the Christology we find his characteristic
   scheme "Christ invested in man" (Christus indutus in homine), as well
   as the strong emphasis laid on the humility of Christ contrasted with
   pride (superbia). Compare, besides, sentences like the following.
   Chapter V I.--"Since he is only-begotten he has no brothers; but since
   he is first-begotten, he has deigned to name all those his brothers who
   after and through his headship are born again into the grace of God
   through the adoption of sons." Or (Chapter XI.): "Our Lord's humility
   was lowly in his being born for us; to this it was added that he
   deigned to die for mortals." Or (Chapter XIX.): "The writers of the
   Divine Scriptures declare that the Holy Spirit is God's gift in order
   that we may believe that God does not bestow a gift inferior to
   himself." Or (ibid.): "No one enjoys that which he knows, unless he
   also loves it . . . nor does anyone abide in that which he apprehends
   unless by love." [150] But if Augustine had died before the Donatist
   and Pelagian controversies, he would not have been the dogmatist who
   changed the whole scheme of doctrine; for it was these controversies
   that first compelled him to reflect on and review what he had long
   held, to vindicate it with all his power, and to introduce it also into
   the instruction of the Church. But since it had never entered his mind
   that the ancient doctrinal tradition, as attached to the Symbol, could
   be insufficient, [151] since it had still less occurred to him to
   declare the Symbol itself to be inadequate, it was a matter of course
   to him that he should make everything which he had to present as
   religious doctrine hinge on that Confession. In this way arose the
   characteristic scheme of doctrine, which continued to influence the
   West in the Middle Ages; nay, on which the Reformed version is based--a
   combination of ancient Catholic theology and system with the new
   fundamental thought of the doctrine of grace, forced into the framework
   of the Symbol. It is evident that by this means a mixture of styles
   arose which was not conducive to the transparency and intelligibility
   of doctrine. But we have not only to complain of want of clearness, but
   also of a complexity of material which, in a still higher degree than
   was the case in the ancient Catholic Church, necessarily frustrated the
   demand for a closely reasoned and homogeneous version of religious
   doctrine. We are perhaps justified in maintaining that the Church never
   possessed in ancient times another teacher so anxious as Augustine to
   think out theological problems, and to secure unity for the system of
   doctrine. But the circumstances in which he was placed led to him above
   all others necessarily confusing that system of doctrine, and involving
   it in new inconsistencies. [152] The following points fall to be
   considered.

   1. As a Western theologian, he felt that he was bound by the Symbol;
   but no Western theologian before him had lived so much in Scripture, or
   taken so much from it as he. The old variance between Symbol and
   Scripture, [153] which at that time indeed was not yet consciously
   felt, was accordingly intensified by him. The uncertainty as to the
   relation of Scripture and Symbol was increased by him in spite of the
   extraordinary services he had rendered in making the Church familiar
   with the former. [154] The Biblicism of later times, which afterwards
   took up an aggressive attitude to the Church in the West, is to be
   traced back to Augustine; and the resolute deletion of Scriptural
   thoughts by an appeal to the authority of the Church's doctrine may
   equally refer to him. [155] If we are asked for the historical
   justification of pre-reformers and reformers in the West, in taking
   their stand exclusively on Scripture, we must name Augustine; if we are
   asked by what right such theologians have been silenced, we may refer
   similarly to Augustine; but we can in this case undoubtedly go back to
   the authority of Tertullian (De præscr. hær.).

   2. On the one hand, Augustine was convinced that everything in
   Scripture was valuable for faith, and that any thought was at once
   justified, ecclesiastically and theologically, by being proved to be
   Biblical--see his doctrine of predestination and other tenets, of which
   he was certain simply because they were found in the Bible. By this
   principle any unity of doctrine was nullified. [156] But, on the other
   hand, Augustine knew very well that religion was a practical matter,
   that in it faith, hope, and love, or love alone, were all-important,
   and that only what promoted the latter had any value. Indeed he
   advanced a considerable step further, and approximated to the
   Alexandrian theologians: he ultimately regarded Scripture merely as a
   means, which was dispensed with when love had reached its highest
   point, and he even approached the conception that the very facts of
   Christ's earthly revelation were stages beyond which the believer
   passed, whose heart was possessed wholly by love. [157] This latter
   point--which is connected with his individualistic theology, but
   slightly influenced by the historical Christ--will be discussed below.
   It is enough here to formulate sharply the inconsistency of making
   Scripture, on the one hand, a source, and, on the other, a means. [158]
   --a means indeed which is finally dispensed with like a crutch. [159]
   The mystics and fanatics of the West have given their adhesion to the
   last principle, advancing the inner light and inner revelation against
   the written. Now Augustine, in his excellent preface to his work "De
   doctrina Christiana," has undoubtedly, as with a flash of prophetic
   illumination, rejected all fanatical inspiration, which either fancied
   it had no need at all of Scripture, or, appealing to the Spirit,
   declared philological and historical interpretation to be useless. But
   yet he opened the door to fanaticism with his statement that there was
   a stage at which men had got beyond Scripture. Above all, however, he
   created the fatal situation, in which the system of doctrine and
   theology of the Western Church are still found at the present day, by
   the vagueness which he failed to dispel as to the importance of the
   letter of Scripture. The Church knows, on the one hand, that in the
   Bible, so far as meant for faith, the "matter" is alone of importance.
   But, on the other hand, it cannot rid itself of the prejudice that
   every single text contains a Divine and absolute direction, a
   "revelation." Protestant Churches have in this respect not gone one
   step beyond Augustine; Luther himself, if we compare his "prefaces" to
   the New Testament, e.g., with his position in the controversy about the
   Lord's Supper, was involved in the same inconsistency as burdened
   Augustine's doctrinal structure.

   3. Augustine brought the practical element to the front more than any
   previous Church Father. Religion was only given to produce faith, love,
   and hope, and blessedness itself was bound up in these virtues bestowed
   by God, or in love. But the act of reform, which found expression in
   the subordination of all materials to the above intention, was not
   carried out by him unalloyed. In retaining the old Catholic scheme,
   knowledge and eternal life (aphtharsia) remained the supreme thoughts;
   in pursuing Neoplatonic mysticism, he did not cast off the acosmic view
   that regarded all phenomena as transient, and all that was transient as
   figurative, retaining finally only the majesty of the concealed Deity;
   in despising the present life, he necessarily also depreciated faith
   and all that belonged to the present. Thus, his theology was not
   decided, even in its final aims, by one thought, and he was therefore
   unable really to carry out his doctrine of grace and sin in a pure
   form. As the intellectualism of antiquity, of course in a sublimated
   form, was not wholly superseded by him, his profoundest religious
   utterances were accompanied by, or entwined with, philosophical
   considerations. Often one and the same principle has a double root, a
   Neoplatonic and a Christian (Pauline), and accordingly a double
   meaning, a cosmological and a religious. Philosophy, saving faith, and
   Church tradition, disputed the leading place in his system of faith,
   and since Biblicism was added to these three elements, the unity of his
   type of thought was everywhere disturbed.

   4. But apart from the intention, the execution contains not only
   inconsistencies in detail, but opposite views. In his conflict with
   Manichæism and Donatism, Augustine sketched a doctrine of freedom, the
   Church, and the means of grace, which has little in common with his
   experience of sin and grace, and simply conflicts with the theological
   development of that experience--the doctrine of predestinating grace.
   We can positively sketch two Augustinian theologies, one
   ecclesiastical, the other a doctrine of grace, and state the whole
   system in either.

   5. But even in his ecclesiastical system and his doctrine of grace,
   conflicting lines of thought meet; for in the former a hierarchical and
   sacramental fundamental element conflicts with a liberal, universalist
   view inherited from the Apologists; and in the doctrine of grace two
   different conceptions are manifestly combined, namely, the thought of
   grace through (per, propter) Christ, and that of grace emanating,
   independently of Christ, from the essential nature of God as the
   supreme good and supreme being (summum bonum, summum esse). The latter
   inconsistency was of greatest importance for Augustine's own theology,
   and for the attitude of Western theology after him. The West,
   confessedly, never thoroughly appropriated the uncompromising Eastern
   scheme of Christology as a statement of saving faith. But by Augustine
   the relation of the doctrine of the two natures (or the Incarnation) to
   that of salvation was still further loosened. It will be shown that he
   really prepared the way much more strongly for the Franciscan feeling
   towards Christ than for Anselm's satisfaction theory, and that, in
   general, as a Christologian--in the strict sense of the term--he
   bequeathed more gaps than positive material to posterity. But in
   addition to this antithesis of a grace through Christ and without
   Christ, we have, finally, in Augustine's doctrine of sin a strong
   Manichæan and Gnostic element; for Augustine never wholly surmounted
   Manichæism.

   From our exposition up to this point--and only the most important facts
   have been mentioned--it follows that we cannot speak of Augustine
   having a system, nor did he compose any work which can be compared to
   Origen's peri archon. Since he did not, like the latter, boldly
   proclaim the right of an esoteric Christianity, but rather as Christian
   and churchman constantly delayed taking this liberating step, [160]
   everything with him stands on one level, and therefore is involved in
   conflict. [161] But it is "not what one knows and says that decides,
   but what one loves"; he loved God, and his Church, and he was true.
   This attitude is conspicuous in all his writings, whether it is the
   Neoplatonist, the earlier Manichæan, the Pauline Christian, the
   Catholic Bishop, or the Biblicist, that speaks, and it lends to all his
   expositions a unity, which, though it cannot be demonstrated in the
   doctrines, can be plainly felt. Therefore, also, the different
   movements that started or learned from him, were always conscious of
   the complete man, and drew strength from him. He would not have been
   the teacher of the future if he had not stood before it as a Christian
   personality who lent force and weight to every word, no matter in what
   direction it led. As preacher of faith, love, and the dispensation of
   grace, he has dominated Catholic piety up to the present day. By his
   fundamental sentiment: "Mihi adhærere deo bonum est," as also by his
   distinction between law and gospel, letter and spirit, and his
   preaching that God creates faith and a good will in us, he called forth
   the evangelical Reformation. [162] By his doctrine of the authority and
   means of grace of the Church, he carried forward the construction of
   Roman Catholicism; nay, he first created the hierarchical and
   sacramental institution. By his Biblicism he prepared the way for the
   so-called pre-reformation movements, and the criticism of all
   extra-Biblical ecclesiastical traditions. By the force of his
   speculation, the acuteness of his intellect, the subtlety of his
   observation and experience, he incited, nay, partly created,
   scholasticism in all its branches, including the Nominalistic, and
   therefore also the modern theory of knowledge and psychology. By his
   Neoplatonism and enthusiasm for predestination he evoked the mysticism
   as well as the anti-clerical opposition of the Middle Ages. [163] By
   the form of his ideal of the Church and of felicity, he strengthened
   the popular Catholic, the monachist, state of feeling, domesticating
   it, moreover, in the Church, and thereby rousing and capacitating it to
   overcome and dominate the world as contrasted with the Church. Finally,
   by his unique power of portraying himself, of expressing the wealth of
   his genius, and giving every word an individual impress, by his gift of
   individualising and self-observation, he contributed to the rise of the
   Renaissance and the modern spirit.

   These are not capricious combinations, but historical facts: [164] the
   connecting lines that lead back to him, can everywhere be clearly
   demonstrated. But where, then, in the history of the West is there a
   man to be compared to him? Without taking much to do with
   affairs--Augustine was Bishop of a second-rate city, and possessed
   neither liking nor talent for the rôle of an ecclesiastical leader or
   practical reformer--by the force of his ideas he influenced men, and
   made his life permeate the centuries that followed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It has been attempted to depict Augustine's significance as Church
   teacher, by dividing absolutely the various directions in which his
   thought moved, and by giving separate accounts of the Neoplatonist, the
   Paulinist, the earlier Manichæan, and the Catholic Bishop. [165] But it
   is to be feared that violence is done him by such an analysis. It is
   safer and more appropriate, within the limits of a history of dogma, to
   keep to the external unity which he has himself given to his
   conceptions. In that case his Enchiridion ad Laurentium, his matured
   exposition of the Symbol, presents itself as our best guide. This
   writing we mean to bring forward at the close of the present chapter,
   after preliminary questions have been discussed which were of supreme
   importance to Augustine, and the controversies have been reviewed in
   which his genius was matured. We shall, in this way, obtain the
   clearest view of what Augustine achieved for the Church of his time,
   and of the revolution he evoked. It is a very attractive task to
   centralise Augustinian theology, but it is safer to rest content with
   the modest result of becoming acquainted with it, in so far as it
   exerted its influence on the Church. One difficulty meets us at the
   very outset which can not be removed, and went on increasing in after
   times. What portion of Augustine's countless expositions constituted
   dogma in his own eyes, or became dogma at a later period? While he
   extended dogma to an extraordinary extent, he at the same time
   sometimes relaxed, sometimes--as regards ancient
   tradition--specifically stiffened, the notion to be held of it. The
   question as to the extent of dogmas was neither answered, nor ever put
   precisely, in the West, after the Donatist and Pelagian controversies.
   In other words, no necessity was felt for setting up similarly express
   positive statements in addition to the express refutations of
   Pelagians, Donatists, etc. But the necessity was not felt, because
   Churchmen possessed neither self-confidence nor courage to take
   ecclesiastical action on a grand scale. They always felt they were
   Epigones of a past time which had created the professedly adequate
   tradition. This feeling, which was still further accentuated in the
   Middle Ages, was gradually overcome by the Popes, though solely by
   them. Apart from a few exceptions, it was not till the Council of Trent
   that dogmas were again formed. Till then the only dogmas were the
   doctrines contained in the Symbols. Next these stood the catalogues of
   heretics, from which dogmas could be indirectly deduced. This state of
   matters induces us to present the doctrine of Augustine as fully as
   possible, consistently with the design of a text-book. Many things must
   here be brought forward from his works which bore no fruit in his own
   time, but had a powerful influence on the course of doctrinal
   development in the following centuries, and came to light in the dogmas
   of Trent. [166]

   In what follows we shall proceed (1) to describe Augustine's
   fundamental view, his doctrines of the first and last things; [167] for
   they were fixed when he became a Catholic Christian; (2) and (3) we
   then describe his controversies with Donatists and Pelagians, in which
   his conception of faith was deepened and unfolded; and (4) we expound
   his system of doctrine by the help of the Enchiridion ad Laurentium.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [149] The foundation of Augustine's religious characteristics can be
   best studied in the writings that are read least, namely in the
   tractates and letters written immediately after his conversion, and
   forming an extremely necessary supplement to his Confessions (see
   above, p. 92, note 2). In these writings he is not yet at all
   interested in Church dogmatics, but is wholly absorbed in the task of
   making clear to himself, while settling with Neoplatonism, the new
   stage of religious philosophical reflection and inner experience, in
   which he finally found rest (see De vita beata, Adv. Academ.,
   Soliloquia, De ordine, and the Epistles to Nebridius). The state of
   feeling expressed by him in these work, never left him; but it was only
   in a later period that he gave it its dogmatic sub-structure. In
   consequence of this, as is proved even by the Confessions and also the
   Retractations, he himself lost the power of rightly estimating those
   writings and the inner state in which he had found himself in the first
   years after his conversion. But he never lost the underlying tone of
   those first fruits of his authorship: "Rest in the possession of God,"
   as distinguished from the unrest and unhappiness of a seeking and
   inquiry that never reach their aim, or the essentially Neoplatonic
   version of the loftiest problems (see e.g., De ordine II., 11 ff.,
   "mala in ordinem redacta faciunt decorem universi"; the same view of
   evil is still given in De civit., XI., 18). Those writings cannot be
   more fully discussed in a history of dogma.

   [150] "Secundum id, quod unigenitus est, non habet fratres; secundum id
   autem quod primogenitus est, fratres vocare dignatus est omnes qui post
   ejus et per ejus primatum in dei gratiam renascuntur per adoptionem
   filiorum." "Parva erat pro nobis domini nostri humilitas in nascendo;
   accessit etiam ut mori pro mortalibus dignaretur." "Divinarum
   scripturarum tractatores spiritum sanctum donum dei esse prædicant, ut
   deum credamus non se ipso inferius donum dare." "Eo quod quisque novit
   non fruitur, nisi et id diligat . . . neque quisquam in eo quod
   percipit permanet nisi dilectione."

   [151] He undoubtedly noticed, and with his love of truth frankly said,
   that the Church writers gave throughout an insufficient statement of
   the grace of God; but he contented himself with the plea that the
   Church had always duly emphasised grace in its prayers and
   institutions. See prædest. sanct., 27: "Quid opus est, ut eorum
   scrutemur opuscula, qui prius quam ista hæresis (Pelagianorum)
   oriretur, non habuerunt necessitatem in hac difficili ad solvendum
   quæstione versari? quod procul dubio facerent, si respondere talibus
   cogerentur. Unde factum est, ut de gratia dei quid sentirent, breviter
   quibusdam scriptorum suorum locis et transeunter adtingerent,
   immorarentur vero in eis, quæ adversus inimicos ecclesiæ disputabant,
   et in exhortationibus ad quasque virtutes, quibus deo vivo et vero pro
   adipiscenda vita æterna et vera felicitate servitur. Frequentationibus
   autem orationum simpliciter apparebat dei gratia quid valeret; non enim
   poscerentur de deo quæ præcipit fieri, nisi ab illo donaretur ut
   fierent." He himself had indeed learned from experience in his struggle
   with the Manichæans, that the defence of truth has to be regulated by
   the nature of the attack. When he was twitted by his opponents with
   what he had formerly written about freewill against the Manichæans, he
   appealed to the claims of advancing knowledge, as well as to the duty
   of offering resistance both to right and left. He thus saw in the
   earlier Church teachers the defenders of the truth of the Church
   against fatalism, Gnosticisim, and Manichæism, and from this standpoint
   explained their attitude.

   [152] It is self-evident that for this reason dogma, i.e., the old
   Catholic doctrine of the Trinity and Christology, necessarily became
   less impressive. Reuter's objection (l.c. p. 495) rests on an
   incomprehensible misunderstanding.

   [153] See on this and on what follows, Vol. III., pp. 203 ff., 207 ff.

   [154] The attempts to define their relationship, e.g., in Book I. of
   the treatise De doctrina Christiana, are wholly vague, and indeed
   scarcely comprehensible. The "substance" of Scripture is to form the
   propositions of the Rule of Faith; but yet every sentence of Scripture
   is an article of faith.

   [155] After his conversion Augustine was firmly of opinion that nothing
   stood in Scripture that contradicted the doctrine of the Church; he was
   not so certain that the interpretation of Scripture must follow the
   authority of tradition. Yet what a profusion of "dangerous" ideas would
   have been evolved from the Bible by his rich and acute genius if once
   he had freed his intellect from the fetters of obedience! The
   perception that no less than everything would have been doubtful, that
   a thousand contradictions would have taken the place of a unanimous
   doctrine, certainly helped in determining him not to shake the bars of
   his prison. He felt he would never be able to escape, but would be
   buried by the ruins of the collapsing edifice. Hence the principle
   declared in De nat. et grat. 22, that we must first submit to what
   stands in Scripture, and only then ask "quomodo id fieri potuerit."
   What a difference from Origen!

   [156] See Vol. II., 331, n. 3.

   [157] De doctr. Christ. I., 34: an extremely noteworthy exposition,
   which, so far as I know, has very few clear parallels in Augustine's
   works, but forms the background of his development.

   [158] See the details in "De doctr. Christiana" copied in Vol. III., p.
   203, n. 2, of this work.

   [159] De doctr. Christ., 35-40, especially c. 39, "Therefore a man who
   depends on faith, hope, and love, and holds by them invincibly, only
   needs Scripture to instruct others." Scripture even only offers
   patchwork; but a man may rise to such perfection even in this life as
   no longer to require the patchwork.

   [160] Tendencies in this direction are found everywhere; but they were
   never more than tendencies.

   [161] It is one of Reuter's chief merits that he has proved the
   impossibility of constructing a system from Augustine's thought, and of
   removing the inconsistencies that occur in it.

   [162] See the testimonies to Augustine of the Reformers and their
   confessional writings; yet the difference that still existed was not
   unknown to them.

   [163] Even the Anti-Gregorian party in the Middle Ages frequently
   appealed to Augustine. It was possible to find in him welcome
   statements as to the meaning of the Empire, the possibility of
   correcting Councils, and, generally, anti-hierarchical passages.

   [164] Compare Reuter, Studie VII.

   [165] It is unmistakable that there are three planes in Augustine's
   theological thoughts, Neoplatonic mysticism (without means of grace,
   without the Church, nay, in a sense, even without Christ),
   Christological soteriology, and the plane of the authority and
   sacraments of the Church. Besides these, rationalistic and Manichæan
   elements have to be taken into account.

   [166] Reuter also recognises (p. 495 f., note) that Augustine held the
   contents of the Symbol alone to be dogma. But we have here to remember
   that the most elaborate doctrine of the Trinity and Christology were
   evolved from the Symbol, and that its words "sancta ecclesia" and
   "remissio peccatorum" contained theories from which equally
   far-reaching dogmas could be formed, or heretics be convicted. Even
   Cyprian refuted the Novatians from the Symbol, and Augustine used it
   against the Pelagians. A peculiar difficulty in the way of discussing
   Augustine in the history of dogma consists further in the fact that he
   created countless theological schemes, but no dogmatic formulas. He was
   too copious, too earnest, and too sincere to publish catch-words.

   [167] Augustine was the first dogmatist to feel the need of considering
   for himself the questions, which we are now accustomed to treat in the
   "prolegomena to dogmatics." The Alexandrians undoubtedly attempted this
   also; but in their case formal and material, original and derived, were
   too much intertwined. Nor did they advance to the last problems of
   psychology and the theory of perception. Enchir., 4: "Quid primum, quid
   ultimum, teneatur, quæ totius definitionis summa sit, quod certum
   propriumque fidei catholicæ fundamentum." (Questions by Laurentius.)

   1. Augustine's Doctrines of the First and Last Things. [168]

   It has been said of Fiesole that he prayed his pictures on to the
   walls. It can be maintained of Augustine that his most profound
   thoughts regarding the first and the last things arose out of prayers;
   for all these matters were contained for him in God. If the same can be
   said of innumerable mystics down to the private communities of Madame
   de Guyon and Tersteegen, it is true of them because they were
   Augustine's disciples. But more than anyone else he possessed the
   faculty of combining speculation about God with a contemplation of mind
   and soul which was not content with a few traditional categories, but
   analysed the states of feeling and the contents of consciousness. Every
   advance in this analysis became for him at the same time an advance in
   the knowledge of God, and vice versâ; concentration of his whole being
   in prayer led him to the most abstract observation, and this, in turn,
   changed to prayer. No philosopher before or after him has verified in
   so conspicuous a fashion the profound saying that "the fear of the Lord
   is the beginning of wisdom." Godliness was the very atmosphere of his
   thought and life. "Piety is the wisdom of man" (Hominis sapientia
   pietas est, Enchir., 2; De civ. dei XIV., 28). Thus Augustine was the
   psychological, because he was the theological, genius of the Patristic
   period. [169] Not unversed in the domains of objective secular
   knowledge, he yet discarded them more resolutely than his Neoplatonic
   teachers, to whom he owed much, but whom he far surpassed. "The
   contents of the inner life lay clearly before Augustine's eyes as a
   realm of distinctive objects of perception, outside and independent of
   sense experience, and he was convinced by his own rich insight that in
   this sphere quite as genuine knowledge and information, based on inner
   experience, were to be gained, as by external observation in
   surrounding nature." Augustine brought to an end the development of
   ancient philosophy by completing the process which led from the naïve
   objective to the subjective objective. [170] He found what had been
   long sought for: the making of the inner life the starting-point of
   reflection on the world. [171] And he did not give himself up to empty
   dreams, but investigated with a truly "physiological psychology" all
   conditions of the inner life, from its elementary processes up to the
   most sublime moods; he became, because he was the counterpart of
   Aristotle, the true Aristotle of a new science, [172] which seems
   indeed to have forgotten that as a theory of perception, and as inner
   observation, it originated in the monotheistic faith and life of
   prayer. He disposed of all that we call the ancient classical temper,
   the classical conception of life and the world. With the last remains
   of its cheerfulness and naïve objectivity, he buried for a long time
   the old truth itself, and showed the way to a new truth of things. But
   this was born in him amid pains, and it has kept its feature of
   painfulness. Mohammed, the barbarian, smote into ruins, in the name of
   Allah, who had mastered him, the Hellenistic world which he did not
   know. Augustine, the disciple of the Hellenes, completed in the West
   the long prepared dissolution of this world, in the name of God, whom
   he had perceived to be the only reality; [173] but he built up a new
   world in his own heart and mind. [174] However, nothing really perished
   entirely, because everything was accomplished by a protracted
   transformation, and, besides, the old Hellenistic world continued in
   part to exist on the North-East coast of the Mediterranean. It was
   possible to travel back along the line which had been traced by a
   millennium down to Augustine, and the positive capital, which
   Neoplatonism and Augustine had received from the past and had changed
   into negative values, could also be re-established with a positive
   force. But something had undoubtedly been lost; we find it surviving in
   almost none but those who were ignorant of theology and philosophy; we
   do not find it among thinkers; and that is frank joy in the phenomenal
   world, in its obvious meaning, and in calm and energetic work. [175] If
   it were possible to unite in science and in the disposition, the piety,
   spirituality, and introspection of Augustine, with the openness to the
   world, the restful and energetic activity, and unclouded cheerfulness
   of antiquity, we should have reached the highest level! We are told
   that such a combination is a phantom, that it is an absurd idea. But do
   we not honour the great minds, who have been granted us since Luther,
   simply because they have endeavoured to realise the "fancy picture"?
   Did not Goethe declare this to be his ideal, and endeavour to present
   it in his own life, in his closing epoch? Is it not in the same ideal
   that the meaning of evangelical and reforming Christianity is
   contained, if it is really different from Catholicism?

   "I desire to know God and the soul. Nothing more? Nothing at all."
   [176] In these words Augustine has briefly formulated the aim of his
   spiritual life. That was the truth [177] for which "the marrow of his
   soul sighed." All truth was contained for him in the perception of God.
   After a brief period of sore doubting, he was firm as a rock in the
   conviction that there was a God, and that he was the supreme good
   (summum bonum); [178] [179] but who he was, and how he was to be found,
   were to him the great questions. He was first snatched from the night
   of uncertainty by Neoplatonism: the Manichæan notion of God had proved
   itself to be false, since its God was not absolute and omnipotent.
   Neoplatonism had shown him a way by which to escape the flux of
   phenomena, and the mysterious and harassing play of the transient, to
   reach the fixed resting-point he sought, and to discover this in the
   absolute and spiritual God (Confess. VI I., 26: "incorporea veritas").
   Augustine traversed this ascending path from the corporeal world
   through ever higher and more permanent spheres, and he also experienced
   the ecstatic mood in the "excess" of feeling. [180] But at the same
   time he turned more energetically to those observations for which the
   Neoplatonists had only been able to give him hints--to his spiritual
   experience, and psychological analysis. He was saved from scepticism by
   perceiving that even if the whole of external experience was subject to
   doubt, the facts of the inner life remained and demanded an explanation
   leading to certainty. There is no evil, but we are afraid, and this
   fear is certainly an evil. [181] There is no visible object of faith,
   but we see faith in us. [182] Thus--in his theory of perception--God
   and the soul entered into the closest union, and this union confirmed
   him in his belief in their metaphysical connection. Henceforth the
   investigation of the life of the soul was to him a theological
   necessity. No examination seemed to him to be indifferent; he sought to
   obtain divine knowledge from every quarter. The command to "know
   thyself" (Gnothi seauton) became for him the way to God. We cannot here
   discuss the wealth of psychological discoveries made by him. [183] But
   he only entered his proper element when he was inquiring into the
   practical side of spiritual life. The popular conception, beyond which
   even philosophers had not advanced far, was that man was a rational
   being who was hampered by sensuousness, but possessed a free will
   capable at every moment of choosing the good--a very external,
   dualistic view. Augustine observed the actual man. He found that the
   typical characteristic of the life of the soul consisted in the effort
   to obtain pleasure [184] (cupido, amor); from this type no one could
   depart. It was identical with the striving to get possessions,
   enjoyment. As the attempt to attain the pleasant it was desire
   (libido), cupiditas, and was perfected in joy; as resistance to the
   unpleasant, it was anger (ira), fear (timor), and was completed in
   sadness (tristitia). All impulses were only evolutions of this typical
   characteristic; sometimes they partook more of the form of passive
   impression, sometimes they were more of an active nature, and they were
   quite as true of the spiritual as of the sensuous life. [185]

   According to Augustine, the will is most closely connected with this
   life of impulse, so that impulses can indeed be conceived as contents
   of the will, yet it is to be distinguished from them. For the will is
   not bound to the nexus of nature; it is a force existing above sensuous
   nature. [186] It is free, in so far as it possesses formally the
   capacity of following or resisting the various inclinations; but
   concretely it is never free; that never free choice (liberum
   arbitrium), but is always conditioned by the chain of existing
   inclinations, which form its motives and determine it. The theoretical
   freedom of choice therefore only becomes actual freedom when desire
   (cupiditas, amor) of good has become the ruling motive of the will; in
   other words, it is only true of a good will that it is free: freedom of
   will and moral goodness coincide. But it follows just from this that
   the will truly free possesses its liberty not in caprice, but in being
   bound to the motive which impels to goodness ("beata necessitas boni").
   This bondage is freedom, because it delivers the will from the rule of
   the impulses (to lower forms of good), and realises the destiny and
   design of man to possess himself of true being and life. In bondage to
   goodness the higher appetite (appetitus), the genuine impulse of
   self-preservation, realises itself, while by satisfaction "in
   dissipation" it brings man "bit by bit to ruin." It does not follow,
   however, from Augustine's assertion of the incapacity for good of the
   individual spontaneous will, that the evil will, because it is not
   free, is also irresponsible; for since the will is credited with the
   power of yielding to the love of good (amor boni), it is guilty of the
   neglect (the defect).

   From this point Augustine, combining the results of Neoplatonic
   cosmological speculation with the above analysis, now built up his
   metaphysic, or more correctly, his theology. But since in the epoch in
   which he pursued these observations, he turned to the asceticism of
   Catholic monachism, and also studied profoundly the Psalms (and the
   Pauline epistles), the simple grandeur of his living notion of God
   exerted a tremendous influence on his speculations, and condensed the
   different, and in part artificially obtained, elements of his doctrine
   of God, [187] again and again into the supremely simple confession:
   "The Lord of heaven and earth is love; He is my salvation; of whom
   should I be afraid?"

   By the Neoplatonic speculation of the ascent [of the soul] Augustine
   reached the supreme unchangeable, permanent Being, [188] the
   incorporeal truth, spiritual substance, incommutable and true eternity
   of truth, the light incommutable [189] (incorporea veritas, spiritalis
   substantia, incommutabilis et vera veritatis æternitas, the lux
   incommutabilis). Starting with this, everything which was not God,
   including his own soul, was examined by Augustine from two points of
   view. On the one hand, it appeared as the absolutely transient,
   therefore as non-existent; for no true being exists, where there is
   also not-being; therefore God exists alone (God the only substance). On
   the other hand, as far as it possessed a relative existence, it seemed
   good, very good, as an evolution of the divine being (the many as the
   embodiment, emanating, and ever-returning, of the one). Augustine never
   tires of realising the beauty (pulchrum) and fitness (aptum) of
   creation, of regarding the universe as an ordered work of art, in which
   the gradations are as admirable as the contrasts. The individual and
   evil are lost to view in the notion of beauty; nay, God himself is the
   eternal, the old and new, the only, beauty. Even hell, the damnation of
   sinners, is, as an act in the ordination of evils (ordinatio malorum),
   an indispensable part of the work of art. [190] But, indeed, the whole
   work of art is after all--nothing; a likeness, but ah! only a likeness
   of the infinite fulness of the one which alone exists. How deeply in
   earnest Augustine was with this acosmic Pantheism, which threatened to
   degenerate into cosmic Monism, how he never wholly abandoned it, is
   shown even by the expression "pulchritudo" (beauty) for God, [191] by
   his doctrine of predestination, which has one of its roots here, and,
   finally, by the aesthetic optimism of his view of the world which comes
   out here and there even in his latest writings, [192] and by his
   uncertainty as to the notion of creation. [193] But the very fact that,
   as a rule, Augustine was governed by a wholly different temper is a
   guarantee that the element here obtained was only a grounding to which
   he applied new colours. He would not have been the reformer of
   Christian piety if he had only celebrated, albeit in the most seductive
   tones, [194] that Neoplatonic notion of God, which, indeed, ultimately
   rested on a pious natural sentiment.

   The new elements resulted first from the psychological analysis briefly
   indicated above. He found in man, as the fundamental form of existence,
   the desire to reach happiness, goods, being, and he could harmonise
   this desire excellently with his Neoplatonic doctrine. He farther found
   the desire to obtain an ever higher happiness, and ever loftier forms
   of good, an inexhaustible and noble longing, and this discovery also
   agreed with the doctrine. Unrest, hunger and thirst for God, horror and
   disgust at the enjoyment of lower kinds of good, were not to be
   stifled; for the soul, so far as it exists, comes certainly from God,
   and belongs to Him (ex deo and ad deum). But now he discovered a
   dreadful fact: the will, as a matter of fact, would not what it would,
   or at least seemed to will. No, it was no seeming; it was the most
   dreadful of paradoxes; we will to come to God, and we cannot, i.e., we
   will not. [195] Augustine felt this state along with the whole weight
   of responsibility; that responsibility was never lessened for him by
   the view that the will in not seeking God was seeking nothing, that it
   therefore by self-will was properly "annulling itself until it no
   longer existed." Nor was it mitigated for him by the correlative
   consideration, that the individual will, ruled by its desire, was not
   free. Rather, from the dread sense of responsibility, God appeared as
   the good, and the self-seeking life of impulse, which determined the
   will and gave its motive, constituted evil. The "summum bonum" now
   first obtained its deeper meaning--it was no longer merely the
   permanent resting point for disturbed thinkers, or the exhilarating
   enjoyment of life for jaded mortals: it now meant that which ought to
   be, [196] that which should be the fundamental motive ruling the will,
   should give the will its liberty, and therewith for the first time its
   power over the sphere of the natural, freeing the inexhaustible longing
   of man for the good from the dire necessity of sinning (misera
   necessitas peccandi), and accordingly first making that innate longing
   effectual. In a word, it now meant the good. And thus the notion of the
   good itself was divested of all accretions from the intellect, and all
   eudaimonist husks and wrappings. In this contemplation that overpowered
   him, the sole object was the good will, the moral imperative vitalised,
   to renounce selfish pleasure. But at the same time he acquired the
   experience which he himself could not analyse, which no thinker will
   undertake to analyse, that this good laid hold of him as love, and
   snatched him from the misery of the monstrous inconsistency of
   existence. [197] Thereby the notion of God received a wholly new
   content: the good which could do that was omnipotent. In the one act of
   liberation was given the identity of omnipotent being and the good, the
   summum on (supreme being) was holiness working on the will in the form
   of omnipotent love. This was what Augustine felt and described. A
   stream of divine conceptions was now set loose, partly given in the old
   language, but with a meaning felt for the first time, wonderfully
   combined with the statement of the philosophical knowledge of God, but
   regulating and transforming it. The Supreme Being (summum esse) is the
   Supreme Good; He is a person; the ontological defect of creaturely
   being becomes the moral defect of godlessness of will; evil is here as
   there negative; [198] but in the former case it is the negation of
   substance (privatio substantiæ), in the latter that of good (privatio
   boni), meaning the defect arising from freedom. The good indeed still
   remains the divine being as fulness of life; but for man it is summed
   up in the "common morality" which issues from the divine being and
   divine love. That is, he cannot appropriate it save in the will, which
   gladly forsakes its old nature, and loves that which dwells above all
   that is sensuous and selfish. Nothing is good except a good will: this
   principle was most closely combined by Augustine with the other:
   nothing is good but God; and love became for him the middle term. For
   the last and highest point reached in his knowledge was his combination
   of the thought that "all substance was from God" (omnis substantia a
   deo) with the other that "all good was" from God (omne bonum a deo).
   The conception of God as universal and sole worker, shaded into the
   other that God, just because he is God and source of all being, is also
   the only author and source of good in the form of self-imparting love.
   [199] It belongs just as essentially to God to be grace (gratia)
   imparting itself in love, as to be the uncaused cause of causes (causa
   causatrix non causata). If we express this anthropologically: goodness
   does not make man independent of God--that was the old conception--but
   in goodness the constant natural dependence of all his creatures on God
   finds expression as a willed dependence securing the existence of the
   creaturely spirit. The latter only exists in yielding himself, only
   lives in dying, is only free when he suffers himself to be entirely
   ruled by God, is only good if his will is God's will. These are the
   grand paradoxes with which he contrasted the "monstrous" paradoxes
   discussed above. But meanwhile there is no mistake that the
   metaphysical background everywhere shows in the ethical view; it is
   seen, first, in the ascetic trait which clings to the notion of the
   good in spite of its simple form (joy in God); secondly, in uncertainty
   as to the notion of love, into which an intellectual element still
   enters; thirdly, in the conception of grace (gratia), which appears not
   infrequently as the almost natural mode of the divine existence.

   The instruction how to hold communion with God displays still more
   clearly the interweaving of metaphysical and ethical views, that
   wonderful oscillation, hesitancy, and wavering between the intellectual
   and that which lives and is experienced in the depths of the soul.
   [200] On the one hand, it is required to enjoy God; nay, he is the only
   "thing" (res) which may be enjoyed, all else may only be used. But to
   enjoy means "to cling to anything by love for its own sake" (alicui rei
   amore inhærere propter se ipsam"). [201] God is steadfastly to be
   enjoyed--the Neoplatonists are reproached with not reaching this. [202]
   This enjoying is inseparably connected with the thought of God's
   "beauty," and in turn with the sense that he is all in all and
   indescribable. [203] But, on the other hand, Augustine thrust aside the
   thought that God was a substance (res) in the interest of a living
   communion with him. God was a person, and in the phrase "to cleave by
   love" ("amore inhærere") the emphasis falls in that case on the love
   (amor) which rests on faith (fides), and includes hope (spes). "God to
   be worshipped with faith, hope, and love ("Fide, spe, caritate colendum
   deum"). [204] Augustine was so strongly possessed by the feeling,
   never, indeed, clearly formulated, that God is a person whom we must
   trust and love, that this conviction was even a latent standard in his
   Trinitarian speculations. [205] Faith, hope, and love had, in that
   case, however, nothing further to do with "freedom" in the proper sense
   of the word. They were God's gifts, and constituted a spiritual
   relation to Him, from which sprang good resolves (bonum velle) and
   righteousness (justitia). But, indeed, whenever Augustine looked from
   this life to eternal life, the possession of faith, love, and hope
   assumed a temporary aspect. "But when the mind has been imbued with the
   commencement of faith which works by love, it aspires by a good life to
   reach the manifestation in which holy and perfect hearts perceive the
   ineffable beauty whose complete vision is the highest felicity. This is
   surely what thou requirest, what is to be esteemed the first and the
   last thing,' to begin with faith, to be perfected in sight" (Enchir. 5;
   see De doctr., II. 34 sq.). [206] Certain as it is that the Neoplatonic
   tendency comes out in this, it is as certain that we have more than a
   mere "remnant of mystical natural religion"; for the feeling that
   "presses upward and forward" from the faith in what is not seen, to the
   seeing of what is believed, is not only the innate germ of religion,
   but its enduring stimulus. [207] The idea of the world sketched from
   contemplation of the inner life and the sense of responsibility, which
   was combined with that of metaphysical cosmological speculation, led
   finally to a wholly different state of feeling from the latter. The
   optimism founded on aesthetics vanished before the "monstrum" of
   humanity which, infirm of will, [208] willed not and did not what at
   bottom it desired, and fell into the abyss of perdition. They are only
   a few who suffer themselves to be saved by grace. The mass is a massa
   perditionis, which death allures. "Woe is thee, thou torrent of human
   custom! Who shall stop thy course? How long will it be before thou art
   dried up? and whom wilt thou, O offspring of Eve, roll into the huge
   and hideous ocean, which even they scarcely overpass who have climbed
   the tree [the Church]?" [209] The misery of the earth is unspeakable;
   whatever moves and cherishes an independent life upon it is its own
   punishment; for he who decreed sins (the ordinator peccatorum) has
   ordained that every sin judges itself, that every unregulated spirit is
   its own punishment. [210]

   But from the beginning the historical Christian tradition penetrated
   with its influence the sequence of thoughts (on nature and grace),
   which the pious thinker had derived from his speculations on nature and
   his spiritual experience. Brought up from boyhood as a Catholic
   Christian, he has himself confessed that nothing ever satisfied him
   which did not bear the name of Christ. [211] The description of the
   years when he wandered in doubt is traversed as with a scarlet cord by
   the bond that united him with Christ. Without many words, indeed with a
   modest reserve, he recalls in the Confessions the relation to Christ
   that had never died out in him, until in VII. 24 f., he can emphasise
   it strongly. We cannot doubt that even those expositions of his which
   are apparently indifferent to the Church traditions of Christianity--on
   the living personal God, the distinction between God and the world, on
   God as Creator, on grace as the omnipotent principle--were already
   influenced by that tradition. And we must remember that his intense
   study of Paul and the Psalms began whenever, having broken with
   Manichæism, he had been convinced by Neoplatonism that God was a
   spiritual substance (spiritalis substantia). Even the expositions in
   the earliest writings which are apparently purely philosophical, were
   already dominated by the Christian conviction that God, the world, and
   the Ego were to be distinguished, and that room was to be made for the
   distinction in mystical speculation. Further, all attempts to break
   through the iron scheme of God's unchangeableness (in his active
   presence in the world) are to be explained from the impression made by
   Christian history upon Augustine.

   However, we cannot here take in hand to show how Christ and the Church
   gradually obtained a fixed fundamental position in his mode of thought.
   His reply to Laurentius in the Enchiridion, that "Christ is the sure
   and peculiar foundation of the Catholic faith," (certum propriumque
   fidei catholicæ fundamentum Christus est), would have been made in the
   same terms many years before, and, indeed, though his conceptions of
   Christ were then still uncertain, as early as about A.D. 387. [212]
   Christ, the way, strength, and authority, explained for him the
   significance of Christ. It is very noteworthy that in the Confessions
   VII., 24 sq., and other passages where he brings the Christian religion
   into the question as to the first and last things, he does not produce
   general theories about revelation, but at once gives the central place
   to Christ and the Church. [213] The two decisive principles on which he
   laid stress were that the Catholic Church alone introduces us into
   communion with Christ, and that it is only through communion with
   Christ that we participate in God's grace. That is, he is only certain
   of the speculative conception of the idea of the good, and its real
   activity as love when it is proclaimed authoritatively by the Church
   and supported by the conception of Christ.

   By the conception formed of Christ. Here a new element entered.
   Augustine supported, times without number, the old Western scheme of
   the twofold nature (utraque natura), the word and man one person
   (verbum et homo una persona)--(we may leave unnoticed the rare,
   inaccurate expressions "permixtio," "mixtura," e.g. Ep. 137, I11, 12),
   the form of God and form of a slave, and he contributed much to fortify
   this scheme in the West with its sharply defined division between what
   was done by the human, and what by the divine. But the unusual energy
   with which he rejected Apollinarianism--from his earliest to his latest
   writings--is enough to show that his deepest interest centred in the
   human soul of Jesus. The passages are extremely rare in which he adopts
   the same interpretation as Cyril of the confession: "the Word became
   flesh," and the doctrine of the deification of all human nature by the
   Incarnation is not represented, or, at any rate, only extremely
   doubtfully represented, by him. (Passages referring to it are not
   wholly awanting, but they arc extremely rare.) He rather explains the
   incarnation of the Word from another point of view, and accordingly,
   though he has points of contact with Origen, he describes it quite
   differently from the Greeks. Starting from the speculative
   consideration, to him a certainty, that it is always the whole Trinity
   that acts, and that its operation is absolutely invariable, the
   Incarnation was also a work of the whole Trinity. The Trinity produced
   the manifestation held to signify the Son (De trin. in many places).
   The Word (verbum) was not really more closely related than the whole
   Trinity to the Son. But since the Trinity could not act upon Jesus
   except as it always did, the uniqueness and power of the Person of
   Jesus Christ were to be derived from the receptiveness with which the
   man Jesus met the operatio divina; in other words, Augustine started
   from the human nature (soul) in his construction of the God-man. The
   human nature received the Word into its spirit; the human soul, because
   it acted as intermediary (medians), was also the centre of the God-man.
   Accordingly, the Word did not become flesh, if that be taken to mean
   that a transformation of any sort took place, but the divina operatio
   trinitatis could so work upon the human spirit of Jesus, that the Word
   was permanently attached to him, and was united with him to form one
   person. [214] This receptiveness of Jesus was, as in all other cases,
   caused by the election of grace; it was a gift of God (munus dei), an
   incomprehensible act of divine grace; nay, it was the same divine grace
   that forgives us our sins which led the man Jesus to form one person
   with the Word and made him sinless. The Incarnation thus appeared
   simply to be parallel to the grace which makes us willing who were
   unwilling, and is independent of every historical fact. [215]

   But it was not so meant. While, indeed, it is here again evident, that
   the conception of the divine grace in Christ was, at bottom,
   subordinate to predestinating grace, and that the latter was
   independent of the former, [216] yet Augustine by no means confined
   himself to dealing with the ultimate grounds of his conceptions. Rather
   the Incarnation benefited us; the salvation bestowed was dependent on
   it for us "who are his members" (qui sumus membra ejus). [217] But how
   far? Where Augustine speaks as a Churchman, he thinks of the
   sacraments, the powers of faith, forgiveness and love, which were the
   inheritance left the Church by the God-man (see under). But where he
   expresses the living Christian piety which actuated him, he had three
   wholly distinct conceptions by which he realised that Christ, the
   God-man, was the rock of his faith. [218] The Incarnation was the great
   proof of God's love towards us; [219] the humility of God and Christ
   attested in it breaks down our pride and teaches us that "all goodness
   is made perfect in humility" (omne bonum in humilitate perficitur); the
   truth which was eternal is made comprehensible to us in Christ: lying
   in the dust we can apprehend God who redeems us by revealing himself in
   our lowliness.

   Throughout all this we are met by the living impression of Christ's
   person, [220] and it is humility, which Paul also regarded as so
   important, that stands out as its clearest and most weighty attributes.
   [221] The type of humility exhibited in majesty--this it was that
   overpowered Augustine: pride was sin, and humility was the sphere and
   force of goodness. From this he learned and implanted in the Church the
   new disposition of reverence for humility. The new bias which he thus
   gave to Christology continued to exert its influence in the Middle
   Ages, and displayed itself in rays of varying brilliancy and strength;
   although, as a consequence of the Adoptian controversy, Greek
   Christology once more entered in force, from the ninth century, and
   hindered piety from expressing its knowledge clearly in dogma. We now
   understand also why Augustine attached such value to the human element
   (homo) in Christ. This was not merely due to a consequence of his
   theology (see above), but it was in a much higher degree the pious view
   of Christ that demanded this conception. He could not realise Christ's
   humility with certainty in the Incarnation; for the latter sprang from
   the universal working of God, predestinating grace, and Jesus'
   receptiveness; but humility was the constant "habit" of the
   divino-human personality. Thus the true nature of Jesus Christ was
   really known: "strength is made perfect in weakness" (robur in
   infirmitate perficitur). That lowliness, suffering, shame, misery, and
   death are means of sanctification; nay, that selfless and therefore
   ever suffering love is the only means of sanctification ("I sanctify
   myself for them"); that what is great and good always appears in a
   lowly state, and by the power of the contrast triumphs over pride; that
   humility alone has an eye wherewith to see the divine; that every
   feeling in the good is accompanied by the sense of being pardoned--that
   was the very core of Augustine's Christology. He, for his part, did not
   drag it into the region of æsthetics, or direct the imagination to busy
   itself with separate visions of lowliness. No, with him it still
   existed wholly on the clear height of ethical thought, of modest
   reverence for the purport of Christ's whole life, whose splendour had
   been realised in humility. "Reverence for that which is beneath us is a
   final stage which mankind could and had to reach. But what was involved
   not only in despising the earth and claiming a higher birthplace, but
   in recognising lowliness and poverty, ridicule and contempt, shame and
   misery, suffering and death as divine, nay, in revering sin and
   transgression not as hindrances, but as furtherances of
   sanctification." Augustine could have written these words; for no idea
   was more strongly marked in his view of Christ than that he had
   ennobled what we shrank from--shame, pain, sorrow, death--and had
   stripped of value what we desired--success, honour, enjoyment. "By
   abstinence he rendered contemptible all that we aimed at, and because
   of which we lived badly. By his suffering he disarmed what we fled
   from. No single sin can be committed if we do not desire what he
   despised, or shirk what he endured."

   But Augustine did not succeed in reducing this conception of the person
   of Christ to dogmatic formulas. Can we confine the sun's ray in a
   bucket? He held by the old formulas as forming an element of tradition
   and as expressing the uniqueness of Christ; but to him the true
   foundation of the Church was Christ, because he knew that the
   impression made by his character had broken down his own pride, and had
   given him the power to find God in lowliness and to apprehend him in
   humility. Thus the living Christ had become to him the truth [222] and
   the way to blessedness, and he who was preached by the Church his
   authority. [223]

   But what is the beatific fatherland, the blessed life, to which Christ
   is the way and the strength? We have already discussed it (p. 91 f.),
   and we need only here mention a few additional points.

   The blessed life is eternal peace, the constant contemplation of God in
   the other world. [224] Knowledge remains man's goal; even the notion of
   the enjoyment of God (fruitio dei), or that other of heavenly peace,
   does not certainly divert us from it. [225] Knowledge, is, however,
   contrasted with action, and the future state is wholly different from
   the present. From this it follows that Augustine retained the popular
   Catholic feeling that directed men in this life wholly to hope,
   asceticism, and the contemplation [of God] in worship, for though that
   can never be attained in this world which the future will bring, yet
   life here must be regulated by the state which will be enjoyed
   afterwards. Hence Augustine championed monachism and opposed Jovinian
   so decidedly; hence he regarded the world in the same light as the
   ancient Catholic Fathers; hence he valued as highly as they did the
   distinction between precepts and counsels; hence he never looked even
   on the highest blessings (munera dei) which we can here enjoy as
   containing the reality, but only a pledge and similitude; for set in
   the sphere of the transitory they were themselves transitory; hence,
   finally, he did not think of the earthly Church when seeking to realise
   the first and last things, for God alone, constantly seen and enjoyed,
   was the supreme blessing; and even the divine kingdom, so far as it was
   earthly, was transitory.

   But even here much that was new emerged in the form of undercurrents,
   and the old was modified in many respects, a few details being almost
   set aside. It is therefore easy to point to numerous dissonances in
   Augustine's idea of the goal; but he who does not criticise like an
   irresponsible critic or impartial logician will admit that he knows no
   more than Augustine, and that he also cannot do better than alternate
   between different points of view. Let us pick out the following points
   in detail.

   1. Augustine put an end to the doubt whether virtue was not perhaps the
   supreme good; he reduced virtues to dependance on God--to grace; see
   Ep. 155, 12 sq. [226] He, indeed, re-admitted the thought at a new and
   higher stage--merits called forth by grace, righteousness made perfect
   by love. But the mood at any rate is changed.

   2. Augustine did not follow the lead of the Greek Church: he did not
   cultivate systematic mysticism with a view to the future state, or
   regard and treat the cultus as a means by which to anticipate
   deification. He set aside the elements of physical magic in religious
   doctrine, and by this means spiritualised the ideas of the other world.
   The ascetic life of the churchman was to be spiritual and moral.
   Statements, indeed, are not wholly wanting in his works to the effect
   that eternal life can be experienced in ecstatic visions in this world;
   but he is thinking then especially of Biblical characters (Paul), and
   in the course of his Christian development he thrust the whole
   conception more and more into the background.

   3. Augustine's profound knowledge of the will, and his perception of
   the extent to which the latter swayed even knowledge, led to his
   discovery of the principle, that goodness and blessing, accordingly
   also final salvation, coincided in the dependance of the will on God.
   By this means he broke through intellectualism, and a superlative
   blessing was shown to exist even in this world. "It is a good thing for
   me to cleave to God." This "cleaving" is produced by the Holy Spirit,
   and he thereby imparts love and blessedness to the heart. [227] In
   presence of the realisation of this blessedness, the antithesis of time
   and eternity, life and death, disappears. [228]

   4. Starting from this, he arrived at a series of views which
   necessarily exerted a powerful influence on the popular frame of mind.

   (a) Of the three virtues, graces, by which man clings to God--faith,
   love, and hope--love continues to exist in eternity. Accordingly, love,
   unchanging and grateful, connects this world with the next.

   (b) Thereby, however, the quietism of knowledge is also modified.
   Seeing is to be nothing but loving; an element of adjustment of all
   discords in feeling and will is introduced into the notion of
   blessedness, and although "rational contemplation" (contemplatio
   rationalis) is always ranked above "rational action" (actio
   rationalis), a high value is always attached to practical and active
   love. [229]

   (c) A higher meaning was now given, not indeed to the earthly world,
   but to the earthly Church and its peculiar privileges (within it) in
   this world. The idea of the city of God on earth, formulated long
   before by others, was yet, as we shall see in the next section, first
   raised by Augustine into the sphere of religious thought. In front of
   the Holy of Holies, the first and last things, he beheld, as it were, a
   sanctuary, the Church on earth, with the blessings granted it by God.
   He saw that it was a self-rewarding task, nay, a sacred duty, to
   cherish this sanctuary, to establish it in the world, to rank it higher
   than worldly ties, and to devote to it all earthly goods, in order
   again to receive them from it as legitimate possessions. He thus,
   following, indeed, the impulses given by the Western tradition, also
   created, if we may use so bold a phrase, a religion of the second
   order. But this second-order religion, was not, as in the case of the
   Greeks, the formless creation of a superstitious cultus. It was on the
   contrary a doctrine which dealt with the Church in its relation to the
   world as an active and moral power transforming and governing society,
   as an organism, in which Christ was actively present, of the
   sacraments, of goodness and righteousness. Ecclesiasticism and theology
   were meant to be thoroughly united, the former serving the latter, the
   one like Martha, the other like Mary. [230] They ministered to the same
   object, and righteousness made perfect by love was the element in which
   both lived. [231]

   (d) While the ascetic life remained the ideal for the individual,
   Augustine modified the popular tendency also in monachism by never
   forgetting, with all his appreciation of external works (poverty,
   virginity, etc.), that faith, hope, and charity were alone of decisive
   importance, and that therefore the worth of the man who possessed these
   virtues might no longer be determined by his outward performances. He
   knew, besides, better than anyone else, that external works might be
   accomplished with a godless heart--not only by heretical monks, where
   this was self-evident, but also by Catholics, Ep., 78, 79, and, uniting
   ascetics as closely as possible to the Church, he urged them to engage
   in active work. Here, again, we see that he broke through the barren
   system which made blessedness consist in contemplatio rationalis and
   that alone.

   This is, in brief, Augustine's doctrine of the first and last things,
   together with indications that point to that sphere which belongs
   though not directly yet indirectly to those things, viz., the equipment
   and tasks of the Church in our present state. "Doctrine" of the first
   and last things is really an incorrect expression; for, and this is the
   supreme thing to be said in closing the subject, it was not to him a
   matter of "doctrine," but of the faithful reproduction of his
   experiences. The most thorough-going modification by Augustine of
   traditional dogmatic Christianity consisted in his perception "that
   Christianity is ultimately different from everything called doctrine'"
   (Reuter, p. 494). The law is doctrine; the gospel is power. The law
   produces enlightenment; the gospel peace. This Augustine clearly
   perceived, and thereby set religion in the sphere of a vital, spiritual
   experience, while he disassociated it from knowledge and inference. He
   once more, indeed, placed his newly-discovered truth on the plane of
   the old; for he was a Catholic Christian; but the connection with the
   past which belongs to every effective reformer need not prevent us from
   exhibiting his originality. Anyone who seeks to give effect to the
   "whole" Augustine and the "whole" Luther is suspected of seeking to
   evade the "true" Augustine and the "true" Luther; for what man's
   peculiarity and strength are fully expressed in the breadth of all he
   has said and done? One or two glorious passages from Augustine should
   show, in conclusion, that he divested the Christian religion of what is
   called "doctrine" or "dogma." "I possess nothing but will; I know
   nothing but that what is fleeting and transitory ought to be despised,
   and what is certain and eternal ought to be sought for. . . . If those
   who flee to thee find thee by faith, grant faith; if by virtue, grant
   virtue; if by knowledge, grant knowledge. Increase in me faith, hope,
   love." "But we say that man's will is divinely aided to do what is
   righteous, so that, besides his creation with free-will, and besides
   the doctrine by which he is taught how he should live, man receives the
   Holy Spirit in order that there may be created in his mind, even now
   when he still walks by faith, and not by appearance, the delight in and
   love of that supreme and unchangeable good which is God; in order that
   this pledge, as it were, having been given him of the free gift, a man
   may fervently long to cling to his Creator, and be inflamed with desire
   to enter into the participation of that true light, that he may receive
   good from him from whom he has his being. For if the way of truth be
   hidden, free-will is of no use except for sinning, and when that which
   ought to be done, or striven for, begins to reveal itself, nothing is
   done, or undertaken, and the good life is not lived, unless it delights
   and is loved. But that it may be loved, the love of God is diffused in
   our hearts, not by free choice emanating from ourselves, but by the
   Holy Spirit given unto us." "What the law of works commands by
   threatening, the law of faith effects by believing. This is the wisdom
   which is called piety, by which the father of lights is worshipped, by
   whom every excellence is given, and every gift made perfect. . . . By
   the law of works God says: Do what I command; by the law of faith we
   say to God: Grant what thou commandest. . . . We have not received the
   spirit of this world, says the most constant preacher of grace, but the
   spirit which is from God, that we may know what things have been
   granted us by God. But what is the spirit of this world but the spirit
   of pride? . . . Nor are they deceived by any other spirit, who, being
   ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own,
   are not subject to God's righteousness. Whence it seems to me that he
   is a son of faith who knows from whom he hopes to receive what he does
   not yet possess, rather than he who attributes to himself what he has.
   We conclude that a man is not justified by the letter, but by the
   spirit, not by the merits of his deeds, but by free grace." [232]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [168] Augustine taught that it was only possible to obtain a firm grasp
   of the highest questions by earnest and unwearied independent labour.
   Herein above all did his greatness consist.

   [169] Compare with what follows, Siebeck, in the Ztschr. f. Philos. and
   philos. Kritik, 1888, p. 170 ff.

   [170] See the Appendix on Neoplatonism, Vol. I., p. 336 ff.

   [171] The method of the Neoplatonists was still very uncertain, and
   this is connected, among other things, with their polytheism. It is
   easy to show that Augustine went so much further in psychology because
   he was a monotheist. So far as I know we are still, unfortunately,
   without any investigation of the importance of monotheism for
   psychology.

   [172] See the excellent parallel between them in Siebeck, l.c. p. 188
   f.: "Among the important personalities of Antiquity two could hardly be
   found with characters so different as Aristotle and Augustine. In the
   former we have the Greek, restful and clear, and yet moved by energetic
   warmth of thought, who gives its purest scientific expression to the
   Hellenic ideal of the life of the cultured, contentment with the even
   and constant advance of the life of the thinker, examining the depths
   and wants of the soul, only in so far as they appear on the surface, in
   the external nature and garb of the affections, and discussing this
   whole domain, not properly in order to know the heart, but only for
   rhetorical purposes. The internal world of the soul is here described
   and criticised only in so far as it evinces itself in reciprocal action
   with the external, and in the form it assumes as determined by the
   co-operation of the latter. For the comprehensive and final problem
   with Aristotle is the scientific construction and form of the external
   world in nature and social life. Augustine's tendency and frame of mind
   are quite the opposite. The external owes all its importance and value
   in his eyes to the form it assumes as reflected in the internal.
   Everything is dominated not by problems of nature and the State and
   secular ethics, but by those of the deepest wants of mind and heart, of
   love and faith, hope and conscience. The proper objects and the moving
   forces of his speculation are not found in the relation of inward to
   outward, but of inner to innermost, to the sense and vision of God in
   the heart. Even the powers of the intellect are looked at from a new
   point of view, owing to the influence exerted on them by the heart and
   will, and they lose, in consequence, their claim to sole supremacy in
   scientific thought. The cool analysis made by Aristotle of the external
   world, which also dissected and discriminated between the states of the
   soul, as if they were objects that existed externally, disappears in
   Augustine before the immediate experience and feeling of states and
   processes of the emotional life; but the fact that he presents them to
   us with the warmest personal interest in them, entirely prevents us
   from feeling the absence of the Aristotelian talent of acuteness in
   analytical dissection. While Aristotle avoids all personal and
   individual colouring in his views, and labours everywhere to let the
   matter in hand speak for itself, Augustine, even when bringing forward
   investigations of the most general purport, always speaks as if only of
   himself, the individual, to whom his personal feelings and sensations
   are the main thing. He is a priori certain that they must have a
   farther reaching meaning, since feeling and wishing are found to be
   similar potencies in every human heart. Questions of ethics, which
   Aristotle handles from the standpoint of the relation of man to man,
   appear in Augustine in the light of the relations between his own heart
   and that of this known and felt God. With the former the supreme
   decision is given by clear perception of the external by reason; with
   the latter, by the irresistible force of the internal, the conviction
   of feeling, which in his case--as is given in such perfection to
   few--is fused with the penetrating light of the intellect. . . .
   Aristotle knows the wants of the inner life only so far as they are
   capable of developing the life, supported by energetic effort and
   philosophic equanimity, in and with society. He seems to hold that
   clear thinking and restfully energetic activity prevent all suffering
   and misfortune to society or the individual. The deeper sources of
   dispeace, of pain of soul, of unfulfilled wants of the heart, remain
   dark in his investigation. Augustine's significance begins just where
   the problem is to trace the unrest of the believing or seeking soul to
   its roots, and to make sure of the inner facts in which the heart can
   reach its rest. Even the old problems which he reviews and examines in
   their whole extent and meaning from the standpoint of his rich
   scientific culture, now appear in a new light. Therefore he can grasp,
   and, at the same time, deepen everything which has come to him from
   Hellenism. For Aristotle, everything that the intellect can see and
   analyse in the inner and outer world constitutes a problem; for
   Augustine, that holds the chief place which the life of feeling and
   desire forces on him as a new fact added to his previous knowledge. In
   the one case it is the calm, theoretical mind; in the other, the
   conscience excited by the unrest caused by love of God and
   consciousness of sin, from which the questions spring. But along with
   this, scientific interest also turned to a wholly novel side of actual
   life. No wonder that the all-sufficiency of the dissecting and
   abstracting intellect had its despotism limited. The intellect was now
   no longer to create problems, but to receive them from the depths of
   the world of feeling, in order then to see what could be made of them.
   Nor was it to continue to feel supremacy over the will, but rather the
   influence to which it was subject from it. The main subject of its
   reflections was to consist, henceforth, not in the external world, nor
   in the internal discussed by means of analogy with, and the method of,
   the external, but in the kernel of personality, conscience in
   connection with emotion and will. Only from this point might it return,
   in order to learn to understand them anew, to previous views of the
   inner and outer life. Aristotle, the Greek, was only interested in the
   life of the soul, in so far as it turned outward and helped to fathom
   the world theoretically and practically; Augustine, the first modern
   man (the expression occurs also in Sell, Aus der Gesch. des
   Christenthums, 1888, p. 43; I had already used it years ago), only took
   it into consideration, in so far as reflection upon it enabled him to
   conceive the inner character of personal life as something really
   independent of the outer world." Aristotle and Augustine are the two
   rivals who contended in the science and tendency of the following
   centuries. Both, as a rule, were indeed degraded, Aristotle to empty
   distinctions and categories, and a hide-bound dogmatism, Augustine to a
   mysticism floating in all conceivable media, having lost the guidance
   of a sure observation of the inner nature. Even in the Pelagians
   Augustine energetically opposed Aristotelian rationalism, and his
   controversy with them was repeated over and over again in after ages.
   In the history of religion it was a fight between a really irreligious,
   theologically, labelled morality and religion; for even in its
   classical form, Aristotelianism is a morality without religion.

   [173] All Christian Hellenistic thinkers before Augustine were still
   refined polytheists, or, more correctly, the polytheistic element was
   not wholly eradicated in their case, seeing that they preserved a part
   of nature-religion. This is most evident among Origen's successors.

   [174]

   Weh! Weh!

   Du hast sie zerstört,

   Die schöne Welt,

   Mit mächtiger Faust;

   Sie stürzt, sie zerfällt!

   Ein Halbgott hat sie zerschlagen!

   Wir tragen

   Die Trümmer ins Nichts hinüber

   Und klagen

   Ueber die verlorene Schöne.

   Prächtiger baue sie wieder,

   In deinem Busen baue sie auf!

   [175] Compare even the state of feeling of Petrarch and the other
   Humanists.

   [176] Soliloq., I. 7. Deum et animam scire cupio. Nihilne plus? Nihil
   omnino. In the knowledge of God was also included that of the Cosmus,
   see Scipio, Metaphysik, p. 14 ff.

   [177] Playing with husks and shells disgusted Augustine; he longed for
   facts, for the knowledge of actual forces.

   [178] Augustine became a Manichæan because he did not get past the idea
   that the Catholic doctrine held God to be the originator of sin.

   [179] Confess., VII. 16: "Audivi (verba Ego sum qui sum) sicut auditur
   in corde, et non erat prorsus unde dubitarem; faciliusque dubitarem
   vivere me, quam non esse veritatem (VI., 5).

   [180] Suggestions in Confess., VII. 13-16, 23. Here is described the
   intellectual "exercise" of the observation of the mutabilia leading to
   the incommutabile. "Et pervenit cogitatio ad id quod est, in ictu
   trepidantis aspectus. Tunc vero invisibilia tua, per ea quæ facta sunt,
   intellecta conspexi (this now becomes his dominant saying); sed aciem
   figere non valui: et repercussa infirmitate redditus solitis, non mecum
   ferebam nisi amantem memoriam et quasi olfacta desiderantem (quite as
   in Plotinus) quæ comedere nondum possem," VIII. 1. But again in his
   famous dialogue (IX. 23-25), with his mother in Ostia, a regular
   Neoplatonic "exercise" is really described which ends with ecstasy
   (attigimus veritatem modice toto ictu cordis"). We afterwards meet
   extremely seldom with anything of the same kind in Augustine; on the
   other hand, the anti-Manichæan writings still show many echoes ("se
   rapere in deum," "rapi in deum," "volitare," "amplexus dei"). Reuter
   says rightly (p. 472) that these are unusual expressions, only
   occurring exceptionally. But he must have forgotten the passages in the
   Confessions when he adds that no instructions are given as to the
   method to be followed.

   [181] Confess., VII. 7: "Ubi ergo malum et unde et qua huc irrepsit?
   Quæ radix ejus et quo semen ejus? An omnino non est? Cur ergo timemus
   et cavemus quod non est? Aut si inaniter timemus, certe vel timor ipse
   malum est . . . et tanto gravius malum, quanto non est quod timeamus.
   Idcirco aut est malum quod timemus, aut hoc malum est quia timemus."

   [182] De trinit., XIII. 3: "Cum propterea credere jubeamur, quia id
   quod credere jubemur, videre non possumus, ipsam tamen fidem, quando
   inest in nobis, videmus in nobis."

   [183] As regards memory, association of ideas, synthetic activity of
   spontaneous thought, ideality of the categories, a priori functions,
   "determinant" numbers, synthesis of reproduction in the imagination,
   etc. Of course all this is only touched on by him; we have, as it were,
   merely flashes of it in his works; see Siebeck, 1.c. p. 179. He has
   applied his observations on self-consciousness in his speculation on
   the Trinity.

   [184] He meant by this the legitimate striving after self-assertion,
   after Being, which he attributed to all organic, nay, even to
   inorganic, things; see De civ. dei, XI., 28.

   [185] This is the most important advance in perception.

   [186] See Siebeck l.c. p. 181 f.; Hamma in the Tüb. Theol.
   Quartalschr., vol. 55, pp. 427 ff. 458; Kahl, Primat des Willens, p. 1
   f. Augustine's psychology of the will is undoubtedly rooted in
   indeterminism; but in his concrete observations he becomes a
   determinist.

   [187] They have all besides a practical object, i.e., they correspond
   to a definite form of the pious contemplation of the divine, and a
   definite relation to it (a definite self-criticism). For details of the
   theology, see Dorner, Augustin, pp. 5-112.

   [188] In Confess. VII. 16, he could now put the triumphant question:
   "Numquid nihil est veritas, quoniam neque per finita, neque per
   infinita locorum spatia diffusa est."

   [189] Not common light; "non hoc illa erat; sed aliud, aliud valde ab
   istis omnibus. Nec ita erat supra mentem meam sicut oleum super aquam,
   nec sicut coelum super terram, sed superior, quia ipsa fecit me, et ego
   inferior, quia factus sum ab ea. Qui novit veritatem novit eam, et qui
   novit eam, novit æternitatem. Caritas novit eam. O æterna veritas, et
   vera caritas, et cara æternitas! tu es deus meus; tibi suspiro die ac
   nocte." (Confess. VII. I6.) Further the magnificently reproduced
   reflection, IX. 23-25, De Trin. IV. 1. By being, Augustine did not
   understand a vacuous existence, but being full of life, and he never
   doubted that being was better than not-being. De civit. dei, XI. 26:
   "Et sumus et nos esse novimus et id esse ac nosse diligimus." The
   triad, "esse, scire, amare" was to him the supreme thing; he never
   thought of the possibility of glorifying not-being after the fashion of
   Buddhism or Schopenhauer.

   [190] We cannot here discuss Augustine's cosmology more fully (see the
   works by Gangauf and Scipio). His reflections on life and the gradation
   of organic and inorganic ("ordo, species, modus") were highly important
   to later philosophy and theology, and especially continued to exert an
   influence in mediæval mysticism. So also the view that evil and good
   are necessary elements in the artistic composition of the world
   continued to make its presence actively felt in the same quarter.
   Yet--as in Augustine--the idea of the privative significance of evil
   always preponderated.

   [191] This expression is frequent in all his writings. Even utterances
   like ";vita vitæ meæ," etc., have at first an acosmic meaning, but, of
   course, were given a deeper sense by Augustine.

   [192] Augustine never lost his optimistic joy in life in the sense of
   the true life, as is proved in his work, De civit. dei; but in
   contrasting the moods caused by contemplation of the world--æsthetic
   joy in the Cosmus, and sorrow over the world perverted by sin--the
   latter prevailed. Existence never became to Augustine a torment in
   itself, but that existence did which condemned itself to not-being,
   bringing about its own ruin.

   [193] Where Augustine put the question of creation in the form, "How is
   the unity of being related to plurality of manifestation?" the notion
   of creation is really always eliminated. But he never entirely gave up
   this way of putting the question; for, at bottom, things possess their
   independence only in their manifestation, while, in so far as they
   exist, they form the ground of knowledge for the existence of God. But
   besides this, Augustine still asserted vigorously the creatio ex nihilo
   ("omnes naturæ ex deo, non de deo," De nat. bon. c. Manich., I.). See
   note 4, p. 120.

   [194] He discovered these, and inspired hundreds of mystics after him.
   We have no right to deny that this contemplative view of being,
   not-being, and the harmony of being evolving itself in the phenomenal,
   is also a sphere of piety.

   [195] We have the most profound description of this state in Confess.
   VIII, 17-26; Augustine calls it a "monstrum" (monstrous phenomenon). He
   solves the problem disclosed, in so far as it is capable of solution,
   not by an appeal to the enslaved will, accordingly not by the "non
   possumus," but as an indeterminist by the reflection, "non ex toto
   volumus, non ergo ex toto [nobis] imperamus." (21), "I was afraid that
   Thou mightest soon hear me, and heal me of the sickness of lust, whose
   satisfaction I wished more than its eradication. . . . And I was
   deluded, therefore I put off following Thee alone from day to day,
   because I had not yet seen any certain aim for my striving. And now the
   day was at hand, and the voice of my conscience exhorted me: Didst thou
   not say thou wouldst not cast the vain burden from thee, only because
   the truth was still uncertain? Behold now thou art certain of the
   truth, but (thou wilt not).' . . . The way to union with God, and the
   attainment of the goal, coincide with the will to reach this goal,
   though, indeed, only with the determined and pure will. . . . And thus
   during this inner fever and irresoluteness I was wont to make many
   movements with my body, which can only be performed when the will makes
   definite resolves, and become impossible if the corresponding limbs are
   wanting, or are fettered, worn out, asleep, or hindered in any way. If,
   e.g., I tore a hair out, beat my brow, or embraced my knee with folded
   hands, I did it because I willed it. But I might have willed and not
   done it, if the power of motion in my limbs had forsaken me. So many
   things, then, I did in a sphere, where to will was not the same as to
   be able. And yet I did not that which both I longed incomparably more
   to do, and which I could do whenever I really earnestly willed it;
   because, as soon as I had willed it, I had really already made it mine
   in willing. For in these things the ability was one with the will, and
   really to resolve was to do. And yet, in my case, it was not done; and
   more readily did my body obey the weakest willing of my soul, in moving
   its limbs at its nod, than the soul obeyed itself where it was called
   upon to realise its great desire by a simple effort of the will. How is
   such a prodigy possible, and what is its reason? The soul commands the
   body, and it obeys instantly; the soul commands itself, and is
   resisted. The soul commands the hand to be moved, and it is done so
   promptly that command and performance can scarcely be distinguished;
   and yet the soul is spirit, but the hand is a member of the body. The
   soul commands the soul itself to an act of will; it is its own command,
   yet it does not carry it out. How is such a prodigy possible, and what
   is its reason? The soul commands an act of will, I say; its command
   consists simply in willing; and yet that command is not carried out.
   Sed non ex toto vult; non ergo ex toto imperat. Nam in tantum imperat,
   in quantum vult, et in tantum non fit quod imperat, in quantum non
   vult. Quoniam voluntas imperat ut sit voluntas, nec alia sed ipsa. Non
   itaque plena imperat ideo non est quod imperat. Nam si plena esset, nec
   imperaret ut esset, quia jam esset. Non igitur monstrum partim velle,
   partim nolle, sed ægritudo animi est, quia non totus assurgit, veritate
   sublevatus, consuetudine prægravatus. Et ideo sunt duæ voluntates, quia
   una earum tota non est, et hoc adest alteri quod deest alteri."

   [196] "What ought to be? How cannot the inner nature exhibit itself by
   reflection, but can by action?" (Scipio, Metaphysik des Aug., p. 7.)
   Augustine was the first to put this question clearly. "Antiquity
   conceived the whole of life, we might say, in a naïve fashion from the
   standpoint of science: the spiritual appeared as natural, and virtue as
   a natural force.

   [197] Augustine indeed could further explain why the form, in which the
   good takes possession of and delivers the soul, must consist in the
   infusion of love. So long as the soul along with its will is confronted
   by duty (an ought), and commands itself to obey, it has not completely
   appropriated the good; "nam si plena esset, nec imperaret ut esset,
   quia jam esset" (Confess. VIII. 21). Accordingly, the fact that it
   admits the duty, does not yet create an effective will ex toto. It must
   accordingly so love what it ought, that it no longer needs command
   itself; nay, duty (the ought) must be its only love; only then is it
   plena in voluntate bona. The "abyssus corruptionis nostræ" is only
   exhausted when by love we "totum illud, quod volebamus nolumus et totum
   illud, quod deus vult, volumus (Confess. IX. 1).

   [198] Confess. VII. 18: "Malum si substantia esset, bonum esset. Aut
   enim esset incorruptibilis substantia, magnum utique bonum; aut
   substantia corruptibilis esset, quæ nisi bona esset, corrumpi non
   posset." But since evil thus always exists in a good substance (more
   accurately: springs from the had will of the good substance), it is
   absolutely inexplicable; see e.g., De civitat. dei, XII. 7: "Nemo
   igitur quærat efficientem causam malæ voluntatis; non enim est
   efficiens sed deficiens (that is, the aspiration after nothing, after
   the annulling of life, constitutes the content of the bad will), quia
   nec illa effectio sed defectio. Deficere namque ab eo, quod summe est,
   ad id, quod minus est, hoc est incipere habere voluntatem malam. Causas
   porro defectionum istarum, cum efficientes non sint, ut dixi, sed
   deficientes, velle invenire tale est, ac si quisquam velit videre
   tenebras vel audire silentium, quod tamen utrumque nobis notum est,
   neque illud nisi per oculos, neque hoc nisi per aures, non sane in
   specie, sed in speciei privatione. Nemo ergo ex me scire quærat, quod
   me nescire scio, nisi forte, ut nescire discat, quod scire non posse
   sciendum est. Ea quippe quæ non in specie, sed in ejus privatione
   sciuntur, si dici aut intellegi potest quodammodo nesciendo sciuntur,
   ut sciendo nesciantur."

   [199] Augustine says of love (De civ. XI. 28), that we not only love
   its objects, but itself. "Amor amatur, et hinc probamus, quod in
   hominibus, qui rectius amantur, ipse magis amatur." This observation
   led him to see God everywhere in love. As God is in all being, so is he
   also in love; nay, his existence in being is ultimately identical with
   his existence in love. Therefore love is beginning, middle, and end. It
   is the final object of theological thought, and the fundamental form of
   true spiritual life. "Caritas inchoata inchoata justitia est; caritas
   provecta provecta justitia est; caritas magna magna justitia est;
   caritas perfecta perfecta justitia est" (De nat. et grat. 84). But
   since in life in general voluntas = caritas (De trin. XV. 38): "quid
   est aliud caritas quam voluntas?", we here find once more the profound
   connection between ethics and psychology.

   [200] Augustine's ability to unite the Neoplatonic ontological
   speculation with the results of his examination of the practical
   spiritual life was due inter alia especially to his complete
   abstinence, in the former case, from accepting ritualistic elements, or
   from introducing into his speculation matter taken from the Cultus and
   the religion of the second order. If at first the stage of spiritual
   development which he occupied (when outside the Church), of itself
   protected him from admitting these deleterious elements, yet it was a
   conspicuous and hitherto unappreciated side of his greatness that he
   always kept clear of ritualistic mysticism. Thereby he rendered an
   invaluable service not only to his disciples in mysticism, but to the
   whole Western Church.

   [201] De doctr. christ., I., 3 sq.

   [202] See Confess., VII. 24: "et qæerebam viam comparandi roboris quod
   esset idoneum ad fruendum te, etc.," 26: "certus quidem in istis eram,
   nimis taken infirmus ad fruendum te."

   [203] Augustine has often repeated the old Platonic assertion of the
   impossibility of defining the nature of God, and that not always with a
   feeling of dissatisfaction, but as an expression of romantic
   satisfaction ("ineffabilis simplex natura"; "facilius dicimus quid non
   sit, quam quod sit"). He contributed much, besides, to the relative
   elucidation of negative definitions and of properties and accidents,
   and created scholastic terminology; see especially De trinit., XV. He
   is the father of Western theological dialectic: but also the inventor
   of the dialectic of the pious consciousness. From the anti-Manichæan
   controversy sprang the desire to conceive all God's separate attributes
   as identical, i.e., the interest in the indivisibility of God--God is
   essence, not substance; for the latter cannot be thought of without
   accidents; see De trinit., VII., 10; and this interest went so far as
   to hold that even habere and esse coincided in God (De civ., X1. 10:
   "ideo simplex dicitur quoniam quod habet hoc est"). In order to guard
   God from corruptibilitas, compositeness of any sort was denied. But, at
   this point, Augustine had, nevertheless, to make a distinction in God,
   in order to discriminate the divine world-plan from him, and not to
   fall completely into Pantheism. (The latter is stamped on many passages
   in the work De trinit., see e.g., IV., 3, "Quia unum verbum dei est,
   per quod facta sunt omnia, quod est incommutabilis veritas, ibi
   principaliter atque incommutabiliter sunt omnia simul, et omnia vita
   sunt et omnia unum sunt.") But since he always harked to the conviction
   that being, and wisdom, and goodness, are identical in God, he did not
   reach what he aimed at. This difficulty increased still further for
   him, where he combined speculation as to the nature of God with that
   regarding the Trinity. (Dorner, p. 22 ff.) It is seen most clearly in
   the doctrine of the divine world-plan. It always threatens to submerge
   the world in the Son as a unity, and to take away its difference (it is
   wrong, however--at least for the period after c., A.D. 400--to say
   conversely that the intelligible world is for Augustine identical with
   the Son, or is the Son). The vacillation is continued in the doctrine
   of creation. But Dorner (p. 40 f.) is wrong when he says: "Augustine
   had no conception as yet that the notion of causality, clearly
   conceived, is sufficient to establish the distinction between God and
   the world." Augustine had undoubtedly no such conception, but this time
   it is not he, but Dorner, who shows his simplicity. The notion of
   causality, "clearly conceived," can never establish a distinction, but
   only a transformation. If he had meant to give expression to the
   former, he required to introduce more into the cause than the effect;
   that is, it was necessary to furnish the cause with properties and
   powers which did not pass into the causatum (effect). But this already
   means that the scheme of cause and effect is inadequate to establish
   the difference. Augustine, certainly, had no clear conception of such a
   thing; but he felt that mere causality was useless. He adopted the
   expedient of calling in "nihil" (nothing) to his aid, the negation: God
   works in nothing. This "nothing" was the cause of the world not being a
   transformation or evolution of God, but of its appearing as an inferior
   or irridescent product, which, because it is a divina operatio, exists
   (yet not independently of God), and which, so far as independent, does
   not exist, since its independence resides in the nihil. The sentence
   "mundus de nihilo a deo factus"--the root principle of Augustinian
   cosmology--is ultimately to be taken dualistically; but the dualism is
   concealed by the second element consisting in negation, and therefore
   only revealing itself in the privative form (of mutability,
   transitoriness). But in the end the purely negative character of the
   second element cannot be absolutely retained (Augustine never,
   certainly, identified it with matter); it purported to be absolute
   impotence, but combined with the divine activity it became the
   resisting factor, and we know how it does resist in sin. Accordingly,
   the question most fatal to Augustine would have been: Who created this
   nothing? As a matter of fact this question breaks down the whole
   construction. Absurd as it sounds, it is justified. Augustine cannot
   explain negation with its determinative power existing side by side
   with the divina operatio; for it is no explanation to say that it did
   not exist at all, since it merely had negative effects. Yet theory,
   sometimes acosmic, sometimes dualistic, in form, is everywhere
   corrected in Augustine, whether by the expression of a wise nescience,
   or by faith in God as Father. The criticism here used has been attacked
   by Loofs (R.-Encykl. 3, Vol. II., p. 271). We have to admit that it
   goes more deeply into the reason of his views than Augustine's words
   require. But I do not believe that the statement given by Loofs is
   adequate: "God so created his creatures from nothing that some are less
   fair, less good than others, and, therefore, have less being (esse)."
   Could Augustine have actually contented himself with these facts
   without asking whence this "less"?

   [204] Enchirid. 3.

   [205] See Vol. IV., p. 129 ff. I do not enter further into the doctrine
   of the Trinity, but remark that the term "tres personæ" was very fatal
   to Augustine, and that all his original efforts in dealing with the
   Trinity lead away from cosmical and hypercosmical plurality to
   conceptions that make it express inner, spiritual self-movement in the
   one God.

   [206] Cum autem initio fidei quæ per dilectionem operatur imbuta mens
   fuerit, tendit bene vivendo etiam ad speciem pervenire, ubi est sanctis
   et perfectis cordibus nota ineffabilis pulchritudo, cujus plena visio
   est summa felicitas. Hoc est nimirum quod requiris, "quid primum, quid
   ultimum teneatur," inchoari fide, perfici specie.

   [207] We may here touch briefly on the question several times recently
   discussed, as to the supremacy of the will in Augustine. Kahl has
   maintained it. But Siebeck (1.c. 183 f.) has with reason rejected it;
   (see also my notice of Kahl's book in the ThLZ., 1886, No. 25); and
   Kahl has himself to admit "that at the last stage of knowledge
   Neoplatonic intellectualism, which explains volition away in view of
   thought, has frequently traversed the logical consequences of
   Augustine's standpoint." But it is just the last stage that decides. On
   the other hand, Kahl is quite right in appreciating so highly the
   importance of the will in Augustine. The kernel of our nature exists
   indisputably according to Augustine in our will; therefore, in order
   that the veritas, the scire deum et animam may be able to obtain
   supremacy, and become, as it were, the unique function of man, the will
   must be won on its behalf. This takes place through God's grace, which
   leads the soul to will and love spiritual truth, i.e., God. Only now is
   it rendered possible for the intellect to assume supremacy. Accordingly
   the freeing of the will is ultimately the substitution of the supremacy
   of the intellect for that of the will. (Compare, e.g., the passage
   Confess. IX. 24: "regio ubertatis indeficientis, ubi pascis Israel in
   æternum veritatis pabulo, et ubi vita sapientia est"; but for this life
   it holds true that "sapientia hominis pietas.") Yet in so far as the
   supremacy of the intellect could not maintain itself without the amor
   essendi et sciendi, the will remains the co-efficient of the intellect
   even in the highest sphere. That is, briefly, Augustine's view of the
   relation of the will and intellect. It explains why the return to
   Augustine in the Middle Ages brought about the complete subordination
   of the intellect to the will; for Augustine himself so presented the
   case that no inner state and no activity of thought existed apart front
   the will. But if that were so, Augustine's opinion, that the vision
   (visio) of God was the supreme goal, could not but in the end pass
   away. It was necessary to demonstrate a goal which corresponded to the
   assured fact that man was will (see Duns Scotus).

   [208] See De civit. dei, XIV. 3 sq.; it is not the body (sensuousness)
   that is the ultimate cause of sin.

   [209] Confess. I. 25: Væ tibi flumen moris humani? quis resistet tibi?
   quamdiu non siccaberis? quosque volves Evæ, filius in mare magnum et
   formidolosum, quod vix transeunt qui lignum [ecclesiam] conscenderint?

   [210] There is a wonderful contrast in Augustine between the profound
   pessimistic view of the world, and the conception, strictly held in
   theory, that everything takes place under the uniform and unchangeable
   activity of God. What a difference between the statement of the problem
   and the result! And in order to remove this difference the
   metaphysician refers us to the--nothing. The course of the world is so
   confidently regarded as caused in whole and in detail by God, nay, is,
   as it were, taken up into the unchangeableness of God himself, that
   even miracles are only conceived to be events contrary to nature as
   known to us (Genes. ad lit. VI. 13; cf. De civ. X. 12; XXI. 1-8;
   nothing happens against nature; the world is itself the greatest, nay,
   the sole miracle; see Nitzsch, Aug's Lehre v. Wunder, 1865; Dorner, p.
   71 f.), and yet everything shapes itself into a vast tragedy. In this
   nothing there still indeed lurks in Augustine a part of Manichæism; but
   in his vital view of the world it is not the "nothing" which plays a
   part, but the sin of wicked pleasure--self-will.

   [211] Confess. III. 8; V. 25; etc.

   [212] See the avowals in Confess. VII. 25.

   [213] Naturally, general investigations are not wanting of the nature
   of revelation as a whole, its relation to ratio, its stages (punishment
   of sin, law, prophecy), etc., but they have no secure connection with
   his dogmatics; they are dependant on the occasions that called them
   forth, and they are not clearly thought out. In any case, however, so
   many elements are found in them which connect them with Greek
   speculations, and in turn others which exerted a powerful influence at
   a later date (see Abelard), that one or two references are necessary
   (cf. Schmidt, Origenes and Aug. als Apolegeten in the Jahrbb. f.
   deutsche Theol. VIII.; Böhringer, p. 204 ff.; Reuter, p. 90 f., 350
   ff., 400). Augustine occupies himself here, as always, with a problem
   whose factors ultimately do not admit of being reconciled. On the one
   hand, he never gave up the lofty appreciation of reason (ratio), of
   independent knowledge, in which being and life are embraced. Originally
   (in his first period, after A.D. 385), although he had already seen the
   importance of auctoritas, he set up as the goal of the ratio the
   overcoming of auctoritas, which required to precede it only for a time
   (De ord. II., 26, 27). "Ratio was to him the organ in which God reveals
   himself to man, and in which man perceives God." In after times this
   thought was never given up; but it was limited by the distinction
   between subjective and objective reason, by the increasing perception
   of the extent of the influence exerted on human mason by the will, by
   the assumption that one consequence of original sin was ignorance, and,
   finally, by the view that while knowledge, due to faith, would always
   be uncertain here below, the soul longed after the real, i.e., the
   absolute and absolutely sure, knowledge. The latter alone superseded
   ratio as the organ by which God is known, as guide to the vita beata;
   the other limitations were limitations pure and simple. And the
   constancy with which, in spite of these, Augustine at all times valued
   ratio is proved by those striking expositions, which occur in his
   earliest and latest writings, of Christianity as the disclosure of the
   one true religion which had always existed. The whole work De civitate
   dei is, indeed, built upon this thought--the civitas dei not being
   first created by the appearance of Christ--which, indeed, has two other
   roots besides Rationalism, namely, the conception of the absolute
   immutability of God, and the intention to defend Christianity and its
   God against Neoplatonic and pagan attacks. (The first two roots, as can
   be easily shown, are reducible ultimately to one single conception. The
   apologetic idea is of quite a different kind. Christianity is held to
   be as old as the world, in order that the reproach of its late arrival
   may fall to the ground. Here the wholly incongruous idea is introduced
   that Christians before Christ had believed on his future appearance.
   Reuter has shown excellently (p. 90 ff.) how even the particularist
   doctrine of pre-destination has its share in the universalist and
   humanist conception; he also deserves the greatest gratitude for
   collecting the numerous passages in which that conception is
   elaborated.) Even before the appearance of Christ the civitas dei
   existed; to it belonged pagans and Jews. Christianity is as old as the
   world. It is the natural religion which has existed from the beginning
   under various forms and names. Through Christ it received the name of
   the Christian religion; "res ipsa quæ nunc Christiana religio
   nuncupatur, erat apud antiquos, nec defuit ab initio generis humani,
   quousque ipse Christus venit in carne, unde vera religio, quæ jam erat,
   coepit appellari Christiana" (Retract. I., 12, 3); see especially Ep.
   102 and De civit. XVIII., 47, where the incongruous thought is inserted
   that the unus mediator was revealed to the heathens who belonged to the
   heavenly Jerusalem in the earliest time. The latter idea is by no means
   inserted everywhere; there was rather up to the end of his life, in
   spite and because of his doctrine of particular predestinating grace,
   an undercurrent in Augustine's thought: co-ordinating God and free
   knowledge, he recognised behind the system of the Church a free
   science, and in accordance therewith conceived also God and the world
   to be the abiding objects of knowledge. With this idea, however, as in
   the case of Origen, Christ at once disappears. The ultimate reason of
   this consists in the fact that Augustine, with all his progress in
   knowledge, never advanced to history. The great psychologist was still
   blind to the nature of historical development, to what personality
   achieved in history, and what history had accomplished fur mankind. He
   had only two methods of observation at his disposal--either the
   mythological contemplation of history, or a rationalistic neutralising.
   The man who felt so clearly and testified so convincingly that freedom
   lay in the change of will when it received a strength binding us to the
   good, was yet incapable as a thinker of drawing clearly the
   consequences of this experience. But those should not blame him who
   cannot free themselves from the illusion that an absolute knowledge of
   some sort must be possible to man; for the effort to obtain such a
   knowledge is the ultimate cause of the inability to understand history
   as history. He who is only happy with absolute knowledge is either
   blind to history, or it becomes a Medusa's head to him. Yet rationalism
   is only the undercurrent, though here and there it does force its way
   to the surface. More surely and more constantly Augustine appeased with
   revelation his hunger for the absolute, which he was unable to
   distinguish from aiming at force and strength (God and goodness). His
   feelings were the same as Faust's: "We long for revelation." Now, it is
   very characteristic that in dealing with the notion of revelation,
   Augustine has expounded nothing more clearly than the thought that
   revelation is absolutely authoritative. We can leave out of account his
   other views on its necessity, nature, etc. The decisive fact for him is
   that revelation does not merely recommend itself by its intrinsic
   worth. Accordingly, the external attestation is the main point.
   Augustine discussed this (especially in his work De civit.) much more
   carefully and comprehensively than earlier Apologists, in order to
   establish the right to demand simple submission to the contents of
   revelation. Auctoritas and fides were inseparably connected; indeed,
   they occupied an almost exclusive relation to each other (see De util.
   cred., 25 sq.). We indeed find him explaining in his writings of all
   periods that authority is milk-food, and that, on the other hand, the
   demand in matters of religion for faith resting on authority is not
   exceptional, but that all the affairs of life of a deeper nature rest
   on such a faith. But these are simply sops to Cerberus. Man needs
   authority to discipline his mind, and to support a certainty not to be
   obtained elsewhere. Augustine was especially convinced of this as
   against heretics (Manichæans). Heathens he could refute to a certain
   extent from reason, heretics he could not. But even apart from this,
   since the power which hinds the will to God presented itself to him as
   the rock-fast conviction of the unseen, even the "strong" could not
   dispense with faith in authority. The gradual progress from faith to
   knowledge, which was well-known to him ("Every one who knows also
   believes, although not every one who believes knows,") was still a
   progress constantly accompanied by faith. The saying, "fides præcedit
   rationem," of which he has given so many variations (see e.g., Ep. 120,
   2 sq.: "fides præcedit rationem," or paradoxically: "rationabiliter
   visum est, ut fides præcedat rationem,") did not signify a suspension
   of faith at the higher stages. Or, rather, and here the Sic et Non
   holds good, Augustine was never clear about the relation of faith and
   knowledge; he handed over this problem to the future. On the one hand
   he trusted ratio; but, on the other hand, he did not, relying only on
   God, and:is Genius ruling in experience. Faith's authority was given
   for him in Scripture and the Church. But here, again, he only
   maintained and transmitted the disposition to obey, while his
   theoretical expositions are beset by sheer contradictions and
   ambiguities; for he has neither worked out the sufficiency,
   infallibility, and independence of Scripture, nor demonstrated the
   infallibility of the Church, nor defined the relation of Scripture and
   the Church. Sometimes Scripture is a court of appeal which owes its
   authority to the Church, sometimes the Church doctrine and all
   consuetudo are to be measured by Scripture (Scripture is the only
   source of doctrina Christiana), sometimes Church and Scripture are held
   to constitute one whole; in one place the Church seems to find in the
   Council its infallible mouthpiece, in the other, the perfectibility of
   Councils themselves is maintained. "The idea of the Church's
   infallibility belongs to Augustine's popular Catholic presuppositions
   which grew out of his Catholic faith. It was never directly or
   expressly expounded by him, or dogmatically discussed. Therefore he
   cannot have felt the necessity of adjusting an exhaustive or precise
   doctrine regarding the legitimate form of the supreme representation of
   the Church by supposition infallible. This uncertainty and vagueness
   perhaps" (rather, indisputably) "spring from the vacillations of his
   thought regarding authority and reason, faith and knowledge" (see
   Reuter, pp. 345-358; Böhringer, pp. 217-256; Dorner, pp. 233-244;
   further, above pp. 77-83, and Vol. III., p. 203 ff.).

   [214] The figure often used by Augustine that the Word was united with
   the man Jesus as our souls are with our bodies is absolutely
   unsuitable. Augustine borrowed it from antiquity without realising that
   it really conflicted with his own conception.

   [215] Enchir., 36: "Hic omnino granditer et evidenter dei gratia
   commendatur. Quid enim natura humana in homine Christi meruit ut in
   unitatem personæ unici filii dei singulariter esset assumpta! Quæ bona
   voluntas, cujus boni propositi studium, quæ bona opera præcesserunt,
   quibus mereretur iste homo una fieri persona cum deo? Numquid antea
   fuit homo, et hoc ei singulare beneficium præstitum est, cum
   singulariter promereretur deum? Nempe ex quo homo esse coepit, non
   aliud coepit esse homo quam dei filius: et hoc unicus, et propter deum
   verbum, quod illo suscepto caro factum est, utique deus. . . . Unde
   naturæ humanæ tanta gloria, nullis præcedentibus meritis sine
   dubitatione gratuita, nisi quia magna hic et sola dei gratia fideliter
   et sobrie considerantibus evidenter ostenditur, ut intellegant homines
   per eandem gratiam se justifcari a peccatis, per quam factum est ut
   homo Christus nullum habere posset peccatum." 40: "Natus Christus
   insinuat nobis gratiam dei, qua homo nullis præcedentibus meritis in
   ipso exordio naturæ suæ quo esse coepit, verbo deo copularetur in
   tantam personæ unitatem, ut idem ipse esset filius dei qui filius
   hominis, etc." De dono persev., 67. Op. imperf., I., 138: "Qua gratia
   homo Jesus ab initio factus est bonus, eadem gratia homines qui sunt
   membra ejus ex malis fiunt boni." De prædest. 30: "Est etiam
   præclarissimum lumen prædestinationis et gratiæ ipse salvator, ipse
   mediator dei et hominum homo Christus Jesus, qui ut hoc esset, quibus
   tandem suis vel operum vel fidei præcedentibus meritis natura humana
   quæ in illo est comparavit? . . . Singulariter nostra natura in Jesu
   nullis suis præcedentibus meritis accepit admiranda (scil. the union
   with deity). Respondeat hic homo deo, si audet, et dicat: Cur non et
   ego? Et si audierit: O homo, tu quis es qui respondeas deo, etc." De
   corrept. et grat. 30: "Deus naturam nostram id est animam rationalem
   carnemque hominis Christi suscepit, susceptione singulariter mirabili
   vel mirabiliter singulari, ut nullis justitiæ suæ præcedentibus meritis
   filius dei sic esset ab initio quo esse homo coepisset, ut ipse et
   verbum, quod sine initio est, una persona esset." De pecc. mer. II. 27.
   Augustine says in Confess. VII. 25: "Ego autem aliquanto posterius
   didicisse me fateor, in eo quod verbum caro factum est, quomodo
   catholica veritas a Photini falsitate dirimatur." Our account given
   above will have shown, however, that he never entirely learnt this. His
   Christology, at all times, retained a strong trace of affinity with
   that of Paul of Samosata and Photinus (only all merit was excluded on
   the part of the man Jesus), because he knew that his faith could not
   dispense with the man Jesus, and he supplanted the pseudo-theological
   speculation as to the Word by the evangelical one that the Word had
   become the content of Christ's soul.

   [216] Therefore, also, the uncertainty which we find already in
   Augustine as to whether the Incarnation was necessary. In De Trinit.
   XIII. 13, he answers the momentous question whether God might not have
   chosen another way, by leaving the possibility open, but describing the
   way selected as bonus, divinæ dignitati congruns and convenientior. By
   this he opened up a perilous perspective to the Middle Ages.

   [217] Op. imperf. l.c.

   [218] He definitely rejects the idea held by him before his conversion
   that Christ was only a teacher; see, e.g., Confess. VII. 25: "Tantum
   sentiebam de domino Christo meo, quantum de excellentis sapientiæ viro,
   cui nullus posset æquari; præsertim quia mirabiliter natus ex virgine
   ad exemplum contemnendorum temporalium pro adipiscenda immortalitate
   divina pro nobis cura tantam auctoritatem magisterii meruisse
   videbatur."

   [219] De trin. XIII. 13: "Quid tam necessarium fuit ad erigendam spem
   nostram, quam ut demonstraretur nobis, quanti nos penderet deus
   quantumque diligeret?" That takes place through the Incarnation.

   [220] The "work" of Christ falls to be discussed afterwards; for we
   cannot include Augustine's views concerning it among his fundamental
   conceptions. In part they alternate (between redemption from the devil,
   sacrifice, and removal of original sin by death), and in part they are
   dependant on his specific view of original sin. Where he indulges in
   expositions of practical piety, he has no theory at all regarding
   Christ's work.

   [221] The clearest, and on account of the historical connection the
   most decisive, testimony is given in Confess. VII. 24-27, where, in
   telling what Christ had become to him, he at the same time explains why
   Neoplatonism was insufficient. He knew what the Neoplatonists
   perceived, but "quærebam viam comparandi roboris quod esset idoneum ad
   fruendum te, nec inveniebam donec amplecterer mediatorem dei et
   hominem, hominem Christum Jesum vocantem et dicentem: Ego sum via et
   veritas et vita, et cibum, cui capiendo invalidus eram, miscentem
   carni; quoniam verbum caro factum est, ut infantiæ nostræ lactesceret
   sapientia tua per quam creasti omnia. Non enim tenebam dominum meum
   Jesum, humilis humilem, nec cujus rei magistra esset ejus infirmitas
   noveram. Verbum enim tuum æterna veritas . . . subditos erigit ad se
   ipsam: in inferioribus autem ædificavit sihi humilem domum de limo
   nostro, per quam subdendos deprimeret a seipsis et ad se trajiceret,
   sanans tumorem et nutriens amorem, ne fiducia sui progrederentur
   longius, sed potius infirmarentur videntes ante pedes sues infirmam
   divinitatem ex participatione tunicæ pelliceæ nostræ, et lassi
   prosternerentur in eam, illa autem surgens lavaret eos." He then
   explains in the sequel that the Neoplatonic writings led him to
   thoroughly understand the nature of God, but: "garriebam plane quasi
   peritus, et nisi in Christo salvatore nostro viam tuam quærerem, non
   peritus, sed periturus essem." I sought to be wise, puffed up by
   knowledge. "Ubi enim erat illa ædificans caritas a fundamento
   humilitatis, quod est Christus Jesus?" This love rooted in humility
   those writings could not teach me. It was from the Bible I first
   learned: "quid interesset inter præsumptionem et confessionem, inter
   videntes quo eundun sit nec videntes qua, et viam ducentem ad
   beatificam patriam, non tantum cernendam, sed et habitandam." Now I
   read Paul. "Et apparuit mihi una facies eloquiorum castorum. Et coepi
   et inveni quidquid illac verum legeram, hac cum commendatione gratiæ
   tuæ dici, ut qui videt non sic glorietur quasi non acceperit, non solum
   id quod videt, sed etiam ut videat, et ut te non solum admoneatur ut
   videat, sed etiam sanetur ut teneat, et qui de longinquo videre non
   potest, viam tamen ambulet, qua veniat et videat et teneat." For if a
   man delights in the law of God after the inner man, what does he do
   with the other law in his members? . . . What shall wretched man do?
   Who shall deliver him from the body of this death? Who but thy grace
   through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the handwriting which was against
   us was abolished. "Hoc illæ litteræ non habent. Non habent illæ paginæ
   vultum pietatis hujus, lacrimas confessionis, sacrificium tuum,
   spiritum contribulatum. . . . Nemo ibi cantat: Nonne deo subdita erit
   anima mea. Ab ipso enim salutare meum. Nemo ibi audit vocantem: Venite
   ad me, omnes qui laboratis. Dedignantur ab eo discere quoniam mitis est
   et humilis corde. Abscondisti enim hæc a sapientibus et prudentihus, et
   revelasti ea parvulis." "For it is one thing from the mountain's wooded
   top to see the land of peace and yet to find no way to it, and another
   to keep steadfastly on the way thither." Compare with this the
   elaborate criticism of Platonism in De civit. dei, X., esp. ch. 24 and
   32, where Christ is presented as "universalis animæ liberandæ via,"
   while his significance is for the rest explained much more in the
   popular Catholic fashion than in the Confessions. In ch. 1 ff. there is
   even an attempt to conceive the angels and saints as a heavenly
   hierarchy as the Greeks do.

   [222] Augustine accordingly testifies that in order that the truth
   which is perceived should also be loved and extolled, a person is
   necessary who should conduct us and that on the path of humility. This
   is the burden of his Confessions. The truth itself had been shown
   clearly to him by the Neoplatonists; but it had not become his
   spiritual possession. Augustine knew only one person capable of so
   impressing the truth as to make it loved and extolled, and he alone
   could do this, because he was the revelation of the verbum dei in
   humilitate. When Christendom has attained securely and clearly to this
   "Christology," it will no longer demand to be freed from the yoke of
   Christology.

   [223] This is linked together by Augustine in a wonderful fashion. The
   scepticism of the thinker in genre and the doubts, never overcome in
   his own mind as to the Catholic doctrine in specie, demanded that
   Christ should be the indisputable authority of the Church. To this is
   added, in connection with gratia infusa, the Christ of the sacraments.
   I do not discuss this authoritative Christ more fully, because he
   coincides with the authority of the Church itself, and we have already
   dealt with the latter.

   [224] De civ. dei XIX. 13: "Pax cælestis civitatis ordinatissima et
   concordissima societas fruendi deo et invicem in deo." Enchir. 29:
   "Contemplatio ejus artifices, qui vocat ea quæ non sunt tamquam ea quæ
   sunt, atque in mensura et numero et pondere cuncta disponit," see 63.

   [225] Yet the conception of blessedness as peace undoubtedly involves a
   tendency to think primarily of the will.

   [226] The whole of Book XIX. of De civit. dei--it is perhaps on the
   whole the most important--comes to be considered here. In Ch. IV., it
   is expressly denied that virtue is the supreme good.

   [227] See De spiritu et lit. 5 (the passage follows afterwards).

   [228] That Augustine was able from this point of view to make the
   conscious feeling of blessedness a force entering into the affairs of
   this world, is shown by the passage De civit. dei XIX. 14, which,
   indeed, so far as I know, is almost unique. "Et quoniam (Christianus)
   quamdin est in isto mortali corpore, peregrinatur a domino, ambulat per
   fidem non per speciem; ac per hoc omnem pacem vel corporis vel animæ
   vel simul corporis et animæ refert ad illam pacem, quæ homini mortali
   est cum immortali deo, ut ei sit ordinata in fide sub æterna lege
   oboedientia. Jam vero quia duo præcipua præcepta, hoc est dilectionem
   dei et dilectionem proximi, docet magister deus . . . consequens est,
   ut etiam proximo ad diligendum deum consulat, quem jubetur sicut se
   ipsum diligere (sic uxori, sic filiis, sic domesticis, sic ceteris
   quibus potuerit hominibus), et ad hoc sibi a proximo, si forte indiget,
   consuli velit; ac per hoc erit pacatus, quantum in ipso est, omni
   homini pace hominum, id est ordinata concordia cujus hic ordo est,
   prinmm ut nulli noceat, deinde ut etiam prosit cui potuerit. Primitus
   ergo inest ei suorum cura; ad eos quippe habet opportuniorem
   facilioremque aditum consulendi, vel naturæ ordine vel ipsius
   societatis humanæ. Unde apostolus dicit: Quisquis autem suis et maxime
   domesticis non providet, fidem denegat et est infideli deterior.' Hinc
   itaque etiam pax domestica oritur, id est ordinati imperandi
   oboediendique concordia cohabitantium. Imperaut enim, qui consulunt:
   sicut vir uxori, parentes finis, domini servis. . . . Sed in domo justi
   viventes ex fide et adhuc ab illa cælesti civitate peregrinantis etiam
   qui imperant serviunt eis, quibus videntur imperare. Neque enim
   dominandi cupiditate imperant, sed officio consulendi, nec principandi
   superbia, sed providendi misericordia."

   [229] The element of "pax" obtains a value higher than and independent
   of knowledge (see above). That is shown also in the fact that the
   definitive state of the unsaved (De civit. dei, XIX., 28) is not
   described as ignorance, but as constant war: "Quod bellum gravius et
   amarius cogitari potest, quam ubi voluntas sic adversa est passioni et
   passio voluntati, ut nullius earum victoria tales inimicitiæ finiantur,
   et ubi sic confligit cum ipsa natura corporis vis doloris, ut neutrum
   alteri cedat? Hic [in terra] enim quando contingit iste conflictus, aut
   dolor vincit et sensum mors adimit, aut natura vincit et dolorem
   sanitas tollit. Ibi autem et dolor permanet ut affligat, et natura
   perdurat ut sentiat; quia utrumque ideo non deficit, ne poena
   deficiat." Undoubtedly, as regards the sainted (see Book, XXII.), the
   conception comes again and again to the front that their felicity will
   consist in seeing God.

   [230] Augustine has (De trin. I. 20) applied this comparison to the
   Churches of the future and present world; we may also adapt it to the
   relations of his doctrines of the Church and of God.

   [231] Ritschl published in his Treatise on the method of the earliest
   history of dogma (Jahrb. f. deutsche Theol., 1871) the grand conception
   that the Areopagite in the East, and Augustine in the West, were
   parallels; that the former founded a ritualistic ecclesiasticism, the
   latter an ecclesiasticism of moral tasks, in the service of a
   world-wide Christianity that both thus modified in the same direction,
   but with entirely different means, the old state of feeling (the bare
   hope of the future life). This conception is substantially correct If
   we keep firm hold of the fact that the traditional popular Catholic
   system was not modified by either to its utmost limit, and that both
   followed impulses which had been at work in their Churches even before
   their time. The doctrine regarding the Church was not Augustine's
   "central idea," but he took what every Catholic was certain of, and
   made it a matter of clearer, in part for the first time of any clear,
   conviction; and moved by very varied causes, he finally produced an
   ecclesiasticism whose independent value he himself never thoroughly
   perceived.

   [232] Solil. I. 5: "Nihil aliud habeo quam voluntatem; nihil aliud scio
   nisi fluxa et caduca spernenda esse, certa et æterna requirenda . . .
   si fide te inveniunt, qui ad te refugiunt, fidem da, si virtute,
   virtutem, si scientia, scientiam. Auge in me fidem, auge spem, auge
   caritatem." De spiritu et lit., 5: "Nos autem dicimus humanam
   voluntatem sic divinitus adjuvari ad faciendam justitiam, ut præter
   quod creatus est homo cum libero arbitrio voluntatis, præterque
   doctrinam qua ei præcipitur quemadmodum vivere debeat, accipiat
   spiritum sanctum, quo fiat in animo ejus delectatio dilectioque summi
   illius atque incommutabilis boni quod deus est, etiam nunc cum adhuc
   per fidem ambulatur, nondum per speciem: ut hac sibi velut arra data
   gratuiti muneris inardescat inhærere creatori atque inflammetur
   accedere ad participationem illius veri luminis, ut ex illo ei bene
   sit, a quo habet ut sit. Nam neque liberum arbitrium quidquam nisi ad
   peccandum valet, si lateat veritatis via, et cum id quod agendum et quo
   nitendum est coeperit non latere, nisi etiam delectet et ametur, non
   agitur, non suscipitur, non bene vivitur. Ut autem diligatur, caritas
   dei diffunditur in cordibus nostris, non per arbitrium liberum quod
   surgit ex nobis, sed per spiritum sanctum qui datus est nobis." L.c.,
   22: "Quod operum lex minando imperat, hoc fidei Iex credendo impetrat.
   Ipsa est illa sapientia quæ pietas vocatur, qua colitur pater luminum,
   a quo est omne datum optimum et omne donum perfectum. . . . Lege operum
   dicit deus: Fac quod jubeo; lege fidei dicitur deo: Da quod
   jubes. . . . Non spiritum hujus mundi accepimus, ait constantissimus
   gratiæ prædicator, sed spiritum qui ex deo est, ut sciamus quæ a deo
   donata sunt nobis. Quis est autem spiritus mundi hujus, nisi superbiæ
   spiritus? . . . Nec alio spiritu decipiuntur etiam illi qui ignorantes
   dei justitiam et suam justitiam volentes constituere, justitiæ dei non
   sunt subjecti. Unde mihi videtur magis esse fidei filius, qui novit a
   quo speret quod nondum habet, quam qui sibi tribuit id quod habet.
   Colligimus non justificari hominem littera, sed spiritu, non factorum
   meritis, sed gratuita gratia."

   2. The Donatist Controversy. The Work: De civitate Dei. Doctrine of the
   Church, and Means of Grace.

   Augustine was still occupied with the controversy with the Manichæans,
   in which he so sharply emphasised the authority of the Catholic Church,
   [233] when his ecclesiastical position--Presbyter, A.D. 392, Bishop,
   A.D. 396, in Hippo--compelled him to take up the fight with the
   Donatists. In Hippo these formed the majority of the inhabitants, and
   so violent was their hatred that they even refused to make bread for
   the Catholics. Augustine fought with them from 393 to 411, and wrote
   against them a succession of works, some of these being very
   comprehensive. [234] We must here take for granted a knowledge of the
   course of the controversy at Synods, and as influenced by the intrusion
   of the Civil power. [235] It was carried on upon the ground prepared by
   Cyprian. His authority was accepted by the opponents. Accordingly,
   internal antitheses developed in the dispute which had remained latent
   in Cyprian's theory. The new-fashioned Catholic theory had been already
   stated impressively by Optatus (see above, p. 42 ff.). It was reserved
   to Augustine to extend and complete it. But, as it usually happens in
   such questions, every newly-acquired position opened up new questions,
   and for one solution created any number of problems. And thus Augustine
   left more problems than he had solved.

   The controversy did not now deal directly with the hierarchical
   constitution of the Church. Episcopacy was an accepted fact. The
   competency of the Church was questioned, and therewith its nature,
   significance, and extent. That ultimately the constitution of the
   Church should be dragged into the same peril was inevitable; for the
   hierarchy is, of course, the tenderest part in a constitution based
   upon it.

   The schism was in itself the greatest evil. But in order to get over
   it, it was necessary to go to its roots and show that it was utterly
   impossible to sever oneself from the Catholic Church, that the unity,
   as well as truth of the Church, was indestructible. The main thesis of
   the Donatists was to the effect that the empirical is only the true
   Church when those who propagate it, the priests, are "pure"; for no one
   can propagate what he does not himself possess. [236] The true Church
   thus needs pure priests; it must therefore declare consecration by
   traditores to be invalid; and it cannot admit the efficacy of baptism
   administered by the impure--heretics, or those guilty of mortal sins;
   finally, it must exclude all that is manifestly stained and unworthy.
   This was followed by the breach with such Christian communions as did
   not strictly observe these rules, and by the practice of re-baptism.
   [237] Separation was imperative, no matter how great or small the
   extent of the Church. This thesis was supplemented, during the period
   of the State persecutions, by a second, that the persecuted Church was
   the true one, and that the State had nothing to do with the Church.

   Augustine's counter-argument, based on Cyprian, Ambrosiaster, and
   Optatus, but partly disavowing, though with due respect, the
   first-named, went far beyond a bare refutation of the separatists. He
   created the beginnings of a doctrine of the Church, and means of grace,
   of the Church as institute of salvation, the organism of the good,
   i.e., of divine powers in the world. Nor did the Donatist controversy
   furnish him with his only motive for developing this doctrine. The
   dispute with the Manichæans had already roused his interest in the
   authority of the Church, and led him to look more closely into it than
   his predecessors (see above, p. 79 ff.), who, indeed, were quite at one
   with him in their practical attitude to the Church. The Pelagian
   controversy, the state of the world, and the defence of Christianity
   against heathen attacks, had an extremely important influence on
   conceptions of the Church. Thus Augustine created the Catholic doctrine
   of the Catholic Church on earth, and we attempt in what follows to
   give, as far as possible, a complete and connected account of it.
   Finally, the earthly Church was and remained absolutely nothing but a
   means for the eternal salvation of the individual, and therefore the
   doctrines of the Church was also meant to be nothing but a subsidiary
   doctrine. But if all dogmatic ran the risk, with its means and
   subsidiary conceptions, of obscuring the important point, the danger
   was imminent here. Does not the doctrine of salvation appear in
   Catholicism to be almost nullified by the "subsidiary doctrine," the
   doctrine of the Church? [238]

   Grace and Authority--these two powers had, according to Augustine's
   self-criticism, effected his conversion. The authority was the Church.
   Every one knew what the Church was: the empirical, visible Church,
   which had triumphed ever since the days of Constantine. A "logical
   definition" of the Church was therefore unnecessary. The important
   point was to show that men needed an authority, and why it was the
   authority. The weak intellect needed revelation, which brings truth to
   the individual, before he himself is capable of finding it; this
   revelation is bound up in the Church. The fact that the Church was the
   authority for doctrine constituted for long Augustine's only interest
   in it. He produced in support of this principle proofs of subjective
   necessity and of an objective nature; yet he never reached in his
   exposition the stringency and certainty which as a Catholic he simply
   felt; for who can demonstrate that an external authority must be
   authoritative? The most important point was that the Church proclaimed
   itself to be the authority in doctrine. One was certainly a member of
   the Church only in so far as he submitted to its authority. There was
   no other way of belonging to it. Conversely, its significance seemed,
   on superficial reflection, to be entirely limited to doctrinal
   authority. We occupy our true relation to God and Christ, we possess
   and expect heavenly blessings only when we follow the doctrinal
   instructions given by the Church.

   Augustine embraced this "superficial reflection" until his
   ecclesiastical office and the Donatist controversy led him to more
   comprehensive considerations. He had arrived at his doctrine of
   predestinating grace without any external instigation by independent
   meditation on the nature of conversion and piety. The development of
   his doctrine regarding the Church, so far as it carried out popular
   Catholic ideas, was entirely dependent on the external circumstances in
   which he found himself placed. But he did not himself feel that he was
   stating a doctrine; he was only describing an actual position accepted
   all along by every Catholic, one which each had to interpret to
   himself, but without subtraction or addition. In addition to the
   importance of the Church as a doctrinal authority, he also felt its
   significance as a sacred institution which imparted grace. On its
   latter feature he especially reflected; but the Church appeared to him
   much more vividly after he had gained his doctrine of grace: it was the
   one communion of saints, the dwelling-place of the Spirit who created
   faith, love, and hope. We condense his most important statements.

   1. The Catholic Church, held together by the Holy Spirit, who is also
   the bond of union in the Trinity, possesses its most important mark in
   its unity, and that a unity in faith, love, and hope, as well as in
   Catholicity.

   2. This unity in the midst of the divisions existing among men is the
   greatest of miracles, the proof that the Church is not the work of men,
   but of the Holy Spirit.

   3. This follows still more clearly when we consider that unity
   presupposes love. Love is, however, the proper sphere of the Spirit's
   activity; or more correctly, all love finds its source in the Holy
   Spirit; [239] for faith and hope can be acquired to a certain extent
   independently--therefore also outside of the Church--but love issues
   only from the Holy Spirit. The Church, accordingly, because it is a
   unity, is the alliance of love, in which alone sinners can be purified;
   for the Spirit only works in "love the bond of unity" (in unitatis
   vinculo caritate). If then the unity of the Church rests primarily on
   faith, yet it rests essentially on the sway of the spirit of love
   alone, which presupposes faith. [240]

   4. The unity of the Church, represented in Holy Scripture by many
   symbols and figures, obtains its strongest guarantee from the fact that
   Christ has made the Church his bride and his body. This relationship is
   so close that we can absolutely call the Church "Christ"; [241] for it
   constitutes a real unity with Christ. Those who are in the Church are
   thus "among the members of Christ" (in membris Christi); the means and
   bond of this union are in turn nothing but love, more precisely the
   love that resides in unity (caritas unitatis).

   5. Heretics, i.e., those who follow a faith chosen by themselves,
   cannot be in the Church, because they would at once destroy its
   presupposition, the unity of faith; the Church, however, is not a
   society like the State, which tolerates all sorts of philosophers in
   its midst. Expelled heretics serve the good of the Church, just as
   everything must benefit those who love God, for they exercise them in
   patience (by means of persecutions), in wisdom (by false contentions),
   and in love to their enemies, which has to be evinced on the one hand
   in saving beneficence, and on the other in the terrors of discipline.
   [242]

   6. But neither do the Schismatics, i.e., those who possessed the true
   faith, belong to the Church; for in abandoning its unity--being urged
   thereto by pride like the heretics--they show that they do not possess
   love, and accordingly are beyond the pale of the operations of the Holy
   Spirit. Accordingly the Catholic Church is the only Church.

   7. From this it follows that salvation (salus) is not to be found
   outside the Church, for since love is confined to the visible Church,
   even heroic acts of faith, and faith itself, are destitute of the
   saving stamp, which exists through love alone. [243] Means of
   sanctification, a sort of faith, and miraculous powers may accordingly
   exist outside of the Church (see afterwards), but they cannot produce
   the effect and afford the benefit they are meant to have.

   8. The second mark of the Church is holiness. This consists in the fact
   that it is holy through its union with Christ and the activity of the
   Spirit, possesses the means--in the Word and sacraments--of sanctifying
   its individual members, i.e., of perfecting them in love, and has also
   actually attained this end. That it does not succeed in doing so in the
   case of all who are in its midst [244] --for it will only be without
   spot or wrinkle in the world beyond--nay, that it cannot entirely
   destroy sin except in a very few, detracts nothing from its holiness.
   Even a preponderance of the wicked and hypocritical over the good and
   spiritual [245] does not lessen it, for there would be no Church at all
   if the Donatist thesis were correct, that unholy members put an end to
   the Church's existence. The Donatists required to limit their own
   contention in a quite capricious fashion, in order to avoid destroying
   the Church. [246]

   9. Although the tares are not to be rooted out, since men are not
   omniscient, and this world is not the scene of the consummation, yet
   the Church exercises its discipline, and in certain circumstances even
   excommunicates; but it does not do so properly in order to preserve its
   holiness, but to educate its members or guard them against infection.
   But the Church can also tolerate. "They do not know the wicked in the
   Catholic unity, or they tolerate those they know for the sake of
   unity." [247] It can even suffer manifest and gross sinners, if in a
   particular case the infliction of punishment might result in greater
   harm. [248] It is itself secured from contamination by the profane by
   never approving evil, and always retaining its control over the means
   of sanctification. [249]

   10. But it is indeed an attribute of its holiness also to beget
   actually holy members. It can furnish evidence of this, since a few
   have attained perfection in it, since miracles and signs have
   constantly been wrought, and a general elevation and sanctification of
   morals been achieved by it, and since, finally, its whole membership
   will in the end be holy.

   11. Its holiness is, however, shown more clearly in the fact that it is
   only within the Church that personal holiness can be attained (see
   above sub. 7). [250]

   12. The unholy in the Church unquestionably belong to it; for being in
   its unity they are subject to the operation of the means of
   sanctification, and can still become good and spiritual. Yet they do
   not belong to the inner court of the Church, but form a wider circle in
   it. [They are "vessels to dishonour in the house of God" (vasa in
   contumeliam in domo dei); they are not themselves, like the "vessels to
   honour" (vasa in honorem), the house of God, but are "in it"; they are
   "in the communion of the sacraments," not in the proper society of the
   house, but "adjoined to the communion of the saints" (congregationi
   sanctorum admixti); they are in a sense not in the Church, because they
   are not the Church self; therefore the Church can also be described as
   a "mixed body" (corpus permixtum).] [251] Nay, even the heretics and
   schismatics, in so far as they have appropriated the Church's means of
   sanctification (see under), belong to the Catholic Church, since the
   latter makes them sons without requiring to impart a second baptism.
   [252] The character of the Church's holiness is not modified by these
   wider circles in the sphere to which it extends; for, as regards its
   foundation, means, and aim, it always remains the same, and a time will
   come when the holiness of all its members--for Augustine does not
   neglect this mark--will be an actual fact.

   13. The third mark of the Church is Catholicity. It is that which,
   combined with unity, furnishes the most impressive external proof, and
   the surest criterion of its truth. That is, Catholicity--extension over
   the globe--was prophesied, and had been realised, although it must be
   described as a miracle, that an association which required such faith
   and obedience, and handed down such mysteries, should have obtained
   this extension. The obvious miracle is precisely the evidence of the
   truth. Donatists cannot be the Church, because they are virtually
   confined to Africa. The Church can only exist where it proves its
   Catholicity by union with Rome and the ancient Oriental Churches, with
   the communities of the whole globe. The objection that men's sin
   hinders the extension is without weight; for that would have had to be
   prophesied. But it is the opposite that was prophesied and fulfilled.
   [253] The reminder, also, that many heresies were extended over the
   world is of no consequence; for, firstly, almost all heresies are
   national, secondly, even the most wide-spread heresy finds another
   existing at its side, and thereby reveals its falsehood. [This is the
   old sophism: on the one hand, disintegration is regarded as the
   essential characteristic of heresies; on the other, they are
   represented as forming a unity in order that the existence of others
   side by side with it may be urged against each in turn.]

   14. The fourth mark of the Church is its apostolicity. It was displayed
   in the Catholic Church, (1) in the possession of apostolic writings,
   [254] and doctrine, (2) in its ability to trace its existence up to the
   Apostolic communities and the Apostles, and to point to its unity
   (communicatio) with the churches founded by the latter. [255] This
   proof was especially to be adduced in the succession of the Bishops,
   though their importance is for the rest not so strongly emphasised by
   Augustine as by Cyprian; indeed passages occur in his works in which
   the universal priesthood, as maintained by Tertullian, is proclaimed.
   [256]

   15. While among the apostolic communities those of the East are also
   very important, yet that of Rome, and in consequence its Bishop, hold
   the first place. Peter is the representative of the Apostles, of
   Christians in general (Ep. 53, 2: "totius ecclesiæ figuram gerens"), of
   weak Christians, and of Bishops, or the Episcopal ministry. Augustine
   maintained the theory of Cyprian and Optatus regarding Peter's chair:
   it was occupied by the Roman Bishop and it was necessary to be in
   accord with it, because it was the apostolic seat par excellence, i.e.,
   the bearer of the doctrinal authority and unity of the Church. His
   statements as to the infallibility of the Roman chair are as uncertain
   and contradictory as those dealing with the Councils and Episcopate. He
   had no doubt that a Council ranked above the Roman Bishop (Ep. 43, 19).
   [257]

   16. Augustine was convinced of the infallibility of the Catholic
   Church; for it is a necessary consequence of its authority as based on
   Apostolicity. But he never had any occasion to think out this
   predicate, and to establish it in the representation and decisions of
   the Church. Therefore he made many admissions, partly without thought,
   partly when hard pressed, which, logically understood, destroyed the
   Church's infallibility.

   17. So also he holds the indispensableness of the Church, for it
   follows from the exclusive relation to Christ and the Holy Spirit
   revealed in its unity and holiness. This indispensableness is expressed
   in the term "Mother Church" [258] (ecclesia mater or corpus Christi);
   on modifications, see later.

   18. Finally, he was also convinced of the permanence of the Church, and
   therewith also of its primeval character; for this follows from the
   exclusive relation to God; yet ideas entered into the conception of
   permanence and primevalness, which did not flow from any consideration
   of the empirical Church ("the heavenly Church" on the one hand, the
   "city of God" on the other; on this see under).

   19. The empirical Catholic Church is also the "Kingdom of God" (regnum
   dei, civitas dei). As a matter of fact these terms are primarily
   employed in a view which is indifferent to the empirical Church (see
   under); but since to Augustine there was ultimately only one Church,
   everything that was true of it was also applicable to the empirical
   Church. At all times he referred to the Catholic Church the old term
   which had long been applied to the Church, "the kingdom (city) of God,"
   of course having in mind not that the Church was the mixed, but the
   true body (corpus permixtum, verum). [259]

   20. But Augustine gave a much stronger hold than his predecessors to
   the conception that the Church is the kingdom of God, and by the manner
   in which in his "Divine Comedy," the "De civitate dei," he contrasted
   the Church with the State, far more than his own expressed view, he
   roused the conviction that the empirical Catholic Church sans phrase
   was the kingdom of God, and the independent State that of the devil.
   That is, although primarily the earthly State (civitas terrena)
   consisted for Augustine in the society of the profane and reprobate,
   inclusive of demons, while the city of God (civitas dei) was the
   heavenly communion of all saints of all times, comprising the angels,
   yet he held that the former found their earthly historical form of
   expression and manifestation in the secular State, the latter in the
   empirical Church; for there were by no means two cities, kingdoms,
   temples, or houses of God. Accordingly the kingdom of God is the
   Church. And, carried away by the Church's authority and triumph in the
   world, as also profoundly moved by the fall of the Roman world-empire,
   whose internal and external power manifestly no longer existed save in
   the Church, Augustine saw in the present epoch, i.e., in the Church's
   History, the millennial kingdom that had been announced by John (De
   civit. XX.). By this means he revised, without completely abolishing,
   the ancient Chiliasm of the Latin Church. [260] But if it were once
   determined that the millennial kingdom was now, since Christ's
   appearance, in existence, the Church was elevated to the throne of
   supremacy over the world; for while this kingdom consists in Christ's
   reign, he only reigns in the present through the Church. Augustine
   neither followed out nor clearly perceived the hierarchical tendency of
   his position; yet he reasoned out the present reign of Christ which he
   had to demonstrate (XX. 9-13) by reflecting that only the "saints"
   (sancti) reign with Christ, and not, say, the "tares"; that thus only
   those reign in the kingdom who themselves constitute the kingdom; and
   that they reign because they aim at what is above, fight the fight of
   sanctification, and practise patience in suffering, etc. But he himself
   prepared the way directly for the sacerdotal interpretation of his
   thought, or positively expressed it, in two of his arguments. The one
   was drawn from him by exegesis, [261] the other is a result of a
   manifest view of his own. In the first place, viz., he had to show that
   Rev. XX. 4 ("those sitting on thrones judge") was even now being
   fulfilled. He found this fulfilment in the heads of the Church, who
   controlled the keys of binding and loosing, accordingly in the clergy
   (XX. 9). Secondly, he prepared the way for the supremacy of the Church
   over the State [262] in his explicit arguments both against and in
   favour of the latter (XIX., and even before this in V.). The earthly
   State (civitas terrena) and accordingly secular kingdoms are sprung
   from sin, the virtue of the ambitious, and simply because they strive
   for earthly possessions--summed up in the pax terrena, carried out in
   all earthly affairs--they are sinful, and must finally perish, even if
   they be legitimate and salutary on earth. The secular kingdom is
   finally, indeed, a vast robbery (IV. 4): "righteousness being
   abolished, what are kingdoms but great robberies?") [263] which ends in
   hell in everlasting war; the Roman Republic never possessed peace (XIX.
   21). From this point of view the Divine State is the only legitimate
   association.

   But Augustine had yet another version to give of the matter. The
   establishment of earthly peace (pax terrena)--see its manifold forms in
   XIX. 13--is necessary upon earth. Even those who treasure heavenly
   peace as the highest good are bound to care on earth by love for
   earthly peace. (Already the Jewish State was legitimate in this sense;
   see the description IV. 34, and the general principle XV. 2: "We
   therefore find two forms in the earthly State, one demonstrating its
   present existence, the other serving to signify the heavenly State by
   its presence"; [264] here the Divine State is also to be understood by
   the earthly, in so far as the former is copied on earth.) The Roman
   kingdom has become Christian, and Augustine rejoices in the fact. [265]
   But it is only by the help of justitia that rests on love that the
   State can secure earthly peace, and lose the character of being a
   robbery (latrocinium). But righteousness and love only exist where the
   worship of the true God is found, in the Church, God's State. [266]
   Accordingly the State must be dependent on the kingdom of God; in other
   words, those who, as rulers, administer the earthly peace of society,
   are legitimate and "blessed" (felices), when they make "their power
   subservient to the divine majesty for the extension as widely as
   possible of the worship of God, if they love that kingdom more, where
   they do not fear having colleagues." [267] Rulers, therefore, must not
   only be Christians, but must serve the Church in order to attain their
   own object (pax terrena); for outside the Divine State--of love and
   righteousness--there are no virtues, but only the semblance of virtues,
   i.e., splendid vices (XIX. 25). However much Augustine may have
   recognised, here and elsewhere, the relative independence and title of
   the State, [268] the proposition stands, that since the Church is the
   kingdom of God it is the duty of the State to serve it, because the
   State becomes more legitimate by being, as it were, embodied in it.
   [269] It is especially the duty of the State, however, to aid the
   Church by forcible measures against idolatry, heretics, and
   schismatics; for compulsion is suitable in such cases to prevent the
   good from being seduced, to instruct the wavering and ignorant, and to
   punish the wicked. But it by no means follows from this that in
   Augustine's view the State was to pursue anything that might be called
   an independent ecclesiastical or religious policy. It rather in matters
   of religion constantly supports the cause of the Church, and this at
   once implies that it is to receive its instructions from the Church.
   And this was actually Augustine's procedure. His conception of the
   "Christian State" did not include any imperial papistical title on the
   part of the civil power; such a title was rather absolutely precluded.
   Even if the Church begged for clemency to heretics, against whom it had
   itself invoked the arm of the State, this did not establish the
   independent right of the latter to inflict punishment: it served the
   Church in punishing, and it gratified it in practising clemency. [270]

   II. 21. Augustine was compelled by the Donatist practice of re-baptism
   and re-ordination to examine more closely, following Optatus, the
   significance and efficacy of the functions of the Church. It was
   inevitable that in doing so he should give a more prominent place to
   the notion of the Church as the communion of the Sacraments, and at the
   same time have instituted extremely sophistical discussions on the
   Sacraments--which, however, he did not yet carry out to their
   conclusion--in order to prove their objectivity, and make them
   independent of men, yet without completely externalising them, while
   vindicating them as the Church's exclusive property.

   22. To begin with, it was an immense advance, only possible to so
   spiritual a man as Augustine, to rank the Word along with the
   Sacraments. It is to him we owe the phrase "the Word and Sacraments."
   If he did not duly appreciate and carry out the import of the "Word,"
   yet he perceived that as gospel it lay at the root of every saving rite
   of the Church. [271]

   23. Exhaustively as he dealt with the Sacraments, he was far from
   outlining a doctrine regarding them; he contented himself rather with
   empirical reflections on ecclesiastical procedure and its defence. He
   did not evolve a harmonious theory either of the number or notion of
   the Sacraments. [272] Every material sign with which a
   salvation-conferring word was connected was to him a Sacrament. "The
   word is added to the element, and a Sacrament is constituted, itself
   being, as it were, a visible word." [273] The emphasis rests so
   strongly on the Word and faith (on John XXV. 12: "believe and thou hast
   eaten") that the sign is simply described in many places, and indeed,
   as a rule, as a figure. But this view is modified by the fact that in
   almost as many passages the Word, with its saving power, is also
   conceived as a sign of an accompanying invisible entity, [274] and all
   are admonished to take whatever is here presented to the senses as a
   guarantee of the reality. But everything beyond this is involved in
   obscurity, since we do not know to what signs Augustine would have us
   apply his ideas about the Sacrament; in De doctr. Christ. he speaks as
   if Baptism and the Lord's Supper were almost alone in question, but in
   other passages his language is different. [275]

   24. He himself had no occasion to pursue his reflections further in
   this direction. On the other hand, the Donatist thesis that the
   efficacy of the Sacrament depended on the celebrant, and the Donatist
   practice of re-baptism, forced him to set up two self-contradictory
   positions. First, the Sacraments are only efficacious in the Church,
   but they are also efficacious in circles outside the Church. If he
   abandoned the former principle, he denied the indispensableness of the
   Church; if he sacrificed the second, he would have required to approve
   of re-baptism. Secondly, the Sacraments are independent of any human
   disposition, and they are inseparably attached to the Catholic Church
   and faith. To give up the one thesis meant that the Donatist was right;
   to doubt the other was to make the Sacrament a magical performance
   indifferent to Christianity and faith. In order to remove these
   contradictions, it was necessary to look for distinctions. These he
   found, not, say, by discriminating between the offer and bestowal of
   grace, but by assuming a twofold efficacy of the Sacraments. These were
   (1) an indelible marking of every recipient, which took place wherever
   the Sacrament was administered, no matter by whom, [276] and (2) an
   administration of grace, in which the believer participated only in the
   union of the Catholic Church. According to this he could teach that:
   the Sacraments belong exclusively to the Catholic Church, and only in
   it bestow grace on faith; but they can be purloined from that Church,
   since, "being holy in themselves," they primarily produce an effect
   which depends solely on the Word and sign (the impression of an
   indelible "stamp"), and not on a human factor. [277] Heretics have
   stolen it, and administer it validly in their associations. Therefore
   the Church does not again baptise repentant heretics (schismatics),
   being certain that at the moment of faithful submission to the Catholic
   communion of love, the Sacrament is "efficacious for salvation" (ad
   salutem valet) to him who had been baptised outside its pale. [278]

   25. This theory could not but leave the nature of the "stamp" impressed
   and its relation to the communication of grace obscure. [279] The legal
   claim of schismatics and heretics to belong to the Catholic Church
   appears to be the most important, and, indeed, the sole effect of the
   "objectivity" of the Sacraments outside the Church. [280] But the
   theory was only worked out by Augustine in baptism and ordination,
   though even here he did not succeed in settling all the problems that
   arose, or in actually demonstrating the "objectivity." But in his
   treatment of the Lord's Supper, e.g., it cannot be demonstrated at all.
   For since, according to him, the reality of the Sacrament (res
   sacramenti) was invisible incorporation in the body of Christ
   (Augustine deals with the elements symbolically), and the eucharistic
   sacrifice was the sacrifice of love or peace, the co-operation of the
   Catholic Church is always taken to be essential to the Lord's Supper.
   Accordingly there is here no "stamp" independent of the Church. [281]
   But in the case of Baptism, he could assume that it could establish,
   even outside of the Church, an inalienable relation to the triune God,
   whose place could not be supplied by anything else, which in certain
   circumstances created a kind of faith, but which only bestowed
   salvation within the pale of the Church. [282] And in the case of
   Ordination he could teach that, properly bestowed, it conveyed the
   inalienable power to administer the Sacraments, although the recipient,
   if he stood outside the Church, only officiated to his own perdition.
   [283] In both cases his view was determined by the following
   considerations. First, he sought to defend the Church, and to put the
   Donatists in the wrong. Secondly, he desired to indicate the mark of
   the Church's holiness, which could not, with certainty, be established
   in any other way, in the objective holiness of the Sacraments. And,
   thirdly, he wished to give expression to the thought that there must
   exist somewhere, in the action of the Church, an element to which faith
   can cling, which is not supported by men, but which sustains faith
   itself, and corresponds to the assurance which the believer rests on
   grace. Augustine's doctrine of grace has a very great share in his
   doctrine of the sacraments, or, more accurately, of the sacrament of
   baptism. On the other hand, he had by no means any sacerdotal interest
   in this conception. But it could not fail afterwards to develop in an
   essentially sacerdotal sense. But, at the same time, men were impelled
   in quite a different direction by the distinction between the outward
   rite and accompanying effect, by the value given to the "Word" and the
   desire to maintain the objectivity of the Sacrament. The above
   distinction could not but lead in later times to a spiritualising which
   refined away the Sacraments, or, on the other hand, centred them in the
   "Word," where stress was laid on a given and certain authority, and
   therewith on the supremacy of the Word. Both these cases occurred. Not
   only does the Mediæval Catholic doctrine of the Sacraments go back to
   Augustine, but so do the spiritualists of the Middle Ages, and, in
   turn, Luther and Calvin are indebted to him for suggestions. [284]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Augustine's conception, above described, of the visible Church and
   means of grace is full of self-contradictions. His identification of
   the Church with the visible Catholic Church was not a success. He meant
   that there should be only one Church, and that none but believers
   should belong to it; but the wicked and hypocrites were also in it,
   without being it; nay, even heretics were in a sense in it, since they
   participated in the Sacraments. But in that case is the Church still
   visible? It is--in the Sacraments. But the Church which is visible in
   the Sacraments is certainly not the bride and body of Christ, the
   indispensable institution of salvation; that is alone the Church which
   is possessed by the spirit of love; and yet it is masked by the
   presence of the wicked and hypocritical. And the Sacrament cannot be
   relied upon; for while it is certainly not efficacious for salvation
   outside the Catholic Church, it is by no means certainly efficacious
   within it. The one Church is the true body of Christ, a mixed body, and
   the outward society of the Sacraments; in each instance we have a
   different circle; but it is as essential and important that it should
   be the one as the other. What is the meaning, then, "of being in the
   Church" (in ecclesia esse)? Every speculation on the notions of things
   is fated to stumble on contradictions; everything can be something
   else, anything is everything, and everything is nothing. The
   speculation surprises us with a hundred points of view--that is its
   strength--to end in none of them being really authoritative.

   But all Augustine's deliverances on this subject are seen to be merely
   conditional in their value, not only from their self-contradictions,
   but from the fact that the theologian is not, or is only to a very
   limited extent, expressing his religious conviction. He felt and wrote
   as he did because he was the defender of the practice of the Church,
   whose authority he needed for his faith. But this faith took quite
   other directions. Even those inconsistencies, which indeed were partly
   traditional, show that his conception of the Church was penetrated by
   an element which resisted the idea that it was visible. This element,
   however, was itself by no means congruous throughout, but again
   cornprehended various though intertwined features.

   1. The Church is heavenly; as bride and body of Christ it is quite
   essentially a heavenly society (cælestis societas). This ancient
   traditional idea stood in the foreground of Augustine's practical
   faith. What the Church is, it cannot at all be on earth; it possesses
   its truth, its seat, in heaven. There alone is to be found the true
   sphere of its members; a small fragment wander as pilgrims here upon
   earth for a time. It may indeed be said that upon earth we have only
   the copy of the heavenly Church for in so far as the earthly fragment
   is a "civitas terrena" (an earthly state) it is not yet what it will
   be. It is united with the heavenly Church by hope. It is folly to
   regard the present Church as the Kingdom of Heaven. "What is left them
   but to assert that the kingdom of heaven itself belongs to the temporal
   life in which we now exist? For why should not blind presumption
   advance to such a pitch of madness? And what is wilder than that
   assertion? For although the Church even as it now exists is sometimes
   called the kingdom of heaven, it is surely so named because of its
   future and eternal existence?" [285]

   2. The Church is primeval, and its members are therefore not all
   included in the visible institution of the Catholic Church. We now meet
   with the conception expounded by Augustine in his great work "De
   civitate dei," at which he wrought for almost fifteen years. The
   civitas dei, i.e., the society in which there rules "the love of God to
   the contempt of self" (amor dei usque ad contemptum sui, XIV. 28), and
   which therefore aspires to "heavenly peace" (pax cælestis), began in
   the angelic world. With this the above conception (see sub. 1) is
   combined: the city of God is the heavenly Jerusalem. But it embraces
   all believers of the past, present, and future; it mingled with the
   earthly State (civitas terrena) before the Deluge, [286] ran through a
   history on earth in six periods (the Deluge, Abraham, David, the Exile,
   Christ, and Christ's second Advent), and continues intermingled with
   the secular State to the end. With the transcendental conception of the
   City of God is thus combined, here and elsewhere, [287] the
   universalist belief applied to the present world: [288] Christianity,
   old as the world, has everywhere and in all ages had its confessors who
   "without doubt" have received salvation; for the "Word" was ever the
   same, and has always been at work under the most varied forms ("prius
   occultius, postea manifestius") [289] down to the Incarnation. He who
   believed on this Word, that is Christ, received eternal salvation.
   [290]

   3. The Church is the communion of those who believe in the crucified
   Christ, and are subject to the influences of his death, and who are
   therefore holy and spiritual (sancti et spiritales). To this view we
   are conducted by the conclusion from the previous one, the humanist and
   universalist element being stript away. If we ask: Where is the Church?
   Augustine answers in innumerable passages, wherever the communion of
   these holy and spiritual persons is found. They are Christ's body, the
   house, temple, or city of God. Grace on the one hand, faith, love, and
   hope on the other, constitute accordingly the notion of the Church. Or
   briefly: "the Church which is on earth exists by the remission of
   sins," or still more certainly "the Church exists in love." [291] In
   any number of expositions Augustine ignores every idea of the Church
   except this, which leads him to think of a spiritual communion alone,
   and he is as indifferent to the conception of the Church being an
   outward communion of the Sacraments as to the last one now to be
   mentioned. [292]

   4. The Church is the number of the elect. The final consequence of
   Augustine's doctrine of grace (see next section) teaches that salvation
   depends on God's inscrutable predestination (election of grace) and on
   that alone. Therefore the Church cannot be anything but the number of
   the elect. This is not, however, absolutely comprehended in the
   external communion of the Catholic Church--for some have been elect,
   who were never Catholics, and others are elect who are not yet
   Catholics. Nor is it simply identical with the communion of the saints
   (that is of those who submit themselves in faith to the operation of
   the means of grace); for these may include for the time such as will
   yet relapse, and may not include others who will ultimately be saved.
   Thus the thought of predestination shatters every notion of the
   Church--that mentioned under 2 can alone to some extent hold its
   ground--and renders valueless all divine ordinances, the institution
   and means of salvation. The number of the elect is no Church. The elect
   of God are to be found inside and outside the Church, under the
   operation and remote from the operation of sacramental grace; God has
   his subjects among the enemy, and his enemies among those who for the
   time being are "good." [293] Augustine, the Catholic, did not, however,
   venture to draw the inexorable consequences of this conception; if he
   was ever led to see them he contented himself with bringing more
   closely together the notions of the external communion, communion of
   saints, Christ's body, city of God, kingdom of heaven, and number of
   elect, and with thus making it appear as if they were identified. He
   stated his conviction that the number of the elect was substantially
   confined to the empirical Catholic Church, and that we must therefore
   use diligently all its benefits. But on the other hand, the faith that
   actuated his own life was too personal to let him bind grace, the
   source of faith, love, and hope, indissolubly to mechanical means and
   external institutions, and he was too strongly dominated by the thought
   of God's majesty and self-sufficiency to bring himself to examine God
   narrowly as to the why and how of his actions. He never did maintain
   that predestination was realised by means of the Church and its
   communication of grace. [294]

   Augustine's different conceptions of the Church are only united in the
   person of their originator, whose rich inner life was ruled by varied
   tendencies. The attempts to harmonise them which occur in his writings
   are, besides being few in number, quite worthless. But the scholastic
   endeavour to combine or pack together the different notions by new and
   flimsy distinctions leads to theological chatter. Even Augustine's
   opponents apparently felt only a small part of the inconsistencies. Men
   at that time were far from seeking in religious conceptions that kind
   of consistency which is even at the present day felt as a want by only
   a small minority, and in any case is no necessary condition of a
   sincere piety. Perhaps the most important consequence of Augustine's
   doctrine of the Church and Sacraments consists in the fact that a
   complex of magical ceremonies and ideas, which was originally designed
   to counter-balance a moralistic mode of thought based on the doctrine
   of free-will, now held its ground alongside of a religious frame of
   mind. The Sacrament had a deteriorating effect on the latter; but, on
   the other hand, it was only by this combination that it was itself
   rendered capable of being reformed. It is impossible to mistake, even
   in the case of Augustine himself, that the notion of the Church in
   which his own life centred was swayed by the thought of the certainty
   of grace and earnestness of faith and love, and that, similarly, his
   supreme intention, in his doctrine of the means of grace, was to
   establish the comfort derived from the sure grace of God in Christ,
   which was independent of human agency. Augustine subordinated the
   notions of the Church and Sacraments to the spiritual doctrine of God,
   Christ, the gospel, faith and love, as far as that was at all possible
   about A.D. 400.

   [233] The Manichæans professed, in the controversy of the day, to be
   the men of "free inquiry" ("docendi fontem aperire gloriantur" De
   utilit. 21). We cannot here discuss how far they were; Augustine did
   not conscientiously feel that his breach with them was a breach with
   free inquiry. Therefore the efforts from the outset to define the
   relations of ratio and auctoritas, and to save what was still possible
   of the former.

   Donatistam episcopum, b. II. The Sermo de Rusticiano is a forgery by
   the notorious Hieronymus Viguerius.

   [235] Augustine supported, at least from A.D. 407, the suppression by
   force of the Donatists by the Christian state in the interest of
   "loving discipline." The discussion of A.D. 411 was a tragi-comedy.
   Last traces of the Donatists are still found in the time of Gregory I.,
   who anew invoked the aid of the Civil power against them.

   [236] C. Litt. Petil I. 3: "Qui fidem a perfido sumpserit non fidem
   percipit, sed reatum." I. 2: "Conscientia dantis adtenditur, qui abluat
   accipientis." Other Donatistic theses ran (l.c.) "Omnes res origine et
   radice consistit, et si caput non habet aliquid, nihil est." "Nec
   quidquam bene regenerat, nisi bono semine (boni sacerdotis)
   regeneretur." "Quæ potest esse perversitas ut qui suis criminibus reus
   est, alium faciat innocentem?"

   [237] The Donatists, of course, did not regard it as re-baptism, l.c.
   "non repetimus quod jam erat, sed damus quod non erat."

   [238] Doctrine is, strictly speaking, inaccurate; for Catholicism does
   not know of any "doctrines" here, but describes an actual state of
   matters brought about by God.

   [239] Grace is love and love is grace: "caritas est gratia testamenti
   novi."

   [240] C. Crescon. I. 34: "Non autem existimo quemquam ita desipere, ut
   credat ad ecclesiæ pertinere unitatem eum qui non habet caritatem.
   Sicut ergo deus unus colitur ignoranter etiam extra ecclesiam nec ideo
   non est ipse, et fides una habetur sine caritate etiam extra ecclesiam,
   nec ideo non est ipse, ita et unus baptismus, etc." God and faith also
   exist extra ecclesiam but not "pie." The relevant passages are so
   numerous that it would give a false idea to quote singly. The
   conception given here constitutes the core of Augustine's doctrine of
   the Church: The Holy Ghost, love, unity, and Church occupy an exclusive
   connection: "caritas christiana nisi in unitate ecclesiæ non potest
   custodiri, etsi baptismum et fidem teneatis" (c. Pet. litt. II. 172).

   [244] The Biblical texts are here used that had been already quoted
   against Calixtus and the Anti-Novatians (Noah's Ark, The Wheat and
   Tares, etc.).

   [245] Augustine seems to have thought that the bad were in the majority
   even in the Church. He at anyrate held that the majority of men would
   be lost (Enchir. 97).

   [246] De bapt. II. 8: If the Donatists were right, there would have
   been no Church even in Cyprian's time; their own origin would therefore
   have been unholy. Augustine often reproaches them with the number of
   gross sinners in their midst. Their grossest sin, it is true,
   was--schism (c. litt. Pet. II. 221).

   [247] C. Petil. I. 25: "Malos in unitate catholica vel non noverunt,
   vel pro unitate tolerant quos noverunt."

   [248] Here and there in Augustine the thought occurs that the new
   covenant was throughout milder than the old.

   [249] C. litt. Pet. III. 4: "Licet a malis interim vita, moribus, corde
   ac voluntate separari atque discedere, quæ separatio semper oportet
   custodiatur. Corporalis autem separatio ad sæculi finem fidenter,
   patienter, fortiter exspectatur."

   [250] Sermo 4, 11: "Omnes quotquot fuerunt sancti, ad ipsam ecclesiam
   pertinent."

   [251] "Corpus permixtum" against the second rule of Tichonius, who had
   spoken of a bipartite body of the Lord, a term rejected by Augustine.
   Not a few of Augustine's arguments here suggest the idea that an
   invisible Church present "in occulto" in the visible was the true
   Church (De bapt. V. 38).

   [252] De bapt. I. 13: The question of the Donatists was whether in the
   view of Catholics baptism begot "sons" in the Donatist Church. if the
   Catholics said it did, then it should follow that the Donatists had a
   Church, and since there was only one, the Church; but if the question
   was answered in the negative, then they drew the inference: "Cur ergo
   apud vos non renascuntur per baptismum, qui transeunt a nobis ad vos,
   cum apud nos fuerint baptizati, si nondum nati sunt?" To this Augustine
   replies: "Quasi vero ex hoc generet unde separata est, et non ex hoc
   unde conjuncta est. Separata est enim a vinculo caritatis et pacio, sed
   juncta est in uno baptismate. Itaque est una ecclesia, quæ sola
   Catholica nominatur; et quidquid suum habet in communionibus diversorum
   a sua unitate separatis, per hoc quod suum in eis habet, ipsa utique
   general, non illæ."

   [253] A Donatist, "historicus doctus," indeed urged the telling
   objection (Ep. 93, 23) "Quantum ad totius mundi pertinet partes, modica
   pars est in compensatione totius mundi, in qua fides Christiana
   nominatur." Augustine, naturally, was unable really to weaken the force
   of this objection.

   [254] We have already remarked that Augustine held these to have--at
   least in many respects--an independent authority; see Doctrina Christ.
   and Ep 54, 55. In not a few expositions it seems as if the appeal to
   the Church was solely to the Church that possessed Scripture.

   [255] Besides the whole of the anti-Donatist writings, see, e.g., Ep.
   43, 21; 44, 3; 49, 2, 3; 51, 5; 53, 3.

   [256] De civit. dei, XX. 10: Distinction between sacerdotes and proprie
   sacerdotes.

   [257] Augustine's attitude to the Roman Bishop, i.e. to the infallible
   Roman tradition, is shown clearly in his criticism of Zosimus (Reuter
   p. 312 ff., 325 ff.) and in the extremely valuable 36 Epistle, which
   discusses the work of an anonymous Roman writer, who had glorified the
   Roman Church along with Peter (c. 21 "Petrus, apostolorum caput, coeli
   janitor, ecclesiæ fundamentum"), and had declared statutory
   institutions of the Roman Church to be universally binding.

   [258] C. litt. Pet. III. 10: "deum patrem et ejus ecclesiam matrem
   habere."

   [259] Perhaps the most cogent evidence of this is Ep. 36, 17. The
   anonymous Roman Christian had appealed to the verse "Non est regnum dei
   esca et potus," and simply identified "regnum dei" with "ecclesia," to
   prove that the Roman command to fast on the Sabbath was apostolic.
   Augustine does not reject this identification, but only the inference
   drawn from it by the anonymous writer. Here, however, ecclesia is
   manifestly the Catholic Church. In De trinit. I. 16, 20, 21, Augustine
   has no doubt that the regnum, which Christ will hand over to the
   Father, "omnes justi sunt, in quibus nunc regnat mediator," or the
   "credentes et viventes ex fide; fideles quippe ejus quos redemit
   sanguine suo dicti sunt regnum ejus." That is the Church; but at the
   same time it is self-evident that its "wrinkles" are ignored, yet not
   so its organisation; see on Ps. CXXVI. 3: "Quæ autem domus dei et ipsa
   civitas? Domus enim dei populus dei, quia domus dei templum dei . . .
   omnes fideles, quæ est domus dei, cum angelis faciunt unam civitatem.
   Habet custodes. Christus custodiebat, custos erat. Et episcopi hoc
   faciunt. Nam ideo altior locus positus est episcopis, ut ipsi
   superintendant et tamquam custodiant populum."

   [260] How far he went in this is shown by observing that in B. XX. he
   has connected with the present, as already fulfilled, not a few
   passages which plainly refer to Christ's Second Advent; see c. 5:
   "Multa præterea quæ de ultimo judicio ita dici videntur, ut diligenter
   considerata reperiantur ambigua vel magis ad aliud pertinentia, sive
   scilicet ad eum salva oris adventum, quo per totum hoc tempus in
   ecclesia sua venit, hoc est in membris suis, particulatim atque
   paulatim, quoniam tota corpus est ejus, sive ad excidium terrenæ
   Hierusalem, quia et de illo cum loquitur, plerumque sic loquitur
   tamquam de fine sæculi atque illo die judicii novissimo et magno
   loquatur." Yet he has left standing much of the dramatic eschatology.

   [261] See Reuter, Studie III.

   [262] Augustine had already written in Ep. 35 (A.D. 396, c. 3):
   "Dominus jugo suo in gremio ecclesiæ toto orbe diffuso omnia terrena
   regna subjecit."

   [263] "Remota justitia quid sunt regna nisi magna latrocinia"?

   [264] "Invenimus ergo in terrena civitate dual formas, unam suam
   præsentiam demonstrantem, alteram cælesti civitati signifcandæ sua
   præsentia servientem."

   [265] It is not, accordingly, involved under all circumstances in the
   notion of the earthly State that it is the organism of sin. Passages on
   the Christian State, Christian ages, and Catholic emperors, are given
   in Reuter, p. 141.

   [266] Augustine, indeed, also holds that there is an earthly justitia,
   which is a great good contrasted with flagitia and facinora; he can
   even appreciate the value of relative blessings (Reuter, p. 135 ff.),
   but this righteousness finally is dissipated, because, not having
   itself issued from "the Good," it cannot permanently institute anything
   good.

   [267] V. 24: If they "suam potestatem ad dei cultum maxime dilatandum
   majestati ejus famulam faciunt, si plus amant illud regnum, ubi non
   timent habere consortes."

   [268] What holds true of the State applies equally, of course, to all
   particular blessings marriage, family, property, etc.

   [269] Augustine, therefore, hold; a different view from Optatus (see
   above, p. 48); at least, a second consideration is frequent, in which
   the Church does not exist in the Roman empire, but that empire is
   attached to the Church. In matters of terrena felicitas the Church,
   according to Augustine, was bound to obey the State.

   [270] On the relation of Church and State, see Dorner, pp. 295-312, and
   the modifications considered necessary by Reuter in Studien, 3 and 6.
   Augustine did not at first approve the theory of inquisition and
   compulsion (c. Ep. Man. c. 1-3), but he was convinced of its necessity
   in the Donatist controversy ("coge intrare"). He now held all means of
   compulsion legitimate except the death penalty; Optatus approved of the
   latter also. If it is not difficult to demonstrate that Augustine
   always recognised an independent right of the State to be obeyed, yet
   that proves little. It may, indeed, be the case that Augustine valued
   the State relatively more highly than the ancient Christians, who were
   still more strongly influenced by eschatological views. But we may not
   forget that he advanced not only the cælestis societas, but the
   catholica, in opposition to the State.

   [271] Ep. 21, 3: "sacramentum et verbum dei populo ministrare." Very
   frequently verbum = evangelium = Christ and the first cause of
   regeneration. C. litt. Pet. I. 8: "Semen quo regeneror verbum dei est."
   The objective efficacy of the Word is sharply emphasised, but--outside
   of the Church it does not succeed in infusing love. C. Pet. III. 67:
   "minister verbi et sacramenti evangelici, si bonus est, consocius fit
   evangelii, si autem malus est, non ideo dispensator non est evangelii."
   II. 11: "Nascitur credens non ex ministri sterilitate, sed ex veritatis
   foecunditate." Still, Luther was right when he included even Augustine
   among the new-fashioned theologians who talk much about the Sacraments
   and little about the Word.

   [272] "Aliud videtur aliud intelligitur" (Sermo 272) is Augustine's
   main thought, which Ratramnus afterwards enforced so energetically.
   Hahn (L. v. d. Sacram., p. 11 ff.) has detailed Augustine's various
   statements on the notion of the Sacrament. We learn, e.g., from Ep. 36
   and 54, the strange point of view from which at times he regarded the
   conception of the Sacrament: see 54, 1: "Dominus noster, sicut ipse in
   evangelio loquitur, leni jugo suo nos subdidit et sarcinæ levi; unde
   sacramentis numero paucissimis, observatione facillimis, significatione
   præstantissimis societatem novi populi colligavit." Baptism and the
   Lord's Supper follow "et si quid aliud in scripturis canonicis
   commendatur. . . . Illa autem quæ non scripta, sed tradita custodimus,
   quæ quidem toto terrarum orbe servantur, datur intelligi vel ab ipsis
   apostolis, vel plenariis conciliis, quorum est in ecclesia saluberrima
   auctoritas, commendata atque statuta retineri, sicut quod domini passio
   et resurrectio et ascensio in cælum et adventus de cælo spiritus sancti
   anniversaria sollemnitate celebrantur, et si quid aliud tale occurrit
   quod servatur ab universa, quacumque se diffundit, ecclesia."

   [273] On John T. 80, 3: "Accedit verbum ad elementum et fit
   sacramentum, etiam ipsum tamquam visibile verbum.

   [274] De catech. rud. 50: "Signacula quidem rerum divinarum esse
   visibilia, sed res ipsas invisibiles in eis honorari."

   [275] Hahn (p. 12) gives the following definition as Augustinian: "The
   Sacrament is a corporeal sign, instituted by God, of a holy object,
   which, from its nature, it is adapted by a certain resemblance to
   represent, and by means of it God, under certain conditions, imparts
   his grace to those who make use of it."

   [276] Ep. 173, 3: "Vos oves Christi estis, characterem dominicum
   portatis in Sacramento." De bapt. c. Donat. IV. 16: "Manifestum est,
   fieri posse, ut in eis qui sunt ex parte diaboli sanctum sit
   sacramentum Christi, non ad salutem, sed ad judicium eorum . . . signa
   nostri imperatoris in eis cognoscimus . . . desertores sunt." VI. 1:
   "Oves dominicum characterem a fallacibus deprædatoribus foris adeptæ."

   [277] De bapt. IV. 16: "Per se ipsum considerandus est baptismus verbis
   evangelicis, non adjuncta neque permixta ulla perversitate atque
   malitia sive accipientium sive tradentium . . . non cogitandum, quis
   det sed quid det." C. litt. Pet. I . 8: "(Against various Donatist
   theses, e.g., conscientia dantis adtenditur, qui abluat accipientis')
   Sæpe mihi ignota est humana conscientia, sed certus sum de Christi
   misericordia . . . non est perfidus Christus, a quo fidem percipio, non
   reatum . . . origo mea Christus est, radix mea Christus est . . . semen
   quo regeneror, verbum dei est . . . etiam si ille, per quem audio, quæ
   mihi dicit ipse non facit . . . me innocentem non facit nisi qui
   mortuus est propter delicta nostra et resurrexit propter
   justificationem nostram. Non enim in ministrum, per quem baptizor,
   credo, sed in eum, qui justificat impium."

   [278] We have to emphasise the distinction between "habere" and
   "utiliter habere" often drawn in the writings against the Donatists; c.
   Cresc. I. 34: "Vobis (Donatistis) pacem nos annuntiamus, non ut, cum ad
   nos veneritis, alterum baptismum accipiatis, sed ut eum qui jam apud
   vos erat utiliter habeatis," or "una catholica ecclesia non in qua sola
   unus baptismus habetur, sed in qua sola unus baptismus salubriter
   habetur." De bapt. c. Donat. IV. 24: "Qui in invidia intus et
   malevolentia sine caritate vivunt, verum baptisma possunt et accipere
   et tradere. (Sed) salus, inquit Cyprianus, extra ecclesiam non est.
   Quis negat? Et ideo quæcumque ipsius ecclesiæ habentur, extra ecclesiam
   non valent ad salutem. Sed aliud est non habere, aliud non utiliter
   habere."

   [279] In the Catholic Church the seal and salvation coincide where
   faith is present. Augustine's primary concern was that the believer
   should receive in the Sacrament a firm conviction of the mercy of
   Christ.

   [280] Augustine did not really lay any stress on legal relation; but he
   did, as a matter of fact, a great deal to set matters in this light.

   [281] Sermo 57, 7: "Eucharistia panis noster quotidianus est; sed sic
   accipiamus illum, ut non solum ventre sed et mente reficiamur. Virtus
   enim ipsa, quæ ibi intelligitur, unitas est, ut redacti in corpus ejus,
   effecti membra ejus, simus quod accipimus." 272: "panis est corpus
   Christi . . . corpus Christi si vis intelligere, apostolum audi: vos
   estis corpus Christi." Augustine maintains the traditional conception
   that, in speaking of the "body of Christ," we may think of all the
   ideas connected with the word (the body is pneumatikon, is itself
   spirit, is the Church), but he prefers the latter, and, like the
   ancient Church, suffers the reference to forgiveness of sins to fall
   into the background. Unitas and vita (De pecc. mer. I. 34) occupy the
   foreground. Therefore in this case also, nay, more than in that of any
   other signum, the sign is wholly irrelevant. This "sacramentum
   unitatis" assures believers and gives them what they are, on condition
   of their possessing faith. (On John XXVI. 1: "credere in eum, hoc est
   manducare panem vivum"; De civit. XX I. 25.) No one has more strongly
   resisted the realistic interpretation of the Lord's Supper, and pointed
   out that what "visibiliter celebratur, oportet invisibiliter intelligi"
   (On Ps. XCVIII. 9 fin.). "The flesh profits nothing," and Christ is not
   on earth "secundum corporis præsentiam." Now it is possible that, like
   the Greeks, Augustine might here or there have entertained the thought
   that the sacramental body of the Lord must also be identified with the
   real. But I have found no passage which clearly supports this (see also
   Dorner, p. 267 ff.). All we can say is that not a few passages at a
   first glance can be, and soon were, understood in this way. Augustine,
   the spiritual thinker, has in general greatly weakened the dogmatic
   significance of the Sacrament. He indeed describes it, like Baptism, as
   necessary to salvation; but since he hardly ever cites the argument
   that it is connected with the resurrection and eternal life, the
   necessity is reduced to the unity and love which find one expression
   along with others in the Lord's Supper. The holy food is rather, in
   general, a declaration and assurance, or the avowal of an existing
   state, than a gift. In this Augustine agrees undoubtedly with the
   so-called pre-Reformers and Zwingli. This leads us to the import of the
   rite as a sacrifice ("sacrificium corporis Christi"). Here there are
   four possible views. The Church presents itself as a sacrifice in
   Christ's body; Christ's sacrificial death is symbolically repeated by
   the priest in memory of him; Christ's body is really offered anew by
   the priest; and Christ, as priest, continually and everywhere presents
   himself as a sacrifice to the Father. Of these views, 1, 2, and 4 can
   certainly be instanced in Augustine, but not the third. He strictly
   maintains the prerogative of the priest; but there is as little mention
   of a "conficere corpus Christi" as of Transubstantiation; for the
   passage (Sermo 234, 2) to which Catholics delight to appeal: "non omnis
   panis sed accipiens benedictionem fit corpus Christi," only means that,
   as in all Sacraments, the res is now added to the panis, and makes it
   the signum rei invisibilis; by consecration the bread becomes something
   different from what it was before. The res invisibilis is not, however,
   the real body, but incorporation into Christ's body, which is the
   Church. According to Augustine, the unworthy also obtain the valid
   Sacrament, but what they do receive is indeed wholly obscure. I could
   not say with Dorner (p. 274): "Augustine does not know of any
   participation in the real (?) body and blood on the part of
   unbelievers."

   [282] It is now the proper administration of baptism (rite) that is
   emphasised. The Sacrament belongs to God; therefore it cannot be
   rendered invalid by sin or heresy. The indispensableness of baptism
   rests of sheer necessity on the "stamp," and that is the most fatal
   turn it could take, because in that case faith is by no means certainly
   implied. The "Punici" are praised in De pecc. mer. I. 34, because they
   simply call baptism "salus"; but yet the indispensableness of the rite
   is not held to consist in its power of conferring salvation, but in the
   stamp. This indispensableness is only infringed by the baptism of
   blood, or by the wish to receive baptism where circumstances render
   that impossible. In the corresponding line of thought baptism rightly
   administered among heretics appears, because possessed unlawfully, to
   be actually inefficacious, nay, it brings a judgment. The Euphrates,
   which flows in Paradise and in profane countries, only brings forth
   fruit in the former. Therefore the controversy between Dorner and
   Schmidt, whether Augustine did or did not hold the Sacrament to be
   dependent on the Catholic Church, is idle. It is independent of it, in
   so far as it is necessary; dependent, if it is to bestow salvation. Yet
   Dorner (l.c. p. 252 f., and elsewhere) seems to me to be advancing not
   an Augustinian conception, but at most a deduction from one, when he
   maintains that Augustine does not contradict the idea that the Church
   is rendered holy by its membership, by emphasising the Sacraments, but
   by laying stress on the sanctity of the whole, namely the Church. He
   repeatedly makes the suggestion, however, in order to remove the
   difficulties in Augustine's notion of the Sacraments, that he must have
   distinguished between the offer and bestowal of grace; even the former
   securing their objective validity. But this is extremely questionable,
   and would fall short of Augustine; for his correct religious view is
   that grace operates and does not merely make an offer. Augustine,
   besides, has wavered to such an extent in marking off the place of the
   stamp, and of saving efficacy in baptism, that he has even supposed a
   momentary forgiveness of sin in the case of heretics (De bapt. I. 19;
   III. 18: "rursus debita redeunt per hæresis aut schismatis
   obstinationem et ideo necessarium habent hujusmodi homines venire ad
   Catholicam pacem;" for, on John XXVII. 6: "pax ecclesiæ dimittit
   peccata et ab ecclesiæ pace alienatio tenet peccata; petra tenet, petra
   dimittit; columba tenet, columba dimittit; unitas tenet, unitas
   dimittit"). The most questionable feature of Augustine's doctrine of
   baptism (within the Church) is that he not only did not get rid of the
   magical idea, but strengthened it by his interest in infant baptism.
   While he intended that baptism and faith should be connected, infant
   baptism made a cleavage between them. He deduced the indispensableness
   of infant baptism from original sin, but by no means also from the
   tendency to make the salvation of all men dependent on the Church (see
   Dorner, p. 257). In order to conserve faith in baptism, Augustine
   assumed a kind of vicarious faith on the part of god-parents, but, as
   it would appear, he laid no stress on it, since his true opinion was
   that baptism took the place of faith for children. However, the whole
   doctrine of baptism is ultimately for Augustine merely preliminary.
   Baptism is indispensable, but it is, after all, nothing more. The main
   thing is the active presence of the Holy Spirit in the soul; so that,
   from this point of view, baptism is of no real importance for
   salvation. But Augustine was far from drawing this inference.

   [283] Little reflection had hitherto been given in the Church to
   ordination. The Donatists furnished a motive for thinking about it, and
   it was once more Augustine who bestowed on the Church a series of
   sacerdotal ideas, without himself being interested in their sacerdotal
   tendency. The practice had indeed for long been sacerdotal; but it was
   only by its fateful combination with baptism, and the principle that
   ordination did not require (as against Cyprian) a moral disposition to
   render it valid, that the new sacrament became perfect. It now
   conferred an inalienable stamp, and was, therefore, if it had been
   properly administered, even though outside the Church, not repeated,
   and as it communicated an objective holiness, it gave the power also to
   propagate holiness. From Book I. c. 1 of De bapt. c. Donat. onwards,
   the sacramentum baptismi and the sacramentum baptismi dandi are treated
   in common (§ 2: "sicut baptizatus, si ab unitate recesserit,
   sacramentum baptismi non amittit, sic etiam ordinatus, si ab unitate
   recesserit, sacramentum dandi baptismi non amittit." C. ep. Parm. II.
   28: "utrumque in Catholica non licet iterari." The clearest passage is
   De bono conjug. 32: "Quemadmodum si fiat ordinatio cleri ad plebem
   congregandam, etiamsi plebis congregatio non subsequatur, manet tamen
   in illis ordinatis sacramentum ordinationis, et si aliqua culpa
   quisquam ab officio removeatur, sacramento domini semel imposito non
   carebit, quamvis ad judicium permanente"). The priests are alone
   appointed to administer the sacraments (in c. ep. Parm. II. 29 we have
   the remarkably tortuous explanation of lay-baptism; Augustine holds
   that it is a veniale delictum, even when the necessity is urgent; he,
   at least, believes it possible that it is so. But baptism, even when
   unnecessarily usurped by laymen, is valid, although illicite datum; for
   the "stamp" is there. Yet Augustine warns urgently against encroaching
   on the office of the priest.) None but the priest can celebrate the
   Lord's Supper. That was ancient tradition. The judicial functions of
   priests fall into the background in Augustine (as compared with
   Cyprian). We do not find in him, in a technical form, a sacrament of
   penance. Yet it actually existed, and he was the first to give it a
   substructure by his conception that the gratia Christi was not
   exhausted in the retrospective effect of baptismal grace. In that
   period, baptism and penance were named together as if they were the two
   chief Sacraments, without the latter being expressly called a
   Sacrament; see Pelagius' confession of faith (Hahn, § 133): "Hominem,
   si post baptismum lapsus fuerit, per pænitentiam credimus posse
   salvari;" which is almost identical with that of Julian of Eclanum
   (l.c. § 535): "Eum, qui post baptismum peccaverit, per pænitentiam
   credimus posse salvari;" and Augustine's (Enchir. 46): "Peccata, quæ
   male agendo postea committuntur, possunt et pænitendo sanari, sicut
   etiam post baptismum fieri videmus;" (c. 65): "Neque de ipsis
   criminibus quamlibet magnis remittendis in sancta ecclesia dei
   misericordia desperanda est agentibus pænitentiam secundum modum sui
   cujusque peccati." He is not speaking of baptism, but of the Church's
   treatment of its members after baptism, when he says (l.c. c. 83): "Qui
   vero in ecclesia remitti peccata non credens contemnit tantam divini
   muneris largitatem et in hac obstinatione mentis diem claudit extremum,
   reus est illo irremissibili peccato in spiritum sanctum."

   [284] A passage in Augustine's letter to Januarius (Ep. 55, c. 2) on
   the nature of the sacrament became very important for after ages:
   "Primum oportet noveris diem natalem domini non in sacramento
   celebrari, sed tantum in memoriam revocari quod natus sit, ac per hoc
   nihil opus erat, nisi revolutum anni diem, quo ipsa res acta est, festa
   devotione signari. Sacramentum est autem in aliqua celebratione, cum
   rei gestæ commemoratio ita fit, ut aliquid etiam signfcari
   intelligatur, quod sancte accipiendum est. Eo itaque modo egimus pascha
   ut non solum in memoriam quod gestum est, revocemus, id est, quod
   mortuus est Christus et resurrexit, sed etiam cetera, quæ circa ea
   adtestantur ad sacramenti significationem non omittamus."

   [285] De virgin. 24: "Quid aliud istis restat nisi ut ipsum regnum
   cælorum ad hanc temporalem vitam, in qua nunc sumus, asserant
   pertinere? Cur enim non et in hanc insaniam progrediatur cæca
   præsumptio? Et quid hac assertione furiosius? Nam etsi regnum cælorum
   aliquando ecclesia etiam quæ hoc tempore est appellatur ad hoc utique
   sic appellatur, quia futuræ vitæ sempiternæque colligitur." It is
   needless to quote more passages, they are so numerous.

   [286] See on this above, p. 151.

   [287] E.g., Ep. 102, quæst 2, esp. § 12.

   [288] See above, p. 152, n. 2.

   [289] Formerly more hiddenly, afterwards more manifestly.

   [290] In this line of thought the historical Christ takes a very
   secondary place; but it is quite different in others; see Sermo 116, 6:
   "Per Christum factus est alter mundus."

   [291] "Per remissionem peccatorum stat ecclesia quæ est in terris." "In
   caritate stat ecclesia."

   [292] We see here that the assumption that the Church was a corpus
   permixtum or an externa communio sacramentorum was only a make-shift
   conception; see the splendid exposition De baptis. V. 38, which,
   however, passes into the doctrine of predestination.

   [293] De bapt. V. 38: "Numerus ille justorum, qui secundum propositum
   vocati sunt, ipse est (ecclesia). . . . Sunt etiam quidam ex eo numero
   qui adhuc nequiter vivant aut etiam in hæresibus vel in gentilium
   superstitionibus jaceant, et tamen etiam illic novit dominus qui sunt
   ejus. Namque in illa ineffabili præscientia dei multi qui foris
   videntur, intus sunt, et multi, qui intus videntur, foris sunt." We
   return to this in dealing with Augustine's doctrine of predestination.

   [294] Here Reuter is entirely right as against Dorner.

   3. The Pelagian Controversy. The Doctrine of Grace and Sin.

   Augustine's doctrine of grace and sin was constructed independently of
   the Pelagian controversy. It was substantially complete when he entered
   the conflict; but he was by no means clear as to its application in
   separate questions in the year of his conversion. At the time of his
   fight with Manichæism (see the Tres libri de libero arbitrio) he had
   rather emphasised, following the tradition of the Church teachers, the
   independence of human freedom, and had spoken of original sin merely as
   inherited evil. It was his clerical office, a renewed study of Romans,
   and the criticism of his spiritual development, as instituted in the
   Confessions, that first led him to the Neoplatonic Christian conviction
   that all good, and therefore faith, came from God, and that man was
   only good and free in dependence on God. Thus he gained a point of view
   which he confessed at the close of his life he had not always
   possessed, and which he opposed to the earlier, erroneous conceptions
   [295] that friends and enemies frequently reminded him of It can be
   said that his doctrine of grace, in so far as it was a doctrine of God,
   was complete as early as A.D. 387; but it was not, in its application
   to Bible history, or to the problem of conversion and sanctification
   (in the Church), before the beginning of the fifth century. It can also
   be shown that he was at all times slightly influenced by the popular
   Catholic view, and this all the more as he was not capable of drawing
   the whole consequences of his system, which, if he had done so, would
   have led to determinism.

   This system did not evoke Pelagianism. Pelagius had taken offence,
   indeed, before the outbreak of the controversy, at Augustine's famous
   sentence: "Grant what thou commandest, and command what thou dost
   desire," and he had opposed it at Rome; [296] but by that date his
   doctrine was substantially settled. The two great types of thought,
   involving the question whether virtue or grace, morality or religion,
   the original and inalienable constitution of man, or the power of Jesus
   Christ was supreme, did not evolve themselves in the controversy. They
   gained in clearness and precision during its course, [297] but both
   arose, independently of each other, from the internal conditions of the
   Church. We can observe here, if anywhere, the "logic" of history. There
   has never, perhaps, been another crisis of equal importance in Church
   history in which the opponents have expressed the principles at issue
   so clearly and abstractly. The Arian dispute before the Nicene Council
   can alone be compared with it; but in this case the controversy moved
   in a narrow sphere of formulas already marked off by tradition. On the
   other hand, in spite of the exegetical and pseudo-historical materials
   that encumbered the problems in this instance also, there is a
   freshness about the Pelagian controversy and disputants that is wanting
   in the Greek contentions. [298] The essentially literary character of
   the dispute, the absence of great central incidents, did not prejudice
   it any way; the main issue was all the freer of irrelevant matter. But
   it is its most memorable feature that the Western Church so speedily
   and definitely rejected Pelagianism, while the latter, in its formulas,
   still seemed to maintain that Church's ancient teaching. In the crucial
   question, whether grace is to be reduced to nature, or the new life to
   grace, in the difficulty how the polar antitheses of "creaturely
   freedom and grace" are to be united, [299] the Church placed itself
   resolutely on the side of religion. In doing so it was as far from
   seeking to recognise all the consequences that followed from this
   position as it had been a hundred years earlier at Nicæa; indeed it did
   not even examine them. But it never recalled--perhaps it was no longer
   possible to recall--the step taken as soon as rationalistic moralism
   clearly revealed its character.

   Not only is the inner logic of events proved by the simultaneous and
   independent emergence of Augustinianism and Pelagianism, but the how
   strikes us by its consistency. On the one side we have a hot-blooded
   man who had wrestled, while striving for truth, to attain strength and
   salvation, to whom the sublimest thoughts of the Neoplatonists, the
   Psalms, and Paul had solved the problems of his inner life, and who had
   been over-powered by his experience of the living God. On the other, we
   have a monk and a eunuch, [300] both without traces of any inner
   struggles, both enthusiasts for virtue, and possessed by the idea of
   summoning a morally listless Christendom to exert its will, and of
   leading it to rnonachist perfection; equally familiar with the Fathers,
   desirous of establishing relations with the East, and well versed in
   Antiochene exegesis; [301] but, above all, following that Stoic and
   Aristotelian popular philosophy--theory of knowledge, psychology,
   ethics and dialectics--which numbered so many adherents among cultured
   Christians of the West. The third member of the league, Julian of
   Eclanum, the early widowed Bishop, was more active and aggressive than
   the reserved and prudent Pelagius, [302] more circumspect than
   Cælestius, the agitator, and more cultured than either. Overbearing in
   manner, he had a talent for dialectics, and, more stubborn than
   earnest, was endowed with an insatiable delight in disputing, and a
   boyish eagerness to define conceptions and construct syllogisms. He was
   no monk, but a child of the world, and jovial by nature. He was,
   indeed, the first, and up to the sixteenth century, the unsurpassed,
   unabashed representative of a self-satisfied Christianity. Pelagius and
   Cælestius required the aid of Julian, if the moralistic mode of thought
   was not to be represented from one side alone--the religious view
   needed only one representative. Certainly no dramatist could have
   better invented types of these two contrasted conceptions of life than
   those furnished by Augustine on the one hand, and the two earnest
   monks, Pelagius and Clestius, and the daring, worldly bishop Julian on
   the other. [303]

   We have thus already indicated the origin of Pelagianism. It is the
   consistent outcome of the Christian rationalism that had long been wide
   spread in the West, especially among the more cultured, that had been
   nourished by the popular philosophy influenced by Stoicism and
   Aristotelianism, [304] and had by means of Julian received a bias to
   (Stoic) naturalism. [305] (We may not overlook the fact that it
   originally fell back upon monachism, still in its early stages in the
   West, and that the two phenomena at first sought a mutual support in
   each other.) [306] Nature, free-will, virtue and law, these--strictly
   defined and made independent of the notion of God--were the catch-words
   of Pelagianism: self-acquired virtue is the supreme good which is
   followed by reward. Religion and morality lie in the sphere of the free
   spirit; [307] they are won at any moment by man's own effort. The
   extent to which this mode of thought was diffused is revealed, not only
   by the uncertain utterances of theologians, who in many of their
   expositions show that they know better, [308] but above all by the
   Institutes of Lactantius. [309] In what follows we have first to
   describe briefly the external course of the controversy, then to state
   the Pelagian line of thought, and finally to expound Augustine's
   doctrine. [310]

   I. We first meet with Pelagius in Rome. In every century there have
   appeared preachers in Italy who have had the power of thrilling for the
   moment the vivacious and emotional Italians. Pelagius was one of the
   first (De pecc. orig. 24: "He lived for a very long time in Rome").
   Roused to anger by an inert Christendom, that excused itself by
   pleading the frailty of the flesh and the impossibility of fulfilling
   the grievous commandments of God, he preached that God commanded
   nothing impossible, that man possessed the power of doing the good if
   only he willed, and that the weakness of the flesh was merely a
   pretext. "In dealing with ethics and the principles of a holy life, I
   first demonstrate the power to decide and act inherent in human nature,
   and show what it can achieve, lest the mind be careless and sluggish in
   pursuit of virtue in proportion to its want of belief in its power, and
   in its ignorance of its attributes think that it does not possess
   them." [311] In opposition to Jovinian, whose teaching can only have
   encouraged laxity, he proclaimed and urged on Christians the demands of
   monachism; for with nothing less was this preacher concerned. [312] Of
   unquestioned orthodoxy, [313] prominent also as exegete and theologian
   in the capital of Christendom, [314] so barren in literary work, he was
   so energetic in his labour that news of his success penetrated to North
   Africa. [315] He took to do with the practical alone. Apparently he
   avoided theological polemics; but when Augustine's Confessions began to
   produce their narcotic effects, he opposed them. Yet positive teaching,
   the emphasising of the freedom of the will, always remained to him the
   chief thing. On the other hand, his disciple and friend Cælestius [316]
   seems to have attacked original sin (tradux peccati) from the first.
   His converts proclaimed as their watchword that the forgiveness of sin
   was not the object of infant baptism. [317] When Alaric stormed Rome,
   the two preachers retreated by Sicily to North Africa. They intended to
   visit Augustine; but Pelagius and he did not meet either in Hippo or
   Carthage. [318] Probably the former left suddenly when he saw that he
   would not attain his ends in Africa, but would only cause theological
   strife. On the other hand, Cælestius remained, and became candidate for
   the post of Presbyter in Carthage. But as early as A.D. 412 (411) he
   was accused by Paulinus, Deacon in Milan (afterwards Ambrose's
   biographer), at a Synod held in Carthage before Bishop Aurelius. [319]
   The points of the complaint, reduced to writing, were as follows:--He
   taught "that Adam was made mortal and would have died whether he had or
   had not sinned--that Adam's sin injured himself alone, and not the
   human race--infants at birth are in that state in which Adam was before
   his falsehood--that the whole human race neither dies on account of
   Adam's death or falsehood, nor will rise again in virtue of Christ's
   resurrection--the law admits men to the kingdom of heaven as well as
   the gospel--even before the advent of our Lord there were impeccable
   men, i.e., men without sin--that man can be without sin and can keep
   the divine commands easily if he will." [320] Cælestius declared at the
   conference that infants needed baptism and had to be baptised; that
   since he maintained this his orthodoxy was proved; that original sin
   (tradux peccati) was at any rate an open question, "because I have
   heard many members of the Catholic Church deny it, and also others
   assent to it." [321] He was, nevertheless, excommunicated. In the
   Libellus Brevissimus, which he wrote in his own defence, he admitted
   the necessity of baptism if children were to be saved; but he held that
   there was a kingdom of heaven distinct from eternal life. He would not
   hear of forgiveness of sin in connection with infant baptism. [322] He
   was indisputably condemned because he undid the fixed connection
   between baptism and forgiveness, thus, as it were, setting up two
   baptisms, and offending against the Symbol. He now went to Ephesus,
   [323] there became Presbyter, and afterwards betook himself to
   Constantinople.

   Pelagius had gone to Palestine. He followed different tactics from his
   friend, who hoped to serve the cause by his maxim of "shocking deeply"
   (fortiter scandalizare). Pelagius desired peace; he wrote a flattering
   letter to Augustine, who sent him a friendly but reserved answer. [324]
   He sought to attach himself to Jerome, and to give no public offence.
   He plainly felt hampered by Cælestius with his agitation for the
   sinlessness of children, and against original sin. He wished to work
   for something positive. How could anyone thrust a negative point to the
   front, and check the movement for reform by precipitancy and
   theological bitterness? He actually found good friends. [325] But his
   friendly relations with John, Bishop of Jerusalem, could not please
   Jerome. Besides, reports of Pelagius' questionable doctrines came from
   the East, where, in Palestine, there always were numerous natives of
   the West. Jerome, who at the time was on good terms with Augustine,
   broke with Pelagius, [326] and wrote against him the Ep. ad
   Ctesiphontem (Ep. 133), and the Dialogi c. Pelag., writings which
   constitute a model of irrational polemics. He put in the foreground the
   question, "whether man can be without sin," and at the same time did
   all he could to connect Pelagius with the "heretic" Origen and other
   false teachers. But still greater harm was done to Pelagius [327] by
   the appearance, at this precise moment, of the work already known to
   us, in which Cælestius played so regardlessly the rôle of the enfant
   terrible of the party (see above). [328]

   Augustine's disciple, the Spanish priest Orosius, who had come to
   Jerome in order to call his attention to the dangers of Pelagianism,
   ultimately succeeded in getting John of Jerusalem to cite Pelagius, and
   to receive a formal report on his case in presence of his presbyters
   (A.D. 415). But the inquiry ended with the triumph of the accused.
   Orosius referred to the authority of his celebrated teacher, and to
   that of Jerome and the Synod of Carthage, but without success, and when
   Pelagius was charged with teaching that man could be sinless and needed
   no divine help, the latter declared that he taught that it was not
   possible for man to become sinless without divine grace. With this John
   entirely agreed. Now since Orosius for his part would not maintain that
   man's nature was created evil by God, the Orientals did not see what
   the dispute was all about. The conference, irregular and hampered by
   Orosius' inability to speak Greek, was broken off: it was said that the
   quarrel might be decided in the West, or more precisely in Rome. [329]
   Pelagius had repelled the first attack. But his opponents did not rest.
   They succeeded, in December, 415, in getting him brought before a
   Palestinian Synod, presided over by Eulogius of Cæsarea, at Diospolis,
   where, however, he was not confronted by his accusers. [330] He was at
   once able to appeal to the favourable testimonies of many Bishops, who
   had warmly recognised his efforts to promote morality. He did not
   disown the propositions ascribed to him regarding nature and grace, but
   he succeeded in explaining them so satisfactorily, that his judges
   found him to be of blameless orthodoxy. The extravagant sentences taken
   from the letter to Livania he in part set right, and in part disowned,
   and when the Synod required him expressly to condemn them, he declared:
   "I anathematise them as foolish, not as heretical, seeing it is no case
   of dogma." [331] Hereupon the Synod decided: "Now since with his own
   voice Pelagius has anathematised the groundless nonsense, answering
   rightly that a man can be without sin with the divine help and grace,
   let him also reply to the other counts." [332] There were now laid
   before him the statements of Cælestius as to Adam, Adam's sin, death,
   new-born children, the perdition of the rich, sinlessness of God's
   children, the unessential character of divine assistance--in short, all
   those propositions which had either been already condemned at Carthage,
   or were afterwards advanced by Cælestius in a much worse form. Pelagius
   was in an awkward position. He hated all theological strife; he knew
   that Christian morality could only lose by it; he wished to leave the
   region of dogma alone. [333] Cælestius had only said, indeed, what he
   himself had described as correct when among his intimate friends; but
   the former had spoken publicly and regardlessly, and--"the tone makes
   the music." Thus Pelagius considered himself justified in disowning
   almost all those statements: "but the rest even according to their own
   testimony was not said by me, and for it I am not called upon to give
   satisfaction." But he added: "I anathematise those who hold or have
   held these views." With these words he pronounced judgment on himself;
   they were false. The Synod rehabilitated him completely: "Now since we
   have been satisfied by our examination in our presence of Pelagius the
   monk, and he assents to godly doctrines, while condemning those things
   contrary to the faith of the Church, we acknowledge him to belong to
   our ecclesiastical and Catholic Communion." [334]

   No one can blame the Synod: [335] Pelagius had, in fact, given
   expression to its own ideas; Augustinianism was neither known nor
   understood; and the "heresy of Cælestius" [336] was condemned. [337]

   But Pelagius now found it necessary to defend himself to his own
   adherents. While on the one hand he was zealous in promoting in the
   West the effect of the impression produced by the decision in his
   favour, he wrote to a friendly priest, [338] that his statement, "that
   a man can be without sin and keep the commands of God easily [339] if
   he will," had been recognised as orthodox. His work, De natura, made
   its appearance at the same time, and he further published four books,
   De libero arbitrio, [340] which, while written with all caution,
   disclosed his standpoint more clearly than his earlier ones. [341]

   But North Africa [342] did not acquiesce in what had taken place. The
   prestige of the West and orthodoxy were endangered. Synods were held in
   A.D. 416 at Carthage and Mileve, Augustine being also present at the
   latter. Both turned to Innocent of Rome, to whom Cælestius had appealed
   long before. Soon after the epistles of the two Synods (Aug. epp. 175,
   176,) the Pope received a third from five African Bishops, of whom
   Augustine was one (Ep. 177). [343] It was evidently feared that
   Pelagius might have influential friends in Rome. [344] The letters
   referred to the condemnation, five years before, of Cælestius; they
   pointed out that the Biblical doctrine of grace and the doctrine of
   baptism were in danger, and demanded that, no matter how Pelagius might
   express himself, those should be excommunicated who taught that man
   could overcome sin and keep God's commands by virtue of his own nature,
   or that baptism did not deliver children from a state of sin. It was
   necessary to defeat the enemies of God's grace. It was not a question
   of expelling Pelagius and Cælestius, but of opposing a dangerous
   heresy. [345]

   The Pope had, perhaps, never yet received petitions from North African
   Synods which laid such stress on the importance of the Roman Chair.
   Innocent sought to forge the iron while it was hot. In his four replies
   (Aug. Epp. 181-184 = Innoc. Epp. 30-33) he first congratulated the
   Africans on having acted on the ancient rule, "that no matter might be
   finally decided, even in the most remote provinces, until the Roman
   Chair had been informed of it, in order that every just decision might
   be confirmed by its authority;" for truth issued from Rome, and thence
   was communicated in tiny streams to the other Churches. The Pope then
   praised their zeal against heretics, declared it impious to deny the
   necessity of divine grace, or to promise eternal life to children
   without baptism; he who thought otherwise was to be expelled from the
   Church, unless he performed due penance. "Therefore (Ep. 31, 6) we
   declare in virtue of our Apostolic authority that Pelagius and
   Cælestius are excluded from the communion of the Church until they
   deliver themselves from the snares of the devil;" if they did so, they
   were not to be refused readmission. Any adherents of Pelagius who might
   be in Rome would not venture to take his part after this condemnation;
   besides, the acquittal of the man in the East was not certain; nothing
   indubitably authentic had been laid before him, the Pope, and it
   appeared even from the proceedings, if they were genuine, that Pelagius
   had got off by evasions; if he felt himself to be innocent, he would
   have hastened to Rome that he might be acquitted by us; he would not
   summon him, however; those among whom he resided might try him once
   more; if he recanted, they could not condemn him; there lurked much
   that was blasphemous, but still more that was superfluous, in the book,
   De Natura; "what orthodox believer might not argue most copiously about
   the potentiality of nature, free-will, the whole grace of God and daily
   grace?" [346] He who can read between the lines will readily observe
   that the Pope left more than one back-door open, and had no real
   interest in the controversy. [347]

   Pelagius now sent his remarkably well-composed confession of faith
   [348] to Rome, along with an elaborate vindication of himself. [349]
   The accusation that he refused baptism to children, or promised them
   admission to heaven without it, and that he taught that men could
   easily fulfil the divine commands, he declared to be a calumny invented
   by his enemies. As already at Diospolis, so now he guarded himself
   against the worst charges, though they were not indeed unwarranted,
   partly by mental reservations, and partly by modifications; but we
   cannot say that he was unfaithful to his main conception. He declared
   that all men had received the power to will aright from God, but that
   the divine aid (adjutorium) only operated in the case of Christians. It
   was blasphemous to maintain that God had given impossible commands to
   men. He took his stand between Augustine and Jovinian. This letter did
   not reach Innocent, he having died. It was thus received by his
   successor Zosimus. Cælestius, who had come to Rome and submitted a
   Libellus fidei that left nothing to be desired in point of submission
   to the Pope, vindicated himself to the latter. Cælestius, on the whole,
   seems now, when matters had become critical, to have sounded the
   retreat; [350] he at least modified his statements, and took care not
   to come into conflict with the theory, deducible from the Church's
   practice, that infant baptism did away with sin. [351] After these
   similar declarations of the two friends, Zosimus did not see that the
   dogma or Church practice of baptism was endangered in any respect. At a
   Roman Synod (417), Cælestius, who was ready to condemn everything
   banned by the Pope, was rehabilitated; [352] and Pelagius, for whom
   Orientals interceded, was likewise declared to have cleared himself.
   The complainants were described as worthless beings, and the Africans
   were blamed for deciding too hastily; they were called upon to prove
   their charges within two months. This result was communicated in two
   letters [353] to the African Bishops. [354] They were told that
   Pelagius had never been separated from the Church, and that if there
   had been great joy over the return of the lost son, how much greater
   should be the joy of believing that those about whom false reports had
   been circulated were neither dead nor lost (Ep. 4, 8)!

   The Carthaginians were indignant, but not discouraged. A Synod (417)
   determined to adhere to the condemnation until it was ascertained that
   both heretics saw in grace not merely an enlightenment of the
   intellect, but the only power for good (righteousness), without which
   we can have absolutely no true religion in thought, speech, and action.
   [355] This resolution was conveyed to Zosimus. Paulinus of Milan
   declared at the same time in a letter to the Pope that he would not
   come to Rome to prosecute Cælestius, for the case had been already
   decided. [356] This energetic opposition made the Pope cautious. In his
   reply, [357] he glorified Peter and his office in eloquent language,
   but changed his whole procedure, declaring now that the Africans were
   under a mistake if they believed that he had trusted Cælestius [358] in
   everything, and had already come to a decision. The case had not yet
   been prejudiced, and was in the same position as before (March, 418).
   Immediately after the arrival of this letter in Africa, a great Council
   was held there--more than 200 Bishops being present--and Pelagianism
   was condemned, without consulting the Pope, in 8 (9) unequivocal
   Canons; [359] indeed, such was the indignation felt against
   Zosimus--and on different grounds--that the Council, in its 17 Canon,
   threatened with excommunication any appeal to Rome. [360] But it had
   first assured itself of the Emperor's support, who had published on the
   30th April, 418, an edict to the Prefect of the Prætorium, banishing
   the new heretics with their followers from Rome, permitting their
   prosecution, and threatening the guilty with stringent penalties. [361]

   Zosimus, whose action had been hitherto influenced by the strength of
   Pelagius' party in Rome, now laid down his arms. In his Ep. tractatoria
   to all the Churches, [362] he informed them of the excommunication of
   Cælestius and Pelagius, was now convinced that the doctrines of the
   absolute importance of justifying grace, and of original sin, belonged
   to the faith (de fide), and required all Bishops to signify their
   assent by their signatures. But eighteen Bishops refused; [363] they
   appealed to a General Council, and recalled with reason the fact that
   the Pope had himself formerly considered a thorough conference to be
   necessary. In their name Julian of Eclanum wrote two bold letters to
   the Pope, [364] while also rejecting the propositions once set up by
   Cælestius. [365] From now onwards the stage was occupied by this "most
   confident young man," for whom Augustine, a friend of his family,
   possessed so much natural sympathy, and whom, in spite of his rudeness,
   he always treated, as long as the case lasted, affectionately and
   gently. [366] At the instigation of the new Pope, Boniface, Augustine
   refuted one of the letters sent to Rome and circulated in Italy, as
   well as another by Julian (addressed to Rufus of Thessalonica) in his
   work c. duas epp. Pelagianorum (420). Julian, who had resigned or been
   deposed from his bishopric, now took up his sharp and restless pen. No
   one else pressed Augustine so hard as he; he compelled him to work out
   the consequences of his line of thought; he displayed inexorably the
   contradictions in his works, and showed how untenable was the great
   man's doctrine when it was fully developed; he pointed out the traces
   of a Manichæan type of thinking in Augustine, traces of which the
   latter tried in vain to get rid. He could indeed explain that he did
   not mean them, but could not show that they were not there. Julian's
   charge that Augustine's teaching desecrated marriage had made an
   impression on the powerful Comes Valerius in Rome. Augustine sought to
   weaken the force of the charge in his writing, De nuptiis et
   concupiscentia, Lib. I.; but Julian now wrote a work in four volumes
   against the treatise. Augustine based a reply on extracts from the
   latter (De nupt. et concup., 1. II.), and when he received the work
   itself, he substituted, for this preliminary answer, a new work: Libri
   sex c. Julianum hæresis Pelagianæ defensorem. Julian replied to the
   "Preliminary pamphlet" with a work in eight volumes (written already in
   Cilicia). Augustine was engaged with the answer to this work, Opus
   imperf. c. Julianum (l. sex), up to his death. Since he follows Julian
   almost sentence by sentence, we possess the most accurate information
   as to the latter's positions. [367] In his latest years, Augustine
   composed other four writings which are not aimed directly at the
   Pelagians, but discuss objections raised against his own doctrine by
   Catholics or Semi-Pelagians [368] (De gratia et libero arbitrio; De
   correptione et gratia: to the monks of Hadrumetum; De prædestinatione
   sanctorum and De dono perseverantiæ: to Prosper and Hilary as against
   the Gallic monks). In these works the doctrine of predestinating grace
   is worked out in its strictest form.

   The Pelagians nowhere came to form a sect or schismatical party. [369]
   They were suppressed in the years after A.D. 418, without it being
   necessary to apply any special force. The Emperor once more published a
   sharp edict. Cælestius, who had hitherto escaped punishment, was still
   chiefly dealt with. He was forbidden to reside in Italy, and sentence
   of exile was pronounced on anyone who should harbour him. Pelagius is
   said to have been condemned by a Synod in Antioch. But this
   information, given by Marius, is uncertain. He disappears from history.
   [370] Julian and other Pelagians took refuge with Theodore in Cilicia.
   There they were at first left in peace; for either the controversy was
   not understood, or the attitude to Augustinianism was hostile. The
   indefatigable Cælestius was able in A.D. 424 to demand once more an
   inquiry in Rome from Bishop Cælestine, but then betook himself, without
   having obtained his object, to Constantinople, where, since Julian and
   other friends were also assembled, the party now pitched their
   headquarters. [371] The Patriarch Nestorius joined hands with them, a
   proceeding fatal to both sides; for Nestorius thereby incurred the
   displeasure of the Pope, and the Pelagians fell into the ranks of the
   enemies of the dominant party in the East (Cyril's). Marius Mercator
   agitated successfully against them at the Court, and in the comedy at
   Ephesus Cyril obliged the Roman legates by getting the Council to
   condemn the doctrine of Cælestius, Rome having concurred in his
   condemnation of Nestorius. [372] Thus Pelagianism had brought upon
   itself a kind of universal anathema, while in the East there were
   perhaps not even a dozen Christians who really disapproved of it, [373]
   and the West, in turn, was by no means clear as to the consequences to
   which it would necessarily be led by the condemnation of the Pelagians.

   II. As regards the history of dogma, the "system" of Pelagianism, i.e.
   of Julian of Eclanum, is tolerably indifferent; for it was only
   produced after the whole question was already decided, and its author
   was a theologian, who, by renouncing his ecclesiastical office, had
   himself thrown away much of his claim to be considered. From the
   standpoint of the history of dogma, the controversy closed simply with
   rejection of the doctrines, (1) that God's grace (in Christ) was not
   absolutely necessary--before and after baptism--for the salvation of
   every man, and (2) that the baptism of infants was not in the fullest
   sense a baptism for remission of sins (in remissionem peccatorum). The
   contrary doctrines were the new "dogmas." But, since those two
   doctrines and the main theses of Pelagianism involved a multitude of
   consequences, and since some of these consequences were even then
   apparent, while others afterwards occupied the Church up till and
   beyond the Reformation, it is advisable to point out the fundamental
   features of the Pelagian system, and the contrary teaching of
   Augustinianism. [374] In doing so we have to remember that Pelagius
   would have nothing to do with a system. To him "De fide" (of the faith)
   meant simply the orthodox dogma and the ability of man to do the good.
   All else were open questions which might be answered in the affirmative
   or negative, among the rest original sin, which he denied. He laid sole
   stress on preaching practical Christianity, i.e., the monastic life, to
   a corrupt and worldly Christendom, and on depriving it of the pretext
   that it was impossible to fulfil the divine commands. Cælestius, at one
   with his teacher in this respect, attacked original sin more
   energetically, and fought by the aid of definitions and syllogisms
   theological doctrines which he held to be pernicious. But Julian was
   the first to develop their mode of thought systematically, and to
   elevate it into a Stoic Christian system. [375] Yet he really added
   nothing essential to what occurs scattered through the writings of
   Pelagius and Cælestius. He only gave it all a naturalistic tendency,
   i.e., he did away with the monastic intention of the type of thought.
   But even in Pelagius, arguments occur which completely contradict the
   ascetic monastic conception. In his letter to Demetrius he shows that
   fasting, abstinence and prayer are not of such great importance; they
   should not be carried to excess, as is often done by beginners;
   moderation should be observed in all things, therefore even in good
   works. The main thing is to change one's morals and to practise every
   kind of virtue. And thus no one is to think that the vow of chastity
   can let him dispense with the practice of spiritual virtues and the
   fight with anger, vanity, and pride, etc. It was the actual development
   of the character in goodness on which he laid stress. The monastic idea
   appears subordinate to this thought, which in some passages is
   expressed eloquently. The ancient call to wise moderation has not a
   naturalistic impress in Pelagius. In treating the thought of these
   three men as a whole we have to remember this distinction, as also the
   fact that Pelagius and Cælestius for the most part paid due heed to
   Church practice, and besides avoided almost entirely any appeal to the
   ancient philosophers. [376] They were all actuated by a courageous
   confidence in man's capacity for goodness, along with the need for
   clearness of thought on religious and moral questions.

   1. God's highest attributes are his goodness and justice, and, in fact,
   righteousness is the quality without which God cannot be thought of at
   all; indeed, it can even be said that there is a God, because there is
   righteousness. [377] "Justice, as it is wont to be defined by the
   learned (s. Aristotle) and as we can understand, is (if the Stoics will
   allow us to prefer one to the other) the greatest of all virtues,
   discharging diligently the duty of restoring his own to each, without
   fraud, without favour." [378] Its genus is God; its species are the
   promulgation and administration of the laws; its difference consists in
   its being regulated by circumstances; its modus in its not requiring
   from anyone more than his powers permit, and in not excluding mercy;
   its quality in sweetness to pious souls. This notion of righteousness
   is so sure that it appears also to be ideally superior to Holy
   Scripture (see Op. imperf. II. 17): "Nothing can be proved by the
   sacred writings which righteousness cannot support." [379]

   2. It follows, from the goodness and righteousness of God, that
   everything created by him is good--and that not only at the
   beginning--but what he now creates is likewise good. [380] Accordingly,
   the creature is good, and so also are marriage, the law, free will, and
   the saints. [381]

   3. Nature, which was created good, is not convertible, "because the
   things of nature persist from the beginning of existence (substance) to
   its end." [382] "Natural properties are not converted by accident."
   [383] Accordingly, there can be no "natural sins" (peccata naturalia);
   for they could only have arisen if nature had become evil.

   4. Human nature is thus indestructibly good, and can only be modified
   accidentally. To its constitution belongs--and that was very good--the
   will as free choice; for "willing is nothing but a movement of the mind
   without any compulsion." [384] This free choice, with which reason is
   implied, [385] is the highest good in man's constitution, "he who
   upholds grace praises human nature." [386] We know that Pelagius always
   began in his sermons by praising man's glorious constitution, his
   nature which shows itself in free will [387] and reason, and he never
   wearied of extolling our "condition of willing" (conditio voluntatis),
   as contrasted with the "condition of necessity" (conditio necessitatis)
   of irrational creatures. "Nature was created so good that it needs no
   help." [388] With reason as guide (duce ratione) man can and should do
   the good, i.e., righteousness (jus humanæ societatis). [389] God
   desires a voluntary performer of righteousness (voluntarius executor
   justitiæ); it is his will that we be capable of both, and that we do
   one. According to Pelagius freedom of will is freedom to choose the
   good; according to Julian it is simply freedom of choice. The
   possibility of good as a natural faculty is from God, [390] willing and
   action are our business; [391] the possibility of both (possibilitas
   utriusque) is as a psychological faculty inevitable (a necessario); for
   this very reason a continual change is possible in it. [392]

   5. Evil, sin, is willing to do that which righteousness forbids, and
   from which we are free to abstain, [393] accordingly what we can avoid.
   [394] It is no element or body, no nature--in that case God would be
   its author; nor is it a perverted nature (natura conversa), but it is
   always a momentary self-determination of the will, which can never pass
   into nature so as to give the to an evil nature. [395] But if this
   cannot happen, so much the less can evil be inherited; for that would
   do away with the goodness and righteousness of God, the notion of sin
   (as that which can be avoided), and the notion of redemption; a
   "natural" guilt could never be got rid of. [396]

   6. Pelagius deduced the actual existence of sin from the snares of the
   devil and sensuous lusts (gula and libido), and condemned concupiscence
   accordingly. It was necessary to overcome it by virginity and
   continence. It sprang not from the substance of the flesh (de
   substantia carnis), but from its works (ex operibus carnis), otherwise
   God would be its author. Pelagius took a serious view of this whole
   matter; but he was certain, on the other hand, that the body was
   subject to the soul, and that thus the relationship willed by God could
   be restored. [397] But Julian felt that this was a vexed point. Whence
   came the evil desires of the flesh (desideria carnis mala) if the
   substance was good, and if it was yet manifest that they frequently did
   not spring from the will? The case of marriage, which is unthinkable
   without sexual desire, showed Julian that libido was permitted by God,
   and he attacked inexorably the artificial distinctions which Augustine
   sought and was compelled to make between nuptiæ and concupiscentia.
   [398] Julian taught that concupiscence was in itself indifferent and
   innocent; for the actual creation was of all conceivable kinds the
   best; but this creation embraced sexual and all other desires. [399]
   Libido was guilty non in genere suo, non in specie, non in modo, but
   only in excessu; genus and species were from God, the modus depended on
   an honest decision (arbitrium honestatis), excess followed from a fault
   of will (vitium voluntatis). [400] If it were otherwise, then baptism
   would necessarily eradicate, and not merely regulate, concupiscence.
   [401] Accordingly the latter, within limits (intra modum), was good;
   [402] he who used it moderately, used a blessing rightly; he who
   indulged in it immoderately, used a blessing badly; but he who from
   love to virginity despised even moderate indulgence, did not thereby
   use a good thing better. [403] The shame alluded to by Augustine, which
   is felt even at the lawful enjoyment of desire, was explained by
   Julian, following the Cynics, as mere convention and custom. [404]
   Christ himself possessed concupiscence. [405]

   7. It follows from this teaching that there can always have been
   sinless men: [406] Pelagius, indeed, argued further that since every
   man could resist sin (easily), he who sinned passed into hell at the
   Judgment; [407] for every sin was really mortal, the sinner having
   acted against his ability to do better. Julian, moreover, taught that
   every excess was a mortal sin, since it was done absolutely without
   compulsion. [408] In the end, it is said, God punishes the wicked and
   rewards the virtuous. But it remains wholly obscure how there can exist
   virtue (righteousness) and sin at all if, in practising them, a
   character can never be gained, if we are only concerned with
   fragmentary actions from which no deposit is left or sum-total formed.

   In the foregoing the fundamental conceptions of the Pelagians are
   described. But they were also, of course, Catholic Christians; they
   were accordingly compelled to harmonise these doctrines of theirs with
   Holy Scripture and its historical contents, with Christ and the
   teaching of the Church. How they did so we have still briefly to
   discuss in what follows. It is apparent that the difficulties in
   showing this agreement were extraordinarily great, and, indeed, not
   only for them, but for everyone who would harmonise a coherent rational
   doctrine with Gen. I.-III., and with hundreds of passages in Scripture.

   8. Adam was created with free will--according to Pelagiusalso with
   "what is called natural holiness" (naturalis quæ dicitur sanctitas),
   which consisted just in free will and reason. Julian considered this
   state to be morally very high and intellectually low. [409] All are,
   however, agreed that Adam's endowments were the peculiar and
   inalienable gift of divine grace (gratia).

   9. Adam sinned through free will (Julian esteemed this sin of slight
   account); [410] but by this sin his nature was not corrupted. Nor was
   natural death a consequence of it, for it is natural; but spiritual
   death, the condemnation of the soul on account of sin, was the result
   of sin. [411]

   10. Natural death was accordingly not inherited from Adam; moreover,
   spiritual death was only in so far as his descendants likewise sinned.
   If all men died through Adam's death, then all would necessarily rise
   again through the resurrection of Christ. [412]

   11. Still much less was Adam's sin or guilt transmitted. The doctrine
   of transmitted and original sin (tradux peccati and peccatum originis)
   is Manichæan and blasphemous; it is equally absurd whether viewed in
   relation to God, or man, or the notion of sin, or Christ, or Holy
   Scripture. In relation to God, for his righteousness is annulled by
   imputing the sins of others, and regarding as sinful a nature that has
   not yet sinned, just as much as it would be by ushering into the world,
   laden with sin, human beings born after Adam's fall. In relation to
   man, for a vitiated nature is then equivalent to a bad nature; if a
   nature possesses evil, it is bad; but in that case the guilt falls upon
   God, for he is responsible for our nature; further, sin could only
   propagate itself, if we assumed a procreation of souls; but this
   assumption is absurd; finally, if sin is propagated through marriage,
   so that desire in marriage is and transmits sin, marriage is thereby
   condemned. In relation to the notion of sin, for sin is absolutely
   embraced by the will, so that it does not exist at all, where there is
   no free-will; further, even if it could propagate itself, it could not
   be transmitted by baptised parents; lastly, Augustine's contention that
   sin is itself used by God as a punishment of sin, that there is a
   divine law of sin, etc., is absurd and immoral. In relation to Christ,
   for were nature bad, it could not be redeemed, or, were there an
   inherited sin which became natural to man, Christ also must have
   possessed it. In relation to Holy Scripture, as countless passages show
   that sin is a matter of the will, and that God punishes each for his
   own sins alone. Rom. V. 12, merely asserts that all die because they
   themselves sin like Adam, or something similar; in any case it contains
   nothing to support inherited sin. [413]

   12. Thus all men created by God are in the position in which Adam was
   before the fall. [414] An unessential difference exists only in so far
   as Adam possessed at once the use of reason, while children do not;
   that Adam was still untaught, while children are born into a society in
   which the custom of evil prevails. Pelagius at least teaches this.
   [415] The mere capacity city of either (mera capacitas utriusque) is
   the original innocence. [416]

   13. The habit of sinning, working by example, according to Pelagius,
   weakens the will (?). Yet nothing can be said as to how it really
   works; for otherwise the indifference of the will [417] is destroyed.
   Probably the meaning was that the possibility of good remained wholly
   intact, but the habit of sinning darkened reason. [418]

   14. It is when we come to discuss grace that it is hardest to reproduce
   the view of the Pelagians; for it was here that they found it most
   necessary to accommodate their opinions. Very strong assertions occur
   in Pelagius and Julian--Cælestius was more reserved [419] --as to the
   necessity of divine grace (adjutorium) for every good work. [420] We
   also find statements to the effect that grace facilitated goodness.
   [421] Finally, others occur which teach that grace is superfluous, nay,
   strictly speaking, in itself impossible. [422] It is no injustice to
   the Pelagians to take the two latter positions, which, to a certain
   extent can be combined, as giving their true opinion; for it was
   assuredly the chief intention of Pelagius to deprive Christians of
   their indolent reliance on grace, and Julian's main object was to show
   that the human constitution bore merit and salvation in its own lap.
   The proposition "homo libero arbitrio emancipatus a deo" really
   contains the protest against any grace. [423]

   15. By grace we have throughout to understand in the first place the
   grace of creation; [424] it is so glorious that there have been perfect
   men even among heathens and Jews. [425]

   16. In the second place, it denotes the law (lex) of God; indeed, all
   grace, in so far as it is not nature, can at bottom have no other
   character than that of illumination and instruction (doctrina). This
   facilitates the doing of the good. [426]

   17. Thirdly, grace means the grace of God through Christ. This also is
   at bottom illuminatio et doctrina; [427] Christ works by his example.
   [428] Pelagius and Julian admit that the habit of sinning was so great
   that Christ's appearance was necessary. [429] Julian's conception of
   this appearance was that Christ owed what he became to his free will.
   [430] But it was necessary, over and above instruction (doctrina), to
   assume, in conformity with Church teaching and practice, an effective
   action through Christ on the part of God. The Pelagians did not deny
   that this was represented in baptism and the remissions granted by God;
   they taught the forgiveness of sins through baptism. But they could not
   show wherein this forgiveness consisted without coming into conflict
   with freedom. As regards infant baptism, they dared no longer dispute
   its necessity; indeed, they dared no longer flatly declare that it was
   not given for the remission of sins. They derived a certain
   consecration and sanctification from it, but they disputed the doctrine
   that children dying unbaptised were lost; these would only fail to
   enter the kingdom of heaven, the highest grade of felicity. [431]

   18. Finally, the Pelagians taught that this grace through Christ was
   compatible with the righteousness (justitia) of God, because the latter
   did not preclude an increase of benefits, [432] but that grace was
   given secundum merita (according to the merits of the rational spirit)
   because in any other case God would have been unjust. [433] The
   contention, however, that it was absolutely necessary was never
   seriously advocated by them, and was frequently denied, and in the
   thesis that the operation of the gospel is not different from that of
   the law, the former is in point of fact completely reduced to the level
   of the latter. But the law is itself nothing but a crutch not necessary
   to everyone. Man is to be sinless: this state we can attain by our
   will; but sinlessness (impeccantia) is rendered easy to the Christian;
   for by looking to Christ he can easily turn, and in baptism, the
   mysteries, dogmas, and the commandments, he from the first possesses
   nothing but means to promote virtue. All that Christ did and the Church
   does is considered not as action but as teaching.

   The Pelagians deserve respect for their purity of motive, their horror
   of the Manichæan leaven and the opus operatum, their insistence on
   clearness, and their intention to defend the Deity. [434] But we cannot
   but decide that their doctrine fails to recognise the misery of sin and
   evil, that in its deepest roots it is godless, that it knows, and seeks
   to know, nothing of redemption, and that it is dominated by an empty
   formalism (a notional mythology) which does justice at no single point
   to actual quantities, and on a closer examination consists of sheer
   contradictions. In the form in which this doctrine was expressed by
   Pelagius--and in part also by Julian--i.e., with all the accommodations
   to which he condescended, it was not a novelty. [435] But in its
   fundamental thought it was; or, rather, it was an innovation because it
   abandoned, in spite of all accommodations in expression, the pole of
   the mystical doctrine of redemption, which the Church had steadfastly
   maintained side by side with the doctrine of freedom. [436]

   III. The fundamental notion of Pelagianism is nature embracing free
   will (liberum arbitrium); the fundamental notion of Augustinianism is
   grace, and in the Pelagian controversy the grace of God through Christ.
   [437] In Pelagianism the doctrine of grace amounts to an "appendix"
   badly connected with the main subject; in Augustinianism the doctrine
   of nature is beset with contradictions, because it is impossible to
   give a rational account of nature and history from the standpoint of
   the grace of experience. For it is absolutely impossible to develop as
   a rational doctrine the conviction of the transforming grace of God who
   is also the creator; it must begin and end with the confession: "How
   incomprehensible are God's judgments and how inscrutable his ways!"
   Augustine, sneered at as "Aristoteles Poenorum" as "philosophaster
   Poenorum" (Op. imperf. III. 198, V. 11), knew this also. But living in
   an age when it was held to be culpable ignorance and unbelief not to
   answer all possible questions, and penetrated by the vulgar conviction
   that Holy Scripture solved all problems, he, too, made the highest
   facts and the feelings of the inner life which he had gained in the
   gospel the starting-point of a description of "primitive history" and
   the history of mankind that could not but end in contradictions. At the
   same time, the pathological experiences of the course of his life are
   mirrored in this description. The stream of living water still bears in
   its depths traces of the gloomy banks past which it once had flowed,
   and into which it had almost sunk. [438]

   1. Mankind is, as experience shows, a "mass of sin" [massa peccati
   (perditionis)], waited on by death, and incapable of raising itself to
   the good; for having revolted from God, it could no more return to him
   than an empty vessel could refill itself. But in Christ the
   Redeemer--and in him alone--the grace of God manifested itself and
   entered on the work of man's deliverance. Christ by his death removed
   the gulf between God and mankind--breaking the rule of the devil--so
   that the grace of God, which for that reason is gratia per (propter)
   Christum, could pursue its work. [439] This free grace (gratia gratis
   data) [440] working in the Church, is beginning, middle, and end. Its
   aim is the rescue from the massa perditionis, that as guilty falls
   justly a prey to eternal death, of a fixed number of elect (certus
   numerus electorum), who enter eternal life. They are saved because God,
   in virtue of his eternal decree of salvation, has predestinated,
   chosen, called, justified, sanctified, and preserved them. [441] This
   is done through grace, which thus is (1) prevenient; [442] for it must
   first create the good will (faith). [443] (This prevenient grace can be
   combined with "the call" (vocatio); [444] but we must even here
   remember that the call comes to some who are not "called according to
   the purpose." [445] In the strict sense the whole transactions of grace
   apply only to those who are predestinated; [446] in the wider sense,
   grace operates as far as sanctification in a much greater circle, who,
   however, finally perish, because they have not received its last work.)
   [447] Augustine has inserted his whole religious experience in the
   confession of free and prevenient grace. He nowhere speaks with greater
   conviction, more simply and grandly, than where he praises the grace
   that snatches man from his sinful condition. But grace (2) works
   co-operatively. [448] This work evolves itself in a series of stages,
   since naturally it is only possible slowly and gradually to reach the
   goal whose attainment is desired, viz., the perseverance and complete
   and actual regeneration of man [449] --re-creation into good
   men--accordingly his being rendered capable of doing good works of
   piety and possessing merit. The calling (vocatio) first results in
   faith as God's gift. This faith is itself subject to growth, i.e., it
   begins as unquestioning acceptance based on the authority of the Church
   and Scripture; it presents itself further as obedience, then trust
   (fiducia) believing God, belief about God, belief on God (credere deum,
   credere de deo, credere in deum) and as such passes into love. [450]
   Parallel with this goes the effective (visible) action of grace in the
   Church, [451] which begins with the remission of sins. [452] This is
   administered in baptism, and since the latter removes the guilt of
   original sin, [453] and blots out sins previously committed, it is the
   "bath of regeneration." But it is so only as an initiatory act; for the
   actual justification, which corresponds to co-operating grace, is not
   yet gained, where sin is no longer imputed, but only where the
   irreligious man has become just, where accordingly an actual renovation
   has taken place. This is effected through the infusion of love into the
   heart by the Holy Spirit, and this love substitutes good for evil
   desire (concupiscence). That is, the man now not only makes the joyful
   confession: "To me to cleave to God is a good thing," and delights in
   God as the summum bonum, instead of in perishable possessions (the
   humility of faith, love and hope in place of pride of heart), but gains
   also the power to do good works. This new frame of mind and capacity,
   which grace begets through the gift of the Holy Spirit, is the
   experience of justification by faith (justificatio ex fide). [454]

   Justification is an act that takes place once for all, and is completed
   sub specie æternitatis, and with reference to the fact that everything
   can be comprised in faith. As an empirical experience, however, it is a
   process never completed in this world, because the being replenished
   with faith, which through love labours to effect the complete
   transformation of man, is itself subject to limitation in our present
   life. [455] This operation of the spirit of love has its parallel in
   the effective (visible) dealings of grace in the Church, and that in
   the Lord's Supper (the incorporation into the love and unity of
   Christ's body) as well as in the Eucharistic sacrifice, penance, and
   Church works, so far as these are capable of blotting out sin. [456]
   These works, however, possess still another value. Renunciation of
   worldly pleasure is only completed in asceticism, and since at the
   Judgment God will deal with us in accordance with our works, the
   completion of justification can only consist in the sanctification, in
   virtue of which particular possessions--marriage, property, etc.--are
   wholly abandoned. It is not, indeed, absolutely necessary for everyone
   to fulfil the counsels of the gospel (consilia evangelica); we can live
   in faith, hope, and love without them. God's grace does not make
   everyone a saint, [457] to be worshipped, and to be implored to
   intercede for us. But everybody who is to be crowned must ultimately
   possess merits in some degree; for, at the Judgment, merits will alone
   be crowned, these ever being, indeed, like all good, God's gifts. [458]
   But the perseverance of the elect in love through the whole course of
   their life until the Judgment is (3) the highest and last gift of
   grace, which now appears as irresistible. Perseverance to the end is
   the good, without which all that went before is nothing. Therefore, in
   a sense, it alone is grace; for only those are finally saved who have
   obtained this irresistible grace. The called who do not possess it are
   lost. But why only a few obtain this gift, though it is bestowed
   secundum merita, is God's secret. [459] Eternal life and eternal
   damnation are decreed by one and the same justice. [460]

   2. The doctrine of sin, the Fall, and the primitive state is sketched
   from the standpoint of free and prevenient grace. It follows from the
   doctrine of grace that sin characterises mankind as they now exist. Sin
   presents itself essentially as being without God (carentia dei), the
   voluntary diminution of strength of being. [461] The failure to possess
   God (privatio boni), the non inhærere deo, constitutes sin, and,
   indeed, the two thoughts--the one metaphysical, that sin is defect of
   being, the other ethical, that it is defect of goodness--coincide as we
   reflect on them, [462] just as in the examination of grace the
   metaphysical (the finding of being from not-being) and the
   ethico-religious elements always accord. This sin is a state: the
   wretched necessity of being unable to refrain from sinning (misera
   necessitas non posse non peccandi). Freedom in the sense of free choice
   is not destroyed; [463] but the freedom still existing always leads to
   sin; and this state is all the more dreadful, as there exists a certain
   knowledge of the good, nay, even a powerless desire for it, which
   invariably succumbs. [464] Positively, however, the sinful state
   presents itself as the rule of the devil over men, as pride [465] and
   concupiscence. [466] From that rule it follows that man must be
   redeemed from without before he can be helped. [467] Pride in relation
   to God and concupiscence show that man is sinful in soul and body. Yet
   the emphasis falls on concupiscence; [468] it is the lower desire,
   sensuous lust, which shows itself above all in the lust of the flesh.
   The motus genitalium, independent even of the will, teaches us that
   nature is corrupt; it has not become vice (vitium), but it is vitiated
   (natura vitiata). [469] It therefore propagates sin. That it does so is
   attested by the evidence of the senses, the sensuous, and therefore
   sinful pleasure in the act of procreation, and by Holy Scripture (Rom.
   V. 12 f.). Thus mankind is a massa perditionis also in the sense that
   it procreates sin in itself from a corrupt nature. But since the soul
   in all probability is not procreated at the same time, it is in each
   case created by God, [470] so the body, begotten in the lust of the
   flesh, is quite essentially the bearer of sin. [471] That the latter
   thus descends is decreed by God; for sin is not always merely sin, but
   also, or often only, the punishment of sin (peccatum and malum combine
   in the sense of evil). [472] The sin which descends in the massa
   perditionis (peccatum originis, tradux peccati) is at once sin and
   sin's punishment. This has been ordained by him who decreed sins (the
   "ordinator peccatorum)." Every desire involves infatuation. It is the
   penalty of sin that we do the evil we would not. Every sin carries with
   it dissolution, the death of the sinner. It rends and dismembers him,
   it empties him and exhausts him, until he no longer exists. Thus death
   reigns in its various forms, till it reaches eternal death, in the
   massa perditionis. This humanity which is subject to the dreary
   necessity of not being able to refrain from sin (non posse non peccare)
   is therefore also and at the same time subject to the dreadful
   necessity of not being able to escape death (non posse non mori). [473]
   No power of its own can rescue it. Its best deeds are all stained from
   the roots; therefore they are nothing but splendid vices. Its youngest
   offspring, even if they have done nothing sinful, must necessarily be
   lost; for since they possess original sin, i.e., are destitute of God,
   and are burdened with concupiscence, they pass justly into damnation.
   [474] This is attested also by the Church when it baptises newly-born
   children. [475]

   How did this state arise--a state which could not have been due to God
   the creator? Scripture and the Church answer: through Adam's Fall. The
   magnitude of this Fall had already been depicted in the Church; but
   from his standpoint Augustine had rightly to say that Adam's sin, and
   therewith sin in general, had not yet been duly perceived--yet the
   Church, as its institutions prove, had, it was alleged, appreciated it
   truly; writers, however, had fallen short of this estimate. Adam's Fall
   was inconceivably great. [476] When, in the hope of becoming like God,
   he transgressed God's command not to eat the apple, all conceivable
   sins were compressed into his sin: the revolt to the devil, pride of
   heart, envy, sensuous lust--all in all: self-love in place of love of
   God. [477] And it was all the more dreadful, as it was easy for Adam to
   refrain from sin. [478] Therefore also came the unspeakable misery,
   viz., the punishment of sin, with and in sin, working itself out in
   death. Adam lost the possession of God. [479] This was followed by
   complete deprivation (defectio boni), which is represented as the death
   of the soul; for the latter without God is dead (spiritual death).
   [480] The dead soul is now drawn downwards; it seeks its blessings in
   the mutable and perishable, and is no longer capable of commanding the
   body. The latter then asserted itself with all its wanton impulses, and
   thus corrupted the whole human nature. [481]

   The corruption is manifest in sexual lust, whose sinfulness is
   evidenced by compulsion and shame, and it must be inherited since the
   central seat of nature is disordered. [482] It indeed still continues
   to be capable of redemption--it does not become an evil substance--but
   it is so corrupt that even grace can only blot out the guilt (reatus)
   of original sin; it cannot completely extirpate concupiscence itself in
   the elect, as is proved by the survival of the evil sexual lust. This
   inheriting of sin and of Adam's death is, however, not merely a fact,
   but it is just, because Scripture says that we have all sinned in Adam,
   [483] because all owe their life to sinful lust, [484] and because--God
   is just.

   Adam's Fall presupposes that his previous constitution had been good.
   This is taught, too, by Scripture, and it follows likewise from the
   assurance that God is the creator, and the good creator, of all things.
   [485] If Adam was created good, then he possessed not only everything
   that a rational creature needs (body and soul and their due
   relationship as servant and master, reason and free will), but, above
   all, grace ever supporting and preserving him, the adjutorium, that is
   the bond of union with the living God; for the virtuous man is not
   independent of God; he is only independent when completely dependent on
   God. Adam, accordingly, not only had a free will, but this will was
   influenced in the direction of God. [486] For this very reason he was
   free (in God); but he was also free (able) to will evil; for evil
   springs from freedom. If Adam had not possessed a free will, he would
   have been unable to sin; but in that case he would not have been a
   rational creature. So he possessed the power not to sin, or die, or
   forsake the good (posse non peccare, --mori,--deserere bonum), but this
   through the adjutorium (auxiliary grace) went so far in the direction
   of inability to sin (non posse peccare) that it would have been easy
   for Adam to attain it. [487] Had he attained it by means of free will
   (liberum arbitrium), he would have received perfect blessedness in
   return for the merit involved in his perseverance, he would have
   remained, and escaped death, in Paradise, and would have begotten
   children without sinful lust. We see that the primitive state was meant
   to be portrayed in accordance with the state of grace of the present;
   but an important difference prevailed, since in the former case, the
   adjutorium was only the condition, under which Adam could use his free
   will lastingly in being and doing good, while in the latter, it is the
   power, that, being irresistible, brings fallen man to perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Contemporary criticism on this system may here be briefly summed up.
   Augustine contradicted himself in maintaining that all ability to
   attain goodness had been lost, and in yet admitting that freedom of
   choice--the decisive thing--remained. His notion of freedom was
   self-destructive, since he defined freedom as lasting dependence on
   God. His conception of original sin was self-contradictory, because he
   himself admitted that sin always springs from the will. He was
   compelled to teach Traducianism, which, however, is a heresy. And his
   Scriptural exegesis was arbitrary. In particular, God provokes sins, if
   he punishes sin with sin, and decrees the reign of sin; he is unjust if
   he imputes to men the sins of others, while forgiving them their own,
   and, further, if he accepts some, and not others, just as he pleases.
   This contention leads to despair. Above all, however, the doctrine of
   original sin leads to Manichæan dualism, which Augustine never
   surmounted, and is accordingly an impious and foolish dogma. For, turn
   as he will, Augustine affirms an evil nature, and therewith a diabolic
   creator of the world. His doctrine of concupiscence conduces to the
   same view. Besides, he depreciates the glorious gift of human freedom,
   nay, even divine grace in Christ, since he holds that original sin is
   never entirely removed. Finally, his doctrines of the exclusive
   efficacy of grace and predestination put an end not only to asceticism
   and the meritoriousness of good works, but also to all human doings. It
   is useless to exhort, intercede for, or blame sinners, etc. In the end,
   even the connection with the Church, which Augustine insisted on so
   energetically in the Donatist controversy, seemed to be superseded.

   Truth and error exist side by side in these observations. Perhaps the
   following considerations will be more pertinent. (1) The impossibility
   of determining the fate of the whole body of mankind and of every
   separate individual from the stand-point of gratia gratis data, is
   shown in the thesis of the damnation of children who die unbaptised.
   Here Augustine impugns the thought of God's righteousness. But this
   thought must become worthless altogether if everything is overruled by
   predestinating and irresistible grace. Thereby a grave injury is
   inflicted on piety. (2) The carrying out of the conception of
   predestinating grace, which should be no more than a sentiment,
   confined to himself, of the redeemed, leads to a determinism that
   conflicts with the gospel and imperils the vigour of our sense of
   freedom. Besides, the assumption of irresistible grace rests above all
   experience, even above that of the believer, and the doctrine of God's
   twofold will (see de grat. et lib. arb. 45) makes everything affecting
   faith uncertain. (3) Augustine did not by any means hold so certainly
   that grace was grace through Christ, as that it proceeded from the
   secret operation of God. The acosmic Neoplatonic element in the
   doctrine of predestination imperilled not only the efficacy of the Word
   and Sacrament (vocatio and justificatio), but also redemption through
   Christ in general. (4) The religious tendency in the system, the belief
   that the decisive point was cleaving or not cleaving to God, received
   in the sequel a new version, and the moral attitude became rather the
   crucial question--the will, of course when freed, was an efficient
   cause of righteousness. For this reason the meaning of forgiveness, of
   the new fundamental relation to God, and of the assurance of faith, was
   misunderstood. The former became an act of initiation, the relation
   became temporary, and the assurance of faith, which even according to
   the doctrine of predestination need not arise, was lost in the
   conception of a process of sanctification never or almost never
   completed in this world, a process to which various grades of
   salvation, just as there were various degrees of damnation,
   corresponded in the world beyond. What a proof of moralism! [488]
   Between the thesis of the ancient (Greek) Church: "Where the knowledge
   of God is, come also life and salvation," and Luther's principle:
   "Where we have forgiveness of sins, we have also life and salvation,"
   we find Augustine's: "Where love is there also follows a salvation
   corresponding to the measure of love." Augustine examined the equation
   remission of sins = grace through Christ, and expressly rejected it.
   This turn he gave his doctrine also explains the contention that God,
   in the end, crowns our merits, a view that conflicts with
   predestinating grace, and opens the door to a refined form of
   righteousness by works. [489] (5) The Neoplatonic notion of God and the
   monastic tendency demand that all love should at the same time present
   itself in the form of asceticism. Thereby love drifts still further
   apart from faith (as fiducia), threatens the sovereignty of the latter,
   and gives free scope for all sorts of popular Catholic conceptions. (6)
   The conception--necessary in the system--of Adam's Fall and original
   sin contains--apart from the mythology which here takes the place of
   history--a bundle of inconsistencies and extremely questionable ideas.
   The latter Augustine also perceived, and he tried, but without success,
   to guard against them. Absolutely Manichæan is the view that man sins
   because he was created from nothing, "nothing" being here treated as an
   evil principle. (The Neoplatonic doctrine also sees in this "nothing"
   the ground of sin; but to it sin is merely finitude. Augustine took a
   more profound view of sin, but he had also to conceive the nilhil as
   "more evil" in proportion, i.e., to convert it into the evil substance
   of Manichism.) Manichæan also is the opinion that sexual desire is
   sinful, and that inherited sin is explained simply from procreation as
   the propagation of a vitiated nature (natura vitiata). [490] Absolutely
   contradictory are the positions that all sin springs from freedom (the
   will), and that children just born are in a state of sin. It is
   extremely suspicious to find that, when sin is more minutely dealt
   with, concupiscence is practically ranked above alienation from God
   (deo non adhærere), this also, indeed, resulting from uncertainty as to
   Traducianism. It again raises our doubts when we see original sin
   treated as if it were more serious than actual sin; for while the
   former can only be washed out by baptism, the latter can be atoned for
   by penance. The whole doctrinal conception at this point shows that the
   conviction of the redeemed, that without God he is lost and unfit to do
   any good work, is a verdict of the believer on himself, a verdict that
   marks a limit, but can never become a principle by which to consider
   the history of mankind. At this point, just because the contradictions
   were so enormous, the development of dogmatic with Augustine was on the
   verge of casting off the immense material in which it had been
   entangled, and of withdrawing from the interpretation of the world and
   history; but as Augustine would not abandon that material, so men will
   not, even at the present day, let it go, because they suppose that the
   Bible protects it, and because they will not learn the humility of
   faith, that shows itself in renunciation of the attempt to decide on
   God's government of the world in history. [491] (7) But apart from
   original sin, Augustine's notion of sin raises doubts, because it is
   constructed at least as much on the thought of God as the supreme and
   true being (summum and verum esse) as on that of his goodness (bonum
   esse). Although the stamp of guilt is not wholly misunderstood, yet it
   is the thought of the misery produced by sin with its destructiveness
   and hideousness that comes to the front. Hence we understand why
   Augustine, passing over justifying faith, perceived the highest good in
   "infused love" (caritas infusa). (8) Finally the doctrine of the
   primitive state is beset by inconsistency, because Augustine could not
   avoid giving grace another meaning in that state from that it possessed
   in the process by which the redeemed is justified. With him grace is
   ultimately identical with irresistible grace--anything else is a
   semblance of it; but though Adam possessed grace, it was not
   irresistible.

   But all these grave objections cannot obscure the greatness of the
   perception that God works in us "to will and to accomplish," that we
   have nothing that we have not received, and that dependence on God is
   good, and is our possession. It is easy to show that in every single
   objectionable theory formulated by Augustine, there lurks a true phase
   of Christian self-criticism, which is only defective because it
   projects into history, or is made the foundation on which to construct
   a "history." Is not the doctrine of predestination an expression of the
   confession: "He who would boast, let him boast in the Lord"? Is not the
   doctrine of original sin based on the thought that behind all separate
   sins there resides sin as want of love, joy, and divine peace? Does it
   not express the just view that we feel ourselves guilty of all evil,
   even where we are shown that we have no guilt?

   gratiam dei quæ per dominum nostrum Jesum Christum est, adversus eam
   defenderemus, exercuit."

   [298] Pelagius and his friends were always convinced that the disputed
   questions, while extremely important, were not dogmatic. We can once
   more, therefore, study very clearly what at that time was held to be
   dogma; (see De gestis Pelag. 16: Pelagius denied at the Synod at
   Diospolis that statements of high dogmatic import were his; when it was
   proposed that he should anathematise those who taught them, he replied:
   "Anathematizo quasi stultos, non quasi hæreticos, si quidem non est
   dogma." Cælestius says of Original sin (De pecc. orig. 3): "licet
   quæstionis res sit ista, non hæresis." He also declared in the Libellus
   fidei (26) submitted at Rome: "si quæ vero præter fidem quæstiones natæ
   sunt . . . non ego quasi auctor alicujus dogmatis definita hæc
   auctoritate statui." Hahn, § 134. This was also the view at first of
   Pope Zosimus (Ep. 3, 7). Julian (Op. imp. III. 106) saw dogmas in the
   doctrine of the Trinity and Resurrection, "multisque aliis similibus."

   [299] Augustinianism and Pelagianism were akin in form, and opposed to
   the previous mode of thought, in that both conceptions were based on
   the desire for unity. They sought to get at the root of religion and
   morality, and had ceased to be satisfied with recognising freedom and
   grace as independent and equivalent original data, as if religion with
   its blessings were at the same time superior and subordinate to moral
   goodness. The "either--or" asserted itself strongly.

   eunuchus matris utero editus," both laymen, Cælestius auditorialis
   scholasticus. Pelagius was a Briton (an Irishman? called Morgan?), but
   in view of the intercourse between different countries at the time, the
   birthplace is somewhat indifferent. Cælestius was won over by Pelagius
   in Rome, and then gave up his worldly career.

   [301] It is uncertain whether Pelagius had been in the East before he
   appeared in Rome. Cælestius had heard Rufinus in Rome, and stated that
   the latter would have nothing to do with the "tradux peccati" (De pecc.
   orig. 3). Marius Mercator has even sought to deduce Pelagianism from
   Theodore of Mopsuestia's teaching, and supposed that Rufinus "the
   Syrian" (identical (?) with Rufinus of Aquileia) brought it to Rome.
   Others have repeated this. While the direct points of contact at the
   beginning are problematical, it is certain (1) that Pelagianism and
   Theodore's teaching approximate very closely (see Gurjew, Theodor v.
   Mopsu. 1890 [in Russian] p. 44 ff.); (2) that Theodore took up sides in
   the controversy against the teaching of Augustine and Jerome: he wrote
   a work "against those who maintain that men sin by nature, and not at
   their own discretion;" (see Photius cod. 177); (3) that the Pelagians
   looked to him as a protector and Julian of Eclanum fled to him; (4)
   that the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians were convinced that they could
   count on the East (and even on the Church of Constantinople) for
   support, and that some of them studied in Constantinople. Theodore's
   distinctive doctrine of Grace is not found in Pelagian writings; for
   this reason he could not ally himself thoroughly with Julian (see Kihn,
   Theodor v. Mopsu. p. 42 ff.). But their affinity was unquestionable. It
   is therefore no mere inference that leads Cassian (c. Nestor. I. 3 sq.)
   to combine the Nestorians with the Pelagians ("cognata hæresis"). The
   interests and methods of both were the same. The comparison with
   Eunomius and Aetius is also pertinent.

   [302] De pecc. orig. 13: "Quid inter Pelagium et Cælestium in hac
   quæstione distabit, nisi quod ille apertior, iste occultior fuit; ille
   pertinacior, iste mendacior, vel certe ille liberior, hic astutior."
   "Cælestius incredibili loquacitate." Many adherents of the new teaching
   preferred to be called "Cælestiani."

   [303] The earnestness and "holiness" of Pelagius are often attested,
   especially by Augustine himself and Paulinus of Nola. His
   untruthfulness, indeed, throws a dark shadow on his character: but we
   have not the material to enable us to decide confidently how far he was
   entrapped into it, or how far he reserved his opinion in the legitimate
   endeavour to prevent a good cause being stifled by theology. Augustine,
   the truthful, is here also disposed to treat charitably the falsehoods
   of his opponent. But we must, above all, reflect that at that time
   priests and theologians lied shamelessly in self-defence, in speeches,
   protocols, and writings. Public opinion was much less sensitive,
   especially when accused theologians were exculpating themselves, as can
   be seen from Jerome's writings, though not from them alone. The people
   who got so angry over Pelagius' lies were no small hypocrites.
   Augustine was entitled to be wroth; but his work De gestis Pelagii
   shows how considerate and tolerant he remained in spite of everything.
   Pelagius and Cælestius must have belonged to those lucky people who,
   cold by nature and temperate by training, never notice any appreciable
   difference between what they ought to do and what they actually do.
   Julian was an emotional character, a young man full of self-confidence
   (c. Julian II. 30: "itane tandem, juvenis confidentissime, consolari te
   debes, quia talibus displices, an lugere?"), who, in his youth, had had
   dealings with the Roman Bishop Innocent (c. Julian I. 13) and
   Augustine, "vir acer ingenio, in divinis scripturis doctus, Græca et
   Latina lingua scholasticus; prius quam impietatem Pelagii in se
   aperiret, clarus in doctoribus ecclesiæ fuit" (Gennad. script. eccl.
   46). In particular, he was unusually learned in the history of
   philosophy. Early author and bishop, he seems, like so many precocious
   geniuses, never to have got beyond the stage reached by the clever
   youth. Fancy and passionate energy checked his growth, and made him the
   fanatical exponent of the moralistic theory. In any case he is not to
   be taken lightly. The ancient Church produced few geniuses so hold and
   heedless. His criticism is often excellent, and always acute. But even
   if we admitted that his whole criticism was correct, we would find
   ourselves in the end in possession of nothing but chaff. We also miss
   in his case that earnest sense of duty which we do not look for in vain
   in Pelagius. For this very reason, the delightful impression produced
   by a serene spirit, who appeared to avenge despised reason and
   authoritative morality, is always spoiled by the disagreeable effect
   caused by the creaking sound of a critical chopping-machine. An
   excellent monograph on Julian by Bruckner will appear immediately in
   the "Texten and Unters."

   [304] Cicero's words: "virtutem nemo unquam acceptam deo retulit,"
   could be inscribed as a motto over Pelagianism.

   [305] Pelagianism and Augustinianism are also akin in form, in that in
   both the old dramatic eschatological element, which had hitherto played
   so great a rôle in the West, and had balanced moralism, wholly
   disappears. But Julian was the first to secularise the type of thought.

   [306] The Antiochene theologians also were notoriously zealous
   defenders of monachism.

   [307] Here we have a third point (see p. 170, n. 1) in which
   Pelagianism and Augustinianism are akin in form. Neither is interested
   in the mysticism of the cultus; their authors rather strive to direct
   spiritual things in spiritual channels, though Augustine, indeed, did
   not entirely succeed in doing so.

   [308] See the remarks on Ambrose, p. 50. Perhaps the three rules of
   Tichonius best show the confusion that prevailed (Aug. de doctr.
   Christ. III. 46: "opera a deo dari merito fidei, ipsam vero fidem sic
   esse a nobis ut nobis non sit a deo." Yet Augustine sought (c. Julian.
   L. I.) to give traditional evidence for his doctrine.

   [309] One passage (IV. 24 sq.) became famous in the controversy:
   "oportet magistrum doctoremque virtutis homini simillimum fieri, ut
   vincendo peccatum doceat hominem vincere posse peccatum . . . ut
   desideriis carnis edomitis doceret, non necessitatis esse peccare, sed
   propositi ac voluntatis."

   [310] Our sources are the writings of Pelagius, Cælestius, and Julian
   (chiefly in Jerome and Augustine) Augustine's works (T. X. and c. 20,
   letters among which Epp. 186, 194 are the most important), Jerome,
   Orosius, Marius Mercator, and the relevant Papal letters. Mansi T. IV:,
   Hefele, Vol. II. For other literature see above, p. 61. Marius was the
   most active opponent of the Pelagians towards the close of the
   controversy, and obtained their condemnation in the East (see Migne, T.
   48, and the Art. in the Dict. of Chr. Biog).

   [311] Pelag. Ep. ad Demetr.: "ne tanto remissior sit ad virtutem animus
   ac tardior, quanto minus se posse credat et dum quod inesse sibi
   ignorat id se existimet non habere."

   [312] He was, perhaps, not the first; we do not know whom Augustine
   meant in De pecc. orig. 25 ("Pelagius et Cælestius hujus perversitatis
   auctores vel perhibentur vel etiam probantur, vel certe si auctores non
   sunt, sed hoc ab aliis didicerunt, assertores tamen atque doctores"),
   and De gest Pelag. 61 ("post veteres hæreses inventa etiam modo hæresis
   est non ab episcopis seu presbyteris vel quibuscumque clericis, sed a
   quibusdam veluti monachis"). Pelagius and Cælestius may themselves be
   understood in the second passage.

   [313] The Confession of Faith, afterwards tendered (Hahn, § 133), is
   clear and confident in its dogmatic parts. The unity of the Godhead is
   not so strongly pronounced in the doctrine of the Trinity as with
   Augustine; Pelagius resembled the Greeks more strongly in this respect
   also.

   [314] At Rome Pelagius wrote the Ep. to Paulinus of Nola, the three
   books De fide trinitatis, his Eulogia and Commentaries on Paul's
   Epistles, to which Augustine afterwards referred. The latter have been
   preserved for us among Jerome's works; but their genuineness is
   suspected. Augustine mentions, besides, an Ep. ad Constantium episc.
   (De grat. 39); it is not known when it was written.

   [315] De gestis Pelag. 46: "Pelagii nomen cum magna ejus laude
   cognovi."

   [316] By him are three works de monasterio. "Cælesti opuscula," De
   gratia, 32.

   [317] So Augustine heard when in Carthage; see De pecc. mer. III. 12.

   [318] De gestis Pelag. 46.

   [319] Marius Merc. Common. and Aug., De pecc. orig., 2 sq. It is worthy
   of note that the complaint came from a disciple of Ambrose. This
   establishes the continuity of the Antipelagian teaching.

   [320] "Adam mortalem factum, qui sive peccaret sive non peccaret
   moriturus fuisset--peccatum Adæ ipsum solum læsit, non genus
   humanum--parvuli qui nascuntur in eo statu sunt, in quo fuit Adam ante
   prævaricationem--neque per mortem vel prævaricationem Adæ omne genus
   hominum moritur, nec per resurrectionem Christi omne genus hominum
   resurget--lex sic mittit ad regnum coelorum quomodo et evangelium--et
   ante adventum domini fuerunt homines impeccabiles, i.e., sine
   peccato--hominem posse esse sine peccato et mandata dei facile
   custodire, si velit." On the transmission of these propositions, see
   Klasen, Pelagianismus, p. 48 f.

   [321] "Quia intra Catholicam constitutos plures audivi destruere nec
   non et alios adstruere."

   [322] De pecc. mer. I. 58, 62.

   [323] He is said to have stayed before this in Sicily, but that is
   merely a guess on Augustine's part, an inference from the spread of
   Cwlestian heresies there. See Augustine's interesting letters, Epp.
   156, 157, 22, 23 sq. From these we learn that Cælestius actually
   taught: "divitem manentem in divitiis suis regnum dei non posse
   ingredi, nisi omnia sua vendiderit; nec prodesse eidem posse, si forte
   ex ipsis divitiis mandata fecerit." In the "definitiones Cælestii" a
   document which came to Augustine from Sicily, and whose origin is
   indeed uncertain, the Stoic method of forming definitions is
   noteworthy. In it there also occurs the famous definition of sin--"that
   which can be let alone"--(Goethe gives the converse description: "What,
   then, do you call sin? With everyone I call it what can not be let
   alone.") The whole argument serves to prove that since peccatum vitari
   potest, man can be sinless (De perfect. just. 1 sq.). In the passage
   just cited, and again at Diospolis (De gestis Pelag. 29-63) a work by
   Cælestius is mentioned, whose title is unknown. Not a few sentences
   have been preserved (l.c.): "Plus facimus quam in lege et evangelis
   jussum est--gratiam dei et adjutorium non ad singulos actus dari, sed
   in libero arbitrio esse, vel in lege ac doctrina--dei gratiam secundum
   merita nostra dari, quia si peccatoribus illam dat, videtur esse
   iniquus--si gratia dei est, quando vincimus peccata, ergo ipse est in
   culpa, quando a peccato vincimur, quia omnino custodire nos aut non
   potuit aut noluit--unumquemque hominem omnes virtutes posse habere et
   gratias--filios dei non posse vocari nisi omni modo absque peccato
   fuerint effecti--oblivionem et ignorantiam non subjacere peccato,
   quoniam non secundum voluntatem eveniunt, sed secundum
   necessitatem--non esse liberum arbitrium, si dei indigeat auxilio,
   quoniam in propria voluntate habet unusquisque aut facere aliquid aut
   non facere--victoriam nostram non ex dei esse adjutorio, sed ex libero
   arbitrio--si anima non potest esse sine peccato, ergo et deus subjacet
   peccato, cujus pars, hoc est anima, peccato obnoxia est--pænitentibus
   venia non datur secundum gratiam et misericordiam dei, sed secundum
   merita at laborem eorum, qui per pænitentiam digni fuerint
   misericordia." We readily see, what indeed has not hitherto been
   clearly perceived, that this writing of Cælestius must have been the
   real cause of offence. It could not but open the eyes even of the
   waverers. We return to it in the text.

   [324] De gestis Pelag. 51, 52. The interpretation added by Augustine to
   a few conventional phrases used in the letter seems to us superfluous
   and laboured. He, besides, spared Pelagius in Carthage itself; for in
   his first great work against Pelagianism, De pecc. mer. et remiss. et
   de bapt. parvulorum ad Marcellinum (412), the name of Pelagius is not
   yet mentioned. Before this, Augustine had sought to influence the
   Church only by sermons and discourses. Even the Tractate De spiritu et
   litera, which followed immediately, is not directed against Pelagius.

   [325] I am disposed to regard as a forgery the letter of condolence to
   the widow Livania (Fragments in Aug. De gestis Pel. 16, 19, Hieron. and
   Marius; partly reported in the indictment at Diospolis). Yet we cannot
   decide with certainty. We must allow the possibility of Pelagius having
   so expressed himself in a flattering letter, not meant to be published,
   to a sanctimonious widow. Indeed, words like the following sound like
   mockery: "Ille ad deum digne elevat manus, ille orationem bona
   conscientia effundit qui potest dicere, tu nosti, domine, quam sanctæ
   et innocentes et mundæ sunt ab omni molestia et iniquitate et rapina
   quas ad te extendo manus, quemadmodum justa et munda labia et ab omni
   mendacio libera, quibus offero tibi deprecationem, ut mihi miserearis."
   Pharisee and Publican in one!

   [326] The latter afterwards complained (c. Jul. II. 36), "quod
   Hieronymus ei tamquam æmulo inviderit." That is very credible.

   [327] From motives of prudence he did not answer Jerome publicly; for
   he wished to avoid all controversy. Jerome was, for the rest, much more
   akin to him really than Augustine. The former maintained, e.g., in a
   later controversial work, that it was orthodox to teach that the
   beginning of good resolves and faith is due to ourselves.

   [328] Pelagius himself wrote to the nun Demetrias (A.D. 413 or 414) a
   letter still preserved, and forming the clearest memorial of his
   doctrine, and shortly before the Synod of Diospolis he composed his
   book De natura, in which there is much that he abjured at the Synod. It
   is extremely probable that this book also was not meant for the public,
   but only for his friends (against the charges of Jerome). Augustine, as
   soon as he got it, refuted it in his tractate De natura et gratia
   (415). Pelagius had essayed to give a dialectical proof of his
   anthropology in the book. Augustine's work, De perfectione justitiæ,
   composed also in A.D. 415, was aimed at Cælestius.

   [329] See Orosii Apolog.

   [330] The indictment was composed by two Gallic Bishops, Heros and
   Lazarus, who had been forced to fly from their own country. It was very
   comprehensive; but no strict line was drawn between what Pelagius had
   himself said, and what belonged to Cælestius. The two Bishops were, for
   the rest, afterwards treated as under suspicion at the conferences in
   Rome.

   [331] "Anathematizo quasi stultos, non quasi hæreticos, si quidem non
   est dogma."

   [332] "Nunc quoniam propria voce anathematizavit Pelagius incertum
   stultiloquium, recte respondens, hominem cum adjutorio dei et gratia
   posse esse sine peccato, respondeat et ad alia capitula."

   [333] The above quoted phrase, "non est dogma," is extremely
   characteristic. It shows how painfully anxious Pelagius was not to
   extend the sphere of dogma. In this he quite shared the feeling always
   entertained even to the present day by the Greeks. A Greek priest once
   said to the author that the great freedom of the Greek Church, compared
   with the Western, consisted in the possibility of holding very
   different views of sin, grace, justification, etc., if only the dogmas
   were adhered to. Pelagius accordingly opposed the introduction of a
   great new tract being included in the dogmatic sphere. He saw merely
   the inevitable evils of such an advance. We must judge his whole
   attitude up to his death from this point of view. Seeberg (Dogmengesch.
   I., p. 282 f.) holds that the phrase, "non est dogma," was merely meant
   to provide a means of defence; but if we consider Pelagius' whole
   attitude, we have no ground for taking any such view.

   [334] De gestis Pelag. 44: "Reliqua vero et secundum ipsorum
   testimonium a me dicta non sunt, pro quibus ego satisfacere non debeo."
   "Anathematizo illos qui sic tenent aut aliquando tenuerunt." "Nunc
   quoniam satisfactum est nobis prosecutionibus præsentis Pelagii
   monachi, qui quidem piis doctrinis consentit, contraria vero ecclesiæ
   fidei anathematizat, communionis ecclesiasticæ eum esse et catholicæ
   confitemur."

   [335] "Synodus miserabilis," Jerome, Ep. 143, 2.

   [336] Jerome, Ep. 143, 1.

   [337] In his work, De gestis Pelagii, Augustine, following a written
   account, criticises the proceedings of the Synod, and shows that
   Pelagius uttered the falsehood. The latter, always anxious to keep
   peace, addressed a report of his own after the Synod to Augustine (l.c.
   57 sq.), in order to influence him in his favour. But Augustine rightly
   gave the preference to the other account, since Pelagius had omitted
   from his the "anathematizo." Again in the work De pecc. orig.,
   Augustine shows, from the writings of Pelagius with which he was
   acquainted, that the latter had got off by evasions at Diospolis, and
   that he really held the same opinions as Cælestius.--We can only excuse
   the man by repeating that he wished to do practical work, and felt
   himself put out by dogmatic questions as to original sin, etc.

   [338] De gestis, 54 sq.

   [339] There was no word of "easily" at Diospolis.

   [340] Augustine's tractates, De gratia Christi et De peccato originali,
   are directed against this book.

   [341] De pecc. orig. 20: "Denique quomodo respondeat advertite et
   videte latebras ambiguitatis falsitati præparare refugia, offundendo
   caliginem veritati, ita ut etiam nos cum primum ea legimus, recta vel
   correcta propemodum gauderemus. Sed latiores disputationes ejus in
   libris, ubi se quantumlibet operiat, plerumque aperire compellitur,
   fecerunt nobis et ipsa suspecta, ut adtentius intuentes inveniremus
   ambigua."

   [342] Orosius had carried there information of the events.

   [343] The letter was accompanied by Pelagius' work De natura and
   Augustine's reply.

   [344] Ep. 177, 2.--To about this date belong, according to Caspari's
   investigations, the Pelagian letters and tractates published by him
   A.D. 1890 (Briefe, Abhandlungen and Predigten, etc. pp. 3-167, 223-389,
   Christiania), and ascribed on good grounds to Agricola, of Britain. The
   fragments were written, however, in Italy. They add nothing new to our
   knowledge of Pelagianism. But they confirm the fact that the earliest
   Pelagianism--before Julian--was associated with the most stringent
   monastic demands, and was extremely rigorous. In particular, Agricola
   flatly forbids the possession of wealth. He also regards ignorance of
   the divine will as no excuse for the sinner, but as an aggravation.

   [345] Epp. 177, 3: "Non agitur de uno Pelagio, qui jam forte correctus
   est." The consideration for him is very remarkable; it is explained by
   his prestige and his justification at Diospolis. The letter of the five
   Bishops composed by Augustine and sent afterwards was obviously meant
   thoroughly to instruct the Pope, who was held to be insufficiently
   informed as to the importance of the question. Yet we have at the
   close, (c. 19): "Non rivulum nostrum tuo largo fonti augendo
   refundimus."

   [346] Ep. 183, 2-5: "Nam de naturæ possibilitate, de libero arbitrio,
   et de omni dei gratia et quotidiana gratia cui non sit recte sentienti
   uberrimum disputare?"

   [347] This is not the view that has hitherto been taken of the letters;
   Zosimus has rather been simply contrasted with Innocent. Seeberg (p.
   283) sees in the letter a monument of the Pope's helplessness in dogma:
   he was so ignorant as to admit that the Africans were right, and yet to
   make them talk like Pelagians. That seems to me an exaggeration.

   [348] Hahn. 133. In it we have the words "liberum sic confitemur
   arbitrium, ut dicamus nos indigere dei semper auxilio" (but in what
   does the auxilium consist?), and "baptismum unum tenemus quod iisdem
   sacramenti verbis in infantibus, quibus etiam in majoribus, asserimus
   esse celebrandum."

   [351] L.c.: "Infantes debere baptizari in remissionem peccatorum
   secundum regulam universalis ecclesiæ et secundum evangelii sententiam
   confitemur, quia dominus statuit, regnum coelorum non nisi baptizatis
   posse conferri; quod, quia vires naturæ non habent, conferri necesse
   est per gratiæ libertatem. In remissionem peccatorum baptizandos
   infantes non idcirco diximus, ut peccatum ex traduce firmare videamur
   (he thus clung to this point), quod longe a catholico sensu alienum
   est, quia peccatum non cum homine nascitur, quod postmodum exercetur ab
   homine, quia non naturæ delictum, sed voluntatis esse demonstrator. Et
   illud ergo confiteri congruum, ne diversa baptismatis genera facere
   videamur, et hoc præmunire necessarium est, ne per mysterii occasionem
   ad creatoris injuriam malum, antequam fiat ab homine, tradi dicatur
   homini per naturam."

   [352] He wisely refused to discuss the separate points of complaint.

   [354] The Bishops are arrogantly rebuked. For the rest, the whole
   question in dispute is regarded as due to an epidemic of curiosity, as
   superfluous and pernicious: one ought to abide by Scripture. No wonder
   that Rome hesitated to declare a question important in which the
   disputants were agreed as regards Holy Scripture, dogma, and Church
   practice. The Church only took hesitatingly the momentous step involved
   in acknowledging anything outside of these to be of equal importance to
   "dogmas."

   [358] It was with Cælestius that he was chiefly concerned.

   [359] Let him be condemned: who derives death from natural necessity;
   who denies the presence of original sin in children and rebels against
   Paul (Rom. V. 12); who assigns any form of salvation to unbaptised
   children; who refers God's justifying grace in Christ merely to past
   sins; who applies grace to knowledge alone, while not perceiving in it
   the power necessary to us; who sees in grace merely a means of
   rendering the good easier, but not its indispensable condition; or who
   derives the confessions of sin by the pious from humility alone, and
   interprets their prayer for pardon of guilt as applying solely to the
   guilt of others.

   [365] The confession of faith contained in one of the letters (Hahn,
   § 135) shows also that Julian wished to stand by Pelagius.

   [366] We must remember in excuse of Julian's violent and unmeasured
   polemics that he was defending an already hopeless case. He himself
   knew this--Op. imp. I. 1, 2: "magnis impedimentis angoribus, quos
   intuenti mihi hac tempestate ecclesiarum statum partim indignatio
   ingerit partim miseratio"--"labentis mundi odia promeremur"--"rebus in
   pejorem partem properantibus, quod mundi fini suo incumbentis indicium
   est" (l.c. I. 12). His violence is in any case not explained from
   secret uncertainty, for there certainly have been few theologians so
   thoroughly convinced as he of being on the right path. Religious
   pioneers, besides, have as a rule surpassed their opponents in strength
   of conviction. They also possess it more readily; for the certainty of
   religion and morality, as they understand it, is involved for them in
   personal assurance.

   [367] When we realise the exceptional qualities of two such outstanding
   opponents, we wish that nature had rolled them into one. What a man
   that would have been!

   [368] This name appears first in the Middle Ages. In ancient times men
   spoke of the "reliquiæ Pelagianorum."

   [369] They still hoped for their rehabilitation up to A.D. 430, and
   urged it in Rome on every new Pope.

   [370] It is noteworthy that Julian speaks in his works as if he now
   alone represented the destituta veritas, a claim that Augustine tells
   him shows extreme arrogance (see c. Jul. II. 36).

   [371] I do not here discuss more minutely the history of Julian, who
   once more paid a passing visit to Rome; see art. in the Encycl. of
   Christ. Biogr.

   [372] Julian's name was expressly mentioned; perhaps he was in Ephesus
   with Nestorius. It is maintained by Marius that he had been already
   condemned in his absence (with Theodore's concurrence) at a Cilician
   Synod.

   [373] Bishop Atticus of Constantinople was undoubtedly a decided enemy
   of the Pelagians; but we do not know his motives.

   [374] This is also necessary because the mode of thought at the root of
   Pelagianism never reappeared--up to the time of Socinianism--in so pure
   a form as in Julian.

   [375] Augustine says very gracefully (c. Jul. VI. 36): "Quæ tu si non
   didicisses, Pelagiani dogmatis machina sine architecto necessario
   remansisset."

   [376] As regards form (Klasen, pp. 81-116), i.e. in their teaching as
   to Scripture, tradition, and authority, no innovations occur in
   Pelagius and Cælestius. Pelagianism, indeed, implicitly involves the
   rejection of every doctrine, quæ ratione defendi non potest, and he
   interpreted Scripture accordingly (see examples of exegesis in Klasen
   l.c.). In his treatise, De natura, he quotes the Fathers in support of
   his form of doctrine, as Augustine did for his (Chrysostom was
   especially often quoted, but so also were Jerome, Ambrose, and
   Lactantius). Julian, on the contrary, expressly gave the first place to
   ratio: "Quod ratio arguit, non potest auctoritas vindicare" (Op. imp.
   II. t6). With Origen--in sharp contrast to Augustine--he observes the
   rule not that a thing is good, because God wills it and it stands in
   Scripture, but that reason establishes what is good: "Hæreat hoc maxime
   prudentis animo lectoris, omnibus scripturis sacris solum illud, quod
   in honorem dei catholici sapiunt, contineri, sicut frequentium
   sententiarum luce illustratur, et sicubi durior elocutio moverit
   quæstionem, certum quidem esse, non ibi id quod injustum est loci
   illius auctorum sapuisse; secundum id autem debere intelligi, quod et
   ratio perspicua et aliorum locorum, in quibus non est ambiguitas,
   splendor apparuerit" (l.c. II. 22; cf. I. 4). "Sanctas quidem apostoli
   esse paginas confitemur, non ob aliud, nisi quia rationi, pietati,
   fidei congruentes erudiunt nos" (II. 144). Julian declares time and
   again that "wrong" and right must be the standard to be applied to all
   traditions regarding God. Now if the interpretations of Scripture given
   by Pelagius and Cælestius are "shallow," Julian's are sometimes quite
   profane. Our first parents clothed themselves after the Fall, because
   they were cold, and had learned for the first time the art of making
   clothes (c. Jul. IV. 79 sq.). But the rationalist standpoint of
   historical criticism appears most clearly in Julian's attitude to
   tradition. He is the author of the famous saying that we ought to weigh
   and not count opinions (c. Julian, II. 35: "non numerandas, sed
   ponderandas esse sententias; ad aliquid inveniendum multitudinem nihil
   prodesse cæcorum"). He says boldly that in dogmatic questions we must
   set aside the strepitus turbarum de omni ordine conversationis hominum,
   all de plebeia fæce sellularii, milites, scholastici auditoriales,
   tabernarii, cetarii, coqui, lanii, adolescentes ex monachis dissoluti,
   and further the turba qualiumcumque clericorum; "honorandam esse
   paucitatem, quam ratio, eruditio, libertasque sublimat." Compare Op.
   imperf. I. 41, where Julian says "et si philosophorum ego senatum
   advocavero, tu continuo sellularios, opifices omneque in nos vulgus
   accendas," and II. 14 "Traduciani pro se sursum deorsum plebecularum
   aut ruralium aut theatralium scita commendant." He justifies the
   setting aside of laymen and the uneducated clergy; he says: "quia non
   possunt secundum categorias Aristotelis de dogmatibus judicare." Here
   (c. Julian. II. 36, 37) Julian's chief interest becomes clearly
   evident. Without Aristotle, no theology; everything else is
   clod-hoppers' theology; but we have the cultured on our side (l.c. V.
   1., Augustine suggests that is a contention of all heretics, already
   soiled and worn by frequent use). Julian adhered to Aristotle and Zeno;
   he knew their ethics thoroughly and reflected on their differences (c.
   Jul. II. 34; VI. 36; VI. 64: "de scholis Peripateticorum sive
   Stoicorum;" Op. impf. I, 35, 36). In contents and method his teaching
   was closely related to that of these philosophers--Augustine alludes
   very often to this. Besides, he quotes (c. Jul. IV .75) Thales,
   Anaximander, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Parmenides, Leucippus,
   Democritus, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Melissus, Plato, and Pythagoras
   ("quis non ipso nominum sectarumque conglobatarum strepitu terretur?"
   remarks Augustine). Of these philosophers--along with whom Sallust and
   Cicero are quoted--Julian says (l.c.), while granting they were
   idolaters ("licet in scholis aliud disserentes"), that they had
   enjoyed, in the midst of many errors, "de naturalibus aliquas veritatis
   partes," and that these were rightly to be preferred to the dogma of
   original sin. Augustine justly speaks of "nebulæ de Aristotelicis
   categoriis;" but the Stoic element prevails in Julian. The whole
   conception of ratio and Nominalism is Stoic. The mania for definitions
   is also Stoic and Ciceronian. Without definition no knowledge (Op. imp.
   II. 30, said against Augustine: "Ad quid ergo persuadendum aut
   scripturas releges aut conscios nominabis, qui adhuc quod sentis non
   potes definire"). But these definitions never rise out of the actual
   and thoroughly observed case--and that was indeed also usual in the
   Stoa--but glide over it. Julian by no means despised altogether the
   appeal to the Fathers. Here also he proved himself reasonable. It was
   only their formal authority that he would have nothing to do with. His
   standpoint is most clearly expressed in c. Jul. I. 29: "Cum igitur
   liquido clareat hanc sanam et veram esse sententiam, quam primo loco
   ratio, deinde scripturarum munivit auctoritas et quam sanctorum virorum
   semper celebravit eruditio, qui tamen veritati auctoritatem non suo
   tribuere consensu, sed testimonium et gloriam de ejus suscepere
   consortio, nullum prudentem conturbet conspiratio perditorum." Here we
   perceive the descending series of authorities, which is yet only
   authoritative, in so far as the witnesses are rational. The "Fathers"
   he really regarded as nothing, and well he knew how to make use of the
   admissions wrung from Augustine regarding their authority (Op. imp. IV.
   112): "Sed bene quod nos onere talium personarum prior levasti. Nam in
   libro ad Timasium cum s. Pelagius venerabilium virorum tam Ambrosii
   quam Cypriani recordatus fuisset, qui liberum arbitrium in libris suis
   commendaverant, respondisti nulla te gravari auctoritate talium, ita ut
   diceres eos processu vitæ melioris, si quid male senserant, expiasse."
   "Numquid"--exclaims Julian (l.c. IV. 110)--"legi dei aut operi dei
   scripta disputatorum præjudicant!" Julian felt most acutely his having
   to call to its senses the West, in bondage to "stupid and godless"
   dogma; in the East alone did he now see salvation. The rock on which he
   stood was reason; his winged organ was the word. He knew that God would
   honour him for having alone to lead the cause of righteousness. He
   confronted, as the most resolute "Aufklärer" of the ancient Church, its
   greatest religious personality.

   [377] Cælestius in Aug., De perf. just. 15; Julian in the Op. imp. I.
   27-38 and often. The thought of goodness--characteristically enough--is
   dropped, or accompanies it, as it were, incidentally. The idea of
   righteousness as legislative, distributive, and social, governs the
   whole system. "Lex dei fons ac magistra justitiæ," Op. imp. I. 4.

   [378] Op. imp. I. 35: "Justitia est, ut ab eruditis definiri solet (s.
   Aristoteles), et ut nos intelligere possumus, virtus (si per Stoicos
   liceat alteri alteram præferre), virtutum omnium maxima fungens
   diligenter officio ad restituendum sua unicuique, sine fraude, sine
   gratia." By this is gained for religion and morality the supreme
   principle by which man confronts God as judge in complete independence.

   [379] "Nihil potest per sanctas scripturas probari, quod justitia non
   possit tueri."

   [380] Op. imp. VI. 16.

   [381] Aug. c. duas epp. Pelag. III. 24: "Hae sunt nebulæ Pelagianorum
   de laude creaturæ, laude nuptiarum, laude legis, laude liberi arbitrii,
   laude sanctorum, IV. 1, 2.

   [382] "Quia naturalia ab initio substantiæ usque ad terminum illius
   perseverant." (Op. imp. II. 76).

   [383] Naturalia per accidens non convertuntur." "Quod innascitur usque
   ad finem ejus, cui adhæserit, perseverat." L.c. I. 61.

   [384] "Voluntas est nihil aliud quam motus animi cogente nullo" (Op.
   imp. 1. V. ). More precisely (I. 78-82): "Libertas arbritii, qua a deo
   emancipatus homo est, in admittendi peccati et abstinendi a peccato
   possibilitate consistit . . . Posse bonum facere aula virtutis est,
   posse malum facere testimonium libertatis est. Per hoc igitur suppetit
   homini habere proprium bonum, per quod ei subest posse facere malum.
   Tota ergo divini plenitudo judicii tam junctum habet negotium cum hac
   libertate hominum, ut harum qui unam agnoverit ambas noverit. . . . Sic
   igitur et libertas humani custodiatur arbitrii, quemadmodum divina
   æquitas custoditur . . . Libertas igitur arbitrii possibilitas est vel
   admittendi vel vitandi peccati, expers cogentis necessitatis, quæ in
   suo utpote jure habet, utrum surgentium partem sequatur, i.e., vel
   ardua asperaque virtutum vel demersa etpa lustria voluptatum."

   [385] The Pelagians were very silent as to the relation of ratio and
   liberum arbitrium. They did not even notice that it involved a main
   difficulty. All that they found it necessary to say consisted in quite
   childish arguments. Even the above definition of the will is absolutely
   untenable. After all, reason impels to what is bad as well as good; the
   wicked man does not act, at least, without reason. But what does
   justitia mean, if the separate acts of will always pass into vacancy?
   The original equilibrium, forsooth, remains fixed.

   [386] Op. imp. III. 188: "Qui gratiam confirmat, hominum laudat
   naturam."

   [387] "Libertas utriusque partis."

   [388] Ep. ad Demetr.

   [389] Op. imp. I. 79. Here the humanist notion of the good is clear. To
   this Julian adhered, in so far as he followed out the thought at all.

   [390] De grat. Christi 5; de nat. et gratia, passim. (Expositions by
   Pelagius).

   [391] The notion of freedom taught by the Pelagians lies in the
   possibilitas, and that according to Julian, the possibilitas utriusque,
   not merely boni. In Pelagius the possibilitas boni, and therewith
   responsibility, are more prominent. He does not merely say that man has
   freedom of choice, but also (ep. ad Demetr.) that "in animi nostris
   naturalis quædam sanctitas est."

   [392] Klasen (pp. 229-237) distinguishes a threefold possibilitas in
   the Pelagians' teaching, i.e., so many distinctions are, in fact,
   required, if we would escape the contradictions covered by the notion.

   [393] Op. imp. I. 44; V. 28, 43; VI. 17 and often.

   [394] Cælest. in Aug. de perfect. 1.

   [395] Besides the indefiniteness of the relation of reason to freedom,
   the wrong definition of the will, the obscurity as to the notion of
   ratio, and the contradictions in the notion of possibilitas, especially
   characteristic are the inability to give a concrete definition of evil,
   and the mythological fashion in which nature and will are
   distinguished. Why should will and nature be so completely divided, if
   the possibilitas belongs to nature? What is nature in general over and
   above will, since it is by no means held to be merely the flesh?

   [396] To this point the Pelagians applied their greatest acuteness, and
   made just objections, see under. Pelag. in Aug. de pecc. orig. 14:
   "Omne bonum ac malum, quo vel laudabiles vel vituperabiles sumus, non
   nobiscum oritur, sed agitur a nobis: capaces enim utriusque rei, non
   pleni nascimur, et ut sine virtute ita et sine vitio procreamur atque
   ante actionem propriæ voluntatis id solum in homine est, quod deus
   condidit."

   [397] See the Ep. ad Demetr.; De nat. et grat. 60-71. A grave
   experience is revealed in the confession (Ep. ad Demetr. 26) that the
   devil may often fill even those who are separated from the world with
   such foul and impious thoughts, that they imagine they are as wicked as
   when they loved the res sæculi.

   [398] With his distinction of marriage as good and had, Augustine
   resembles the charlatan who would exhibit a beast that devours itself;
   Jul. III. 47.

   [399] See especially Op. imp. Book V., and c. Julian, Book V. Augustine
   calls him "laudator concupiscentia;" c. Jul. III. 44.

   [400] C. Jul. IV. 7; III. 27.

   [401] L.c. IV. 8.

   [402] L.c. IV. 52.

   [403] Asceticism is thus declared to be superfluous, l.c. III. 42.

   [404] Op. imp. IV. 37-43. There undoubtedly occur other passages in
   Julian in which the "blessing" of libido appears small, and virginity
   is admired.

   [405] L.c. IV. 45-64, and elsewhere.

   [406] We must here, indeed, remember the twofold meaning of posse.

   [407] De gest. Pelag. 11.

   [408] On this Pelagius laid great stress (see Op. imp. V.), expressly
   denying (against Augustine) that man sins because he was created ex
   nihilo. By referring evil to the will, every possibility of explaining
   its origin comes to an end; for any such explanation means proving its
   necessity. V. 41: "Quæritis necessitatem rei quæ esse non potest si
   patitur necessitatem. Huic motui animi libero, sine coactu originis
   inquieto, si causa ipso motu detur antiquior, non gignitur omnino sed
   tollitur." V. 57-60: "ideo habuit voluntatem malam, quia voluit."

   [409] Op. imp. VI. 14-23.

   [410] Op. Imp. VI. 23; VI. 14, he lets it appear plainly enough that
   the Fall was an advantage for Adam: "porro ignorantia quam profunda
   quamque patiendi ejus dura conditio, ut liberari ab ea nisi
   prævaricatione non posset, scientiam quippe boni malique absque ansa
   condemnabili nequaquam capessiturus."

   [411] Thus first Cælestius (Karthago, s. Diospolis; de pecc. mer. 2).
   So also Julian, op. imp. II. 66. Common death is natural. Yet here
   Julian has tried to compromise. He will not deny that natural death has
   a connection with sin; i.e., it had really to be annulled by merits;
   but his explanations in Book II. are very tortuous. Without sin death
   would have been "levissima"; but God cannot do away with it entirely
   even for saints, for (VI. 30): "non est tanti unius meritum, ut
   universa quæ naturaliter sunt instituta perturbet."

   [412] Thus already Cælestius.

   [413] It is superfluous to quote passages; see the detailed account in
   Klasen, pp. 116-182. Julian's explanation of Rom. V. 12 occurs in c.
   Jul. VI. 75-81. Besides charging him with Manichæism, Julian also
   accused Augustine of Traducianism, though he was no Traducian. The
   heretical name of "Traduciani" was originated by Julian (Op. imp. I.
   6).

   [414] De pecc. orig. 34.

   [415] Ep. ad Demetr. The reign of sin in the world is also elsewhere
   strongly emphasised by Pelagius.

   [416] This talk of primitive innocence is already in Julian a case of
   accommodation; for innocence of course always remains really the same.
   C. Jul. III. 36: "homo igitur innocentia quidem plenus, sed virtutis
   capax nascitur, aut laudem aut reprehensionem ex proposito accedente
   meriturus . . . nec justos nasci parvulos nec injustos, quod futuri
   sunt actibus suis, sed tantummodo infantiam innocentiæ dote
   locupletem." But the same chapter shows what is after all meant by this
   "innocence": Perfecta ignorantia (in scripturis justitia nominatur).

   [417] Op. imp. I. 91: "liberum arbitrium et post peccata tam plenum est
   quam fuit ante peccata."

   [418] Here, as in Stoicism, there is a gap in the system. Why is
   rational man irrational and bad? How can he possess ratio and an evil
   will at the same time? And how is the sinful habit explained?--Julian
   also says, besides (Op. imp. I. 16) "consuetudo peccati amorem delicti
   facit et exstinguit pudorem;" but he means in the teaching of
   Augustine.

   [419] "The will is not free, if it needs God's help" (De gestis 42).
   "Si per gratiam (De gestis 30) omnia facimus, quando vincimur a
   peccato, non nos vincimur, sed dei gratia, quæ voluit nos adjuvare omni
   modo et non potuit."

   [420] We can, indeed, exemplify almost all the principles of
   Augustinianism from the utterances of Pelagius and Julian. The number
   of passages in their works which sound like good Church doctrine is
   very great. We should require to quote these also in order to give an
   idea of the figure presented by the two men to the world; but this
   would carry us beyond our present limits. We do not, however, do
   injustice to their thought by omitting them; for they are only
   characteristic of their mode of expression. Pelagius never denied
   publicly that man always needed the divine grace, that he could only
   adjuvante gratia esse sine peccato (see De gestis 16, 22, 31; De gratia
   2: "anathemo qui vel sentit vel dicit, gratiam dei, qua Christus venit
   in hunc mundum peccatores salvos facere, non solum per singulas horas
   aut per singula momenta, sed etiam per singulos actus nostros non esse
   necessariam, et qui hanc conantur auferre, poenas sortiantur æternas";
   see also his Confession to the Pope). Julian used, if possible, still
   stronger expressions; but both very often said exactly the opposite of
   what is here given. But they never did say that the grace of God
   through Christ established freedom from sin and salvation.

   [421] These are the usual ones: free will exists in all men, but it is
   only supported by grace in the case of Christians (De gratia, 34); the
   rest only possess the "nudum et inerme conditionis bonum." Similarly
   Julian, but still more strongly (Op. imp. I. 40): "quos fecit quia
   voluit nec condemnat nisi spretus; si cum non spernitur, faciat
   consecratione meliores, nec detrimentum justitiæ patitur et
   munificentia miserationis ornatur." I. 111: "malæ voluntati veniam pro
   inæstimabili liberalitate largitur et innocentiam, quam creat bonam,
   facit innovando adoptandoque meliorem" (but can anything be better than
   good?). III. 106: "Quod ais, ad colendum recte deum sine ipsius
   adjutorio dici a nobis sufficere unicuique libertatem arbitrii, omnino
   mentiris. Cum igitur cultus dei multis intelligatur modis, et in
   custodia mandatorum et in execratione vitiorum et in simplicitate
   conversationis et in ordine mysteriorum et in profunditate dogmatum
   . . . qui fieri potest, ut nos in confuso dicamus, sine adjutorio dei
   liberum arbitrium sufficiens ad ejus esse culturam . . . cunt utique
   ista omnia, tam quæ dogmatibus quam quæ mysteriis continentur, libertas
   arbitrii per se non potuerit invenire, etc." There we see clearly how
   we are to understand the "adjutorium"; it consists solely in the law of
   dogmas and mysteries given by God and not discovered by man, but not in
   a power. Therefore, because God had invented so many institutions,
   Julian can proceed: "hominem innumeris divinæ gratiæ speciebus juvari
   . . . præcipiendo, benedicendo, sanctificando, coercendo, provocando,
   illuminando."

   [422] Impossible as a power, since the will cannot actually be
   determined. On this point Cælestius has alone expressed himself
   clearly, but Julian holds the same view, as he is never tired saying:
   "cunctarum origo virtutum in rationabili animo sita est."

   [423] This proposition of Julian's is properly the key to the whole
   mode of thought: man created free is with his whole sphere independent
   of God. He has no longer to do with God, but with himself alone. God
   only re-enters at the end (at the judgment).

   [424] The statements of the Pelagians as to grace are very often
   rendered intentionally (e.g., De gestis Pel. 22) ambiguous, by their
   understanding it to mean the grace of creation, and accordingly nature.
   Yet this is not the rule. Pelagius and Julian distinguish three states:
   ex natura, sub lege, sub gratia (Christi); see C. duas epp., I. 39.

   [425] "Perfecta justitia" also in the old covenant (l.c.) and among
   "antiqui homines." Julian often cites the perfect heathens, and sneers
   at Augustine's "splendida vitia." If the virtues of the heathens are
   not virtues, their eyes are not eyes (c. Jul. IV. 26-30). Pelagius has
   made wholly contradictory statements on this point; Julian afterwards
   became more prudent; but, finally, he always held the opinion that
   there was no difference between a good Christian and a good heathen.

   [426] The law was the first augmentum beneficiorum dei; but it was at
   the same time the fundamental form of all that God could further do
   after creation. Pelagius has expressed himself very plainly (De gestis
   30): "gratiam dei et adjutorium non ad singulos actus dari (in other
   places he says the opposite) sed in libero arbitrio esse vel in lege ac
   doctrina." That accordingly is all. Augustine therefore says very
   rightly that Pelagius only admitted the grace "qua demonstrat et
   revelat deus quid agere debeamus, non qua donat atque adjuvat ut
   agamus."

   [427] See preceding note and Cælestius' statement: "lex sic mittit ad
   regnum cælorum quomodo et evangelium."

   [428] Example and imitation, see Op. imp. II. 146 sq. C. Jul. V. 58:
   "tolle exempli causam, tolle et pretii, quod pro nobis factus est."
   Julian also ultimately reduced the death of Christ to a type, Op. imp.
   II. 223.

   [429] Op. imp. II. 217-222.

   [430] It is very instructive that to Julian (as to Augustine) it is the
   man that forms the personality in Jesus. He is distinguished from
   Augustine by saying that the man Jesus was chosen by God and united
   with Christ secundum merita. The profectus is also more plainly marked:
   Jesus was gradually adopted by the Word of God; the filius hominis
   gradually became the filius dei through the achievement of his will.
   Accordingly, unless Augustine has greatly exaggerated, this still might
   be taught with impunity at that time in the West (see Op. imp. IV. 84).

   [431] The evasions in the case of baptism are so numerous that it is
   not worth while mentioning separate instances. The notion of
   forgiveness was in itself very irksome to the Pelagians; it could be at
   most a kind of indulgence, with difficulty compatible with justice.
   They also touched on the question whether baptism extirpates sin or
   removes guilt; but for them the question was senseless. As regards
   infant baptism, all their statements are to be derived from the fact
   that they would neither abolish it, nor admit baptisms of different
   value. The distinction between regnum cælorum and vita æterna was an
   eschatological rudiment, in this case welcome.

   [432] Op. imp. I. 72, III. 163: "augmenta beneficiorum divinorum utilia
   esse et necessaria omnibus in commune ætatibus dicimus, ita tamen ut
   nec virtus nec peccatum sine propria cuiquam voluntate tribuatur."

   [433] De gestis 30: "De gratiam secundum merita nostra dari, quia si
   peccatoribus illam det, videtur esse iniquus." This destroys the notion
   of grace; for it is only as gratuitous that it is grace. Here it takes
   the form of a means of rewarding the good. But if grace is neither
   gratis nor a power, it is nothing but an empty word.

   [434] That Augustinianism is identical with Manichæism runs through
   Julian's polemic like a red line. "Sub laude baptismatis eructat
   Augustinus Manichæorum sordes ac naturale peccatum, ut ecclesiæ
   catholicæ pura hactenus sacramenta contaminet" (Op. imp. I. 9).

   [435] His condemnation was, therefore--from a legal standpoint--not
   above question; the rejection of his energetic appeal to freedom in
   Church instruction not in every respect salutary.

   [436] But from this point of view it could not be thoroughly opposed.
   Augustinianism could alone overcome it. Augustine's criticism of this
   system will be best given through an exposition of his own.

   [437] Therefore the Pelagians attacked Augustine's doctrine of nature,
   and he their doctrine of grace. Everything that Augustine has to say to
   the Pelagians springs properly from the proof that they were ignorant
   of the nature of grace, and therefore also of that of sin.

   [438] Since Augustine's fundamental theological conceptions have been
   already discussed above (see p. 94 ff. ), we have here only to examine
   the doctrine of grace, and that of sin and the primitive state. This
   order is self-evident, while Pelagianism started at the doctrine of an
   indestructible nature.

   [439] Expositions of the death of Christ as the ground of salvation are
   frequent in Augustine. But they refer mostly to the reign of the devil,
   which was legally abrogated by Christ's death; on the other hand, they
   are much rarer when Augustine speaks of positive redemption. This
   deliverance from the devil's power was the common conception of
   Christ's death; it was the pretium paid for us to the devil, which he
   could not, however, retain. But it plays a subordinate part in
   Augustine's whole system; even the thought that God must be
   propitiated, of which we have echoes in Augustine, is not strictly
   carried out. The grace of God to him means, as a rule, the annulling of
   the state of sin. It is involved, however, in the nature of the case,
   that the reference is uncertain; for it is hard to demonstrate how a
   "state" is changed effectively by the death of Christ. But the
   looseness of connection was also a result of Augustine's conception of
   God; for grace, at bottom, emanated from the inscrutable decree of God,
   or the bonum esse. Augustine rarely connects gratia infusa in his
   thought with Christ, but with caritas, which is the essence of the
   Good. Here we have once more to remember that Christ himself, as a
   historical manifestation, was an instance in Augustine's view of
   predestinating grace (see above, p. 129). "Therefore the activity of
   Christ, who, as living eternally, works directly in us, is loosely
   connected with the historical process of propitiation" (Dorner, p.
   182). That is, this "ever living Christ" is himself nothing but grace.
   In Enchir. 108, Augustine has summed up all he had to say on the import
   of Christ's work; but it will be found that, although the reconciliatio
   cum deo--only, indeed, as restoration to God--is not wanting, what is
   called "objective redemption" is left pretty much in the background.
   Augustine accordingly conceived the import of Christ spiritually:
   "Neque per ipsum liberaremur unum mediatorem dei et hominum hominem
   Jesum Christum, nisi esset et deus. Sed cum factus est Adam homo, scil.
   rectus, mediatore non opus erat. Cum vero genus humanum peccata longe
   separaverunt a deo, per mediatorem, qui solus sine peccato natus est,
   vixit, occisus est, reconciliari nos oportebat deo usque ad carnis
   resurrectionem in vitam æternam, ut humana superbia per humililatem dei
   argueretur (that is the main thought, see above, p. 131 f.) ac
   sanaretur et demonstraretur homini quam longe a deo recesserat (to-day
   this conception of Christ's work would be called rationalistic), cum
   per incarnatum deum revocaretur et exemplum obedientiæ per hominem-deum
   (this expression, "homo-deus" was not used, so far as I know, before
   Augustine) contumaci homini præberetur, et unigenito suscipiente formam
   servi, quæ nihil ante meruerat, fons gratiæ panderetur et carnis etiam
   resurrectio redemptis promissa in ipso redemptore præmonstraretur, et
   per eandem naturam quam se decepisse lætabatur, diabolus vinceretur,
   nec tamen homo gloriaretur, ne iterum superbia nasceretur, etc."

   [440] Enchir. 107: "Gratia vero nisi gratis est, gratia non est."

   [441] See the writings De corrept. et gratia, De dono perseverantiæ, De
   prædest. sanctorum, as well as expositions in all the works of
   Augustine's last years; for they never fail to prove that he more and
   more recognised the doctrine of predestinating grace to be the main
   one. Predestination does not rest on the foreknowledge that those
   particular men would follow grace, but it effects this result. The
   scriptural proof is Rom. IX. (see De prædest. 34).

   [442] Enchir. 32: "Nolentem prævenit ut velit, volentem subsequitur, ne
   frustra velit." De gratia et lib. arb. 33: "præparat voluntatem et
   cooperando perficit, quod operando inficit. Quoniam ipse ut velimus
   operatur incipiens." There are countless other passages.

   [443] De spir et litt. 34: "Non credere potest quodlibet libero
   arbitrio, si nulla sit suasio vel vocatio cui credat; profecto et ipsum
   velle credere deus operatur in homine et in omnibus misericordia ejus
   prævenit nos: consentire autem vocationi dei vel ab ea dissentire
   propriæ voluntatis est." Augustine's favourite text was, "Quid habes,
   quod non accepisti."

   [444] See preceding note.

   [445] See Augustine's last writings, e.g., De corr. 39; De præd. 32.
   The means of grace are uncertain; the universal vocatio should be
   successful, but it is not.

   [446] Here it is true that "deus ita suadet ut persuadeat." De prædest.
   34: "Electi sunt ante mundi constitutionem ea prædestinatione, in qua
   deus sua futura facta præscivit; electi sunt autem de mundo ea
   vocatione, qua deus id, quod prædestinavit, implevit. Quos enim
   prædestinavit, ipsos et vocavit, illa scilicet vocatione secundum
   propositum, non ergo alios sed quos prædestinavit ipsos et vocavit, nec
   alios, sed quos prædestinavit, vocavit justificavit, ipsos et
   glorificavit, illo utique fine, qui non habet finem."

   [447] Therefore it was possible for Augustine to conceive the means of
   grace as acting in the case of heretics, because he felt their efficacy
   in general to be in the end uncertain.

   [448] See above, note 1. The commonest term is "adjutorium," which the
   Pelagians also used, but with a quite different meaning. They thought
   of a crutch, Augustine of a necessary power.

   [449] That is, this regeneration, surpassing forgiveness of sin and
   faith, is always considered the goal. That is the moral phase of the
   religious movement. Renovatio = justificatio = sanctificatio =
   sanctitas. Thus even regeneration is only perfect at the close. Enchir.
   31: "We become free when God fashions us into good men."

   [450] On faith as an advancing process of faith see Dorner, pp.
   183-195. Originally, faith is contrasted with knowledge; it is the
   acceptance on authority of things we cannot know, nay, of what is
   contrary to reason; but it grows into assensus, fiducia, and spiritual
   perception, and thus passes into love, or, according to Paul and James,
   into the faith that works in love.

   [451] Yet, as follows from the above exposition, the whole process of
   grace is completely subjective, although the parallel of the rites of
   the Church is maintained.

   [452] Augustine was the first to make baptism a real act of initiation
   (Ench. 64: "a baptismate incipit renovatio"). The forgiveness of sins
   has an independent value only for the baptised child if it dies;
   otherwise it is an initiation. Here, and for this reason, we have
   Luther's divergence in the notion of faith. De grat. et lib. arb. 27:
   "neque scientia divinæ legis, neque natura neque sola remissio
   peccatorum est illa gratia per Christum, sed ipsa facit, ut lex
   impleatur."

   [453] For Augustine's system it is a grave defect, sufficiently
   animadverted on also by the Pelagians, that baptism only removes the
   guilt of inherited sin; for with him removal of guilt is really a
   slight matter, in any case not the chief concern. But in the formulas
   the "non imputare," as well as fides, undoubtedly appears as the chief
   thing. In reality, while the removal of guilt is the object of fides
   historica, sin is blotted out by gratia infusa. Where Augustine seeks
   to retain guilt as the supreme conception, he always turns to its
   punishment. Man is emptied by sin. Thus sin bears its punishment in
   itself. Man despoiled, however, is much too dependent, too much of a
   cipher, to be able to possess guilt.

   [454] The formula justificatio ex fide is very frequent in Augustine.
   De spiritu et litt. 45: "cum dicat gratis justificari hominem per fidem
   sine operibus legis, nihil aliud volens intelligi in eo, quod dicit
   gratis, nisi quia justificationem opera non præcedunt. . . Quid est
   aliud justificati quam justi facti ab illo scilicet qui justificat
   impium ut ex impio fiat justus." 15: "non quod sine voluntate nostra
   justificatio fiat, sed voluntas nostra ostenditur infirma per legem, ut
   sanet gratia voluntatem et sanata voluntas impleat legem." C. Jul. II.
   23: "justificatio in hac vita nobis secundum tria ista confertur: prius
   lavacro regenerationis, quo remittuntur cuncta peccata, deinde
   congressione cum vitiis, a quorum reatu absoluti sumus, tertio dum
   nostra exaudiatur oratio, qua dicimus, Dimitte nobis debita nostra."
   The whole process up to the meritis and vita æterna in De gratia et
   lib. arb. 20. Love alone decides salvation, because it alone
   replenishes the man despoiled by sin. Man receives his final salvation
   by being restored through the spirit of love to goodness, being, and
   God, and by being united with him mystically yet really. The
   depreciation of faith follows necessarily from the notions of God, the
   creature and sin, all three of which have the mark of the acosmic.
   Since there is no independence beside God, the act of faith on the part
   of a subject in the presence of God only obtains any value when it is
   transformed into union with God--the "being filled" by God. This union,
   however, is a product of the freed will and gratia (cooperans).

   [455] This is argued very often by Augustine. The bona concupiscentia
   can, as experience shows, never wholly supplant on earth the mala. (De
   spiritu 6: "adjuvat spiritus sanctus inspirans pro concupiscentia mala
   concupiscentiam bonam, hoc est caritatem diffundens in cordibus
   nostris.") For this very reason diffusio caritatis (gratia infusa,
   inspiratio dilectio--Augustine has many synonyms for this power of
   justification) is never perfected. Thus justification, which is
   identical with sanctification, is never completed because "opera" also
   are essential to it. Augustine appealed expressly to James. Gratia,
   however, is never imparted secundum merita bonaæ voluntatis, let alone
   bonorum operum; it first calls them forth.

   [456] See above, p. 155. We have to notice here also the juxtaposition
   of the two processes, the outer and inner. For the rest, the whole
   account of the process of salvation is not yet reduced to a strict
   plan. Augustine still confuses the stages, and, fortunately, has no
   fixed terminology. Scholasticism first changed all this.

   [457] No one can wholly avoid sin; but the saints can refrain from
   crimes (Enchir. 64).

   [458] The work "De fide et operibus" is especially important at this
   point. Augustine expressly denies, c. 40, that faith and knowledge of
   God suffice for final blessedness. He holds by the saying: "Hereby we
   know him, if we keep his commandments." Against reformers like
   Jovinian, and not only against them, he defended the consilia,
   monachism, the higher morality, and the saints. De gratia et lib. arb.
   1: "per gratiam dei bona merita comparamus quibus ad vitam perveniamus
   æternam." By these merita, works thoroughly ascetic are to be
   understood; see also the writings, De sancta virgin., and De bono
   viduit., in which, for the rest, Augustine is still more favourable to
   marriage than at a later date. His writings are at all times marked by
   a lofty appreciation of almsgiving.

   [459] That grace is gratis data only appears certain to Augustine from
   the contention that it is irresistibilis, and embraces the donum
   perseverantiæ. The doctrine that the election of grace is unconditioned
   thus appears most plainly at the close of the whole line of thought;
   see De corrept et grat. 34, and the writings De dono persev. and De
   prædest. sanct. But, according to Augustine, no one can be certain that
   he possesses this grace. Therefore with all his horror of sin,
   Augustine had not experienced the horror of uncertainty of salvation.
   For this reason Christ can take so secondary a place in the working out
   of the process of grace. Christ is for him the Redeemer, and is
   actively present in the Sacraments; but he is not the pledge of the
   inner assurance of salvation.

   [460] But Augustine assumes different degrees also in definitive
   salvation and perdition. That is characteristic for his moral theory.

   [461] Dorner, p. 124 ff.

   [462] See above, p. 114 f.

   [463] This was constantly admitted by Augustine.

   [464] We find in Augustine the two positions, that sinful man does not
   will goodness, and that he yet, under a blind impulse, pursues
   blessings, nay, even the good, but without ever attaining them.

   [465] The inclination to nothing (not-being) is always at the same time
   a striving for independence, which is false, and ends in being
   resultless.

   [466] Pride is the sin of the soul, concupiscence essentially that of
   the body which masters the soul. The inner evolution of sin from
   privatio (defectus) boni to ignorantia, concupiscentia, error, dolor,
   metus, delectatio morbida, see Enchir. 23. What Augustine always
   regarded most in sin was the infirmity, the wound.

   [467] The work of the historical Christ is essentially redemption from
   the power of the devil.

   [468] Here enters the popular Catholic element, still further
   accentuated, however, by Augustine. Enchir. 117: "Regnat carnalis
   cupiditas, ubi non est dei caritas."

   [469] The extremely disgusting disquisitions on marriage and lust in
   the polemical writings against Julian (also De civ. dei XIV.) are, as
   the latter rightly perceived, hardly independent of Augustine's
   Manichæism: (Julian, indeed, traces Traducianism to Manichæism; see Op.
   imperf. III. 172). (Manichæism, besides, already appears, in the
   treatment of the "ex nihilo," as if it were an evil substance;
   Neoplatonism alone does not, in my opinion, explain this conception;
   yet the above dependence cannot be strictly proved--see Loofs,
   D.-Gesch., 3 Ed., p. 215.) And the disquisitions are by no means a mere
   outwork in Augustine's system; they belong to its very centre. The most
   remarkable feature in the sexual sphere was, in his view, the
   involuntariness of the impulse. But instead of inferring that it could
   not therefore be sinful--and this should have been the inference in
   keeping with the principle "omne peccatum ex voluntate"--he rather
   concludes that there is a sin which belongs to nature, namely, to
   natura vitiata, and not to the sphere of the will. He accordingly
   perceives a sin rooted in natura, of course in the form which it has
   assumed, a sin that propagates itself with our nature. It would be easy
   now to prove that in thinking of inherited sin, he always has chiefly
   in view this very sin, the lust of procreation; but it is impracticable
   to quote his material here. It is clear that inherited sin is the basis
   of all wickedness, and that it is in quite a different position front
   actual sins, because in it nature, having become evil, infects the
   whole being. But it is obvious that this was an unheard of novelty in
   the Church, and must be explained by reference to Manichæism. Of course
   Augustine did not intend to be a Manichæan. He distinguishes sharply
   between vitium and natura vitiate (De nupt. 36; Op. imp. III. 188,
   etc., etc.,); he strives to introduce the "voluntarium" even into
   inherited sin (Retract. I. 13, 5); but dualism is not surmounted simply
   by supposing nature to have become "mala," and yet to propagate itself
   as evil, and the voluntarium is a mere assertion. The dualism lies in
   the proposition that children possess original sin, because their
   parents have procreated them in lust--and by this proposition stands or
   falls the doctrine of original sin (De nupt. II. 15). So also Christ
   has sinlessness attributed to him, because he was not born of marriage
   (Ench. 41, 34), and Augustine imagined paradisaical marriages in which
   children were begotten without lust, or, as Julian says jestingly, were
   to be shaken from trees. All that he here maintains had been long ago
   held by Marcion and the Gnostics. One would have, in fact, to be a very
   rough being not to be able, and that without Manichæism, to sympathise
   with his feeling. But to yield to it so far as Augustine did, without
   rejecting marriage in consequence, could only happen at a time when
   doctrines were as confused as in the fifth century. Those, indeed, have
   increased the confusion still further, who have believed that they
   could retain Augustine's doctrine of inherited sin while rejecting his
   teaching as to concupiscence. But the history of dogma is the history
   of ever increasing confusions, and of a growing indifference not only
   to the absurd, but also to contradictions, because the Church was only
   with difficulty capable of giving up anything found in tradition. It
   cannot also be said that Augustine by his theory simply gave expression
   to the monastic tendency (Jerome, indeed, has gone just as far in his
   rejection of marriage--see lib. adv. Jovin.); for this was a tendency
   and not a theory. The legitimate point in Augustine's doctrine lies in
   the judgment passed by the child of God on himself, viz., that without
   God he is wretched, and that this wretchedness is guilt. But this
   paradox of the verdict of faith is no key to the understanding of
   history.

   [470] See the correspondence with Jerome on this point which was never
   settled by Augustine.

   [471] This destroys the beautiful proposition (pride and humility) out
   of which, of course, no historical theories could be constructed.

   [472] On sin and sin's punishment (inherited sin is both), see Op. imp.
   I. 41-47, but even in the Confessions often, and De pecc. mer. II. 36.

   [473] Even inherited sin is quite enough for damnation, as Augustine
   has very often maintained--and rightly, if there is such a thing.

   [474] "Mitissima poena" (Enchir. 103)--thus the man permits himself to
   soften the inscrutable righteousness of God which he teaches elsewhere.
   He answered the question why then should God continue to create men if
   they must almost all be lost, by referring to baptism, and the peculiar
   power of Divine Omnipotence to make good out of evil. Had God not been
   omnipotent, then he could not have permitted evil (Enchir. 11); "melius
   judicavit, de malis bene facere, quam mala nulla esse permittere" (c.
   27, 100). But he himself was shaken by the problem presented by the
   death, unbaptised, of Christian children (De corr. et gr. 18), All who
   are lost are juste prædestinati ad poenam (mortem)--see Enchir. 100; De
   civ. XXII. 24. Whether God damns all, or pardons some--nulla est
   iniquitas; for all have deserved death (Enchir. 27). "Tenebatur justa
   damnatione genus humanum et omnes erant iræ filii" (c. 33). Here in the
   later writings arises the doctrine of God's twofold will (judicium),
   the secret and the manifest. God does not will that all be blessed
   (Enchir. 203).

   [475] It was very incorrect to derive Augustine's whole conception of
   original sin from the practice of infant baptism. It was, of course,
   very important to him as a means of proof.

   [476] The description of the magnitude of Adam's Fall is in most of the
   anti-Pelagian writings, but also elsewhere.

   [477] In the case of Adam's Fall Augustine gives the greatest
   prominence to the sin of the soul: "in paradiso ab animo coepit elatio"
   (c. Jul. V. 17). We have "amor sui" as chief and radical sin in the
   Confessions; Enchir. 45 gives a precise enumeration of all the sins
   committed in one act by Adam.

   [478] That is, he was not only created good, but grace stood by him
   also as adjutorium: see under.

   [479] The grace supporting him (adjutorium).

   [480] Augustine always thinks first of this death. That the Pelagians
   accepted for their own purposes, since they held natural death to be
   natural. Augustine never maintained that formal freedom had been lost
   by Adam's sin, nay, in C. duas epp. Pelag. I. 5 he distinctly disputed
   this: "libertas periit, sed illa, quæ in paradiso fuit, non liberum
   arbitrium." But Augustine has represented the latter to be hopelessly
   hampered. See also the writing De gratia et lib. arb. In it he says (c.
   45): "deus induravit per justum judicium, et ipse Pharao per liberum
   arbitrium. But (Enchir. 105): "Multo liberius erit arbitrium, quod
   omnino non poterit servire peccato."

   [481] Thus sensuousness appears as the main detriment.

   [482] Enchir. 26: "Hinc post peccatum exul effectus stirpem quoque
   suam, quam peccando in se tamquam in radice vitiaverat, poena mortis et
   damnationis obstrinxit, ut quidquid prolis ex illo et simul damnata per
   quam peccaverat conjuge per carnalem concupiscentiam, in qua
   inobedientiæ poena similis [so far as the flesh here is not obedient to
   the will, but acts of itself] retributa est, nasceretur, traheret
   originale peccatum, quo treheretur per errores doloresque diversos ad
   illud extremum supplicium."

   [483] Augustine's exposition of the eph' ho in De pecc. mer. I. 11; c.
   Jul. VI. 75 sq.; Op. imp. II. 48-55 (against mere imitation). The
   translation "in quo" was received by Augustine from tradition, and in
   general his doctrine of original sin is at this point closest to
   tradition. If he had contented himself with the mystical, i.e., the
   postulated, conception that all are sinners, because they somehow were
   all in Adam, his theory would have been no novelty. But this "in quo"
   does not include, but excludes, original sin in the strict sense; all
   are sinners personally, because they were all in Adam, or were Adam.
   The conception that Adam's sin passed to all as actual sip, and
   affected them through contagion (by means of the parents who infect
   their children, Enchir. 46; doubts as to the extent of descent by
   inheritance, 47), is the complete antithesis of that mystical
   conception.

   [484] See above, p. 210 f.

   [485] On the doctrine of the primitive state, see Dorner, p. 114 ff.

   [486] Both formal freedom and the true freedom which established Adam's
   obedience as the mater omnium virtutum are very strongly emphasised by
   Augustine as belonging to the primitive state; De civ. XIV. 12; De bono
   conjug. 32. On the primitive state, l.c. XI.-X1V.; De corrept. 28-33.

   [487] This "ease" is strongly emphasised in De civ. XIV. 12-15. The
   whole doctrine of the primitive state, like all teaching on this
   subject, is full of contradictions; for we have here a grace that is
   meant to be actual, and is yet merely a condition, i.e., it by no means
   makes a man good, but only leaves scope to the will. Thereby the whole
   doctrine of grace is upset; for if there is a grace at all which only
   produces the posse non peccare, is not this the sole significance of
   all grace? and if that is correct, were not the Pelagians right? They,
   of course, maintained that grace was only a condition. Augustine's
   doctrine of grace in the primitive state (the adjutorium) is Pelagian,
   and contradicts his doctrine of grace elsewhere. We have here the
   clearest proof that it is impossible to construct a history from the
   standpoint of predestinating grace. Augustine falls back on the
   assumption that God wished to bestow on man a higher good than that he
   had received at first. Enchir. 25, 105: "Sic enim oportebat prius
   hominem fieri, ut et bene velle posset et male, nec gratis si bene, nec
   impune, si male; postea vero sic erit, ut male velle non possit, nec
   ideo libero carebit arbitrio . . . ordo prætermittendus non fuit, in
   quo deus ostendere voluit, quam bonum sit animal rationale quod etiam
   non peccare possit, quamvis sit melius quod peccare non possit." But
   how does that accord with irresistible grace? Therefore the question
   rightly arises (De corrept. et gratia): "Quomodo Adam non perseverando
   peccavit, qui perseverantiam non accepit?" Is not the whole doctrine of
   grace upset if we have to read (Enchir. 106): "Minorem immortalitatem
   (i.e., posse non mori) natura humana perdidit per liberum arbitrium,
   majorem (i.e., non posse mori) est acceptura per gratiam, quam fuerat,
   si non peccasset, acceptura per meritum, quamvis sine gratia nec tunc
   ullum meritum esse potuisset?" Accordingly, at the beginning and end
   (the primitive state and the Judgment) the moral view is set above the
   religious. The whole doctrine of predestinating irresistible grace is
   set in a frame incompatible with it. Thus Augustine is himself
   responsible if his Church in after times, arguing from the primitive
   state and the Judgment (secundum merita), has eliminated practically
   his doctrine of gratia gratis data. He, indeed, said himself (107):
   "ipsa vita æterna merces est operum bonorum," That would have been the
   case with Adam, and it is also ours. The infralapsarian doctrine of
   predestination, as understood by Augustine, is very different from
   Calvin's.

   [488] Enchir. 93: "Tanto quisque tolerabiliorem ibi habebit
   damnationem, quanto hic minorem habuit iniquitatem!" Also 111.

   [489] Augustine attempted, in opposition to Pelagianism, to exhibit the
   difference between the law and faith: "fides impetrat quod lex
   imperat." He also succeeded as far as the difference can he evolved
   from the notion of grace as the exclusive operation of God. But since
   he had not obtained an insight into the strict and exclusive cohesion
   of grace and faith, he did not succeed in thinking out and holding fast
   the distinction between law and faith to the end. He had no assured
   experience that the law prepared the way for wrath and despair. At this
   point Luther intervened.

   [490] It is perhaps the worst, it is at any rate the most odious,
   consequence of Augustinianism, that the Christian religion in
   Catholicism is brought into particularly close relations to the sphere
   of sex. The combination of grace and sin (in which the latter takes
   above all the form of original sin identified with the sexual impulse
   and its excesses) became the justification of that gruesome and
   disgusting raking up of human filth, which, as is proved by the moral
   books of Catholicism, is a chief business of the priest, the celibate
   priest and monk, in the confessional. The dogmatic treatises of
   mediæval and modern times give, under the heading "sin," a wholly
   colourless idea of what is really considered "sin," of that which
   incessantly occupies the imagination of common Christians, priests,
   and, unfortunately, also many "saints." We have to study the mirrors of
   the confessional, the moral books and legends of the saints, and to
   surprise the secret life, to perceive to what point in Catholicism
   religious consolation is especially applied. Truly, the renowned
   educational wisdom of this Church makes a sad shipwreck on this rock!
   It seeks here also to oppose sin; but instead of quieting the
   imagination, which is especially interested in it, it goes on exciting
   it to its depths, drags the most secret things shamelessly to the light
   in its dogmas of the virgin, etc., and permits itself to speak openly
   of matters of which no one else ventures to talk. Ancient naturalism is
   less dangerous, at any rate for thousands less infectious, than this
   seraphic contemplation of virginity, and this continual attention to
   the sphere of sex. Here Augustine transmitted the theory, and Jerome
   the music. But how far the beginnings reach back! Tertullian had
   already written the momentous words (De pudic. 17): "Quid intelligimus
   carnis sensum et carnis vitam nisi quodcunque pudet pronuntiare?" Later
   writers were nevertheless not ashamed to utter broadly what the far
   from prudish African only suggested.

   [491] We have at the same time to notice that no Church Father was so
   keenly conscious as he of the limitations of knowledge. In almost all
   his writings--a bequest of the Academy and a result of his thought
   being directed to the main matter--he exhorts his hearers to refrain
   from over-curiousness, a pretence of knowledge that runs to seed. He
   set aside as insoluble very many problems that had been and were
   afterwards often discussed, and he prepared the way for the
   concentration of the doctrinal system on its own material.

   4. Augustine's Interpretation of the Symbol (Enchiridion ad
   Laurentium). The New System of Religion.

   After the exposition given above p. 106 f., we shall best conclude our
   account of Augustine's rôle in the history of dogma, by reviewing the
   expositions given in the Enchiridion of the contents of the Catholic
   religion. Everything is combined in this book to instruct us as to the
   nature of the revision (and on the other hand of the confirmation) by
   Augustine of the popular Catholic dogmatic doctrine that gave a new
   impress to the Western Church. We shall proceed first to give a minute
   analysis of the book, and then to set down systematically what was new
   and at the same time lasting.

   Augustine begins by saying that the wisdom of man is piety ("hominis
   sapientia pietas est" or more accurately "theosebeia") (2). The answer
   to the question how God is to be worshipped, is--by faith, hope, and
   love. We have accordingly to determine what is meant by each of these
   three virtues (3). In them is comprised the whole doctrine of religion.
   They cannot, however, be established by reason or perception, but must
   be derived from Holy Scripture, and be implicitly believed in on the
   testimony of the sacred writers (4). When the soul has attained this
   faith, it will, if faith works in love, strive to reach that vision by
   which holy and perfected souls perceive the ineffable beauty, the
   complete contemplation of which is supreme blessedness. "The beginning
   in faith, the completion in sight, the foundation Christ." But Christ
   is the foundation only of the Catholic faith, although heretics also
   call themselves by his name. The evidence for this exclusive
   relationship between Christ and the Catholic Church would carry us too
   far here (5). We do not intend to enter into controversy, but to
   expound (6). The Symbol and the Lord's Prayer constitute the contents
   of faith (symbol), and of hope and love (prayer); but faith also prays
   (7). Faith applies also to things which we do not hope for, but fear;
   and further to our own affairs and those of others. So far as it--like
   hope--refers to invisible, future blessings, it is itself hope. But
   without love it profits nothing, because the devils also believe. Thus
   everything is comprehended in faith, which works by love and possesses
   hope (8)

   Augustine now passes to the Symbol (the ancient Apostolic creed), in
   order to state the contents of faith. In § 9-32, he deals with the
   first article. The knowledge of nature and physics does not belong to
   faith--besides, scholars conjecture rather than know in this matter
   (opinantes quam scientes). It is enough for the Christian to believe
   that the goodness of the creator is simply the first cause of all
   things, so that there is no nature unless either it is he himself, or
   is of him. Further, that this creator is the "Trinity, supremely and
   equally, and unchangeably good" (trinitas summe et æquabiliter et
   immutabiliter bona), and that while created things do not Possess this
   quality, they are good; nay, everything collectively is very good, and
   produces a wonderful beauty, in which evil, set in its right place,
   only throws the good into relief (9, 10). Augustine at once passes to
   the doctrine of evil. God permits it only because he is so powerful
   that he can make good out of evil, i.e., he can restore the defect of
   the good (privatio boni), evil being represented as such defect (morbus
   [disease] vulnus [wound]). In the notion of that which is not supremely
   good (non summum bonum esse) we have the capacity for deterioration;
   but the good, which is involved in the existence of any substance,
   cannot be annihilated, unless the substance itself be destroyed. But in
   that case corruption itself also ceases, since it can never exist save
   in what is good: evil can only exist in what is good (in a bonum). This
   is expounded at length (11-15). The causes of good and evil must be
   known, in order to escape the errors and infirmities (ærumnæ) of this
   life. On the other hand, the causes of great movements in
   nature--Augustine returns to § 9--need not be known; we do not even
   know the conditions of our health, which yet lie nearest us (16)!

   But is not every error an evil, and what are we to think of deception,
   lying? These questions are minutely discussed in §§ 17-22. Every case
   of ignorance is not an error, but only supposed knowledge is, and every
   error is not hurtful; there is even a good error, one that is of use.
   But since it is unseemly (deforme atque indecens) for the mind to hold
   the truth to be false, and the uncertain certain, our life is for that
   very reason wretched, because at times we need error that we may not
   lose our life. Such will not be that existence, "where truth itself
   will be the life of our soul" (ubi ipsa veritas vita animæ nostræ
   erit). But the lie is worst, so bad that even liars themselves hate
   being lied to. But yet falsehood offers a difficult problem. (The
   question of lying in an emergency, whether it can become a duty for a
   righteous man, is elaborately discussed.) Here again the most important
   point is to determine wherein one errs: "it is far more tolerable to
   lie in those things that are unconnected with religion than to be
   deceived in those without belief in, or knowledge of, which God cannot
   be worshipped" (18). [492] Looked at accurately, every error is an
   evil, though often, certainly, a small one. It is possible to doubt
   whether every error is also sinful--e.g., a confusion about twins, or
   holding sweet to be bitter, etc.; at all events, in such cases the sin
   is exceedingly small and trivial (minimum et levissimum peccatum),
   since it has nothing to do with the way that leads to God, i.e. with
   the faith that works in love. Error is, indeed, rather an evil than a
   sin, a sign of the misery of this life. In any case, however, we may
   not, in order to avoid all error, seek to hold nothing to be true--like
   the Academicians; for it is our duty to believe. Besides the standpoint
   of absolute nescience is impracticable; for even he who knows not must
   deduce his existence from this consciousness of nescience (20). We
   must, on the contrary, avoid the lie; for even when we err in our
   thought, we must always say what we think. [493] Even the lie which
   benefits another is sinful, although men who have lied for the general
   advantage have contributed a great deal to prosperity (22). Augustine
   returns to § 16: we must know the causes of good and evil. The sole
   first cause of the good is the goodness of God; the cause of evil is
   the revolt of the will from the unchangeable God on the part of a
   being, good but changeable, first, an angel, then man (23). From this
   revolt follow all the other infirmities of the soul [ignorance,
   concupiscence, etc.] (24). But the craving for blessedness (appetitus
   beatitudinis) was not lost.

   We now have an exposition of Adam's endowment, the Fall, original sin,
   the sentence of death, the massa damnata, which suffers along with the
   doomed angels, etc. God's goodness is shown, however, in his grant of
   continued existence to the wicked angels, for whom there is no
   conversion besides, and in his preservation of men. Although it would
   have been only justice to give them also over to eternal punishment, he
   resolved to bring good out of evil (25-27). It was his merciful
   intention, i.e., to supplement from mankind the number of the angels
   who persevered in goodness, rendered incomplete by the fall of some, in
   order that the heavenly Jerusalem might retain its full complement,
   nay, should be increased by the "sons of our Holy Mother" [filii sanctæ
   matris] (28-29). But the men chosen owe this not to the merits of their
   own works (to free will); for in themselves they are dead like the rest
   (suicides), and are only free to commit sin. Before they are made free,
   accordingly, they are slaves; they can only be redeemed by grace and
   faith. Even faith is God's gift, and works will not fail to follow it.
   Thus they only become free, when God fashions them anew (into the nova
   creatura), producing the act of will as well as its accomplishment
   ("quamvis non possit credere, sperare, diligere homo rationalis, nisi
   velit"--although rational man cannot believe, hope, or love, unless he
   will). [494] That is, God makes the will itself good (misericordia
   præveniens) and constantly assists it [miseric. subsequens] (30-32).

   The exposition of the second article follows in §§ 33-55. Since all men
   are by nature children of wrath, and are burdened by original sin and
   their own sins, a mediator (reconciliator) was necessary, who should
   appease this wrath (justa vindicta) by presenting a unique sacrifice.
   That this was done, and we from being enemies became children,
   constitutes the grace of God through Jesus Christ (33). We know that
   this mediator is the "Word" that became flesh. The Word was not
   transformed, but assumed our complete human nature from the virgin,
   being conceived not by the libido matris, but by faith--and therefore
   sinlessly. [495] The mother remained a virgin in giving birth (in
   partu) (34). We have now a short discussion on Christ as "God and man
   in unity of person, equal to God, and as man less than God" (35).
   Christ, the man who was deemed worthy to be assumed by God to form one
   person with him, is the most splendid example of grace given gratis,
   and not according to merits. The same grace that fell to the man Christ
   and made him sinless falls to us in justification from sins. It also
   revealed itself in Christ's miraculous birth, in connection with which,
   besides, the Holy Ghost did not act like a natural father. It was
   rather the whole Trinity that created the offspring of the virgin: the
   man Jesus, like the world, is the creation of the Trinity. But why
   precisely the Holy Ghost is named, it is hard to say. In any case, the
   man Jesus was not the son of the Spirit, but the latter is probably
   named in order to point to the grace that, existing without any
   preceding merits, had become in the man Jesus an attribute which in
   some way was natural (quodammodo naturalis); for the Holy Spirit is "so
   far God that he may be called the gift of God" [sic deus, ut dicatur
   etiam dei donum] (36-40). This is followed again by a long section (41
   to 52) on sin and the relation of Christ to it. Christ was free from
   original and actual sin, but was himself--on account of similarity to
   sinful flesh--absolutely called sin. That is, he became a sacrifice for
   sin, representing our sin in the flesh in which he was crucified, "that
   in some way he might die to sin, in dying to the flesh," [496] and from
   the Resurrection might seal our new life (41). That is bestowed on us
   in baptism. Everyone dies to sin in baptism--even the children, who die
   to original sin--and in this respect sin is to be understood
   collectively; for even in Adam's sin many forms of sin were contained.
   But children are obviously infected not only by Adam's sin, but also by
   those of their parents. For their birth is corrupt, because by Adam's
   sin nature was perverted; moreover the actual sins of parents "although
   they cannot thus change nature, impose guilt on the children" (etsi non
   ita possunt mutare naturam, reatu tamen obligant filios). But Augustine
   refrains from deciding how far the sins of ancestors project their
   influence in the chain of descent. It is all expiated by the mediator,
   the man Jesus Christ, who was alone equipped with such grace as not to
   need regeneration; for he only accepted baptism by John in order to
   give a grand example of humility, just as he also submitted to death,
   not from compulsion, but in order to let the devil receive his rights
   (42-49). Christ is thus Adam's anti-type; but the latter only
   introduced one sin into the world, while Christ took away all that had
   since been committed. All were condemned in Adam; none escapes the
   condemnation without Christ. Baptism is to be solemnised as "the grand
   mystery in the cross of Christ" (mysterium grande in cruce Christi);
   for according to Paul baptism is "nothing but the similitude of
   Christ's death; but the death of Christ crucified is nothing but the
   similitude of the remission of sin, that as in him a true death took
   place, so in us a true remission of sins." [497] This is elaborated in
   accordance with Rom. VI; we are dead to sin through baptism (50-52).
   The clauses of the Symbol are now enumerated down to the "sitting at
   the right hand" with the observation: "It was so carried out that in
   these matters the Christian life which is borne here should be typified
   not only mystically by words but also by deeds." [498] That is
   established in connection with each separate article. Thus the "sitting
   at the right hand" means: "set your affections on those things that are
   above" (quæ sursum sunt sapite). On the other hand, the Return of
   Christ has no reference to our earthly life. It belongs entirely to the
   future. The judgment of the living and dead may also suggest to us the
   just and unjust (53-55).

   To the third article §§ 56-113 are devoted; it is accordingly most
   elaborately elucidated. §§ 56-63 treat of the Holy Ghost, who completes
   the Trinity, and so is no part of creation, and also of the Holy
   Church. This is the temple and city of the Trinity. But it is here
   regarded as a whole. That is, it includes the section which exists in
   heaven and has never experienced a fall--the angels who aid the pilgrim
   part (pars peregrinans) being already united with it by love (56). The
   Church in heaven is void of evil and unchangeable. Augustine admits
   that he does not know whether there are degrees of rank among the
   angels, whether the stars belong to them, or what the truth is as to
   their bodily form (57-59). It is more important to determine when Satan
   invests himself in the form of an angel of light (60). We shall only
   know the state of the heavenly Church when we belong to it ourselves.
   The Church of this world, for which Christ died, we do know; for the
   angels he did not die; yet the result of his work also extends to them,
   in so far as enmity to them is at an end, and their number is once more
   complete. Thus by the one sacrifice the earthly host is again united
   with the heavenly, and the peace is restored that transcends all
   thought--not that of angels, but of men; but even angels, and men who
   have entered the state of felicity, will never comprehend the peace of
   God as God himself does (61-63).

   Augustine now passes to the "remission of sins" (64-83): "by this
   stands the Church on earth" (per hanc stat ecclesia qua in terris est).
   So far as our sins are forgiven, "the angels are even now in harmony
   with us" (concordant nobiscum angeli etiam nunc). In addition to the
   "great indulgence," there is a continuous remission of sins, which even
   the most advanced of the righteous need, for they often descend to
   their own level and sin. Certainly the life of the saints may be free
   from transgressions, but not from sin (64). But even for grave offences
   there is forgiveness in the Church after due penance; and the important
   point is not the time of penance, but the anguish of the penitent. But
   since this emotion is concealed from our fellow-men, and cannot be
   inspected, the bishops have rightly instituted penitential seasons
   "that the Church may also be satisfied," the Church beyond whose pale
   there is no forgiveness; for it alone has received the pledge of the
   Holy Ghost (65). Evils remain in this world in spite of the salutaria
   sacramenta, that we may see that the future state is their goal. There
   are punitive evils; for sins last on, and are punished in this life or
   the next (66). We must certainly not fancy that faith by itself
   protects from future judgment (hos dia puros), it is rather only the
   faith that works in love (faith and works). By "wood and stubble" we
   are not to understand sins, but desires after earthly things lawful in
   themselves (67, 68). It is credible that a purifying fire exists for
   believers even after death (69)--sinners can only be saved by a
   corresponding penance combined with almsgiving. Almsgiving is now
   discussed in detail (69-77). At the Last Judgment the decision turns on
   it (Mat. XXV. 34 ff.). Of course we are at the same time to amend our
   lives; "God is to be propitiated for past sins by alms, not by any
   means to be bribed that we may always be allowed to commit sins with
   impunity." [499] God blots out sins "if due satisfaction is not
   neglected" (si satisfactio congrua non negligatur), without giving
   permission to sin (70). Daily prayer furnishes satisfaction for small
   and light daily sins (71). [500] The forgiveness, also, that we bestow
   on others is a kind of alms. Speaking generally, everything good we
   give to others, advice, comfort, discipline, etc., is alms. By this we
   besides help to gain forgiveness of our own sins (72). But the highest
   stages of almsgiving are forgiveness of sins and love of our enemies
   (73). [501] Those virtues everyone must practise, that he himself may
   be forgiven (74). But all these alms fail to benefit us unless we amend
   ourselves; that is, the alms we give to ourselves are the most
   important. Of him alone who has mercy on himself is the saying true:
   "Give alms and all is right (pure) with you." We must love ourselves
   with the love that God has bestowed on us; this the Pharisees, who only
   gave outward alms, did not do, for they were the enemies of their own
   souls (75-77). The divine judgment, however, can alone determine what
   sins are light or grave. Many things permitted by the apostles--e.g.,
   matrimonial intercourse prompted by desire--are yet sinful; many sins
   which we consider wholly trifling (e.g., reviling), are grave; and
   many--e.g., unchastity--which custom has brought us to look on lightly,
   are dreadful, even though Church discipline itself has become lax in
   dealing with them (78-80). All sin springs either from ignorance or
   weakness. The latter is the more serious; but divine grace alone aids
   us to overcome either (81). Unfortunately, from false weakness and
   shame, public penance is frequently withheld. Therefore God's mercy is
   not only necessary in the case of penitence, but also that men may
   resolve to show penitence. But he who disbelieves in and despises the
   forgiveness of sin in the Church commits the sin against the Holy Ghost
   (82, 83).

   The resurrection of the body is dealt with in §§ 84-113. First, the
   resurrection of abortions and monstrosities is discussed (85-87); then
   the relation of the new body to its old material--every particle of
   which need not pass into the former; and further, the corporeal
   difference, the stainlessness and spirituality of bodies in the future
   state (88-91). We must not concern ourselves with the constitution of
   the bodies of the lost who also rise again, although we are here
   confronted by the great paradox that a corruptible body does not die
   nor an incorruptible feel pain). [502] (92). Those will have the
   mildest punishment who have only original, but not actual, sin.
   Damnation in general will be marked by degrees, depending in each case
   on the measure of sin (93). Augustine now comes to speak of
   predestination in detail (94-108): "no one is saved except by
   undeserved mercy, and no one is condemned except by a deserved
   judgment." [503] That is the theme. It will become manifest in eternal
   life why of two children the one is accepted out of mercy, and the
   other rejected in accordance with justice. God's refusal of salvation
   is not unjust, though all might have been saved if he had willed; for
   nothing happens without his will or permission (95). Even in permitting
   evil his action is good, or the first article of the Symbol would no
   longer hold true (96). But if God's will cannot be frustrated by any
   choice of his creatures, how does the fact that all are not saved agree
   with the assurance that "he wills that all should be saved" (1 Tim. II.
   4)? The usual answer, that men will not, is obviously false; for they
   cannot hinder God's will, as he can certainly turn even the bad into a
   good will. Accordingly, God does not will that all be saved, but he
   justly sentences sinners to death (Rom. IX.), that he who receives
   salvation may boast in the Lord. God is free in his election to grace;
   he would not have been to be blamed if he had redeemed no one after
   Adam's Fall; so neither is he to be blamed if in his mercy he redeems
   only a few, that none may boast of his own merits, but in the Lord.
   God's will is expressed in the case of the lost as much as in that of
   the saved ("in the very deed by which they opposed his will, his will
   regarding them was done"). [504] So great are the works of the Lord
   that nothing that takes place against his will happens outside (præter)
   of it. A good son wishes his father to live, but God, whose will is
   good, decides that he should die. Again, a bad son wishes his father to
   die, and God also wills this. The former wills what God does not; the
   latter what he does. Yet the former stands nearer God; for in the case
   of men it is the final intention that counts, while God accomplishes
   his good will even through the bad will of men. He is always just and
   always omnipotent (97-102). Therefore 1 Tim. II. 4 can only mean that
   God wills all classes of men to be saved, or that all those whom he
   resolves to save will be saved. In any case it is not to be imagined
   that he desires to save all, but is prevented (103).

   Had God foreknown that Adam, in keeping with his constitution, would
   have retained forever the will to avoid sin, he would have preserved
   him in his original state of salvation. But he knew the opposite, and
   therefore shaped his own will to effect good through him who did evil.
   For man must have been so created originally as to be able to do good
   and evil. Afterwards he will be changed, and will no longer be able to
   will evil; "nor will he therefore be without free choice" (nec ideo
   libero carebit arbitrio); for free will still exists, even if a time
   comes when we cannot will evil, just as it even now exists, although we
   can never will our own damnation. Only the order of things had to be
   observed, first the "posse non," then the "non posse." But grace is
   always necessary, and would have been even if man had not sinned; for
   he could only have attained the "non posse" by the co-operation of
   grace. (Men can indeed starve voluntarily, but mere appetite will not
   keep them alive; they require food.) But since sin entered, grace is
   much greater, because the will had itself to be freed in order that it
   might co-operate with grace (104-106.) Eternal life, though a reward of
   good works, is also a gift of grace, because our merits are God's
   gifts. God has made one vessel to honour and another to dishonour, that
   none should boast. The mediator who redeemed us required also to be
   God, "that the pride of man might be censured by the humility of God"
   (ut superbia humana per humilitatem dei argueretur), and that man might
   be shown how far he had departed from God, etc. (107, 108). After this
   long excursus, Augustine returns to § 93, and deals (log) with the
   intermediate state (in abditis receptaculis), and the mitigation
   obtained by departed souls through the Mass, and the alms of survivors
   in the Church; for there are many souls not good enough to be able to
   dispense with this provision, and not bad enough not to be benefited by
   it. "Wherefore here (on the earth) all merit is acquired by which
   anyone can be relieved or burdened after this life." [505] What the
   Church does for the dead (pro defunctis commendandis) is not
   inconsistent with Rom. XIV. 10; II. Cor. V. 10. For those who are
   wholly good it is a thanksgiving, for those not altogether bad an
   atonement, for those entirely wicked it is resultless, but gives
   comfort to the survivors; nay, while it makes remission complete
   (plena), it renders damnation more tolerable (110). After the Judgment
   there are only two states, though there are different grades in them.
   We must believe in the eternal duration of the pains of hell, although
   we may perhaps suppose that from time to time God lightens the
   punishment of the lost, or permits some sort of mitigation. "Death will
   continue without end, just as the collective eternal life of all saints
   will continue" (111-113). [506]

   Following his programme, Augustine ought now to have discussed in
   detail hope and love (prayer); but he omits doing so, because he has
   really touched on everything already. He therefore confines himself to
   affirming that hope applies solely to what we pray for in the Lord's
   Prayer, that three petitions refer to eternal, four to temporal,
   benefits, and that Matthew and Luke do not really differ in their
   versions of the Prayer (114-116). As regards love, he points out that
   it is the greatest of all. It, and not faith and hope, decides the
   measure of goodness possessed by a man. Faith and hope can exist
   without love, but they are useless. The faith that works in love, i.e.,
   the Holy Spirit by whom love is infused into our hearts, is
   all-important; for where love is wanting, fleshly lust reigns (117).
   There are four human conditions: life among the deepest shades of
   ignorance (altissimis ignorantiæ tenebris), under the law (which
   produces knowledge and conscious sin), under grace or good hope, and
   under peace (in the world beyond). Such has also been the history of
   God's people; but God has shown his grace even at the first and second
   stages (118), and thus even now man is laid hold of sometimes at the
   first, sometimes at the second, stage, all his sins being forgiven in
   his regeneration (119), so that death itself no longer harms him (120).
   All divine commands aim at love, and no good, if done from fear of
   punishment or any other motive than love, is done as it ought. All
   precepts (mandata) and counsels (consilia) given by God are comprised
   in the command to love God and our neighbour, and they are only rightly
   performed when they spring, at present in faith, in the future in
   immediate knowledge, from love. In the world of sight each will know
   what he should love in the other. Even now desire abates as love
   increases, until it reaches the love that leads a man to give his life
   for another. But how great will love be in the future state, when there
   no longer exists any desire to be overcome!
     __________________________________________________________________

   No one can mistake the popular Catholic features of this system of
   religion. It is based on the ancient Symbol. The doctrines of the
   Trinity and the Two Natures are faithfully avowed. The importance of
   the Catholic Church is strictly guarded, and its relation to the
   heavenly Church, which is the proper object of faith, is left as
   indefinite as the current view required. Baptism is set in the
   foreground as the "grand mystery of renovation," and is derived from
   Christ's death, in which the devil has obtained his due. Faith is only
   regarded as a preliminary condition; eternal life is only imparted to
   merits which are products of grace and freedom. They consist of works
   of love, which are summed up in almsgiving. Almsgiving is freely
   treated; it constitutes penance. Within the Church forgiveness is to be
   had for all sins after baptism, if only a fitting satisfaction is
   furnished (satisfacere ecclesiæ; satisfactio congrua). There is a scale
   of sins, from crimes to quite trivial daily offences. For this reason,
   wicked and good men are graded; but even the best (sancti, perfecti)
   can only be sinless in the sense that they commit none but the lightest
   sins. The saints are the perfect ascetics; asceticism is the
   culmination of love; but all do not need to practise it; we must
   distinguish between commands and counsels. In the future state both
   felicity and perdition will also be graded. Departed souls, if at death
   they have only left trivial sins unatoned for by penance, will be
   benefited by the masses, alms, and prayers of survivors. They are
   placed in a purgatory that cleanses them in the form of a decreed
   punishment. [507] If here popular Catholic elements are already
   strengthened, and the way prepared for their future elaboration, that
   is equally true of the doctrines of the intermediate state, the
   temporary mitigation of the punishment of the lost, the help afforded
   by holy angels to the Church of the present world, the completion--by
   means of redeemed mortals --of the heavenly Church reduced in number
   through the Fall of the wicked angels, the virginity of Mary even in
   partu, [508] and the grace of Christ as being greater than Adam's sin.
   This also applies to the opinion that the ignorant adherence to a false
   religion is worse than the knowing utterance of a lie, and to many
   other doctrines developed by Augustine in other writings. Finally, the
   conception of salvation that holds it to consist in "vision" and
   "fruition" is at the root of and runs through everything. Yet the most
   spiritual fact, the process of sanctification, is attached to
   mysteriously operating forces.

   But on the other hand, this system of religion is new. The old
   Symbol--the Apostles interpreted by the Nicene--was supplemented by new
   material which could only be very loosely combined with it, and which
   at the same time modified the original elements. In all three articles
   the treatment of sin, forgiveness, and perfecting in love is the main
   matter (10-15; 25-33; 41-52; 64-83). Everything is presented as a
   spiritual process, to which the briefly discussed old dogmatic material
   appears subordinated. Therefore, also, the third article comes into the
   foreground; a half of the whole book is devoted to the few words
   contained in it. Even in the outline, novelty is shown: religion is so
   much a matter of the inner life that faith, hope, and love are
   all-important (3-8). No cosmology is given in the first article;
   indeed, physical teaching is expressly denied to form part of dogmatics
   (9, 16 f.). Therefore any Logos doctrine is also wanting. The Trinity,
   taught by tradition as dogma, is apprehended in the strictest unity; it
   is the creator. It is really one person; the "persons," as Augustine
   teaches us in other writings, are inner phases (moments) in the one
   God; they have no cosmological import. Thus the whole Trinity also
   created the man Christ in Mary's womb; the Holy Ghost is only named
   because "spiritus" is also a term for "God's gift" (donum dei).
   Everything in religion relates to God as only source of all good, and
   to sin; the latter is distinguished from error. Hereby a breach is made
   with ancient intellectualism, though a trace of it remains in the
   contention that errors are very small sins. Wherever sin is thought of,
   so is free, predestinating grace (gratia gratis data). The latter is
   contrasted with the sin inherited from Adam; it first gives freedom to
   the enslaved will. The exposition of the first article closes with the
   reference to prevenient and subsequent mercy. How different would have
   been the wording of this article if Augustine had been able to give an
   independent version!

   The case is not different with the second article. The actual contents
   of the Symbol are only briefly touched on--the Second Advent is merely
   mentioned without a single Chiliastic observation. On the other hand,
   the following points of view come to the front. On the one side we have
   the unity of Christ's personality as the man (homo) with whose soul the
   Word united itself, the predestinating grace, that introduced this man
   into personal unity with the Deity, although he possessed no merits
   (hence the parallel with our regeneration); the close connection of
   Christ's death with redemption from the devil, atonement, and baptism
   (forgiveness of sins). But on the other side we find the view of
   Christ's appearance and history as loftiness in humility, and as the
   pattern of the Christian life. Christ's significance as redeemer [509]
   is quite as strongly expressed for Augustine in this humility in
   splendour, and in his example of a Christian life (see S. Bernard and
   S. Francis), as in his death. He fluctuates between these two points of
   view. The Incarnation wholly recedes, or is set in a light entirely
   unfamiliar to the Greeks. Thus the second article has been completely
   changed.

   The chief and novel point in the third article consists in the freedom
   and assurance with which Augustine teaches that the forgiveness of sins
   in the Church is inexhaustible. When we consider the attitude of the
   ancient Church, Augustine, and Luther, to the sins of baptised
   Christians, an external criticism might lead us to say that men grow
   more and more lax, and that the increasing prominence given to grace
   (the religious factor) was merely a means of evading the strict demands
   made by the gospel on morality--the Christian life. And this view is
   also correct, if we look at the great mass of those who followed those
   guides. But in their own case their new ideas were produced by a
   profounder consciousness of sin, and an absorption in the magnitude of
   divine grace as taught by Paul. Augustine stands midway between the
   ancient Church and Luther. The question of personal assurance of
   salvation had not yet come home to him; but the question: "How shall I
   get rid of my sins, and be filled with divine energy?" took the first
   place with him. Following the popular Catholic view, he looked to good
   works (alms, prayer, asceticism); but he conceived them to be the
   product of grace and the will subject to grace; further, he warned
   Christians against all external doing. As he set aside all ritualistic
   mysticism, so he was thoroughly aware that nothing was to be purchased
   by almsgiving pure and simple, but that the issue depended on an inner
   transformation, a pure heart, and a new spirit. At the same time he was
   sure that even after baptism the way of forgiveness was ever open to
   the penitent, and that he committed the sin against the Holy Ghost who
   did not believe in this remission of sins in the Church. That is an
   entirely new interpretation of the Gospel saying. The concluding
   section of the Symbol (resurrectio carnis) is explained even more
   thoroughly than the forgiveness of sins in its third treatment in the
   third article. But after a short discussion of the subject proper--the
   doctrine of predestination [510] and a view which as doctrine is
   likewise virtually new, and takes the place of Origen's theory of
   Apokatastasis--the main theme is the supposition of an intermediate
   state, and of a cleansing of souls in it, to which the offerings and
   prayers of survivors can contribute.

   Piety: faith and love instead of fear and hope. Theory of religion:
   something higher than aught we call doctrine, a new life in the power
   of love. The doctrine of Scripture: the substance--the gospel, faith,
   love and hope--God. The Trinity: the one living God. Christology: the
   one mediator, the man Jesus into union with whose soul the Deity
   entered, without that soul having deserved it. Redemption: death for
   the benefit of enemies and humility in greatness. The Sacraments: the
   Word side by side with the Symbols. Salvation (felicity): the beata
   necessitas of the good. The good: blessedness in dependence on God.
   History: God works everything in accordance with His good pleasure.
   With that compare the dogmatics of the Greeks! [511]

   The extent and position of dogma were also modified by this revolution.
   The old dogmas of the undivided Church, simply because they passed into
   the background, and were no longer expressive of piety itself, became
   more rigid; they more and more received the character of a legal
   system. The new dogmas, on the contrary, the doctrines of sin and grace
   in which piety lived, did not yet receive in their positive form the
   position and value of the old, nor were they definitely stated in
   rounded formulas. [512] Thus, through the instrumentality of Augustine,
   the extent and importance, in the history of dogma, of the doctrine of
   the Church became more uncertain. On the one hand, that doctrine was
   referred back to the gospel itself; on the other, it was much less
   sharply marked off than before from theology, since the new thoughts
   were not enclosed in fixed formulas. There was formed round the old
   dogma, which held its ground as an inflexible authority, a vast
   indefinite circle of doctrines, in which the most important religious
   conceptions lived, and which yet no one was capable of examining and
   weaving into a fixed connection. That is the state of dogma in the
   Middle Ages. Side by side with the growing inflexibility, the process
   of internal dissolution had already begun.

   During the storms of the tribal migrations, just before the power of
   barbarianism broke in, God bestowed on the Church a man who judged
   spiritual things spiritually, and taught Christendom what constituted
   Christian piety. So far as we can judge, the young Germano-Roman
   peoples, like the Slays, would have remained wholly incapable of ever
   appropriating independently and thoroughly the contemporary Christian
   religion, the Church system transmitted to them as law and cultus in
   fixed formulas, they would never have pierced through the husk to the
   kernel, if along with that system they had not also received Augustine.
   It was from him, or rather from the Gospel and Paulinism under his
   guidance, that they derived the courage to reform the Church and the
   strength to reform themselves.

   earliest period. But they were expressed with Augustine's thoroughness
   only by the Gnostics, Marcion and--the author of the fragment De
   resurrectione ascribed to Justin. The parallel offered by the latter
   (c. 3) is extremely striking. There is not yet, naturally, any question
   of sin being propagated through sexual union; that union is held simply
   to be sinful; metras estin energeia to kuiskein kai moriou andrikou to

   alms as conferring a license.

   [500] "Delet omnino hæc oratio minima et quotidiana peccata."

   [501] Augustine here says with great truth that love of our enemies is
   possible only to a small minority (the perfect). But even those who do
   not attain it are heard if they utter the fifth petition in faith.

   [506] Manebit sine fine mors, sicut manebit communiter omnium vita
   æterna sanctorum.

   [507] The Enchiridion is not the only work in which Augustine has
   spoken of this ignis purgatarius.

   [508] The growing Marian dogma (see Vol. IV., p. 314) was thus
   strengthened rather than weakened by Augustine. He agreed entirely with
   Ambrose and Jerome (against Jovinian). By a woman came death, by a
   woman came life; Mary's faith conceived the Saviour. Julian's
   remarkable objection to the doctrine of original sin, that it made Mary
   to be subject to the devil (nascendi conditione), Augustine met by
   saying (Op. imp. IV. 122): "ipsa conditio nascendi solvitur gratia
   renascendi." We may not maintain it to be certain (see Schwane II., p.
   691 f.) that Augustine thus implicitly taught Mary's immaculate
   conception. On the other hand, he undoubtedly held her to be without
   active sin; see De nat. et gr. 36: "Excepta itaque s. virgine Maria, de
   qua propter honorem domini nullam prorsus, cum de peccatis agitur,
   haberi volo quæstionem; unde enim scimus, quid ei plus gratiæ collatum
   fuerit ad vincendum omni ex parte peccatum, quæ concipere et parere
   meruit, quem constat nullum habuisse peccatum? hac ergo virgine excepta
   si omnes illos sanctos et sanctas, cum hic viverent, congregare
   possimus et interrogare, utrum essent sine peccato, quid fuisse
   responsuros putamus, utrum hoc quod ista dicit an quod Johannes
   apostolus?" Gen. ad litt. X. 18-21. Augustine helped to give Mary a
   special position between Christ and Christians, simply because he first
   emphasised strongly the sinfulness of all men, even the saints, and
   then excepted Mary. Mary's passive receptivity in relation to grace is
   emphasised with the same words as that of the man Jesus.

   [509] Sin and original sin are again discussed in §§ 41.52, but they
   are now looked at from the standpoint of their removal through the
   baptism that emanates from Christ's death.

   [510] The doctrine of predestination--before Augustine almost unheard
   of in the Catholic Church--constituted the power of his religious life,
   as Chiliasm did that of the post-apostolic, and mysticism that of the
   Greek Church. In Augustine, in addition to its Biblical and Neoplatonic
   supports, the doctrine had indeed a strong religious root--free grace
   (gratia gratis data). But the latter by itself does not explain the
   importance which the doctrine had gained in his case. As everything
   that lives and works in nature is attached to something else, and is
   never found in an independent state, so, too, there is no distilled
   piety, On the contrary, so long as we men are men, precisely the most
   vital piety will be least isolated and free. None but the dogmatist can
   construct such a religion. But history teaches that all great religious
   personalities have connected their saving faith inextricably with
   convictions which to the reflecting mind appear to be irrelevant
   additions. In the history of Christianity there are the three
   named--Chiliasm, mysticism, and the doctrine of predestination. It is
   in the bark formed by these that faith has grown, just as it is not in
   the middle of the stem, but at its circumference, where stem and bark
   meet, that the sap of the plant flows. Strip the tree, and it will
   wither! Therefore it is well-meant, but foolish, to suppose that
   Augustine would have done better to have given forth his teaching
   without the doctrine of predestination.

   [511] An excellent comparison between Origen and Augustine occurs in
   Bigg, The Christian Platonists, pp. 284-290. He has sharply emphasised
   the inconsistencies in Augustine's doctrine of the primitive state,
   original sin, and grace, but he has not overlooked the advance made by
   Augustine on Origen. If we evolve Augustine's doctrine from
   predestination, then Bigg is right when he says: "Augustine's system is
   in truth that of the Gnostics, the ancestors of the Manichees. For it
   makes no real difference whether our doom is stamped upon the nature
   given to us by our Creator, or fixed by an arbitrary decree."

   [512] The resistance of the Pelagians and their associates was also a
   resistance to the formation of new dogmas in general. Exactly like the
   Eusebians in the Arian conflict, they also fought against the new
   construction of dogmas by the North African Church on formal grounds.

CHAPTER V.

  HISTORY OF DOGMA IN THE WEST DOWN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE MIDDLE AGES (A.D.
  430-604).
     __________________________________________________________________

   We have already described in Vol. III. of our present work, as far as
   it bore on the history of dogma, the part taken by the West during this
   period in the Christological controversies of the East, the great
   impetus given to the papacy by the successors of Damasus, and further
   by Leo I. and his successors. We have shown how the papal power was in
   the sixth century embroiled, and (under Justinian) almost perished, in
   the East Gothic and Byzantine turmoils; how the fifth Council produced
   a schism in the West, and shook the position of the papacy, and how on
   the other hand the latter regained and strengthened its importance
   through the instrumentality of Gregory I. [513] [514] We also reviewed
   the important work, in which Vincentius of Lerinum standing on
   Augustine's shoulders, described the antiquitas catholicæ fidei, i.e.,
   the Catholic conception of tradition. [515] The whole West was agitated
   in our period by the storms of the tribal migrations. The ancient world
   received its final blow, and the Church itself, so far as it was
   composed of Romans, seemed to run wild under the horror and pressure of
   the times. [516] The young peoples which streamed in were Christian,
   but Arian. In the kingdom of the Franks alone there arose a Catholic,
   German nation, which began slowly to be fused with the ancient Roman
   population; but the Church, with its cultus, law, and language,
   remained Latin: victus victori legem dat. The Franks were at the outset
   in the Latin Church, as at the present day the Mongolian tribes of
   Finland are in the Greek Church of Russia. This Latin Church, which,
   however, had parted in Franconia with the Roman Bishop, or was only
   connected with him by respect for him, preserved its old interests in
   Gaul and Spain, and continued its former life until the end of the
   sixth century. [517] Even up till that time the old civilisation had
   not wholly perished in it, but it was almost stifled by the
   barbarianism, which resulted from fusion with the invading populace. In
   North Africa, in spite of dreadful sufferings, Catholic Latin
   ecclesiasticism held its ground till on into the seventh century. But
   the Church, once so independent in its relations with Rome, found
   itself compelled more than once in this period to turn for succour to
   Rome for its self-preservation. The position of Italy, i.e., of the
   Roman Bishop, was wholly peculiar, for the Church of Middle and Lower
   Italy never played any part in Church history. So far as a Catholic
   Church still existed in the West in the German Empire, it represented
   the remnant of the shattered Western Roman Empire, and therefore lay in
   the sphere of power of the Roman Bishop, even if this relationship
   might not take any definite shape for the moment. But this Roman Bishop
   was himself fettered to the East, and political and ecclesiastical ties
   compelled him to look more to the East than the West. The fact that he
   nevertheless did not lose his connection with the latter, he, in the
   sixth century, owed more to his past, and his impregnable position in
   Rome, than to a deliberate policy. [518]

   Under the Catholic Bishops who had survived in Gaul and North Africa as
   representatives of the Roman Empire, a not altogether unimportant part
   of the history of dogma was enacted in our period, viz., the fight for
   and against complete Augustinianism. The Roman Bishop, though much more
   concerned with the Christological and political questions of the East,
   intervened also in this matter. At the close of our period, when
   absolute darkness had settled on the West, the great monachist Pope and
   "father of superstitions" introduced the ecclesiastical world to the
   Middle Ages in the form required by uncivilised peoples. In doing so,
   he had not to do violence to his own convictions; for the civilisation
   that was passing away inclined to barbarianism. [519]

   We have only therefore to consider, in what follows, the conflict waged
   round Augustinianism, and the position of Gregory the Great in the
   history of dogma. [520]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [513] Gregory, certainly, had almost to abandon the fifth Council.

   [514] The papal power received its greatest accession of authority from
   the days of Damasus to the end of the fifth century: it was then
   settled that the primacy was to be a permanent institution of the
   Catholic Church. This accession of strength was partly due to the fact
   that in that century the Chair of St. Peter was occupied by a number of
   peculiarly capable, clever, and energetic Bishops. But the advance was
   caused to a still greater extent by external conditions. The most
   important may be mentioned here. (1) The dogmatic complications in the
   East gave the Popes an opportunity of acting as umpires, or of
   exhibiting in full light the doctrinal correctness "characteristic of
   the Chair of St. Peter." (2) The Western Roman Empire leant ultimately
   for support, in its decline, on the Roman Bishop (see the Ep. Valent.
   III. to Leo. I.); when it perished the latter was its natural heir,
   since the central political power in the West was gone, and the
   Byzantine Emperor had not the power, the leader of the German hosts not
   the prestige, necessary to restore it. (3) The storms of the tribal
   migration drove the Catholics of Western countries, which were seized
   by Arians, into the arms of Rome; even where this did not happen at
   once, the opposition ceased which had been previously offered to the
   claims of the Roman Bishop by the provinces, especially North Africa.
   (4) The patriarchal constitution never got established in the West, and
   the Metropolitan only succeeded in part; thus the development into the
   papal constitution was ensured for the future. (5) The transactions
   with the political power of Eastern Rome and the Imperial Bishop there
   now compelled the Roman Bishops, that they might not be at a
   disadvantage in dealing with Constantinople, to deduce their peculiar
   position, which they owed to the capital of the world, entirely from
   their spiritual (their apostolic or Petrine) dignity. But this
   exclusive basing of the Roman Chair on Peter afforded the firmest
   foundation at a time when all political force tottered or collapsed,
   but the religious was respected. Even the thought of political
   sovereignty, so far as such a thought could arise in the Roman Empire
   at all, seems to have dawned on Leo's successors. In any case, the
   position of the papacy was so secure at the close of the fifth century,
   that even the frightful storms of the sixth century were unable to
   uproot it. That in the West--outside of Rome--the theory of the Roman
   Bishop (following Matt. XVI.) came but slowly to be recognised, and
   that the attempt was made to retain independence as far as the
   exigencies of the case permitted, ought to be expressly noticed.
   Theologians only admitted that the Roman Bishop represented
   ecclesiastical unity, and did not assent to the papistical inference
   that it was the prerogative of Rome to govern the Churches.

   debet placatrix dei, quid est aliud quam exacerbatrix dei? aut præter

   coetus Christianorum quam sentina vitiorum?"

   [517] See Hatch, "The Organisation of the Early Christian Churches,"
   Lecture viii., and "The Growth of Church Institutions," p. 1 f.

   [518] The recognition in Rome of the fifth Council had almost alienated
   Italy and North Africa from the Pope.

   [519] Yet classical culture was never quite extinct in Italy (Rome).
   Its representatives in the sixth century were Cassiodorus, the pious
   churchman, on the one hand, and Boethius, the latitudinarian, on the
   other. The former laboured earnestly on behalf of the Church and
   monachism of his time (compare also the exertions of Junilius); the
   latter was the instructor of a later age (see above, p. 34).

   [520] On the history of the Apostolic Symbol in our period see my
   article in Herzog's R. E. 3 Ed.; Caspari, Quellen I.-IV. Vols.; v.
   Zerschwitz, System der Katechetik II. 1. Of the additions made to the
   ancient Roman Symbol, and afterwards universally accepted, the only one
   important dogmatically is the phrase "communio sanctorum." It can be
   proved from the second homily of Faustus of Rhegium (Caspari,
   Kirchenhist. Anekdota, p. 338), and his Tractat de symbolo, which he
   certainly did not edit himself (Caspari, Quellen IV., p. 250 ff.), that
   South Gallican Churches had the words "communio sanctorum" in the
   Apostolicum in the second half of the fifth century. It is debatable
   whether they already stood in the Symbol of Nicetas, whom I identify
   with Nicetas of Romatiana--the friend of Paulinus of Nola; they may
   also have merely belonged to the exposition, which was strongly
   influenced by Cyril's Catechisms (see Kattenbusch, Apost. Symbolum,
   1894, Vol. I). If it were certain that they were merely meant in the
   Gallican Symbol to stand in exegetical apposition to "sancta ecclesia,"
   then we would have to suppose that that Symbol had been influenced by
   the countless passages in which Augustine describes the Church as
   communio sanctorum, i.e., of the angels and all the elect, inclusive of
   the simple justi (or with synonymous terms). But, firstly, one does not
   conceive how a mere exegetical apposition should have got into the
   Symbol, and why that should have happened particularly in Gaul;
   secondly, the explanation of the words by Faustus points in another
   direction. We read in his second homily: "Credamus et sanctorum
   communionem, sed sanctos non tam pro dei parte, quam pro dei honore
   veneremur. Non sunt sancti pars illius, sed ipse probatur pars esse
   sanctorum. Quare? quia, quod sunt, de illuminatione et de similitudine
   ejus accipiunt; in sanctis autem non res dei, sed pars dei est.
   Quicquid enim de deo participant, divinæ est gratiæ, non naturæ.
   Colamus in sanctis timorem et amorem dei, non divinitatem dei, colamus
   merita, non quæ de proprio habent, sed quæ accipere pro devotione
   meruerunt. Digne itaque venerandi sunt, dum nobis dei cultum et futuræ
   vitæ desiderium contemptu mortis insinuant." And still more clearly in
   the Tractate (p. 273 f.): ". . . transeamus ad sanctorum communionem.
   Illos hic sententia ista confundit, qui sanctorum et amicorum dei
   cineres non in honore debere esse blasphemant, qui beatorum martyrum
   gloriosam memoriam sacrorum reverentia monumentorum colendam esse non
   credunt. In symbolum prævaricati sunt, et Christo in fonte mentiti
   sunt." Faustus accordingly understands by the "sancti" not all the
   justi, but--as Augustine not infrequently does--the specifically
   "holy," and he contends that the words aimed at the followers of
   Vigilantius who rejected the worship of the saints. In that case
   "communio sanctorum" means communion of or with the specifically
   "holy." It is still matter of dispute whether this is really the idea
   to which the Apostolicum owes its questionable acquisition, or whether
   the latter is only a very early artificial explanation. On the
   "filioque" in the Constantinopolitan Creed, see Vol. IV., p. 126 f.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. The Conflict between Semi-Pelagianism and Augustinianism.

   Augustine and the North-African Church had succeeded in getting
   Pelagianism condemned; but this did not by any means involve the
   acceptance of Augustinianism in the Church. Augustine's authority,
   indeed, was very great everywhere, and in many circles he was
   enthusiastically venerated; [521] but his doctrine of gratia
   irresistibilis (absolute predestination) met with opposition, both
   because it was new and unheard of, [522] and because it ran counter,
   not only to prevalent conceptions, but also to clear passages of Holy
   Scripture. The fight against it was not only a fight waged by the old
   conception of the Church against a new one--for Semi-Pelagianism was
   the ancient doctrine of Tertullian, Ambrose, and Jerome--but the old
   gospel was also defended against novel teaching; for Semi-Pelagianism
   was also an evangelical protest, which grew up on Augustinian piety,
   against a conception of the same Augustine that was intolerable as
   doctrine. [523] Accordingly, it is not strange that "Semi-Pelagianism"
   raised its head in spite of the overthrow of Pelagianism; rather it is
   strange that it was ultimately compelled to submit to Augustinianism.
   This submission was never indeed perfectly honest. On the other hand,
   there lurked an element of "Semi-Pelagianism" in Augustinianism itself;
   viz., in the doctrines of the primitive state, of righteousness--as the
   product of grace and the will--and of merits. When Augustinianism
   triumphed, these points necessarily came to the front. But a situation
   was thus created that was wholly insecure, capable of various
   interpretations, and untrue in itself.

   Augustine himself found by experience that his doctrine of grace
   produced internal disturbances among the monks at Hadrumetum. Free-will
   was done with; men could fold their hands; good works were superfluous;
   even at the Last Judgment they were not taken into account. Augustine
   sought to appease them by his treatise, De gratia et lib. arbitrio, and
   he followed this with his work, De correptione et gratia, when he heard
   that doubts had risen whether the erring and sinful should still be
   reprimanded, or if their case was sufficiently met by intercession.
   Augustine strove in these writings to remove the misunderstandings of
   the monks, but he formulated his doctrine of grace more sharply than
   ever, trying, however, to retain free choice and the popular Catholic
   view. A year or two afterwards (428-9) he was informed by his devoted
   friends, Prosper, Tyro, [524] and Hilary [525] (Epp. 225, 226,), that
   at Marseilles and other places in France there was an unwillingness to
   admit the strict doctrine of predestination, and the view that the will
   was completely impotent, [526] because they paralysed Christian
   preaching. Augustine replied, confirming his friends, but giving new
   offence to his opponents by his two writings, De prædestinatione
   sanctorum and De dono perseverantiæ. He died soon afterwards,
   bequeathing his mantle to disciples whose fidelity and steadfastness
   had to atone for their want of independence. The Gallican monks ("servi
   dei") now advanced to open opposition. [527] It is quite intelligible
   that monks, and Greek-trained monks, should have first entered the
   lists. Among them the most prominent were Johannes Cassianus, father of
   South Gallican monachism [528] and disciple of Chrysostom and
   Vincentius of Lerinum. [529] The former has especially formulated his
   standpoint in the 13th Conference of his "collationes patrum," which
   bears the title "De protectione dei." [530] He takes objection above
   all to absolute predestination, the particularism of grace, and the
   complete bondage of the will. His teaching as to grace and liberty is
   as follows.

   God's grace is the foundation of our salvation; every beginning is to
   be traced to it, in so far as it brings the chance of salvation and the
   possibility of being saved. But that is external grace; inner grace is
   that which lays hold of a man, enlightens, chastens, and sanctifies
   him, and penetrates his will as well as his intelligence. Human virtue
   can neither grow nor be perfected without this grace--therefore the
   virtues of the heathens are very small. [531] But the beginnings of the
   good resolve, good thoughts, and faith--understood as the preparation
   for grace--can be due to ourselves. Hence grace is absolutely necessary
   in order to reach final salvation (perfection), but not so much so in
   order to make a start. It accompanies us at all stages of our inner
   growth, and our exertions are of no avail without it (libero arbitrio
   semper co-operatur); but it only supports and accompanies him who
   really strives, "who reaches forward to the mark." Yet at times God
   anticipates the decision of men, and first renders them willing--e.g.,
   at the call of Matthew and Paul; but even this--rare--action of grace
   is not irresistible. Free-will is never destroyed by God--that we must
   hold, even if we admit the incomprehensibleness of divine grace.
   Similarly, we must hold firmly to the conviction that God wills
   earnestly the salvation of all, and that therefore Christ's redemption
   applies not only to the small number of elect, but to all men. The
   contrary doctrine involved "a huge blasphemy" (ingens sacrilegium).
   Predestination can therefore be only grounded on prescience--and the
   proposition that it was foreknown what anything would have been, if it
   had been at all, had at that time arisen in connection with the
   question of those dying in infancy. [532] But Cassian has hardly given
   an opinion on the relation of prescience and predestination. Regarding
   the primitive state, he taught that it was one of immortality, wisdom,
   and perfect freedom. Adam and Eve's Fall had entailed corruption and
   inevitable sinfulness on the whole race. But with a free, though a
   weakened, will, there also remained a certain ability to turn to the
   good. [533]

   It is usual to condemn "Semi-Pelagianism." But absolute condemnation is
   unjust. If a universal theory is to be set up, in the form of a
   doctrine, of the relation of God to mankind (as object of his will to
   save), then it can only be stated in terms of "Semi-Pelagianism" or
   Cassianism. Cassian did not pledge himself to explain everything; he
   knew very well that "God's judgments are incomprehensible and his ways
   inscrutable." Therefore he rightly declined to enter into the question
   of predestination. In refusing, however, to probe the mystery to the
   bottom, he demanded that so far as we affirmed anything on the subject,
   we should not prejudice the universality of grace and the
   accountability of man, i.e., his free-will. That was an evangelical and
   correct conception. But as Augustine erred in elevating the necessary
   self-criticism of the advanced Christian into a doctrine, which should
   form the sole standard by which to judge the whole sphere of God's
   dealings with men, so Cassian erred in not separating his legitimate
   theory from the rule by which the individual Christian ought to regard
   his own religious state. He thus opened the door to self-righteousness,
   because from fear of fatalism he would not bluntly say to himself and
   those whose spiritual guide he was, that the faith which does not know
   that it is produced by God is still entangled in the life of self.
   [534]

   Prosper, himself an ascetic and a frequenter of the famous cloisters of
   Provence, had already attacked his friends as Troubadour of
   Augustinianism during the lifetime of Augustine (Carmen de ingratis,
   see also the Ep. ad Rufinum). Now, after 430, he wrote several works in
   which he defended Augustine, and also himself, against charges that had
   been brought against Augustinianism. [535] He did not succeed in
   convincing the monks; for his admission that Augustine spoke too
   harshly ("durius") when he said that God did not will that all men
   should be saved, [536] did not satisfy, and their scruples were not
   even removed by his contention that there was only one predestination
   (to salvation), that we must distinguish between this and prescience
   (as regards the reprobati), and in doing so be certain that God's
   action was not determined by caprice, but by justice and holiness.
   [537] He did, however, succeed in getting Pope Celestine to send a
   letter to the Gallican monks, supporting Augustine and blaming the
   opposition for presumption. The Pope was, however, very reserved in
   dealing with the matter in question, although he stated strongly the
   activity of grace as prevenient. [538] Prosper now wrote (432) his
   chief work against the 13th Collatio of Cassian, in which he showed
   more controversial skill, convicted his opponent of inconsistencies,
   and stated his own standpoint in a more cautious form, but without any
   concession in substance. He left Gaul, and took no further part in the
   dispute, but showed in his "Sentences" and "Epigrams" that as a
   theologian he continued to depend on Augustine alone. [539]

   Another Augustinian, unknown to us, author of the work, De vocatione
   omnium gentium, [540] sought to do justice to the opposition by
   undertaking to combine the doctrine of the exclusive efficacy of divine
   grace with the other that God willed that all men should be saved. His
   intention proves that even among Augustine's admirers offence was taken
   at his principle of the particularism of God's purpose to save. But the
   laudable endeavour to combine the truth of Augustinianism with a
   universalist doctrine could not but fail. For all the author's
   distinctions between universal grace (creation and history) and special
   (Christ), and between the sensual, animal, and spiritual will (voluntas
   sensualis, animalis, spiritalis), as well as his assertions that grace,
   while preparing the will, does not supersede it, and that God desires
   the salvation of all, could not remove the real causes of offence (the
   damnation of children who died unbaptised, and reprobation in general)
   since Augustinianism was to be strictly upheld. [541] The work was at
   all events written with the honourable intention of removing doubts and
   establishing peace. On the other hand, attempts had been made on the
   Semi-Pelagian side from the first to make Augustinianism impossible, by
   an unsparing exposure of its real and supposed consequences, and these
   efforts culminated (about 450?) in the notorious "Prædestinatus" first
   discovered in A.D. 1643. The mystery that overhangs this work has not
   yet been fully solved; but it is probable that the writing of a
   predestinationist, introduced into Book II., and refuted, from the
   standpoint of Semi-Pelagianism, in Book III., is a forgery. For
   Augustine's teaching is unfolded in it entirely in paradoxical,
   pernicious, and almost blasphemous propositions, such as no Augustinian
   ever produced. [542] (We have both kinds of predestination strictly
   carried out: "those whom God has once predestined will, even if they
   neglect, sin, or refuse, be brought unwillingly to life, while those
   whom he has predestined to death labour in vain, even if they run or
   hasten)." [543] And the contention that the "sect of the
   predestinationists" [544] covers itself with Augustine's name, like the
   wolf in sheep's clothing, is a bold, controversial trick of fence.

   Of the effects produced by this venomous writing nothing is known; on
   the other hand, we do know that Semi-Pelagianism continued to exist
   undisturbed in Southern Gaul, [545] and, indeed, found its most
   distinguished defender in Faustus of Rhegium (died shortly before 500),
   formerly Abbot at Lerinum. [546] This amiable and charitable Bishop,
   highly respected in spite of many peculiar theories, took an active
   part in all the controversies and literary labours of his time. He was
   the forerunner of Gregory I. in establishing, from the Episcopal Chair,
   monastic Christianity in the Gallican communities. He had entered the
   lists against Pelagius ("pestifer"), and he now fought as decidedly
   against the tenet of the extinction of free-will and the doctrine of
   predestination, which he declared to be erroneous, blasphemous,
   heathen, fatalistic, and conducive to immorality. The occasion was
   furnished by Lucidus, a Presbyter of Augustinian views, who made an
   uncompromising statement of the doctrine of predestination. He recanted
   formally after the "error prædestinationis" had been condemned at a
   Synod at Arles (475), with the assistance, if not on the instigation,
   of Faustus. [547] After this Synod, and a second at Lyons, Faustus
   composed his work, De gratia dei et humane mentis libero arbitrio, lib.
   II., meant to explain the dogmatic attitude of the Synods--against
   Pelagius and predestination. [548] Grace and freedom are parallel; it
   is certain that man, since Adam's Fall, is externally and internally
   corrupt, that original sin and death as the result of sin reign over
   him, and that he is thus incapable of attaining salvation by his own
   strength; but it is as certain that man can still obey or resist grace.
   God wills the salvation of all; all need grace; but grace reckons on
   the will which remains, though weakened; it always co-operates with the
   latter; otherwise the effort of human obedience (labor humanæ
   obedientiæ) [549] would be in vain. Original sin and free-will, in its
   infirm, weakened state (infirmatum, attenuatum), are not mutually
   exclusive. But those who ascribe everything to grace fall into heathen
   and blasphemous follies. [550] Our being saved is God's gift; it does
   not rest, however, on an absolute predestination, but God's
   predetermination depends on the use man makes of the liberty still left
   him, and in virtue of which he can amend himself (prescience). Faustus
   no longer shows himself to be so strongly influenced by Augustine's
   thoughts as Cassian, [551] although, as a theologian, he owes more to
   him than the latter does. He is "more of a monk." Faith also is a work
   and a human achievement; [552] ascetic performances are in general
   brought still more to the front by him, and the possibility of grace
   preceding the movement of the will towards good is understood to mean
   that salvation is first offered to a man from without by means of
   preaching, law, and reproof. (In this sense Faustus is even of opinion
   that the beginning is always the work of grace.) The most questionable
   (Pelagian) feature, however, consists in Faustus giving a very
   subordinate place to internal grace--the adjutorium essentially means
   for him external aid in the form of law and doctrine--and that he
   clearly returns to the Pelagian conception of nature as the original
   (universal) grace [gratia prima (universalis)]. It is manifest, on the
   other hand, that he sought to lead precisely ascetics to humility; even
   where they increase their own merits they are to remember that
   "whatever we are is of God," (dei est omne quod sumus), i.e., that
   perfect virtue is impossible without grace. [553] We see when we look
   closely that Faustus already distinctly preached implicitly the later
   doctrine of meritum de congruo et de condigno. [554] In faith as
   knowledge, and in the exertions of the will to amend ourselves, we have
   a merit supported by the first grace (gratia prima); to it is imparted
   redeeming grace, and the latter now co-operates with the will in
   producing perfect merits.

   In his own time Faustus hardly met with an opponent, not to speak of
   one his equal. [555] But in Rome Augustine was held in high honour,
   without anyone, certainly, saying how far he was prepared to go with
   him, and doctrines which directly contradicted him were not tolerated.
   If we may ascribe the decree, De libris recipiendis et non recipiendis,
   to Gelasius, then that Pope, who is also proved by other facts to have
   been a strong opponent of Pelagianism, declared Augustine and Prosper's
   writings to be in harmony with the Church, but those of Cassian and
   Faustus "apocryphal." But the course of affairs in Rome at the
   beginning of the sixth century makes the ascription of this decree to
   Gelasius--in its present form--improbable. That is, as Pelagianism had
   formerly amalgamated with Nestorianism, to which it gravitated, and had
   thus sealed its doom, so Semi-Pelagianism did not escape the fate of
   being dragged into the Christological controversy, and of being
   assailed by the dislike which orthodoxy influenced by Monophysitism
   cherished against all "that was human." Those Scythian monks in
   Constantinople, who wished to force Theopaschitism on the Church, [556]
   handed to the Legate of Pope Hormisdas a Confession of faith, in which
   they opposed the remains of Nestorianism as well as the doctrine that
   grace did not effect the act of will and its accomplishment (519).
   [557] Dismissed by the Legate, they brought their view in person before
   the Pope, and sent a report to the banished North African Bishops, who
   were residing in Sardinia, and among whom the most important was
   Fulgentius of Ruspe, a practised disputant against Arianism, and a
   faithful adherent of Augustine. The report of the Scythians, which
   discussed Christology as well as the doctrine of grace, and quoted in
   support of the latter--in its Augustinian form--Eastern and Western
   authorities, closes with the words: "We hold it necessary to add this;
   not as if you did not know it, but we have considered it useful to
   insert it in our short paper, in order to refute the folly of those who
   reject it as containing tenets novel and entirely unheard of in the
   churches. Instructed in the teaching of all these holy Fathers, we
   condemn Pelagius, Cælestius, Julian, and those of a similar type of
   thought, especially the books of Faustus of the cloister of Lerinum,
   which there is no doubt were written against the doctrine of
   predestination. In these he attacks the tradition not only of these
   holy Fathers, but also of the Apostle himself, annexing the support of
   grace to human effort, and, while doing away with the whole grace of
   Christ, avowing impiously that the ancient saints were not saved, as
   the most holy Apostle Peter teaches, by the same grace as we are, but
   by natural capacity."

   The North Africans assented to this, and Fulgentius in reply wrote his
   work, De incarnatione et gratia, in which, as in earlier writings, he
   defended the Augustinian standpoint, and especially derived original
   sin from the lust of sexual intercourse. Free-will in the state of sin
   was wickedly free (male liberum), and Christ's grace was to be sharply
   distinguished from grace in creation (gratia creans) [c. 12]; the act
   of willing is not ours, and assistance God's, business, but "it is the
   part of God's grace to aid, that it may be mine to will, believe" (c.
   16: gratis dei est adjuvare, ut sit meum velle credere). Rom. II. 14,
   is to be applied to the Gentiles justified by faith (c. 25); and the
   particularism of grace is also maintained. [558] The Scythians left
   Rome, leaving behind them an anathema on Nestorians, Pelagian,, and all
   akin to them. The celebrated name of Faustus appeared in a bad light,
   and Possessor, an exiled African Bishop who lived in Constantinople,
   hastened to recommend himself to the Pope by the submissive query, What
   view was now to be taken of Faustus? assuring him at the same time that
   distinguished State officials equally desired enlightenment. [559]
   Hormisdas gave a reserved answer (Aug. 520). The Scythian monks were
   branded as vile disturbers of orthodoxy; Faustus was described as a man
   whose private views need disquiet nobody, as the Church had not raised
   him to the post of a teacher; the doctrine of the Roman Church as
   regards sin and grace could be seen from Augustine's writings,
   especially those to Prosper and Hilary. The Scythians sent a vigorous
   reply, sparing the Pope in so far as they questioned the authenticity
   of his letter. If Augustine's teaching was that of the Catholic Church,
   then Faustus was a heretic; that is what the Pope would have
   necessarily said. The heresy was perfectly clear; for Faustus only
   understood by prevenient grace, external grace--the preaching of the
   gospel. At the same time, the monks instigated Fulgentius now to write
   directly against Faustus, which he did in the Seven Books c. Faustum
   (lost) and--on his return to Africa A.D. 523--in his work, De veritate
   prædestinationis et gratin dei (l. III.) In this work Fulgentius
   expounds out and out Augustinianism (particularism of the will to
   save), but rejects the idea of a predestination to sin (nevertheless to
   punishment). [560] The Bishops remaining in Sardinia concurred fully
   with their colleague in the Ep. Synodica addressed to the Scythian
   monks: grace is the light, the will the eye; the eye needs light in
   order to be able to see the light. Faustus' theses are "inventions,
   contrary to the truth, entirely hostile to the Catholic faith"
   (commenta, veritati contraria, catholicæ fidei penitus inimica).

   These conflicts could not be without consequence for Southern Gaul.
   Still greater effect was produced by the reading of Augustine's
   writings, especially his sermons. In an age that thought solely in
   contrasts, the dilemma whether Augustine was a holy doctor or a heretic
   could only be decided ultimately in favour of the incomparable teacher.
   Cæsarius of Arles, the most meritorious and famous Bishop at the
   beginning of the sixth century, had, though trained in Lerinum and
   never wholly belying his training, so steeped himself in Augustine's
   works, that he would not abandon him, and his theology and sermons
   became a mirror of the master's important thoughts and forms of
   expression (though not of all or the most characteristic of them).
   [561] He fought against (+ 542) the writings and authority of Faustus.
   [562] In Southern Gaul he at first met with much opposition, but still
   more indifference--for how many Bishops were there at the beginning of
   the sixth century capable of understanding Augustinianism? In Rome, on
   the contrary, he found approval. [563] This approval was not without
   effect in Gaul. [564] A mixed Synod at Orange [565] in A.D. 529 under
   the presidency of Csarius approved of twenty-five Canons, i.e.,
   headings extracted by Pope Felix IV. from Augustine and Prosper's
   writings, and sent by him to the South Gallicans as the doctrine of the
   "ancient Fathers," in order to support Cæsarius in his fight against
   Semi-Pelagianism. [566]

   These Canons [567] are strongly anti-Semi-Pelagian:--3: "The grace of
   God is not granted in response to prayer, but itself causes the prayer
   to be offered for it." 4: "That we may be cleansed from sin, God does
   not wait upon, but prepares, our will." 5: "The beginning of faith is
   not due to us, but to the grace of God--that state of believing by
   which we believe in him who justifies the impious, and attain the
   regeneration of holy Baptism, is brought about through the gift of
   grace, i.e., the inspiration of the Holy Spirit correcting our will
   from unbelief to faith, and is not ours naturally." 6: "It is the work
   of grace that we believe, will, desire, attempt, knock, etc., and not
   vice-versâ." 7: "We cannot without grace think or choose, by our
   natural powers, anything good that pertains to salvation." 8: "It is
   untrue that some attain baptismal faith by mercy, others by free-will."
   9: "As often as we do good, God works in and with us, that we may
   work." 10: "Even the regenerate and holy always need the divine aid."
   11: "We can only vow to God what we ourselves have received from him."
   12: "God loves us as we shall be by his gift, not as we are by our
   merit." 13: "Choice of will, weakened in the first man, cannot be
   repaired except by the grace of Baptism." 16: "Let no one boast of what
   he seems to have as if he did not receive it, or think that he has
   received, because the letter appeared or was sounded outwardly that it
   might be read or heard." 17: "On the love of God diffused in hearts by
   the Holy Spirit." 18: "Undeserved grace precedes meritorious works."
   19: "Even if it had remained in the sound state in which it was
   created, human nature would by no means preserve itself without the aid
   of its creator." 21: "The law does not justify, and grace is not
   nature; therefore Christ died not gratuitously, but that the law might
   be fulfilled, and that nature, ruined by Adam, might be repaired by
   him." 22: "No one has anything of his own but falsehood and sin," and
   "The virtue of heathens is produced only by worldly desire, that of
   Christians springs not from free will, but from the gift of the Holy
   Ghost." [568] 23: "In (doing) evil men carry out their own will, but
   when they do what they resolve in order to serve the divine will,
   although their actions are willed by them, yet it is his will by which
   their act of will is both prepared and commanded." 24: "The twig does
   not benefit the stem, but the stem the twig; so also those who have
   Christ in them and abide in him do not benefit Christ, but themselves."
   25: "To love God is the gift of God."

   The definition given by the Bishops, after drawing up these heads, is
   likewise strongly anti-Semi-Pelagian. [569] But no mention is made of
   predestination, [570] nor is the inner process of grace, on which
   Augustine laid the chief stress, properly appreciated. The former fact
   would have been no blemish in itself; but at that time, when the
   question was whether the whole Augustine was authoritative or not,
   silence was dangerous. Those who were disposed to Semi-Pelagianism
   could appeal to the fact that Augustine's doctrine of predestination
   was not approved, and might then introduce into this unsanctioned tenet
   a great deal that belonged to the doctrine of grace. This actually took
   place. Accordingly the controversy only came apparently to an end here.
   But the continued vitality of Semi-Pelagian ideas, under cover of
   Augustinian formulas, was further promoted by that external conception
   of grace as the sacrament of Baptism, which lay at the root of the
   decree. "Love," it is true, was also discussed; but we see easily that
   the idea of the sacrament was all-predominant. "Even Augustine's
   adherents," it has been truly remarked, "lost sight of the distinction
   between Augustinianism and Semi-Pelagianism in relation to all who were
   baptised." It was Augustine himself, who, because he had not
   comprehended the notion of faith, was to blame for the fact that, at
   the close of the dispute, a conception was evolved as his doctrine
   which, while explaining grace to be beginning and end, really held to
   the magical miracle of Baptism, and to "faithful working with the aid
   of Christ" (fideliter laborare auxiliante Christo).

   The new Pope, Boniface II., approved of these decrees in a letter to
   Cæsarius; [571] they have retained a great esteem in the Catholic
   Church, and were very thoroughly considered by the Council of Trent.
   [572] Henceforth, the doctrine of prevenient grace, on which the Pope
   also laid particular stress, is to be regarded as Western dogma; the
   Semi-Pelagians have to be acknowledged heretics. But the controversy
   could begin anew at any moment, as soon, namely, as any one appeared,
   who, for the sake of prevenient grace, also required the recognition of
   particular election to grace. If we consider which of Augustine's
   doctrines met with acceptance, and which were passed over, if further
   we recollect why the former were approved, we are compelled to say
   that, next to anxiety to secure to the Sacrament of Baptism its
   irreplaceable importance, it was the monastic view of the impurity of
   marriage that especially operated here. All are sinful, and grace must
   come before our own efforts, because all are born from the sinful lust
   of sexual intercourse. The Catholic system of doctrine has risen from a
   compromise between two equally monastic conceptions: the
   meritoriousness of works and the impurity of marriage. Both thoughts
   were Augustinian in themselves and in their working out; but the moving
   soul of Augustinianism was starved. It is a fact that has not yet been
   sufficiently appreciated that Catholic doctrine did not adhere to
   Semi-Pelagianism, because the former declared sexual desire to be
   sinful. [573]

   [521] See the Ep. Prosperi ad Aug. [225]. Here Augustine is called
   "ineffabiliter mirabilis, incomparabiliter honorandus, præstantissimus
   patronus, columna veritatis ubique gentium conspicua, specialis fidei
   patronus."

   [522] See Vincentius' Commonitorium.

   [523] Semi-Pelagianism also rests undoubtedly on Augustinian
   conceptions. Loof's designation of it as "popular Anti-Pelagian
   Catholicism" is perfectly just (see Theol. Lit. Ztg. 1895, Col. 568,
   against Krüger, l.c. Col. 368). "Semi-Pelagianism" is a malicious
   heretical term. The literary leaders of this doctrine were in no
   respect influenced, so far as I see, by Pelagius, nor did they learn
   anything from him; on the contrary, they take their stand--the later
   the more plainly (but not more Augustinian)--on doctrines of Augustine,
   and it is impossible to understand them apart from his teaching.
   "Semi-Pelagianism" is popular Catholicism made more definite and
   profound by Augustine's doctrines. The Semi-Pelagians are accordingly
   the Eusebians of the doctrine of grace. See also Sublet, Le
   Semi-Pélagianisme des Origines. Namur, 1897.

   [529] The Commonitorium is directed exclusively against Augustine. The
   fact that it has reached us only in a mutilated form is explained,
   indeed, by its opposition to him. Apart from it, Prosper has preserved
   for us Vincentius' objections to Augustine.

   [530] He speaks still more frankly and therefore "more like a Pelagian"
   in the Institutions.

   [531] Here Cassian has learned thoroughly Augustine's teaching, and we
   see that he not only accommodated himself to it, but had been convinced
   by it.

   [532] Some maintained, namely, that the fate of these children was
   decided by how they would have acted if they had lived; for that was
   known to God.

   [533] Statements by Cassian. (Coll. XIII. 3): "non solum actuum, verum
   etiam cogitationum bonarum ex deo esse principium, qui nobis et initia
   sanctæ voluntatis inspirat et virtutem atque opportunitatem eorum quæ
   recte cupimus tribuit peragendi . . . deus incipit quæ bona sunt et
   exsequitur et consummat in nobis, nostrum vero est, tit cotidie
   adtrahentem nos gratiam dei humiliter subsequamur." 5: "gentiles veræ
   castitatis (and that is the virtue kat' exochen) virtutem non
   agnoverunt." 6: "semper auxilio dei homines indigere nec aliquid
   humanam fragilitatem quod ad salutem pertinet per se solam i.e., sine
   adiutorio dei posse perficere." 7: "propositum dei, quo non ob hoc
   hominem fecerat, tit periret, sed ut in perpetuum viveret, manet
   immobile, cuius benignitas cum bonæ voluntatis in nobis quantulamcunque
   scintillam emicuisse perspexerit vel quam ipse tamquam de dura silice
   nostri cordis excuderit, confovet eam et exsuscitat et confortat . . .
   qui enim ut pereat unus ex pusillis non habet voluntatem, quomodo sine
   ingenti sacrilegio putandus est non universaliter omnes, sed quosdam
   salvos fieri velle pro omnibus? ergo quicumque pereunt, contra illius
   pereunt voluntatem . . . deus mortem non fecit." 8: "tanta est erga
   creaturam suam pietas creatoris, ut non solum comitetur eam, sed etiam
   præcedit iugiter providentia, qui cum in nobis ortum quendam bonæ
   voluntatis inspexerit, inluminat eam confestim atque confortat et
   incitat ad salutem, incrementum tribuens ei quam vel ipse plantavit vel
   nostro conatu viderit emersisse." 9: "non facile humana ratione
   discernitur quemadmodum dominus petentibus tribuat, a quærentibus
   inveniatur et rursus inveniatur a non quærentibus se et palam adpareat
   inter illos, qui eum non interrogabant." 10: "libertatem scriptura
   divina nostri confirmat arbitrii sed et infirntitatem." 11: "ita sunt
   hæc quodammodo indiscrete permixta atque confusa, ut quid ex quo
   pendeat inter multos magna quæstione volvatur, i.e., utrum quia initium
   bonæ voluntatis præbuerimus misereatur nostri deus, an quia deus
   misereatur consequamur bonæ voluntatis initium (in the former case
   Zacchæus, in the latter Paul and Matthew are named as examples)." 12:
   "non enim talum deus hominem fecisse credendus est qui nec velit umquam
   nec possit bonum . . . cavendum nobis est, ne ita ad dominium omnia
   sanctorum merita referamus, ut nihil nisi id quod malum atque perversum
   est humanæ adscribamus naturæ . . . dubitari non potest, inesse quidem
   omni animæ naturaliter virtutum semina beneficio creatoris inserta, sed
   nisi hæc opitulatione dei fuerint excitata, ad incrementum perfectionis
   non potuerunt pervenire."

   [534] Semi-Pelagianism is no "half truth." It is wholly correct as a
   theory, if any theory is to be set up, but it is wholly false if taken
   to express our self-judgment in the presence of God.

   [535] Pro Augustino responsiones ad capitula objectionum Gallorum
   calumniantium (against the Gallican monks); Responsiones pro Augustino
   ad excerpta quæ de Genuensi civitate sunt missa (against Semi-Pelagian
   priests who desired aufklärung); Responsiones pro Augustino ad capitula
   objectionum Vincentiarium (here we have the most acute attacks by
   opponents). The "Galli" adhered to Cassian, though he hardly mentions
   original sin, while they taught it, and he does not speak so definitely
   as they about predestination.

   [536] Sentent. sup. VIII. on the respons. ad capp. Gallorum.

   [537] Even Augustine, in addition to expressing himself in a way that
   suggests the two-fold doctrine of predestination, said (De dono persev.
   14): "Hæc est prædestinatio sanctorum nihil aliud: præscientia scil.
   præparatio beneficiorum dei quibus certissime liberantur, quicunque
   liberantur." Prosper takes his stand on this language (see resp. ad
   excerpt. Genuens. VIII.): "We confess with pious faith that God has
   foreknown absolutely to whom he should grant faith, or what men he
   should give to his Son, that he might lose none of them; we confess
   that, foreknowing this, he also foresaw the favours by which he
   vouchsafes to free us, and that predestination consists in the
   foreknowledge and preparation of the divine grace by which men are most
   certainly redeemed." The reprobate accordingly are not embraced by
   predestination, but they are damned, because God has foreseen their
   sins. In this, accordingly, prescience is alone at work, as also in the
   case of the regenerate, who fall away again. But prescience compels no
   one to sin.

   [538] Cælest. ep. 21. The appendix was added later, but it perhaps was
   by Prosper.

   [539] Gennadius relates (De script. eccl. 85) that Prosper dictated the
   famous letters of Leo I. against Eutyches. But he gives this as a mere
   rumour.

   [540] Included among the works of Prosper and Leo I.

   [541] A minute analysis of the work is given by Wiggers, II. p. 218 ff.
   and Thomasius. I. pp. 563-570. It is to be admitted that the work marks
   an advance by its desire to admit the universality of God's purpose of
   salvation. But the doctrine of the universitas specialis is only a play
   on words, if universitas does not here mean more than with Augustine
   and Prosper, namely, that men of all nations and periods will be saved.

   [542] See Wiggers, II., pp. 329-350.

   [543] "Quos deus semel prædestinavit ad vitam, etiamsi negligant,
   etiamsi peccent, etiamsi nolint, ad vitam perducentur inviti, quos
   autem prædestinavit ad mortem, etiamsi currant, etiamsi festinent, sine
   causa laborant."

   [544] Of any such sect absolutely nothing is known. There is no
   original authority to show that there actually existed "libertines of
   grace," i.e., Augustinians who, under cover of the doctrine of
   predestination, gave themselves up to unbridled sin. The Semi-Pelagians
   would not have suffered such "Augustinians" to escape them in their
   polemics. There may have arisen isolated ultra-Augustinians like
   Lucidus, but they were not libertines.

   [545] North Africa was removed from theological disputes by the
   dreadful invasion of the Vandals. The majority there were certainly
   Augustinians, yet doubts and opposition were not wanting; see Aug. Ep.
   217 ad Vitalem.

   [546] See Tillemont, Vol. XVI., and Wiggers, II. 224-329; Koch, Der h.
   Faustus von Riez, 1895 (further, Loofs, Theol. Lit.-Ztg. 1895, Col. 567
   ff.).

   [547] See Mansi VII., where we have also (p. 1010) Lucidus' recantation
   in a Libellus ad episcopos. Even before the Synod Faustus had an
   interview with his friend, and he wrote a doctrinal letter to him (VII.
   1007 sq.) which, however, was equally unsuccessful.

   [548] Further, the Professio fidei (to Leontius) contra eos, qui dum
   per solam dei voluntatem alios dicunt ad vitam attrahi, alios in mortem
   deprimi, hinc fatum cum gentilibus asserunt, inde liberum arbitrium cum
   Manichæis negant.

   [549] "Obedientia" plays the chief part with Faustus next to castitas.
   In this the mediæval monk announces himself.

   [550] Faustus took good care not to contend against Augustine; he only
   opposed Augustinianism. This is true of the Catholic Church at the
   present day.

   [551] Yet he expressed himself very strongly as to original sin, and
   even taught Traducianism. As with Augustine, pro-creation is the means
   of transmitting original sin, which rises "per incentivum maledictæ
   generationis ardorem et per inlecebrorum utriusque parentis amplexum."
   Since Christ was alone free from this heritable infection, because he
   was not born of sexual intercourse, we must acknowledge the pleasure of
   intercourse and vice of sensuality to be the origin of the malum
   originale. We readily see that everything in Augustinianism met with
   applause that depreciated marriage. And these monks crossed themselves
   at the thought of Manichæism!

   [552] Faustus even supposes that fides remained as the knowledge of God
   after the Fall.

   [553] See lib. II. 4. On the other hand, Abel, Enoch, etc., were saved
   by the first grace, the law of nature, II. 6, 7. Since Enoch preceded
   the rest, in that so early age, by the merit of faith (fidei merito),
   he showed that faith had been transmitted to him with the law of
   nature; see also II. 8 ("et ex gentibus fuisse salvatos," 7).

   [554] Wiggers calls attention (p. 328) to Faustus' principle, important
   for the sake of later considerations in the Church: "Christus plus
   dedit quam totus mundus valebat" (De grat. et lib. arb. 16).

   [555] The most distinguished writers of the age held similar views,
   e.g., Arnobius the younger, Gennadius of Marseilles, Ennodius of
   Ticinum. Augustine's own authority was already wavering; for Gennadius
   permitted himself to write of him (De script. eccl. 39): "unde ex multa
   eloquentia accidit, quod dixit per Salomonem spiritus sanctus: ex
   multiloquio non effugies peccatum" and "error tamen illius sermone
   multo, ut dixi, contractus, lucta hostium exaggeratus necdum hæresis
   quæstionem absolvit." Many MSS. have suppressed these passages! We find
   it said of Prosper (c. 85) that in his work against Cassian he "quæ
   ecclesia dei salutaria probat, infamat nociva." Cassian and Faustus are
   highly praised.--As sources for Semi-Pelagianism there fall further to
   be considered the homilies, only in part by Faustus, which are printed
   in the Max. Bibl. Lugd. T. VI., pp. 619-686; see on them Caspari,
   Briefe, Abhandlungen u. Predigten (1890) p. 418 ff.

   [556] See Vol. IV., p. 231.

   [557] These "Scythians" were well versed in Western thought, their
   leader, Maxentius, who wrote in Latin, belonged himself to the West. In
   the Confession of faith they treat of grace, "non qua creamur, sed qua
   recreamur et renovamur." Pelagius, Cælestius, and Theodore of
   Mopsuestia are grouped together.

   [558] See Wiggers II., pp. 369-4 9. According to Fulgentius, even
   Mary's conception was stained, and therefore not free from original
   sin, see c. 6.

   [559] All these transactions in Mansi VIII.

   [560] On the derivation of original sin, see I. 4: "proinde de
   immunditia nuptiarum mundus homo non nascitur, quia interveniente
   libidine seminatur."

   [561] See Arnold's interesting monograph, Cæsarius von Arelate and die
   gallische Kirche s. Zeit, 1894. An edition of the Opp. Cæsarii is
   forthcoming.

   [562] Avitus of Vienne is usually named along with him; but after
   Arnold's authoritative account of the former (p. 202 ff.), he must be
   disregarded. On the other hand, Mamertus Claudianus is to be named as
   an opponent of Faustus (Arnold, p. 325); he is an Augustinian and
   Neoplatonist, and thus an enemy of Semi-Pelagianism as a metaphysician.

   [563] Cæsarius' work, however, De gratia et libero arbitrio, and its
   approval by Felix IV. belong to the realm of fiction (Arnold, p. 499).
   On the other hand, we have to notice some indirect manifestations on
   the part of Rome about A.D. 500 in favour of Augustinianism and against
   Faustus. Yet Rome never took the trouble really to comprehend
   Augustinianism.

   [564] We only know of the Synod of Valencia, at which Cæsarius was not
   present, owing to illness, but where he was represented by a friendly
   Bishop, from the Vita Cæsarii by his disciple Cyprian (Mansi VIII., p.
   723). Hefele has shown (Conciliengesch., II.2 p. 738 ff.), that it is
   to be dated before the Synod of Orange. It seems necessary to infer
   from the short account that the Bishops met to oppose Cæsarius, and
   published a decree condemning, or at least disapproving his teaching
   (see also Arnold, p. 346 ff.). At Orange Cæsarius justified himself, or
   triumphantly defended his doctrine from "Apostolic tradition," and Pope
   Boniface agreed with him, and not with his Valencian opponents.

   [565] See Arnold p. 350 ff.

   [566] We cannot now decide whether the 25 Canons are absolutely
   identical with those transmitted heads, or whether the Synod (perhaps
   even the Pope?) proposed trifling modifications; see Chap. XIX. of the
   Treves Codex in Mansi VIII., p. 722. However, it is very improbable
   that the Bishops made important changes in these heads (yet see Arnold,
   p. 352) since according to them they expounded their own view in the
   Epilogue.

   [567] See Hahn, § 103; Hefele, p. 726 f.

   [568] This Canon caused the greatest distress to the Catholic Church in
   the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries (see
   Hefele, p. 733 f.).

   [569] Yet Augustine would not have written the sentence: "hoc etiam
   credimus, quod accepta per baptismum gratia omnes baptizati Christo
   auxiliante et co-operante, quæ ad salutem animæ pertinent, possint et
   debeant, si fideliter laborare voluerint, adimplere." Besides, the
   words "que ad salutem pertinent adimplere" and "fideliter laborare" are
   ambiguous.

   [570] The word only occurs in the epilogue, and there merely to reject
   prædestinatio ad malum: "aliquos vero ad malum divina potestate
   prædestinatos esse non solum non credimus, sed etiam, si sunt qui
   tantum malum credere velint, cum omni detestatione illis anathema
   dicimus." The decree is also silent as to gratia irresistibilis, and
   the particularism of God's will to bestow grace.

   [571] Mansi VIII., p. 735 sq. The resolutions were also subscribed by
   laymen, a thing almost unheard of in the dogmatic history of the
   ancient Church, but not so in Gaul in the sixth century; see Hatch,
   "The Growth of Church Institutions" chap. VIII.

   [572] The Roman Bishops evidently felt their attitude in the
   Semi-Pelagian controversy prejudiced by the decisions of their
   predecessors against Pelagius. We look in vain for an independent word
   coming from internal conviction (Gelasius is perhaps an exception), and
   yet it is quite essentially "thanks" to them that the Semi-Pelagian
   dispute ended with the recognition of the Augustinian doctrine of
   prevenient grace and with silence as to predestination.

   [573] Seeberg (Dogmengesch. I., p. 326), has disputed this, because the
   representatives of Semi-Pelagianism made the strongest assertions on
   this point (see especially Faustus), and because the opposition between
   them and the Augustinians actually depended on quite different issues.
   Both objections are quite correct, but they do not meet the above
   statement; the Semi-Pelagian doctrine of grace could not but react upon
   and modify Augustine's doctrine of original sin, and therefore also the
   view of the evil of sin as necessarily propagated by sexual
   intercourse, involving damnation, and destructive of all goodness. As
   regards this it is quite indifferent how individual Semi-Pelagian monks
   looked at sexual desire and marriage, as also whether this point came
   at once to light in the controversy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2. Gregory the Great.

   The doctrine of grace taught by Pope Gregory the Great (590 to 604)
   shows how little Augustinianism was understood in Rome, and how
   confused theological thought had become in the course of the sixth
   century. A more motley farrago of Augustinian formulas and crude
   work-religion (ergismus) could hardly be conceived. Gregory has nowhere
   uttered an original thought; he has rather at all points preserved,
   while emasculating, the traditional system of doctrine, reduced the
   spiritual to the level of a coarsely material intelligence, changed
   dogmatic, so far as it suited, into technical directions for the
   clergy, and associated it with popular religion of the second rank. All
   his institutions were wise and well considered, and yet they sprang
   from an almost naif monastic soul, which laboured with faithful anxiety
   at the education of uncivilised peoples, and the training of his
   clergy, ever adopting what was calculated by turns to disquiet and
   soothe, and thus to rule the lay world with the mechanism of religion.
   [574] Because Gregory, living in an age when the old was passing away
   and the new presented itself in a form still rude and disjointed,
   looked only to what was necessary and attainable, he sanctioned as
   religion an external legality, as suited to train young nations, as it
   was adapted to the Epigones of ancient civilisation, who had lost
   fineness of feeling and thought, were sunk in superstition and magic,
   and did homage to the stupid ideals of asceticism. [575] It is the
   accent that changes the melody, and the tone makes the music. Gregory
   created the vulgar type of mediæval Catholicism by the way he accented
   the various traditional doctrines and Church usages, [576] and the tone
   to which he tuned Christian souls is the key we hear echoed by
   Catholicism down to the present day. [577] The voice is the voice of
   Gregory, and also of Jerome, but the hands are Augustine's. Only in one
   respect he was not Augustine's disciple. Akin to Cyprian and Leo I. and
   well versed in jurisprudence, he laid stress on the legal element in
   addition to the ritual and sacramental. Through him the amalgamation of
   doctrine and Church government made a further advance in the West.
   [578]

   A few lines are sufficient to depict the emasculated Augustinianism
   represented by Gregory. Reason, science, and philosophy, are more
   strongly depreciated by him than by Augustine (Evang. II. hom. 26);
   [579] miracle is the distinguishing mark of the religious. Reason can,
   indeed, establish the existence of God, but it is only "by faith that
   the way is opened to the vision of God" (per aditum fidei aperitur
   aditus visionis dei; Ezech. II. hom. 5, following Augustine). The
   doctrine of angels and the devil comes to the front, because it suited
   popular and monastic piety. We can call Gregory the "Doctor angelorum
   et diaboli." As regards the angels, he took particular delight (see
   Evang. II. hom. 34) in working out their ranks (under the influence of
   Greek mysticism), in glorifying Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael--the hero
   of miracle, the great messenger and warrior against the spirits of the
   air, and the medicine-man--in the exact division of angelic tasks and
   the idea of guardian spirits; he held that angels watched over men, as
   the latter did over cattle. He who thought so little of Græco-Roman
   culture sanctioned its most inferior parts in his doctrine of the
   angels. His monkish fancy dealt still more actively in conceptions
   about the devil and demons, and he gave new life to ideas about
   Antichrist, who stood already at the door, because the world was near
   its end. As the Logos had assumed human nature, so the devil would be
   incarnate at the end of the world (Moral. 31, 24; 13, 10). Before
   Christ appeared, the devil possessed all men of right, and he still
   possesses unbelievers. He raged through the latter; but as regarded
   believers he was a powerless and cheated devil. The doctrines of
   redemption, justification, grace, and sin show an Augustinianism
   modified in the interests of miracle, sacred rites and monachism. The
   God-man--whose mother remained a virgin at and after the birth--was
   sinless, because he did not come into the world through fleshly lust.
   He is our redeemer (redemptor) and mediator--these titles being
   preferred--and he especially propitiated the devil by purchasing men
   from him with his death, [580] and he abolished the disunion between
   angels and men. It is also remarked incidentally that Christ bore our
   punishments and propitiated God's wrath. But, besides redemption from
   the devil, the chief thing is deliverance from sin itself. It was
   effected by Christ putting an end to the punishment of original sin,
   and also destroying sin itself, by giving us an example. [581] This
   amounts to saying that Christ's work was incomplete, i.e., that it must
   be supplemented by our penances, for it transformed the eternal
   punishment of original sin into temporary penalties, which must be
   atoned for, and it acts mainly by way of example. [582] In fact, in
   Gregory's teaching, Christ's death and penance appear side by side, as
   two factors of equal value. [583]

   We must remember this, or we may assign too high a value to another
   line of thought. Gregory regards Christ's death as an offering
   (oblatio) for our purification: Christ presents it constantly for us,
   ever showing God his (crucified) body. [584] But this apparently high
   pitched view after all means very little. It has risen from the
   observance of the Lord's Supper. What was constantly done by the priest
   has been transferred to Christ himself. But both oblations, related as
   they are to our "purification," possess their sole value in the
   mitigation of sin's penalties. Still another consideration was at work
   in this case, one that, though relying on Biblical statements, sprang
   in reality from wholly different sources. It is the conception of
   Christ's continual intercession. But this intercession must be combined
   with the whole apparatus of intercessions (of angels, saints, alms and
   masses for the dead, which were conceived as personified forces), to
   see that we are here dealing with a heathen conception, which, though
   it had indeed long been established in the practice of the Church, was
   only now elevated into a theory--that of "aids in need." Gregory's
   candid avowal that the death of Christ was not absolutely necessary,
   showed how indefinite was his view of the part it played in this
   mediation. As God created us from nothing, he could also have delivered
   us from misery without Christ's death. But he willed to show us the
   greatness of his compassion by taking upon himself that from which he
   desired to deliver us; he willed to give us an example, that we should
   not dread the misfortune and miseries of the world, but should avoid
   its happiness; and he sought to teach us to remember death. [585] Nor
   has Gregory yet sketched a theory of Christ's merit--after the analogy
   of the merits which we can gain. That was reserved for the Middle Ages;
   but he has examined Christ's work from the point of view of masses for
   the dead and the intercession of saints.

   In the doctrines of the primitive state, original sin, sin, faith and
   grace, the Augustinian formulas are repeated--after the Canons of
   Orange, without irresistible grace and particular election. [586] But a
   very real significance was attributed to free-will, which Augustine had
   abstractly admitted. Here we have the fully developed doctrines of free
   and prevenient grace, of the primitive state and original sin; (the
   carnal lust of parents is the cause of our life, therefore the latter
   is sinful; the "disobedience" or "disorderliness" of the genital organs
   is the proof of original sin; intercourse in marriage is never
   innocent). And side by side with all this, we have a calm statement of
   the doctrine of the will, which is merely weakened, and of free choice
   (liberum arbitrium) which must follow grace, if the latter is to become
   operative, [587] --and yet grace is first to determine the will to
   will. From the first two powers co-operate in all good, since free-will
   must accept what grace offers. It can therefore be said "that we redeem
   ourselves because we assent to the Lord redeeming us." [588]
   Predestination is simply reduced in the case of sinners and elect to
   prescience, while at the same time it is maintained in other passages
   that it rests on God's free power and grace. The latter assumption was
   necessary, because Gregory also adhered to "a fixed and definite number
   of the elect"--to supply the place of angels; but ultimately all belong
   to that number whose perseverance in faith and good works God knew
   beforehand.

   After all, everything spiritual is reduced to the rites of the Church.
   As in the East, these come to the front; but they are regarded in a
   different way. In the East more scope is given to religious sentiment,
   which exalts itself and luxuriates in the whole of the Cultus as a
   divino-human drama; in the West, as befitted the Roman character,
   everything is more prosaic and calculating. Man accomplishes and
   receives; submissive obedience is the chief virtue; merits are
   rewarded, but on the humble a merit not his own is also bestowed: that
   is grace. Baptism, the Lord's Supper, and penance are the central
   points in the legal process of grace. We are baptised: thereby
   inherited guilt is expiated, and all sins committed before baptism are
   blotted out; but original sin is not obliterated, and the guilt of
   later sins remains. [589] It must be cancelled or atoned for. For this
   there are numerous means, which are as necessary as they are uncertain.
   A man must make himself righteous; for righteousness is the supreme
   virtue (radix virtutum). He is instructed to pray, give alms, and mourn
   over life. But he is further told: "Those who trust in no work of their
   own run to the protection of the holy martyrs, and throng to their
   sacred bodies with tears, entreat that they may merit pardon at the
   intercession of the saints." [590] This practice of resorting to saints
   and relics had existed for a long time, but Gregory has the merit of
   systematising it, at the same time providing it with abundant material
   by means of his "Dialogues," as well as his other writings. [591] A
   cloud of "mediators" came between God and the soul: angels, saints, and
   Christ; and men began already to compute cunningly what each could do
   for them, what each was good for. Uncertainty about God, perverse,
   monkish humility, and the dread entertained by the poor unreconciled
   heart of sin's penalties, threw Christians into the arms of pagan
   superstition, and introduced the "mediators" into dogmatics. But in
   terrifying with its principle: "sin is in no case absolved without
   punishment" (nullatenus peccatum sine vindicta laxatur), [592] the
   Church not only referred men to intercessors, alms, and the other forms
   of satisfaction, to "masses for the dead," which obtained an
   ever-increasing importance, but it even modified hell, placing
   purgatory in front of heaven; it thereby confused conscience and
   lessened the gravity of sin, turning men's interest to sin's
   punishment. Gregory sanctioned and developed broadly the doctrine of
   purgatory, [593] already suggested by Augustine. [594] The power of the
   Church, of prayers, and intercessors extended, however, to this
   purgatory of his. [595]

   The whole life even of the baptised being still stained at least by
   small sins, their constant attitude must be one of penitence, i.e.,
   they must practise penance, which culminates in satisfactions and
   invocations to "Aids in need." Gregory systematised the doctrine of
   penance in the exact form in which it passed over into the Middle Ages.
   [596] Penance included four points, perception of sin and dread of
   God's judgments, regret (contritio), confession of sin, and
   satisfaction (satisfactio). The two first could also be conceived as
   one (conversio mentis). [597] The chief emphasis was still held to fall
   on "conversion," even penance was not yet attached to the institution
   of the Church and the priest; but "satisfaction" was necessarily felt
   to be the main thing. The last word was not indeed yet said; but
   already the order of penance was taking the place due to faith; nay, it
   was called the "baptism of tears." [598] And the Lord's Supper was also
   ultimately drawn into the mechanism of penance. In this case, again,
   Gregory had only to accentuate what had long been in use. The main
   point in the Lord's Supper was that it was a sacrifice, which benefited
   living and dead as a means of mitigation (laxatio). As a sacrifice it
   was a repetition of Christ's--hence Gregory's development of the
   ceremonial ritual--and it is self-evident that this was conceived
   altogether realistically. In this rite (eucharistia, missa,
   sacrificium, oblatio, hostia, sacramentum passionis, communio), the
   passion of Christ; [599] who "is entire in the single portions" (in
   singulis portionibus totus est), was repeated for our atonement. Yet
   even here the last word was not yet uttered, transubstantiation was not
   yet evolved. Indeed, we find, accompanying the above, a view of the
   Lord's Supper, which lays stress on our presenting ourselves to God as
   the victim (the host), in yielding ourselves to him, practising love,
   rendering daily the sacrifice of tears, despising the world, and--daily
   offering the host of the body and blood of Christ. [600]

   What has been left here of Augustinianism? All the popular Catholic
   elements which Augustine thrust aside and in part remodelled have
   returned with doubled strength! The moral and legal view has triumphed
   over the religious. What we see aimed at in Cyprian's work, De opere et
   eleemosynis, now dominates the whole religious conception, and the
   uncertainty left by Augustine as to the notion of God, because his
   ideas regarding God in Christ were only vague, has here become a source
   of injury traversing the whole system of religion. For what does
   Gregory know of God? That, being omnipotent, he has an inscrutable
   will; [601] being the requiter, he leaves no sin unpunished; and that
   because he is beneficent, he has created an immense multitude of
   institutions for conveying grace, whose use enables the free will to
   escape sin's penalties, and to exhibit merits to God the rewarder. That
   is Gregory's notion of God, and it is the specific conception held by
   the Roman Catholic Church: Christ as a person is forgotten. He is a
   great name in dogmatics, i.e., at the relative place; but the
   fundamental questions of salvation are not answered by reference to
   him, and in life the baptised has to depend on "means" which exist
   partly alongside, partly independently of him, or merely bear his
   badge. From this standpoint is explained the whole structure of
   Gregory's theory of religion, which once more sets up fear [602] and
   hope instead of faith and love, and for the grace of God in Christ
   substitutes not an improved, but merely a more complicated doctrine of
   merit. And yet Augustine could not have complained of this displacement
   of his ideas; for he had left standing, nay, had himself admitted into
   his system, all the main lines of this theory of religion. Even the
   manifest and grave externalisation of sin, the direction that we must
   be ever bathed in tears, while at the same time zealous and watchful to
   escape the penalties of sin, the perversion of the notion of God and
   sin, as if God's sole concern was to be satisfied, since he was the
   requiter--all these thoughts have their points of contact in the range
   of Augustine's conceptions. [603] The darkest spot in mediæval piety,
   the fact that it commanded constant contrition, while at the same time
   it incited the penitent to make calculations which deadened the moral
   nerve and changed regret for sin into dread of punishment--this source
   of evil, which makes religious morality worse than non-religious, was
   from this time perpetuated in the Catholic Church of the West. [604]

   But in the case of Gregory himself this system of religion is traversed
   by many other ideas gained from the Gospel and Augustine. He could
   speak eloquently of the impression made by the person of Christ, and
   describe the inner change produced by the Divine Word [605] in such a
   way as to make us feel that he is not reproducing a lesson he has
   learnt from others, but is speaking from his own experience. "Through
   the sacred oracles we are quickened by the gift of the Spirit, that we
   may reject works that bring death; the Spirit enters, when God touches
   the mind of the reader in different ways and orders." [606] The Spirit
   of God works on the inner nature through the Word. Thus, many of
   Augustine's best thoughts are reproduced in Gregory's writings. [607]
   Again, in his Dogmatics he was not a sacerdotalist. If, as is
   undeniable, he gave an impetus to the further identification of the
   empirical Church with the Church, if all his teaching as to the imputed
   merit of saints, oblations, masses, penance, purgatory, etc., could not
   but benefit the sacerdotal Church, and favour the complete subjection
   of poor souls to its power, if, finally, his ecclesiastical policy was
   adapted to raise the Church, with the Pope at its head, to a supremacy
   that limited and gave its blessing and sanction to every other power,
   yet his dogmatic was by no means mere ecclesiasticism. We wonder,
   rather, that he has nowhere drawn the last, and apparently so obvious
   consequences, [608] in other words, that he did not rigidly concentrate
   the whole immense apparatus in the hand of the priest, and give the
   latter the guidance of every single soul. Already this had been
   frequently done in practice; but the thought still predominated that
   every baptised person was alone responsible for himself, and had to go
   his own way in the sight of God and within the Church, by aid of
   penance and forgiveness. It was reserved for the mediæval development
   first to set up dogmatically the demand that the penitent, i.e., every
   Christian from baptism to death, should depend wholly on the guidance
   of the priest. [609]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [574] After reading Gregory's abundant correspondence, we gain a high
   respect for the wisdom, charity, tolerance, and energy of the Pope.

   [575] Yet side by side with this external legality there are not
   wanting traits of Gospel liberty; see the letters to Augustine.

   [576] So Lau. Gregor d. Grosse, p. 326: "Without perceiving, perhaps,
   the significance of what he did, he prepared the way for the
   development of later Catholicism by imperceptibly altering the
   conception of the tradition received from a preceding age."

   [577] Gregory was most read of the Western Church Fathers, as the
   literature of the Middle Ages and our libraries show. Even in the
   seventh century he was extolled by tasteless and uncritical writers as
   wiser than Augustine, more eloquent than Cyprian, more pious than
   Anthony ("nihil illi simile demonstrat antiquitas" Ildefond. de script.
   I).

   [578] Lau gives a detailed account of Gregory's teaching; l.c. pp.
   329-556. We see here the extent of Gregory's dependence on Augustine.
   He especially lays as great stress on Holy Scripture being the rule of
   life and doctrine. The most profound of Augustine's thoughts are
   touched on, but they are all rendered superficial.

   [579] "Fides non habet meritum, cui humana ratio præbet experimentum"
   (§ 1). Tertullian, certainly, had already said that (Apolog. 21) once.

   [580] The deception theory is thus given by Gregory in its most
   revolting form. The devil is the fish snapping at Christ's flesh, and
   swallowing the hidden hook, his divinity; see Moral. 33, 7, 9.

   [581] Moral. I. 13: "Incarnatus dominus in semetipso omne quod nobis
   inspiravit ostendit, ut quod præcepto diceret, exemplo suaderet." II.
   24: "Venit inter homines mediator dei et hominum, homo Christus Jesus,
   ad præbendum exemplum vitæ hominibus simplex, ad non parcendum malignis
   spiritibus rectus ad debellandum superbiam timens deum, ad detergendam
   vero in electis suis immunditiam recedens a malo."

   [582] Lau. p. 434: "The chief stress is placed on instruction and
   example; reconciliation with God, certainty of which is absolutely
   necessary to man's peace of mind, is almost entirely passed over; and
   deliverance from punishment is inadequately conceived, as referring
   merely to original sin, or is regarded purely externally. . . . All
   that Gregory can do to give man peace is to direct him to penance and
   his good works." He speaks of even the holiest remaining in constant
   uncertainty as to their reconciliation. He can make nothing of the
   thesis that our sins are forgiven for Christ's sake. God rather
   punishes every sin not atoned for by penance, even if he pardons it;
   see Moral. IX. 34: "Bene dicit Hiob (IX. 28): Sciens quod non parceris
   delinquenti, quia delicta nostra sive per nos sive per semetipsum
   resecat, etiam cum relaxat. Ab electis enim suis iniquitatum maculas
   studet temporali afflictione tergere, quas in eis in perpetuum non vult
   videre," In his commentary on 1 Kings (1. IV. 4, 57), which was hardly
   transcribed indeed in its present form by Gregory himself, we even
   read: "Non omnia nostra Christus explevit, per crucem quidem suam omnes
   redemit, sed remansit, ut qui redimi et regnare cum eo nititur,
   crucifigatur. Hoc profecto residuum viderat, qui dicebat: si compatimur
   et conregnabimus. Quasi dicat: Quod explevit Christus, non valet nisi
   ei, qui id quod remansit adimplet."

   [583] Therefore we find over and over in the Moral. in reference to the
   expiation of sins: "sive per nos, sive per deum."

   [584] Moral. i. 24: "Sine intermissione pro nobis holocaustum redemptor
   immolat, qui sine cessatione patri suam pro nobis incarnationem
   demonstrat; ipsa quippe ejus incarnatio nostræ emundationis oblatio
   est; cumque se hominem ostendit, delicta hominis interveniens diluit.
   Et humanitatis suæ mysterio perenne sacrificium immolat, quia et hæc
   sunt æterna, quæ mundat."

   [585] Moral. 20, 36; 2, 37. Ezek. 1. II. hom. 1, 2. Here occur fine
   ideas: "Nos minus amasset, nisi et vulnera nostra susciperet" (M. 20,
   36).

   [586] See the proof of positive points of agreement between Gregory and
   the Canons of Oranges in Arnold, Cæsarius, p. 369 f. Yet Gregory never
   himself appealed to those resolutions.

   [587] How could a bishop, who felt himself to be the pastor of all
   Christendom, have then made pure Augustinianism the standard of all his
   counsels?

   [588] Moral. 24, 10; gee also 33, 21; "Bonum quod agimus et dei est et
   nostrum, dei per prævenientem gratiam, nostrum per obsequentem liberam
   voluntatem. . . . Si nostrum non est, unde nobis retribui præmia
   speramus? Quia ergo non immerito gratias agimus, scimus, quod ejus
   munere prævenimur; et rursum quia non immerito retributionem quærimus,
   scimus, quod obsequente libero arbitrio bona eligimus, quæ ageremus."
   See Ep. III. 29: Christ will comfort us richly at the judgment, when he
   observes that we have punished our faults by ourselves.

   [589] Moral. IX. 34: "Salutis unda a culpa primi parentis absolvimur,
   sed tamen reatum ejusdem culpæ diluentes absoluti quoque adhuc
   carnaliter obimus." The casuistical treatment of sins is by no means
   puritanical in Gregory. He displays in this matter a lofty wisdom
   united with charity, and gives directions which were certainly the best
   for the circumstances of the time. He says once (Ep. XI. 64): "It is
   characteristic of pious souls to imagine that they are guilty of faults
   when there is absolutely none."

   [590] Moral. XVI. 51: "Hi qui de nullo suo opere confidunt, ad
   sanctorum martyrum protectionem currunt atque ad sacra eorum corpora
   fletibus insistunt, promereri se veniam iis intercedentibus
   deprecantur."

   [591] Similar things to those recorded by Gregory were often narrated
   at an earlier date; but no Western writer before him had developed
   these superstitions to such an extent--and he was the most influential
   bishop. Miracles wrought by relics were to him every-day events; the
   miraculous power of some was so great that everyone who touched them
   died. Everything that came in contact with them was magnetised. What
   powerful intercessors and advocates must then the saints be, when even
   their bodies did such deeds! Gregory therefore sought to preserve the
   attachment of influential people by sending relics and--slaves. On
   pictures, see Ep. IX. 52; IX. 105; XI. 13.

   [592] Moral, IX. 34, or: "delinquenti dominus nequaquam parcit, quia
   delictum sine ultione non deserit. Aut enim ipse homo in se pænitens
   punit, aut hoc deus cum homine vindicans percutit."

   [593] See Dial. IV. (25) and 39. After God has changed eternal
   punishments into temporary, the justified must expiate these temporary
   penalties for sin in purgatory. This is inferred indirectly from Matth.
   XII. 31, directly from 1 Cor. III. 12 f. There are perfect men,
   however, who do not need purgatory.

   [594] See above, p. 232.

   [595] Dial. IV. 57: "Credo, quia hoc tam aperte cum viventibus ac
   nescientibus agitur, ut cunctis hæc agentibus ac nescientibus
   ostendatur, quia si insolubiles culpæ non fuerint, ad absolutionem
   prodesse etiam mortuis victima sacræ oblationis possit. Sed sciendum
   est, quia illis sacræ victimæ mortuis prosint, qui hic vivendo
   obtinuerunt, ut eos etiam post mortem bona adjuvent, quæ hic pro ipsis
   ab aliis fiunt."

   [596] On the older Western order of penance, see Preuschen,
   Tertullian's Schriften de pænit. and de pudicit. 1890; Rolff's Das
   Indulgenzedict des röm. Bischofs Kallist 1893 (Texte and Unters. Vol.
   Part 3); Götz, Die Busslehre Cyprian's 1895; Karl Muller, Die
   Bussinstitution in Karthago unter Cyprian (Zeitschr. f. K.-Gesch., Vol.
   16 [1895-96] p. 1 ff., p. 187 ff.).

   [597] 1 Reg. 1. VI. 2, 33: "tria in unoquoque consideranda sunt
   veraciter pænitente, videlicet conversio mentis, confessio oris et
   vindicta peccati." Moral 13, 39: "convertuntur fide, veniunt opere,
   convertuntur deserendo mala, veniunt bona faciendo." Voluntarily
   assumed pains constitute satisfactio.

   [598] Evang. 1. I. hom. 10: "Peccata nostra præterita in baptismatis
   perceptione laxata sunt, et tamen post baptisma multa commisimus, sed
   laxari iterum baptismatis aqua non possumus. Quia ergo et post baptisma
   inquinavimus vitam, baptizemus lacrimis conscientiam."

   [599] Evang. 1. II. hom. 37, 7: "Singulariter ad absolutionem nostram
   oblata cum lacrimis et benignitate mentis sacri altaris hostia
   suffragatur, quia is, qui in se resurgens a mortuis jam non moritur,
   adhuc per hanc in suo mysterio pro nobis iterum patitur. Nam quoties ei
   hostiam suæ passionis offerimus, toties nobis ad absolutionem nostram
   passionem illius reparamus."

   [600] See Dial. IV. 58, 59. Gregory already laid great stress on the
   frequency of masses. He also approved of their use to avert temporal
   sufferings. He tells with approval of a woman having delivered her
   husband from prison by their means, and he sees in them generally the
   remedy against all torments in this world and in purgatory. Only to
   eternal blessedness the mass does not apply.

   [601] That is the impression that was preserved of Augustine's doctrine
   of predestination.

   [602] "Deus terrores incutit"--often.

   [603] The term "tutius," and the via tutior already play a great part
   in Gregory's writings; see e.g., Dial. IV. 58: "Pensandum est, quod
   tutior sit via, ut bonum quod quisque post mortem suam sperat agi per
   alios, agit ipse dum vivit per se." Accordingly that is only tutius,
   and not a self-evident duty.

   [604] Gregory also expressly forbids anyone to be certain of his
   salvation; for this he could, indeed, appeal to Augustine. His letter
   to the Empress Gregoria's lady of the bed-chamber is most instructive
   (V. 25). This poor woman wished to have assurance of her salvation, and
   had written the Pope that she would ply him with letters until he
   should write that he knew by a special revelation that her sins were
   forgiven. What an evangelical impulse in A.D. 596! The Pope replied,
   first, that he was unworthy of a special revelation; secondly, that she
   should not be certain of forgiveness until, the last day of her life
   having come, she should no longer be in a position to deplore her sins.
   Till then she must continue to fear; for certainty is the parent of
   indolence; she must not strive to obtain it lest she go to sleep. "Let
   thy soul tremble for a little while just now, that it may afterwards
   enjoy unending delight."

   [605] Divinus sermo. The phrase "verbum fidei" is also very common.

   [606] Ezech. I., h. 7. "Per sacra eloquia dono spiritus vivificamur, ut
   mortifera a nobis opera repellamus; spiritus vadit, cum legentis animum
   diversis modis et ordinibus tangit deus."

   [607] Gregory's veracity, indeed, is not altogether above suspicion.
   His miraculous tales are often not ingenuous, but calculated; read
   e.g., Ep. IV. 30. His propaganda for the Church did not shrink from
   doubtful means. The Jews on papal properties were to be influenced to
   accept Christianity by the remission of taxes. Even if their own
   conversion was not sincere, their children would be good Catholics (Ep.
   V. 8). Yet Gregory has expressed himself very distinctly against
   forcible conversions (Ep. I. 47).

   [608] Besides, he by no means sought to introduce the usages of the
   Roman Church by tyrannical force, but rather directed Augustine, the
   missionary, to adopt what good he found in other national Churches; see
   Ep. XI. 64. On the other hand, the bewildering identification of Peter
   and the Pope made a further advance in the hands of Gregory. He means
   the Pope when he says: "s. ecclesia in apostolorum principis soliditate
   firmata est." And he declares (Ep. IX. 12): "de Constantinopolitana
   ecclesia quod dicunt, quis eam dubitet sedi apostolica; esse
   subjectam;" see also the fine passage Ep. IX. 59: "Si qua culpa in
   episcopis invenitur, nescic quis Petri successori subjectus non sit;
   cum vero culpa non exigit, omnes secundum rationem humilitatis æquales
   sunt."

   [609] Gregory's extensive correspondence shows how far even at this
   time strictly theological questions had come to be eclipsed by
   practical ones as to pastoral supervision and education by means of the
   cultus and church order. On Gregory's importance in connection with the
   cultus, see Duchesne's excellent work, Orig. du culte chrétien (1888),
   esp. p. 153 sq.

CHAPTER VI.

  HISTORY OF DOGMA IN THE PERIOD OF THE CARLOVINGIAN RENAISSANCE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Among the young uncivilised peoples, all ecclesiastical institutions
   occupied a still more prominent place than had been given them even by
   the development of the Church in the Roman Empire. The philosophical
   and theological capital of antiquity, already handed down in part in
   compendia, was propagated in new abridgements (Isidore of Seville,
   Bede, Rabanus, etc.). John Scotus the unique excepted, [610] no one was
   now able to probe that intellectual world to its ultimate ideas and
   perceptions, and make it part of their own spiritual experience. [611]
   To the historian of civilisation everything in the epoch is
   interesting; in the Carlovingian age, the foundations were laid for the
   developments of the Middle Ages; but to the historian of dogma, if we
   are to consider not the appropriation of familiar material, but the
   advance of evolution, that period does not offer much.

   The Carlovingian epoch was a great, and in many respects an
   unsuccessful, essay at a renaissance of antiquity. It was not the
   product of the slow natural evolution of the Germano-Roman peoples, but
   Charlemagne and his circle sought to gain by storm a higher culture for
   the Frankish Empire, by a frequently forced return to antiquity, or by
   the establishment in their midst of Byzantine culture. Antiquity was
   still a living thing in Constantinople. Springer has shown, in dealing
   with the history of art, that the Carlovingian school is to be regarded
   as the after-bloom of ancient, and not as the beginning of mediæval,
   art; and this applies also to theological and philosophical efforts.
   The Carlovingian period marks the epoch-making beginnings in the
   history of institutions; [612] in the history of spiritual 1ife it is
   an appendix to that of the ancient world. Therefore the history of
   dogma in the Middle Ages begins, strictly speaking, with the age of
   Clugny. [613] It is also useless to discuss, in connection with this
   branch of study, the so-called popular forms of German Christianity
   found in poetical and prose fragments. For, firstly, their popular
   character is very limited; secondly, popular Christianity has hardly
   exercised any influence at all on institutions, not to speak of dogma.
   He who wished to reach a higher theological culture, read Augustine and
   Gregory, Gregory and Augustine, and he felt himself to be merely a
   disciple in relation to these and the other Latin Fathers, having still
   to learn the lessons delivered to him. [614]

   At that time many of the clergy were undoubtedly keenly desirous of
   culture; to see this we have only to look at the manuscripts preserved
   from the eighth and ninth centuries. [615] Nor must we overlook the
   fact that a small number of scholars went further than those belonging
   to the period A.D. 450-650, that they advanced beyond Isidore and
   Gregory to Augustine himself, saw through the emasculation of religion
   and its perversion into a ceremonial service and belief in miracle, and
   returned to the spiritual teaching of Augustine. [616] But the lofty
   figure of the African Bishop set bounds to any further advance. The
   best looked up to him, but none saw past him, not even Alcuin and
   Agobard, though the latter has also studied Tertullian. [617] It is
   very attractive to study, in connection with Church history, the
   energetic efforts of the Carlovingian Augustinians, to observe their
   attempts, following but surpassing the great Emperor, to purify the
   traditional form of religion, and to narrow the range of a stupid awe
   of the mysteries and of a half-heathen superstition. But it would
   merely lead to confusion in the history of dogma if we were to try to
   examine these attempts. [618]

   The transactions and determining events important to the history of
   dogma in our epoch divide into the following groups. 1. Controversies
   as to Byzantine and Roman Christology contrasted with that of Augustine
   and the West, and between the Gregorian system of doctrine and
   Augustine's theory of predestination. [619] 2. Disputes shared in by
   Rome against the East regarding the filioque, and against Rome and the
   East about images. [620] 3. The development of the practice and theory
   of the Mass and of penance. [621]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [610] Johannes Scotus Erigena's system (chief work: De divisione
   nature, see Migne CXXII.; Christlieb 1860, Huber 1861, see Ritter and
   Baur), does not belong to the history of dogma in the West, for it is
   an entirely free, independent reproduction of the Neoplatonic
   (pantheistic) type of thought, as represented by the Areopagite and
   especially "the divine philosopher Maximus Confessor," whom Scotus had
   read. Augustine also undoubtedly influenced him; but he has not brought
   his speculation any nearer Christianity. The most learned and perhaps
   also the wisest man of his age, he maintained the complete identity of
   religio vera and philosophia vera, and thus restored to its central
   place the fundamental thought of ancient philosophy. But to him, only
   nominally conceding a place to authority beside reason, the philosophia
   vera was that monism of view in which the knowledge of nature and that
   of God coincide, thought and being in that case also coinciding.
   (Everything is nature, and finally indeed, "nature which does not
   create and is not created," and the notion of being existing in the
   human mind is the substance of being itself: "intellectus rerum
   veraciter ipsæ res sunt.") Acosmic idealism is carried by Scotus (as by
   Stephan bar Sudaili) to the point at which even deity disappears in the
   intellect of man. All agreements with Church doctrines rest with Scotus
   on accommodation; they do not spring, however, from perplexity, but
   from the clear insight that wrappings must exist. In reality, even the
   living movement of nature itself is only an appearance. Without
   influence, indeed regarded with suspicion in his own time, he did not
   afterwards become the instructor of the West, though Western mystics
   have learnt much from him. He was too much of a Greek. In love and
   power of systematic construction he was phenomenal, and speculative
   philosophers rightly revere him as a master.

   [611] It is, on the other hand, wonderful with what strength of memory
   and intellect men like Alcuin and Paulinus of Aquileia familiarised
   themselves with the separate lines of Augustine's thought. Alcuin also
   lived a life of Augustinian piety.

   [612] See Hatch: An introductory lecture on the study of ecclesiastical
   history, 1885.

   [613] On the history of dogma in the Carlovingian age, see Schwane,
   Dogmengesch. der mittleren Zeit. 1882; Bach, Dogmengesch. des
   Mittelalters I. Th. 1873, Thomasius-Seeberg, Dogmengesch. II. 1, 1888:
   Reuter, Gesch. der relig. Aufklärung im Mittelalter, 1875, I. pp. 1-64.
   The last book discusses the efforts to promote culture. Cf. also Göbl,

   by Rettberg and Hauck. On "popular theology" among Anglo-Saxons,
   Saxons, and Franks, see Bach, l.c. I., p. 81 ff.

   [614] John Scotus forms an exception, and so also does, in some sense,
   Fredegis of Tours, so far as the latter took an independent view of the
   ominous "nihil" presented by Augustinian metaphysics. Ahner has,
   however, shown in his Dissertation on Fredegis and his letter "De
   nihilo et tenebris" (1878) that this work has been over-estimated by
   earlier scholars.

   [615] Our gratitude is due to Schrörs for having given in his monograph
   on Hinkmar (1884), pp. 166-174, an account of the ancient works read or
   quoted by the great Bishop. What an amount of learning and reading is
   evident from this comparison, and yet Hinkmar was by no means the
   greatest scholar. It is also interesting to notice that Hinkmar held
   strictly to the edict of Gelasius.

   [616] A greater interest in Dialectics was also shown by many teachers
   of the Carlovingian period than by earlier theologians. Compare
   Alcuin's work, De fide trinitatis, which also displays a valiant effort
   to reach systematic unity in theological thought. Fredegis, Alcuin's
   discipulus dulcissimus, was also reproved by Agobard as a "philosopher"
   for his preference for dialectics, the syllogism, and vexed questions.
   ("Invenietis nobilitatem divini eloquii non secundum vestram
   assertionem more philosophorum in tumore et pompa esse verborum"
   Agobardi lib. c. object. Fredegisi abb.) Yet his teaching as to
   auctoritas and ratio was not different from Augustine's; but distrust
   was caused by the earnest attempt, on the basis of authority, to use
   reason in dealing with dogma. In the dispute between Agobard and
   Fredegis many controversial questions emerged which would have become
   important if the opponents had really developed them.

   [617] On Alcuin, see Werner's monograph (1881). Radbert had also read
   Tertullian.

   [618] The conditions which heralded the Carlovingian Renaissance
   consisted in the political position of the Frankish Empire, the
   flourishing of theological studies among the Anglo-Saxons (Bede), the
   ecclesiastical activity of Boniface on the Continent, and the partly
   new, partly revived, relations of the Empire to Rome and
   Constantinople. The fact that elements of culture from England, Rome,
   Lombardy, and finally also the East converged at Charlemagne's Court,
   and found so energetic a Mæcenas in the king, made possible the
   renaissance, which then continued to exist under Louis the Pious, and
   at the Court of Charles the Bald. We cannot over-estimate the
   contribution made by Constantinople. We need only recall the works of
   the Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus, and John of Damascus, which at that time
   had reached the Frankish Kingdom. Not only John Scotus, but e.g.,
   Hinkmar, read or quoted the Pseudo-Dionysius. Some knowledge of Greek
   was possessed by a few Anglo-Saxons from the days of Archbishop
   Theodore of Tarsus in Canterbury; but they were to a much greater
   extent teachers of Augustinianism; yet not in the Christological
   question (see under). It was in Augustine along with the Areopagite
   that the mediæval mysticism of the West--and also Scotus--found its
   source; for it is very one-sided to make the latter alone responsible
   for mysticism. The Franks' love of culture received its greatest
   strength from the acquisition of the Crown of Imperial Rome, A.D. 800.
   What had formerly been a voluntary aspiration now assumed the
   appearance of a duty and obligation; for the king-emperor of the Franks
   and Romans was the successor of Augustine and Constantine. But how
   rapidly all this blossom withered! Walafrid writes truly in the
   prologue to Einhard's Life of Kaiser Karl: "When King Karl assembled
   wise men, he filled with light, kindled by God, the mist-shrouded, and
   so to speak almost entirely dark, expanse of the kingdom entrusted to
   him by God, by the new radiance of all science such as till then had
   been in part wholly unknown to these barbarians. But now, since these
   studies once more relapse into their opposite, the light of wisdom,
   which finds few who love it, becomes ever rarer."

   [619] In these conflicts the controversy as to Augustine is
   represented. See also the dispute as to the Lord's Supper.

   [620] These controversies are of universal interest in Church history.

   [621] In this development the dogmatic interest of the Carlovingians
   was alone really acute, leading to new definitions, if not at once
   expressed in strictly dogmatic forms. To this subject also belongs the
   doctrine of the saints (Mary), relics, and indulgences.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I. (a.) The Adoptian Controversy. [622]

   After the Western Christological formula of the two natures had been
   forced on the East at the fourth Council, the latter had at the fifth
   Council given the formula a Cyrillian interpretation, which it
   confirmed by condemning the Three Chapters. Since the Roman Bishop had
   to accede to the new definition, which was regarded in the West as a
   revolt from that of Chalcedon, a schism took place in Upper Italy,
   which was only got over with difficulty, extending into the seventh
   century, and damaging the Pope's prestige in the West. The Monothelite
   controversies brought the schism to an end, [623] and the sixth Council
   restored the formula of Chalcedon in the new version .af the
   problem--the question as to the will in Christ. But men were far from
   drawing the consequences of the formula in the East, or in Rome itself.
   Mysticism, which taught the complete and inseparable union of the
   divine and human, and celebrated its triumph in all the ritual
   institutions of the Church, had long overgrown the intractable dogmatic
   formula and stifled its influence. But the case was different with many
   Western Bishops, so long as they had not yet been reached by Greek
   mysticism, and still were under the influence of the ancient Western
   tradition, especially Augustine. They held the Christological theory
   that the Holy Trinity had effected the Incarnation by the second Person
   of the Godhead, the Son, selecting a man (homo) in virtue of eternal
   election--without antecedent merits on the part of the man--by uniting
   with him to form a personal unity, and by thus adopting him to perfect
   sonship. [624] This scheme is distinguished toto coelo from the Greek
   one (received in Rome) of the fifth Council, even if--as happened--the
   whole of human nature was also understood by the homo. For, according
   to the prevailing Greek conception, the God-Logos; in the moment of the
   Incarnation, so assumed human nature and received it into the unity of
   his being (idiopoiein), that it participated completely in the dignity,
   and accordingly in the sonship, of the Son, the incarnate Logos thus
   being in every respect as much the one real Son of God as the
   pre-existent. To hold Jesus Christ as Son of Man to be merely the
   adopted Son of God destroyed, according to Greek ideas, the whole
   mystery of the Incarnation, and took the Church back to the abyss of
   Nestorianism. Conversely, it was possible for one who took his stand on
   Augustinian Christology to feel that the contention that the Son of Man
   was as essentially Son of God as the Logos, was a relapse into Docetism
   or even Pantheism--the fusion of divine and human. The great claim of
   Cyril's conception consisted in its maintenance of the perfect unity of
   the Redeemer's personality, [625] the justification of the other in its
   adherence to Christ's real humanity. This humanity was to the opposite
   party in truth only a theorem, whose avowal permitted them to deify in
   concreto everything human in Christ, [626] while the Adoptians were
   only able to postulate the unity of the Son of God and Son of Man.
   [627]

   It is the old antagonism of Monophysitism and Nestorianism, toned down,
   indeed, in phraseology, but not lessened in substance--how could it be
   lessened? It is not wonderful that it broke out once more after the
   sixth Council, and that in connection with the term "adoptio." It is
   only surprising that it arose at the outskirts of Christendom; and that
   the controversy occasioned by it in the Church was so rapidly and
   thoroughly quieted. If we reflect that Augustine had unhesitatingly
   taught that Christ, on his human side, was the adopted Son of God and
   the supreme example of prevenient free grace (gratia gratis data
   præveniens), that he was read everywhere, that many passages in the
   Western Fathers gave evidence of Adoptianism, [628] and that even
   Isidore of Seville had written without being questioned: "he is called
   sole-begotten from the excellence of his divinity, because he is
   without brothers, first-begotten on account of the assumption of a man,
   in which act he has deigned to have brothers by the adoption of grace,
   with regard to whom he should be the first-begotten," [629] we are
   seized with astonishment at the secret, energetic counter-action of the
   Christological mysticism of Cyril and the Areopagite. It captivated
   thoughtful and superstitious Christians in Rome, and thence in England,
   Upper Italy, and France. It succeeded in doing so, because it was
   allied both with the philosophical speculation of the time and the
   superstitious craving for mysteries. Plato and Aristotle, as they were
   understood, were its evangelists, and, again, every celebration of the
   Lord's Supper, yea, every relic, was a silent missionary for it. In
   this men experienced the identity of the heavenly and earthly;
   accordingly, that identity had to be recognised above all in Christ
   himself. Thus the Western and Augustinian Christology, with its last,
   and yet so significant, remnant of a historical view of Christ--his
   subjection to divine grace--was effaced, not by a conflict, but much
   more certainly by a silent revolution. [630]

   But Augustinian Christology was advocated in Arabian Spain about A.D.
   780 by Elipandus, Metropolitan of Toledo, and soon afterwards in
   Frankish Spain by Felix, Bishop of Urgel; it being also supported by
   the Mozarabian liturgy. [631] They strongly emphasised the view that
   Christ was adopted as man, and the redeemed were accordingly, in the
   fullest sense, brothers of the man Jesus. There has been a good deal of
   argument as to how the two bishops, who, for the rest, had the approval
   of the majority of their colleagues in Spain, were influenced thus to
   emphasise the adoptio. After what we have observed above we ought
   rather to ask why the other Western Bishops did not do the same. In any
   case, the hypothesis that this Adoptianism is to be explained from
   Ancient West Gothic Arianism [632] is still less tenable than its
   derivation from Arab influences. [633] Nor do we obtain much
   enlightenment from the reference to the controversy which Elipandus had
   previously waged with a heretic named Migetius, [634] since the
   doctrines ascribed to him do not seem to have been the reverse of
   Adoptianism, while the whole figure is obscure. [635] All that is clear
   is that at that date the Spanish Church possessed no connection with
   Rome, that it rejected the alliance sought by Hadrian I., and, while
   relatively uninfluenced by the Roman and Byzantine Church tradition,
   [636] was in a state of great confusion internally. [637] It is further
   evident that Elipandus gladly seized the opportunity to extend the
   sphere of his metropolitan power to Asturia under the sure protection
   of the unbelievers. A dogmatic Spanish formula was welcome to him as a
   means of doing this. It is probable, finally, that Latin translations
   of Nestorian writings (i.e., of Theodore of Mopsuestia) were read in
   Spain. This cannot, indeed, be proved; but there can be no doubt that
   Felix of Urgel gave a Nestorian (Theodorian) development to Augustine's
   Christology, and thus went beyond Augustine, and it is on the other
   hand certain that from the sixth century Latin translations of works by
   Nestorian (and Syrian) writers were current in the West. [638]

   Elipandus was a loyal adherent to the Augustinian and Chalcedonian
   Christology; this is attested by his epistles; see also the two books
   written against him by Beatus and Eterius of Asturia, as well as
   Alcuin's writings. He meant to maintain the unity of person throughout;
   but this unity did not, in his view, do away with the strict
   distinction of natures. The human nature remained human, being thence
   raised to the dignity of divinity, and for this reason he held the term
   "adoptio" to be peculiarly fitting: "the son adoptive in his humanity
   but not in his divinity" (filius adoptivus humanitate nequaquam
   divinitate). Everyone in the West (even Alcuin) still spoke at that
   time of the assumtio hominis, and not merely of the assumtio humanæ
   naturæ (assumption of a man not of human nature). It was a correct
   inference that assumtio hominis = adoptio hominis. If the word
   "adoptio" was not exactly common in the more ancient literature, [639]
   the matter designated by it was correctly expressed in Augustine's
   sense. [640] The sonship of Christ was therefore twofold; as God he was
   son by race and nature (genere et natura), as man by adoption and
   grace. Elipandus quoted texts in support of this, and inferred quite
   correctly that he who disputed the Redeemer's adoptio had to deny the
   reality of his human nature, and consequently to suppose that Christ
   derived his humanity, which would be unlike ours, from the substance of
   the Father. Elipandus therefore designates his opponents Docetics or
   Eutychians.

   If we find that even he was interested really in Christ's complete
   humanity for his work's sake, the same fact shows much more clearly in
   the important case of Felix (see the writings directed against him by
   Paulinus and Alcuin). He has also left the God-Logos resting in the
   background; but his theory of religion deals with the second Adam in a
   way that had not been heard of in the Church since the days of
   Theodore. Since the Son of Man was actually a man, the whole stages of
   his humiliation were not voluntarily undertaken, but were necessary. It
   was only the resolve of the Son of God to adopt a man that was freely
   made. After this resolve was realised the Son of Man had to be a
   servant, had to be subject to the Father in everything, had to fulfil
   his will and not his own. Like all men he was only good so far as, and
   because, he was subject to the Father's grace; he was not omniscient
   and omnipotent, but his wisdom and power were bounded by the limits
   imposed on humanity. He derived his life from the Father, and to him he
   also prayed for himself. [641] Felix's final interest consisted in the
   fact that only thus can we be certain of our adoption. He insisted very
   strongly on raising to the central place in the conception of
   redemption the thought that the adoption of believers is only certain
   if Christ adopted a man like other men, or humanity: we are only
   redeemed if Christ is our oldest brother. The assurance of the
   redemption of humanity rests, as with Augustine, on the sole-begotten
   (in the divine sphere) having united with himself the first-begotten
   (in the human) ["adoptivi cum adoptivo, servi cum servo, Christi cum
   Christo, deus inter deos" ]. Christ, who as man was sacrificed for
   sakes, was the head of humanity, not by his divinity, but by his
   humanity. For this very reason the members are only certain of their
   adoption if the head is adopted. [642] If we are not dealing in
   Christ's case with an adoption as in our own, the then Incarnation was
   enacted outside of our sphere, and is of no benefit to us. But Felix
   went a step farther. He did not, like Augustine, satisfy himself with
   stopping at the simple contention that the man (homo) Christ was
   adopted in virtue of the prevenient grace of predestination, and with
   combining, by a mere assertion, this contention with the thesis of
   personal unity. On the contrary he rigidly separated the natures, and
   sought to form a clear idea of the way in which the adoption was
   accomplished (see the Antiochenes.)

   As regards the first point, he applied the phrase "true and peculiar
   son" (verus et proprius filius) to the God-Logos alone, and did not
   shrink from the proposition "the son is believed one in two forms"
   (duobus modis unus creditur filius); he distinguished between "the one"
   and "the other" (alter and alter), "this one" and "that" (ille and
   ille), nay, he called the Son of Man "God by adoption" (nuncupativus
   deus: meaning that he became God). He speaks, like the Antiochenes, of
   a "dwelling" of God in man, of the man who is united (conjunctus;
   applicatus) with deity, or bears deity. He has, indeed, compared the
   union of the two natures in Christ with the relation of soul and body;
   but the figure is still more inapt from his standpoint than from
   Augustine's; for the community of attributes is to him not real, but
   nominal, and "we must by no means believe that the omnipotent divine
   Father, who is a spirit, begets the body from himself" (nullo modo
   credendum est, ut omnipotens deus pater, qui spiritus est, de semetipso
   carnem generet). The man Christ has two fathers, one natural (David),
   and the other by his adoption.

   With reference to the second point, Felix taught that the Son of Man
   underwent two births: he was born of the virgin--that was his natural
   birth, and of grace or adoption in baptism--his spiritual birth.
   Christ, accordingly, like all Christians, experienced a twofold birth.
   His spiritual birth, as indispensable for him as for the rest, was
   accomplished, as in every other case, in baptism; but in this instance
   also baptism was only the beginning. It was not completed till the
   Resurrection. [643] As the Son of Man, therefore, was subject to the
   different stages of divine grace arising from his election, he was also
   originally, though sinless, [644] the "old man" (vetus homo), and
   passed through the process of regeneration until he reached complete
   adoption--undergoing everything that and as we do. But we follow the
   Head, and it is only because he experienced this that he can be our
   redeemer and intercessor. For the rest, it is besides to be held that
   the Son of God also accepted human birth for himself, as in that case
   he is further to be conceived as sharing in all the acts of the Son of
   Man. [645]

   Elipandus had given currency to his teaching in letters. His first
   opponents were the Abbot Beatus and the youthful Bishop Eterius. Their
   opposition inflamed the anger of the ageing Metropolitan, jealous of
   his orthodoxy. All who refused to see in the two natures more than one
   filius proprius he called "servants of Antichrist" (A.D. 785). Those he
   attacked, however, did not keep silent, but exposed the heretical
   character of Adoptianism in an elaborate document; they also noted the
   fact that the controversy had already excited the Bishops of all Spain,
   and had extended into France. [646] Hadrian I. entered into the dispute
   at this time. He could not but welcome the chance of proving to the
   Spanish Metropolitan, whose independence rendered him obnoxious, that
   he had fallen into the heresy of Nestorius, and that the Spanish
   Bishops were therefore bound to adhere to the teaching of Rome and the
   Fathers. [647]

   Soon afterwards Felix of Urgel energetically championed the thesis laid
   down by Elipandus. Thereby the question at issue became important for
   the kingdom of the Franks. The Synod of Regensburg (792), whose
   transactions are unfortunately lost, was convened to deal with
   Adoptianism. Felix himself required to appear. He defended himself
   before Charlemagne, [648] but is said to have ultimately recanted,
   since all the Bishops declared his teaching to be erroneous. The
   recantation is, indeed, supported by several witnesses, but is not
   placed beyond doubt, for we hear that Felix was sent to Rome, and was
   kept in prison by the Pope until he yielded to swear to an orthodox
   confession. He now returned to Spain (to his bishopric?) but soon
   renounced his forced recantation, and withdrew to Toledo in Saracen
   territory, in order to escape the censorship of the Franks. Alcuin's
   attempt to recover for the Church its highly prized bishop by means of
   a very friendly letter that breathed Augustine's spirit (A.D. 793)
   perhaps crossed the effort made by the heads of the Adoptianists to
   maintain their teaching in the Church by an encyclical to the Bishops
   of the Frankish kingdom. and a letter to Charlemagne, which took the
   form of a remonstrance, and contained a petition for a new
   investigation. Elipandus always regarded the "sleek" Beatus as the
   chief enemy, who had instilled his poison into the Church and seduced
   the Bishops. He adjures the King to judge justly; to reinstate Felix,
   and be warned by Constantine's revolt to Arianism. The heresy that
   through Beatus now threatened the whole Church was nothing less than
   the denial that Christ received his body from the Virgin. At the
   brilliant Synod of Frankfurt, Charlemagne, after reporting to the Pope,
   set on foot a new investigation (794). Learned bishops and theologians
   were summoned from all quarters. The assembly rejected Adoptianism in
   two Synodal deeds--the Italian Bishops under Paulinus of Aquileia voted
   separately. The same course was followed by a Synod assembled
   contemporaneously at Rome. All these resolutions were transmitted,
   along with a letter of his own, by Charlemagne to Elipandus.

   We are not interested in following the controversy further, for new
   phases did not appear. But we have the impression that Adoptianism made
   advances in Saracen Spain and the neighbouring province until about
   A.D. 799. Even the personal influence of famous doctors (Benedict of
   Aniane, Leidrad of Lyons) met at first with little success. But
   Frankish Spain could not resist the influence of the whole empire, and
   Felix himself was ultimately induced once more to recant at the Synod
   of Aachen (799). At this date, besides Paulinus, [649] Alcuin was
   indefatigable in producing works, some of them extensive, against the
   heresy (Libell. adv. Felic. hair., IV. lib. adv. Elipandum, VII. lib.
   adv. Felic.). It is interesting to notice how this Anglo-Saxon, the
   disciple of Bede, was entirely dependent in his Christology on the
   Greeks, and had abandoned the Augustinian tradition. Augustine as well
   as Græco-Roman speculative theology had become domesticated in England
   through the Romanising of that country. But in those questions on which
   the Greeks had pronounced their views, they were ever regarded as the
   more honourable, reliable, and learned. They were the representatives
   of the sublime theology of the mystery of the Incarnation. [650] The
   Latins were only after all to be considered in so far as they agreed
   with the Greeks. How great is the imposing prestige and power of an
   ancient culture, and how cogent is every "advance" that it experiences,
   even if that advance passes imperceptibly into a refinement which
   produces a new barbarianism! Alcuin's arguments might have occurred
   just as well in the works of Cyril, Leontius, or John of Damascus, and
   they are sometimes actually to be found there word for word:--Christ is
   the personal God-Logos who assumed impersonal human nature, and fused
   it into the complete unity of his being. Accordingly, even apart from
   sin, Christ's humanity was by no means like ours in all points, but was
   very different. Since it acquired all the attributes of deity, all
   human limitations shown in the life of Jesus were voluntarily accepted,
   in other words were due to accommodation, were pedagogic or illusory.
   Alcuin dissipates the records of the gospels as thoroughly as the
   Monophysite and Crypto-Monophysite Greeks. This form of piety had
   ceased to regard Christ in any sense as a human person; nay, it felt
   itself gravely hurt if it was told that it ought to suppose a really
   human consciousness in Christ. Not only was the dismemberment of the
   one Christ disowned as blasphemous, but still more the application to
   him of categories that were held to describe believers. [651] In fact,
   we are correct in saying that faith in Christ as Redeemer had no
   interest in expounding broadly wherein Christ is like us. [652] But the
   Adoptians had, consistently with this likeness, which they asserted,
   characterised him as head of the community, and demonstrated a way in
   which the man Christ could be apprehended as redeemer and intercessor.
   [653] But then, as now, no one who had once been initiated into the
   mysteries was influenced by this. He who has once but sipped the
   intoxicating cup of that mysticism, which promises to transform every
   worthless stone into gold, sees everywhere the mystery of deification,
   and then it is not easy for the watchman to recall the dreamer to life.
   [654] For this is the last motive of this speculation: from the
   transformation of the impersonal human substance into the divine (in
   the case of Christ) to derive the divino-human means of ea joyment in
   this world. Even in the instance of Beatus, the realistic conception of
   the Lord's Supper turns out to be a decisive motive against
   Adoptianism, [655] and this motive can also be demonstrated in Alcuin's
   works. [656] Thus the Christological controversy is closely connected
   with the magical conceptions of the Lord's Supper as the centre of
   Church doctrine and practice. It is all the more instructive that, as
   we shall see, images were not yet thought of, while the East had long
   had them in view, as well as the Lord's Supper, in connection with its
   Crypto-Monophysite Christology. In this matter the Anglo-Saxon and
   Frankish Church still "lagged" behind its guide.

   Felix secluded himself with Leidrad in Lyons. The re-conversion of the
   Frankish Adoptians now made great strides, and Felix himself had to
   exhort his congregation to abandon the error which he had formerly
   taught them. But he was by no means thoroughly convinced at heart, as
   is shown by papers found, after the death of the unfortunate Bishop, by
   Leidrad's successor, Agobard. Agobard held it necessary to refute the
   dead Felix. If aggressive Adoptianism soon expired in the Frankish
   kingdom, it was revived by the daring dialectic of the eleventh and
   twelfth centuries as a doctrine of the schools, [657] and it afterwards
   continued during all centuries of the Middle Ages, though without
   rousing more than a theological dispute. Little is known of how the
   "heresy" gradually died out in Saracen Spain. Even in the time of
   Elipandus it did not escape censure. It still had power to attract
   about A.D. 850; [658] but then there came times when it was necessarily
   worth more to Christian Spaniards to feel that they were in agreement
   with the whole Church than to defend the legitimacy of a distinctive
   position.

   The decisive result of the whole controversy was that the West set
   aside its own earlier Christological system, and--for the sake of the
   Lord's Supper and the imposing tradition of the Greeks--thought like
   the latter within the sphere of dogma. Christ's unity was maintained;
   but this unity absorbed his humanity, and removed far off the dread
   incarnate Son of God (dei filius incarnatus tremendus). Strict dogmatic
   only permitted him to be approached in the Lord's Supper. But that did
   not prevent the vision of the lowly Man of Sorrows continuing, still
   secretly at first, to make its way side by side with dogmatic theory,
   that vision that had dawned upon Augustine, and was in ever-increasing
   vividness to form the strength of piety in the future.

   [623] Yet not yet everywhere.

   [624] See Augustine's Christology above, p. 127 ff. The idea of the
   adoptio of the man Jesus, or human nature, also occurs in Tertullian,
   Novatian, Marius Victorinus, and Hilary.

   [625] So far as the retention of this is the condition of understanding
   Jesus Christ, the Greek conception is superior to the Adoptian.

   [626] The defenders of the anti-Adoptian Christology (Alcuin's) have
   not latered their tactics at the present day. Thus Bach says (l.c. I.,
   p. 109 ff.): "The Adoptians had no presentiment of that which the
   (Greek) Fathers call the pneumatic quality of Christ's flesh. Christ's
   body is to them that of common human nature in every respect. In this
   kenotic (!!) we have the basis of Adoptian dualism. . . . Felix, like
   Elipandus, does not understand the pneumatic human nature in Christ."
   If these words suggest any meaning at all, they show that the modern
   historian of dogma is as honest a Docetic as the orthodox after
   Justinian's heart.

   [627] The case is precisely the same as in Christological conflicts
   generally from the days of Apollinaris. There is right and wrong on
   both sides, but after all on neither, because the conception of a
   divine nature in Christ leads either to Docetism or the double
   personality. All speculations that seek to escape these consequences
   can display at most their good intentions.

   [628] This was bluntly asserted by Marius Victorinus (adv. Arium I.) to
   whom is entirely due the Augustinian view of Christology sub specie
   prædestinationis.

   excellentiam, quia sine fratribus, primogenitus secundum susceptionem
   hominis, in qua per adoptionem gratiæ fratres habere dignatus est, de
   quibus esset primogenitus."

   [630] Western Augustinian Christology, like Nestorianism, deserved its
   fall; for since it taught that the God-Logos existed behind the man
   Jesus who was supported by divine grace, the relation of the work of
   redemption to that homo was extremely uncertain. The result was a
   duplicity of view which could only produce confusion, and which had to
   come to an end, until the conception of faith should be thoroughly
   accepted, unhampered by pernicious speculations as to the two natures,
   that God himself was in the man Jesus.

   [631] See the seven, though not equally valuable passages in Hefele,
   l.c., p. 650 f.: "adoptivi hominis passio"--"adoptivi hominis non
   horruisti vestimentum"--"salvator per adoptionem carnis sedem repetiit
   deitatis," etc.

   [632] So Helfferich, l.c.; also Hauck, R.-Encyklop I3., p. 185, leaves
   it open.

   [633] Gfrörer, K.-Gesch. III., p. 644 ff. Graf. Baudissin, Eulogius und
   Alvar 1872, p. 61 f. The traces cited of a connection between Elipandus
   and Felix with the Saracens are very slight; besides, the objections
   felt by the latter to the doctrine of the Trinity are not lessened by
   Adoptianism. Elipandus defended the doctrine with peculiar emphasis.

   [634] Hefele, Op. cit., p. 628 ff.

   [635] Besides his enthusiasm for Rome, Migetius' main heresy seems to
   have been that he conceived God strictly as a single person, and
   maintained that he had revealed himself in three persons, namely, David
   (Father?), Jesus, and Paul (the Holy Ghost?). Besides this
   "Sabellianism," one might be tempted to discover "Priscillian" errors
   in him. But the slight information we possess (see Hadrian and
   Elipandus' letters) do not warrant a confident decision.

   [636] This explains the uninterrupted prestige of Augustinian theology.
   Isidore of Seville, e.g., felt it so strongly, that he even taught
   twofold predestination (Sentent. II. 6): "gemina predestinatio . . .
   sive reproborum ad mortem."

   [637] The comparatively slight influence exerted by the great main
   current of Church development is also shown by the fact that the
   opposition of the Spaniard Vigilantius to saints and relics continued
   to influence Spain, as is evidenced, e.g., by the attack made upon him
   by Faustus of Rhegium (see above, p. 244, note 1). Paradoxical as it
   sounds, the veneration of these objects lay in the van of Church
   evolution, in so far as it was most closely connected with the
   development of Christology. Those who resisted this worship soon ceased
   to do so on evangelical grounds, but because ecclesiastically they were
   "laggards." The dislike to relics and pictures, however, is as closely
   connected with the Adoptian theory, as their worship and the
   materialistic dogma of the Lord's Supper are with the Christology of
   Cyril, Justinian, and Alcuin (see under). But even after Reccared
   passed over to Catholicism, the Spanish Church showed its disorderly
   state, not only in the persistent mingling of Pagan and Christian
   morals, and (in some circles) the continuance of certain Arian
   leanings, but still more in numerous heretical intrigues. To this class
   belong Priscillianism, degenerated into dualism, Migetius, that Marcus
   who rejuvenated Basilidianism, and above all the sect of Bonosians that
   held its ground in Spain--phenomena that were profoundly opposed to
   Catholicism, and prove how hard it was for the rising Roman Catholic
   Church in Spain to adopt the sentiments of Roman Catholicism. No other
   Western Church had at this date still to strive so keenly with powerful
   heresies as the Spanish. Hence is explained the growth in this Church,
   especially after contact with Islam, of the cold, determined fanaticism
   of its orthodoxy and persecution of heretics. Wherever it arises, this
   is a sign that men have forced themselves after severe sacrifices to
   submit to the sacred cause, and that they now seek to compensate
   themselves by making others do the same. As regards the sect of
   Bonosians in particular, their founder, Bonosus, Bishop of Sardica,
   advanced from a denial of Mary's perpetual virginity to the doctrine of
   Photinus (see the Synod of Capua, A.D. 391; Ambrose's letters,
   Siricius, and Innocent I., and Marius Mercator). Strange to say, he
   found adherents in South Gaul, and especially in Spain, up till into
   the eighth century; in Spain, as it appears, they were numerous; see
   the 2 Synod of Arles (443?) c. 17, Synod of Clichy (626) c. 5, Synod of
   Orleans (538) c. 31, Gennad. de vir. inl. 4, Avitus Vienn., Isidore de
   script. eccl. 20, de hær. 53. In the sixth century Justinian of
   Valentia opposed them in Spain, and in the seventh the Synod of Toledo
   (675), referred in the Symbol to the doctrine of the Bonosians that
   Christ had only existed after Mary bore him, and was merely a filius
   adoptivus, by confessing: "hic etiam filius dei natura est filius, non
   adoptione." Naturally Elipandus and Felix were conjoined by their
   opponents with the Bonosians, but with the greatest injustice; they
   were rather their most implacable enemies, since they never denied that
   Christ as Son of God was filius dei naturalis. They even tried to hurl
   back the charge of Bonosianism at their enemies (Beatus and Eterius),
   an attempt, indeed, that could not succeed. It was at any rate
   prejudicial, seeing that men cling to catchwords, to place in the
   Toledan Symbol of 675 the words "non filius adoptione," although by
   them the Photinian error, which Elipandus himself "condemned to hell,"
   was exclusively meant. We may, indeed, say of Bonosianism, but not of
   Elipandus' teaching, that its circulation in Spain is explained by the
   Arian leanings of the Western Goths; for not only in the Arianism of
   scholarly theologians, but still more in its popular form, there lurked
   an element of the doctrine of Paul of Samosata and Photinus.

   [638] Since the Three Chapter controversy. We have to remember,
   further, that Theodore's commentary on Paul's Epistles still exists in
   a Latin translation, and that the work of Junilius comes from a Syrian
   copy; see Neander's Dogmengesch. II., p, 25 f., and Jacobi's note
   there, p. 26 f. Möller (Art. Adoptianism in Herzog's R.-E., 2nd Ed.)
   has stated, on the basis of Gam's discoveries, a conjecture that is
   worth noting: "Perhaps we ought to regard the orthodox brethren in
   Cordova extolled by Elipandus (Er). ad Felic. in Alcuin's letters, ep.
   123), who provided him with scholarly material, and to whom Alcuin (ep.
   ad Leidrad. 141) supposes the evil originally to have been due, as
   Eastern Christians of Nestorian culture who had come in the train of
   the Arabs, and who, if they did not produce, supported the Adoptian
   tendency." It is further important that Elipandus has not mentioned
   Nestorianism among the ancient heresies rejected by him.

   [639] Alcuin says too much when he exclaims (adv. Elip. IV. 2): "Ubi
   latuit, ubi dormivit hoc nomen adoptionis vel nuncupationis de
   Christo?" or Ep. 110: "Novitas vocum in adoptione, nuncupatione, omnino
   fidelibus omnibus detestanda est."

   [640] Compare how also Facundus of Hermiane (pro defens. trium capp. p.
   708, ed. Paris, 1616, II.) acknowledges that Christ accepted the
   "Sacrament of Adoption."

   [641] See passages cited by Bach, Opp. cit., p. 110 ff.

   [642] The clearest passages--Felix's own words--occur in Agobard, lib.
   adv. Fel. 27-37.

   [643] Alcuin adv. Felic. II. 16 (Felix says): "Christus qui est
   secundus Adam, accepit has geminas generationes, primam vid. quæ
   secundum carnem est, secundam vero spiritualem, quæ per adoptionem fit,
   idem redemptor noster secundum hominem complexus in semetipso continet:
   primam vid. quam suscepit ex virgine nascendo, secundam vero quam
   initiavit in lavacro a mortuis resurgendo."

   [644] Alcuin indeed does not believe that Felix was sincere in
   professing to hold the sinlessness of Christ, for, if he had been, he
   would not have spoken of a regeneration of Christ (l.c., c. 18).

   [645] Felix's words in Agobard 33: "Propter singularitatem personæ, in
   qua divinitas filii dei cum hurnanitate sua communes habeat actiones,
   qua ex causa aliquando ea quæ divina sunt referuntur ad humana, et ea
   quæ humana fiunt interdum adscribuntur ad divina, et hoc ordine
   aliquando dei filius in hominis filio filius hominis appellari dignatur
   et hominis filius in dei filio filius dei nuncupatur." The Nestorians,
   too, maintained such a double personality.

   [646] See the analysis of this writing in Bach, p. 116 ff. It follows
   Cyril. The old charge formerly made against the Nestorians is also
   urged against the Adoptians, that by making the Son of Man independent
   they expanded the Trinity into a Quaternity. A few western
   reminiscences are, however, not wanting, although the human nature is
   substantially conceived to be the impersonal caro; see e.g., II. 68,
   where the filius secundum carnem is named as mediator ("reconciliati
   sumus per solum filium secundum carnem, sed non soli filio secundum
   divinitatem"); also II. 40: "dominus ac redemptor noster cum sancta
   ecclesia, quam redemit secundum carnem, una substantia est."

   [647] Ep. 97 in the Cod. Carol. in Migne, T. CII., see analysis in
   Hefele III., p. 661 ff., which is also to be compared with what
   follows.

   [648] In the controversy the King proved that he felt fully his
   responsibility as a Christian ruler, and was at the same time
   thoroughly anxious to be just. He was really convinced by the
   propositions of his theologians. They extolled him highly as protector
   of the faith, as a David and a Solomon. Alcuin says of the King (adv.
   Elipand. I. 16): "Catholicus in fide, rex in potestate, pontifex in
   prædicatione, judex in æquitate, philosophus in liberalibus studiis,
   inclytus in moribus (?) et omni honestate præcipuus." Ep. 100 ad
   dominum regem: "hoc mirabile et speciale in te pietatis dei donum
   prædicamus, quod tanta devotione ecclesias Christi a perfidorum
   doctrinis intrinsecus purgare tuerique niteris, quanta forinsecus a
   vastatione paganorum defendere vel propagare conaris. His duabus
   gladiis vestram venerandam excellentiam dextra lævaque divina armavit
   potestas."

   [649] See on his polemics, Bach, p. 121 ff.

   [650] This is true above all of Cyril.

   [651] See the analysis of Alcuin's Christology in Bach, p. 128 ff.
   Alcuin seeks to show (1) that all the statements of Scripture and the
   Fathers regarding Christ have for their subject the concrete person in
   two natures; (2) that the notion of adoption occurs neither in
   Scripture nor the Fathers, and is thus novel and false; and (3) that
   the Adoptianist theory is inconsistent, and upsets the basis of faith.
   He tries to show that adoptio, if taken to mean anything different from
   assumptio, leads to heresy. Assumption is held to express the natural
   relation in which humanity is connected with deity by the Incarnation,
   and which is annulled by the adoptio that designates a relation due to
   grace. Alcuin indeed also speaks (following Augustine) of grace having
   been in Christ, for it does not, like adoptio, exclude the natural
   relation of sonship. But his strongest argument consists in his
   explanation that passive adoption was impossible, because the Son of
   Man did not exist at all before he was actual Son of God. Neither he
   nor Paulinus supposes that the man Christ was a person before the
   God-man. He certainly possessed his personality from the first in the
   Son of God. Accordingly, if we think abstractly, we may not conceive of
   a man (homo) Christ who existed before the Incarnation, but of human
   nature, which only became personal by its assumption, and was at once
   made an essential constituent of the person of the God-man. Therefore
   this nature, even apart from sin, was infinitely superior to and unlike
   ours. Therefore the doctrine of the Agnoetes, who had besides been
   already strongly assailed by Gregory I. in his letters, was to be
   condemned; and the servile form of the Son of God was in every respect
   worthy of adoration, because it was not necessary to his nature, but
   was at every point freely undertaken. Accordingly Christ required
   neither baptism nor adoption, and even as man was no ordinary creature,
   but always the God-man. "In spite of the assumption of human nature,
   the God-man retained sole property in the person of the Son." Humanity
   was merely added like something impersonal to this unity of person of
   the Son of God, "and there remained the same property in two natures in
   the name of the Son that formerly existed in one substance." But Alcuin
   adds very inaptly (c. Felic. II. 12): "in adsumtione carnis a deo
   persona petit hominis, non natura;" for he certainly did not assume
   that a "persona hominis" had existed previously. We can only explain
   this lapse by supposing that Alcuin had not yet let Cyril's Christology
   expunge from his mind every reminiscence of Augustine's. Bach rightly
   remarks (p. 136 f.: against Donner) "that no opponent of the Adoptians
   imagined that personality was essential to the completeness of the
   human nature; (like Bach himself) they taught exactly the opposite."
   Bach's own explanation of the above passage, which is only intelligible
   as a lapse, is, for the rest, wholly incorrect. By persona he would
   understand "the person of man as such, of humanitas, and not of the man
   Christ."

   [652] Epist. ad Carol. M.: "Quid enim prodest ecclesiæ dei Christum
   appellare adoptivum filium vel deum nuncupativum?

   [653] The explanations given by Felix as to the man Christ as sacerdos,
   sacrificium, caput ecclesiæ are Augustinian, and in part more precise
   than they occur in Augustine. The part played in the controversy by the
   thought of Christ as head of the Church is worthy of note. We are not
   prepared for it, if we start from the more ancient tradition. The
   greater emphasis laid on Christ as priest and sacrifice was already
   determined by the all-prevailing reference to the Mass.

   [654] Adoptianism, like Nestorianism, necessarily remained a half
   thing, because it did not correct this pseudo-Christian motive. This is
   the ultimate cause of its speedy death. Adoptianism and the Eucharistic
   Christ do not suit each other.

   [655] See Bach, p. 119 f. Beatus has pointed out, like Cyril, that the
   concrete unity of Christ's person is shown most clearly in the fact
   that in the Lord's Supper the whole Christ is adored, and that his
   flesh is the principle of eternal life. Bach (p. 120) has eloquently
   evolved as his own view the cause for which the opponents of the
   Adoptians ultimately contended. "Beatus and Eterius, in opposition to
   the externality of Elipandus, pointed with a profoundly realistic
   glance to the central significance of Christ in the collective ethical
   and sacramental constitution of Christianity, and the morally free life
   of humanity. The organic and physical relation of Christ to humanity,
   and the physiology of grace in its inner relation to human freedom,
   which has its living roots in the concrete God-man, are hereby
   indicated. A divided Christ cannot be a new physical ethical ferment of
   life to mankind." This materialistic ghost unfortunately also announces
   its presence in Protestant Christianity.

   [656] With him and Paulinus, only indeed in unimportant hints,
   wherefore Each calls Paulinus "less profound and thorough" than Beatus.
   How the speculation reached the latter is not known.

   I. (b). The Controversy as to Predestination. [659]

   The revival of theological science in the ninth century led to a
   thorough study of Augustine. But the theology of Gregory I. had already
   accustomed men to combine the formulas of Augustinianism with the
   Pelagianism required by the system of the cultus. Hence a renewal of
   the controversy would hardly have taken place had not the monk
   Gottschalk of Orbais asserted the doctrine of predestination with as
   much energy as Augustine had done in his latest writings, and had he
   not been opposed by Hinkmar, whom his jealous colleagues would gladly
   have charged with heresy. It was not his use of Augustinian formulas
   that lifted Gottschalk out of the mass of theologians, and gave a
   startling effect to his confession. It was the fact that the doctrine
   of predestination had become the strength and support of his being
   after a misspent life. Here again it is palpable that words are not
   everything, that they remain a tinkling cymbal as long as they are not
   the expression of experience. Many joined and followed Gottschalk in
   speaking as he did at the time; but he alone was persecuted as a
   heretical teacher, because the opposition felt that he alone was
   dangerous to their Church system.

   Gottschalk's teaching regarding predestination was not different,
   either in matter or form, from that of Augustine, Fulgentius, and
   Isidore; [660] but it must also be said that he taught nothing but
   predestination. With the devotion, at first of resignation, and
   afterwards of fanaticism, he committed himself to the hands of God who
   does all things according to his good pleasure, and does nothing
   without having determined it irrevocably from the beginning.
   Predestination is the content of the Gospel, is the object of faith. It
   is the truth--that twofold predestination to life and death, according
   to which eternal life is decreed for the good, and death for the
   sinner, in which, therefore, some are appointed to life, and the rest
   to death. Nothing is to be set aside that the Church elsewhere teaches,
   or that it does; but it is a revolt from the Gospel to obscure in the
   hearts of men the certainty of this eternal unchangeable dispensation
   of divine grace--for justice and punishment are also good. Until his
   death Gottschalk defended inflexibly this faith of his, in the living
   and original language of the convinced advocate. [661]

   But what did the historical Christ, or the Christ of the sacramentally
   ordered Church, mean here? If the hidden God with his hidden will was a
   comfort to Gottschalk, then that comfort consisted in the assurance
   that this God had also predestinated some to life, and the assurance
   flowed from the economy which culminated in Christ. For from what other
   source was it known that eternal predestination also embraced the
   pardon of a section of mankind? The assurance of the individual gained
   nothing by this; but among the opposition also no one would have
   anything to do with certainty of salvation; the individual did not
   count for much to himself or others. Individualism was not yet
   developed. Christ accordingly was not in question. Even the resolute
   defender of predestination looked to him when he thought of election to
   life. But the system of the Sacraments, legal demands and works, which
   constituted the Church itself, tottered, as it must always totter,
   wherever religion is recalled from externality to the inner life. This
   recall was accomplished in a much more abstract way in the present
   instance than by Augustine. The most profound of the African's
   expositions on liberating grace and the blessed necessity of goodness
   (beata necessitas boni), which form the background of the doctrine of
   predestination, do not tell strongly upon Gottschalk. Nor had the
   Frankish monk been able to appropriate the Neoplatonic speculation,
   that had been toned down or transferred to a wholly different sphere of
   ideas by Augustine's teaching. And, again, he did not know the
   dialectic of the notion of time, which is inseparable from Augustine's
   conception. Yet he was not unfamiliar with dialectics; indeed, if we
   may trust the accounts given us, he at first took pleasure in the
   problem on dialectical grounds; but the fire he played with afterwards
   mastered him. The subject matter itself became precious to him. It
   corresponded to his own mood, ever growing gloomier, and he championed
   it with the zeal of the missionary. It was not original sin, or sin
   that he regarded as the chief subject, but the unchangeableness and
   wisdom of God. He was a theologian in the narrowest sense of the term.

   Gottschalk was first opposed by Rabanus in his letters to Noting and
   Eberard--shortly before A.D. 848. [662] He was accused of teaching that
   right faith and good works were of no avail to him who was not
   appointed to salvation, and that God forced men to sin and perdition
   (invitum hominem facit peccare). [663] Other opponents soon arose, and
   it was declared that he taught a predestination to sin. At the Council
   of Mainz (848) Rabanus got him condemned, [664] and handed over, by
   command of King Lewis, to Hinkmar to whose province as monk he
   belonged. [665] In his letter to Hinkmar, Rabanus declares a
   predestination as regards wickedness to be simply erroneous, and he is
   able to tell already of people, who, seduced by Gottschalk, gave up
   pious practices because, forsooth, they were wholly useless. [666]
   Hinkmar got the judgment against the "miserable monk" repeated at an
   imperial synodal diet at Chiersey (849). He was deposed from his
   office, scourged, and rendered harmless in prison. [667] Neither
   Rabanus nor Hinkmar seems at first to have formed as yet any idea of
   the difficulty of the whole question--caused by the authority of
   Augustine and other Fathers. Hinkmar contented himself with referring
   God's prescience to good or evil, but predestination to goodness alone.
   [668] But the position of the case soon changed. Gottschalk composed
   two confessions, in which he stated his teaching, supporting it from
   Scripture and the Fathers, [669] and he also wrote essays in which he
   emphasised the particularism of Christ's saving work, [670]
   subordinating the latter strictly to the premundane decree of God. He
   also, in a letter to Amolo, gave expression to the particularly
   objectionable principle "that baptism and the other sacraments were
   given in vain to those who perished after receiving them;" for "those
   of the number of the faithful who perish were never incorporated in
   Christ and the Church." [671] But it was perceived in the more cultured
   South, apart from Mainz and Rheims, that it was not Gottschalk but his
   opponents who diverged from Augustine's teaching. The best theologians
   ranged themselves on the side of the Confessor e.g., Prudentius of
   Troyes, Ratramnus of Corbie, then also the learned and acute Lupus of
   Ferrières, [672] the priest Servatus Lupus and Remigius of Lyons, for
   the most part disciples of Alcuin. [673]

   There now began a lively theological controversy (849-50), which was
   not, however, violent enough to involve the rest of the Church and the
   Pope, and which was unspeakably unsatisfactory, because staunch
   Augustinians neither could nor would abandon the ruling ecclesiastical
   system, and had therefore to seek for compromises where Gottschalk's
   results endangered it, and because the Frankish Semi-Pelagians soon saw
   that they would have to approximate their phraseology to
   Augustinianism. Among the writings in defence of Gottschalk there were
   accordingly many shades of opinion, but so were there also on the other
   side. [674] Florus Magister, e.g., advocated the twofold (gemina)
   predestination, but yet opposed Gottschalk, since he rejected the
   thought of the irresistibleness of grace. [675] Amolo of Lyons treated
   him in a friendly spirit; but no one else showed so emphatically that
   Gottschalk's teaching did away with the historical redemption, the
   fruits of Christ's death, and sacramental grace. [676] The only one who
   took up a consistent standpoint, and from it opposed the monk, was John
   Scotus. His teaching did not rest on Augustine's doctrine of
   predestination but on the Neoplatonic and Augustinian ontology, which
   he developed boldly. According to this, evil and death were nothing.
   Unchangeable being had only one unchangeable will, namely itself, and
   it evolved itself alone. Everything else consisted in negation, was
   nothing actual, and bore this very not-being in itself as a punishment.
   Applying this to the question of predestination, it followed that those
   were right who would only admit one predestination. [677] But friend
   and foe felt, without seeing through the pantheism of Scotus, that this
   was a case of casting out the devil by the aid of Beelzebub ("commentum
   diaboli"). There was only one way out of the difficulty besides that
   given by Scotus. This was to give up altogether putting the question in
   the form of the predestination problem, to hold to the historical
   Christ, and to do justice to Augustine's doctrine of grace by reducing
   the Church system to the experience of the new birth and faith. But no
   one discovered this expedient, [678] and so the whole controversy
   necessarily became a maze of insincerity, partly objective, partly
   conscious. Augustine's authority, however, was so powerful that the
   result, if we may speak of such a thing, came nearer Gottschalk's
   teaching in words than to the original utterances of Rabanus and his
   comrades (of whom Pardulus also was one). The latter sought to carry
   their distinction between prescience and predestination (as regards
   evil and punishment), and would therefore have nothing said of persons
   being predestined to punishment. When God foresaw evil, he predestined
   punishment for those who should not deserve to be redeemed by grace;
   room, accordingly, is left indirectly to free-will, although, so far as
   words go, the saved are saved solely in virtue of election. The
   artificial distinction here made (predestination of life and of the
   good, prescience of the wicked, predestination of punishment) is
   apparently defensible, even on an Augustinian basis, since Hinkmar now
   spoke of a complete loss of freedom through Adam's Fall. But the
   distinction was in truth meant to open a door for the entrance of
   Semi-Pelagianism. This doctrine was adopted at a new Synod of Chiersey
   (853) under Hinkmar's leadership. [679]

   But what took place here was not authoritative in the Archbishopric of
   Sens [680] and the Empire of Lothar. Remigius of Lyons sharply attacked
   the four chapters of Chiersey as running counter to Scripture and the
   Fathers. [681] At the great Synod held at Valencia of the provinces of
   Lyons, Vienne and Arles (855), canons were adopted which adhered much
   more closely to Augustine, and contained the teaching of Remigius.
   Dislike to the powerful Hinkmar also played a part in their
   composition. The Synod rejected the four chapters: they had been
   entered on with too little prudence ("minus prospecte suscepta.") It
   taught the double predestination, applied the latter to persons also,
   and maintained that Christ shed his blood for believers. The question
   whether God willed to save all men was carefully evaded. If the Synod
   disowned a predestination to sin, it did not thereby abandon strictly
   Augustinian ground. On the contrary, the contention that condemnation
   was based on prescience, and that in the Church's Sacraments "nothing
   was futile or delusive" (nihil sit cassum, nihil ludificatorium) shows
   the anxiety felt not to give up what was held valid by the Church.
   [682] If we compare the resolutions of the two Synods word for word,
   the differences are extremely subtle, and yet the little addition
   (plus) of the alien co-efficient attached to Augustinianism in the
   Chiersey decrees is highly significant. Rabanus, Hinkmar, and Charles's
   Synod take their stand on ecclesiastical empiricism, and try, because
   they must, to come to terms with Augustinianism, therein yielding more
   than can have been agreeable to them. Remigius, Prudentius, and
   Lothar's Synod take their stand on Augustinianism, and yet would not
   give up this ecclesiastical empiricism. But in neither case did anyone
   permit the suggestion of a doubt as to whether this empiricism and
   Augustinianism were compatible.

   Political affairs prevented the threatened breach from being
   consummated. The matter was taken up again in the reign of King
   Charles, Lothar's son. A few slight modifications of the chapters of
   Valencia were decided on at Langres (859) in order to enable Charles
   the Bald, who had subscribed those of Chiersey, to approve of them.
   [683] The great Synod of Savonieres (859), at which there were present
   bishops from three kingdoms, as well as the sovereigns themselves,
   Charles the Bald, Charles of Provence, and Lothar of Lothringen,
   adopted the modified chapters of Valencia, and also, as it appears,
   those passed at Chiersey; the members did not condemn one another on
   account of disbelief or belief in twofold predestination (gemina
   predestinatio), and this meant the greatest advance towards peace.
   [684] Hinkmar, indeed, did not doubt that there had been and was a
   predestinationist heresy, which it was necessary to oppose, and whose
   adherents appealed unjustifiably to Augustine. He composed at the time
   his prolix work, De prædestinatione (against Remigius and others),
   under the auspices of his theological king. But the kings' need of
   peace was stronger than the zeal of bishops fighting in the dark. At
   the great Synod of the three realms at Toucy (860), the case postponed
   at Savonières was brought to an end in a comprehensive synodal edict,
   which dealt indefinitely with the real kernel of the question, and was
   destitute of meaning and badly arranged. Controversial points were left
   alone, and those were confessed on which all were agreed. Hinkmar
   composed this document. Besides predestination to life, which was set
   forth in good Augustinian language, it was declared that God willed to
   save all, that Christ died for all, and that while free-will required
   to be redeemed and healed after the Fall, it had never been wholly
   lost. [685] If the worth of a confession depends on its really
   expressing the existing belief, then the triumph of Hinkmar's formula
   was really more valuable than would have been that of the contrary
   doctrine. The avowal of twofold predestination, in itself even more the
   expression of a theological speculation than of Christian faith in God
   the Father, would have meant less than nothing coupled with the
   retention of ecclesiastical empiricism. Of course the formula of
   Hinkmar, which no artifice could reconcile with that of Orange, did not
   mean much either; for, in spite of words, Augustine remained deposed.
   Gregory I.'s system of doctrine held the field. Men thought of the
   sacramental Christ, as they rejected, along with Adoptianism, the
   Augustinian Christology, and it was still this Christ and the good
   works of believers to which they looked, when, along with twofold
   predestination, they in fact set aside Augustine's doctrine of grace.

   Gottschalk died in prison, irreconcilable and unreconciled (869),
   clinging to the prædestinatio ad mortem, which he understood in so
   "erroneous a sense" that he did not abandon it as Remigius seems to
   have done. He had prophesied in vain the unmasking and fall of his
   mortal enemy Hinkmar as Antichrist, that great exemplar of
   predestination to death. [686]

   Confessio prolixior (Migne, CXXI., p. 349): "Tui profecto sic semper

   "gemina prædestinatio . . . similiter omnino omnes reprobos, qui
   damnabuntur propter ipsorum mala merita, incommutabilis deus per justum
   judicium suum incommutabiliter prædestinavit ad mortem merito
   sempiternam."

   1027.

   [668] Hinkmar's large works on the question in dispute were not written
   till several years later; (yet see the writing Ad reclusos et
   simplices, A.D. 849-50; Gundlach in the Ztschr. für K.-Gesch., Vol. X.,
   p. 258 ff.; Freystedt, l.c. p. 320 ff., 358 ff.). The first in three
   books (856 and 857) was so extensive, that it was not transcribed, and
   so has perished (see Schrörs, p. 136 f. ). The second, De
   prædestinatione dei et libero arbitrio, was also prolix enough and very
   meaningless (written 859 to 860, Schrörs, p. 141 ff.). In the
   introduction to this work, the history of the sect of
   predestinationists, which is said to have risen even in St. Augustine's
   lifetime, is described in a very unhistorical fashion. The sect has now
   revived, and its newer members adhere to Fulgentius, who never enjoyed
   a lofty prestige in the Church (c. 3, 8, 13). Hinkmar's main
   proposition is that predestination to punishment embraces compulsion to
   commit sin. "Præscivit deus hominem ad poenam." Accordingly there is
   only a predestination of, not to, punishment.

   [669] Migne, CXXI., pp. 347-349: "Confiteor, deum omnipotentem et
   incommutabilem præscisse et prædestinasse angelos sanctos et homines
   electos ad vitam gratis æternam, et ipsum diabolum . . . cum ipsis
   quoque hominibus reprobis . . . propter præscita certissime ipsorum
   propria futura mala rnerita prædestinasse pariter per justissimum
   judicium suum in mortem merito sempiternam." "Credo siquidem atque
   confiteor præscisse teante sæcula quæcunque erant futura, sive bona
   sive mala, prædestinasse vero tantummodo bona. Bona autem a te
   prædestinata bifariam sunt tuis a fidelibus indagata . . . i.e. in
   gratiæ beneficia et justitiæ simul judicia . . . Frustra electis
   prædestinasses vitam, nisi et illos prædestinasses ad ipsum. Sic etiam
   . . . omnibus quoque reprobis hominibus perennem merito prædestinasti
   poenam, et eosdem similiter prædestinasti ad eam, quia nimirum sine
   causa et ipsis prædestinasses mortis perpetuæ poenam, nisi et ipsos
   prædestinasses ad eam: non enim irent, nisi destinati, neque profecto
   destinarentur, nisi essent prædestinati." From Gottschalk's standpoint
   both confessions are conciliatory.

   [670] Gottschalk frequently maintained that Christ did not die for the
   reprobi, though he taught a certain general redemption of all the
   baptised; see Hincm. De præd. 29, 34, 35; Migne, CXXV., p. 289 sq., 349
   sq., 369 sq.

   [671] Hefele, p. 169: "baptistum et alia sacramenta frustatorie eis
   dari, qui post eorum perceptionem pereunt;" for "qui ex numero fidelium
   pereunt, Christo et ecclesiæ nunquam fuerunt incorporati."

   [672] See Freystedt, i.e., p. 329 ff.

   [673] Bach (I., p. 232 ff.) has analysed and discussed the various
   writings of these men.

   [674] Men at that time disputed about predestination, just as
   "positive" theologians to-day quarrel among themselves about the right
   of historical criticism. Some defend this right, others would restrict
   or abolish it; but even the former don't really believe in it, since
   they take care not to carry out its conclusions.

   [678] Amolo came nearest it.

   [679] The four chapters of Chiersey yielded more to Augustinianism than
   was consistent with truthfulness: I. "Deus hominem sine peccato rectum
   cum libero arbitrio condidit et in paradiso posuit, quem in sanctitate
   justitiæ permanere voluit. Homo libero arbitrio male utens peccavit et
   cecidit, et factus est massa perditionis totius humani generis. Deus
   autem bonus et justus elegit ex eadem massa perditionis secundum
   præscientiam suam, quos per gratiam prædestinavit ad vitam, et vitam
   illis prædestinavit æternam. Ceteros autem, quos justitiæ judicio in
   massa perditionis reliquit, perituros præscivit, sed non ut perirent
   prædestinavit, poenam autem illis, quia justus est, prædestinavit
   æternam. Ac per hoc unam dei prædestinationem tantummodo dicimus, quæ
   aut ad donum pertinet gratiæ, aut ad retributionem justitiæ." II.
   "Libertatem arbitrii in primo homine perdidimus, quam per Christum
   dominum nostrum recepimus. Et habemus liberum arbitrium ad bonum,
   præventum et adjutum gratia. Et habemus liberum arbitrium ad malum,
   desertum gratia. Liberum autem habemus arbitrium quia gratia liberatum
   et gratia, de corrupto sanatum." III. "Deus omnes homines sine
   exceptione vult salvos fieri, licet non omnes salventur. Quod autem
   quidem salvantur, salvantis est donum; quod autem quidem pereunt,
   pereuntium est meritum." The fourth chapter says that Christ adopted
   the nature of each man, and accordingly died for each, though all are
   not redeemed. The cause of this fact is that those not redeemed are
   infideles or are deficient in the faith that works by love; "poculum
   humanæ salutis, quod confectum est infirmitate nostra et virtute
   divina, habet quidem in se, ut omnibus prosit, sed si non bibitur non
   medetur." Mansi, XIV., p. 919.

   ff. Prædestinatio ad mortem is not mentioned.

   [686] The ill-usage he had suffered seems to have rendered Gottschalk
   at times irresponsible for his actions in the last years of his life.
   His dispute with Hinkmar about the phrase "trina deitas" is noteworthy.
   The latter would not permit it on the ground that it was Arian;
   Gottschalk and Ratramnus defended it by accusing Hinkmar of
   Sabellianism. Both phrases "una deitas" and "trina deitas" can be
   defended from the Augustinian standpoint; see Hinkmar's writing, De una
   et non trina deitate (Migne, CXXV., p. 473; Schrörs, Hinkmar, p. 150
   ff.), in which Boethius' notion of personality ("rationabilis naturæ
   individua subsistentia") plays a part. The number of theological
   problems discussed at the date of this renaissance of theology was very
   great; see Schrörs, Hinkmar, p. 88 ff. But the questions were almost
   all exceedingly minute and subtle, like those suggested by clever
   children. Nor was the culture of the period possessed of the scholastic
   technique required for their treatment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2. The Controversy regarding the Filioque and Pictures.

   By the position it had taken up in the Adoptianist as well as in the
   predestination controversy, the Church of the Frankish kingdom
   identified itself, abandoning tendencies to higher characteristics of
   its own, [687] with the popular Church ideas as represented by
   Constantinople and Rome. The theology it had inherited from Augustine
   was transformed into an ecclesiastical system such as had long
   prevailed in those chief Churches. But the West at that time still held
   tenaciously to its own characteristic position as compared with the
   East in two doctrines; it supported the filioque and rejected images.
   Both these subjects have been already discussed in Vol. IV., pp. 133,
   317, therefore only a little falls to be added.

   Even if we had not known it already, we see very clearly in the
   controversy regarding the filioque clause that the doctrine of the
   Trinity and Christology constituted dogma and the legal basis of the
   Church kat' exochen, even for the West--see the Athanasian Creed. [688]
   The filioque, which originated in Augustinian theology, came to the
   Frankish kingdom from Spain, but we know nothing more precisely as to
   how it did. It was held to be certain that it belonged to the Symbol,
   and this conviction was already expressed at the Synod of Gentilly
   (767). [689] Charles's learned theologians confirmed it, as is proved
   by Alcuin's work De processione spiritus sancti, and the Libri
   Carolini. [690] Official action was provoked by Western monks having
   had to submit to grave injustice in Jerusalem, because in the Liturgy
   they added, "sicut erat in principio" to the "Gloria patri," and "tu
   solus altissimus" to the "Gloria in excelsis," and in the Symbol
   "filioque" to "a patre." They complained to the Pope, who turned to the
   Emperor. The latter commissioned Theodulf of Orleans to compose a work,
   "De spiritu sancto," and got it decreed at the Synod of Aachen (809)
   that the filioque belonged to the Symbol. [691] The Pope, however, who
   had to approve of this decision, still took the East into
   consideration, and did not permit the admission of the word, though he
   assented to the doctrine. Even the remonstrance of the Franks that the
   filioque was necessary to salvation did not move him. [692] The matter
   continued thus till the great controversy under Photius, until the
   filioque became the Symbolic watchword in the whole of the West. [693]
   The most worthless formula of Augustinianism, once recommended by its
   opposition to Arianism, was thus preserved in the West.

   If in this controversy between the West and East the former at first
   received only a lukewarm support from Rome, which was still half
   Byzantine, the Pope ranged himself entirely on the side of the pious
   Eastern theologians in the Oriental controversy about images, and
   therewith his relations became strained with Frankish theology or the
   efforts made by Charles I. to promote civilisation. The attitude of
   that theology in the great conflict is extremely characteristic of the
   transition time in which it found itself. The spiritual (inner) element
   introduced into it by Augustine no longer reacted in Christology, and
   in the conception of the Mass, against mystical superstition and magic
   sacramentalism. It had been swallowed up by the more powerful Byzantine
   Roman current. But the Franks could not yet force themselves to adopt
   the Oriental worship of images. [694] A halt was made at the Host. A
   spiritual, Augustinian element reacted against image-worship, but,
   paradoxical as it sounds, the lower state of dogmatic culture had also
   its effect here. It would indeed seem, on a superficial view, that he
   who rejects the veneration of images is always the more cultured. But
   that only holds in circumstances that did not then exist. Where men had
   once entered, as was the case in the Frankish kingdom, the magic circle
   of the Byzantine mysticism that enveloped Christ and the cultus, it was
   simply the sign of a religious faith not yet fully developed on this
   basis to halt at the Host, and to disdain the riches offered by images
   to theological thought and pious fancy. The East and Rome made their
   Christology living for themselves in pictures, and so saw the past
   mystery in the abiding present. How could a faith dispense with them
   that already aimed at the sensuous enjoyment of heavenly things and
   revelled in the worship of relics? But dogmatic culture was still
   backward in the West, the theosophy of images had not yet been learnt,
   and--what was most important--but few pictures were possessed.

   It has been maintained, [695] but it is not absolutely certain, that
   the Synod of Gentilly (767) emitted a declaration as to image-worship
   satisfactory to the Pope. The Synod of Frankfort (794) unanimously
   condemned the decision of the seventh OEcumenical Council, which
   required "service and adoration" (servitium, adoratio) to be rendered
   to images. The decisions of the Council were undoubtedly extant only in
   a very bad translation. [696] "Certain chapters" had been previously
   sent to Rome against the worship of images, these being an extract (85
   ch.) from the Libri Carolini, which Alcuin had composed shortly before,
   at the Emperor's command, in conjunction with other theological Court
   officials; they were written against the Oriental Councils of 754 and
   787. [697] In these iconoclasm, but still more strongly image-worship,
   are forbidden as foolish and mischievous. It was right to have pictures
   for decoration and recollection, but not to adore them (Gregory I., Ep.
   VII. III: "therefore the picture is used in Churches that those who are
   ignorant of letters may at least read by seeing upon the walls what
   they cannot read in books," and, further, Libri Carol. præf.: "having
   images in the ornaments of our churches and in memory of past events,
   and worshipping God alone, and exhibiting fit veneration to his saints,
   we are neither iconoclasts with the one party nor worshippers with the
   other"). Image-worship is then refuted at greater length, and the
   addition of the seventh to the six OEcumenical Councils is condemned;
   the two Synods (of 754 and 787) are "infamous" and "most foolish"
   (infames, ineptissimæ). Some would see in these books a proof of the
   Carlovingian "illumination"; [698] but the enlightenment, which is
   unmistakable in other respects, only went the length of ignorance of
   the theosophy of images, failure to understand the subtle distinctions
   between latreia (worship) and proskunesis (veneration), and the king's
   effort to advance civilisation. What the books really show is the
   self-reliance and sense of power of the Frankish Church, which break
   out with youthful audacity, convicting with mischievous glee the older
   and wiser sister of error, and actually summoning, and requiring the
   Pope formally to prosecute, the Byzantine Emperor and the
   Empress-Regent.

   These books already show that the Roman West and the East could no
   longer go together, because the former sought to take command. They
   also reveal a trace of Augustinian spiritual teaching, but knowing what
   we do of the sort of thing held sacred at that time in the Frankish
   kingdom, they cannot be taken as proving that men were more enlightened
   in the Western than in the Eastern Church. [699] Pope Hadrian refuted
   the chapters, [700] but took care not to exaggerate the difference.
   Under Louis the Pious, a Synod convoked at Paris on account of an
   embassy from Michael the Stammerer (825) pronounced itself decidedly
   against the image-worshipping Pope, and held strictly to the line laid
   down in the Libri Carolini: pictures might be set up "in memory of
   pious love" (pro amoris pii memoria), as ornaments, and, above all, for
   the sake of the uneducated; but they were not to be adored, and their
   erection might therefore be dispensed with. [701] Louis adopted more
   stringent measures against image-worship than Charles. [702] Pope
   Eugene II. wrapped himself in silence; nay, even in A.D. 863 a Lateran
   Synod, while it recognised image-worship in guarded language, said
   nothing about the seventh OEcumenical Council. [703] Image-worship and
   the seventh Synod of 787 were gradually accepted only after the time of
   the eighth general Synod (869). [704] Yet the Carlovingian theologians
   were still hostile to image-worship at the close of the period.
   Hinkmar, who wrote a work, no longer preserved, "on the worship of
   pictures of the Redeemer and the Saints," [705] would only admit them
   as means of instruction (or for ornament); and Agobard, [706] Jonas of
   Orleans, [707] Walafrid Strabo, [708] and Æneas of Paris [709] held the
   same view. Hinkmar also calls the Council of 787 a Pseudo-Synod, and
   all Frankish authorities known to us, of the ninth century, reckon only
   six Councils. Even the (eighth) Council of 869 was at first not
   recognised by Hinkmar. It was only when the Frankish German Church
   again came to the light after the dark ages that it also saw the
   seventh and eighth Councils. Yet the difference with the Pope regarding
   the pictures hardly did any harm to his prestige in the ninth century.
   His authority, that is, had not been carried so high or become so
   sensitive that such shocks could bring about its fall. [710]
   Image-worship was never able to domesticate itself thoroughly where
   antiquity was not the ruling spirit. Even at the present day Italy is
   still the classic land of image-worship in the West. While, however, in
   the East that worship expresses the religious faith and the philosophy
   of religion themselves, because it is evolved from the Christology, in
   the West pictures form part of the system of intercessors and helpers
   in need. In practice, indeed, the difference is pretty well
   obliterated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [687] Of course only tendencies--the confusion that still prevailed at
   the close of the eighth century as regards Augustinianism is best shown
   by the fact that the Symbol admitted into the Libri Carolini (symbolum
   Hieronymi, sermo Augustini) was Pelagius' Confession of Faith ad
   Innocentium. But it was also, as late as A.D. 1521, produced by the
   Sorbonne against Luther as Augustine's confession.

   [688] I have dealt with the origin and authority of the Athanasian
   Symbol in Vol. IV., p. 134. Since then Loofs (R. Encykl., Vol. II.3,
   pp. 177-194) has published an investigation regarding it, distinguished
   by a comprehensive knowledge of sources and literature. We are agreed
   as to the following points. (1) The Symbol, whether we may think it to
   have risen out of two originally independent documents or not, belongs
   to Roman Southern Gaul. (2) Its first, longer, Trinitarian half, as
   well as the second, shorter, Christological portion belongs to the
   period c. 450--(at latest) 600. In the pre-Carlovingian age the Symbol
   had only a partial authority--the Canon of Autun proves that it was
   accepted there c. 670. Not till the Carlovingian period was the way
   prepared for its universal acceptance. Thus only two important points
   are in dispute. (1) Did the Symbol originate in a sermo de symbolo, or
   was it directly conceived as a formulary of the faith? (2) Does it
   consist of two portions originally independent, or was it framed from
   the first in its present extent? I may here leave the first question
   alone. As regards the second, I had supported the original independence
   of the Trinitarian first half, and supposed that the Christological
   section was only added a considerable time later, perhaps not till the
   Carlovingian epoch. Loofs (p. 185 ff.) has convinced me, by his
   evidence as to the Cod. Paris, 3836, that this date has been put too
   late. But I never based my opinion of an original independence of the
   two parts on this external testimony invalidated by Loofs, but on the
   internal matter of the Symbol. The latter Loofs has practically left
   alone. The following facts fall to be considered. (1) In the opening of
   the Symbol, §§ 1-3, the doctrine of the Trinity is alone announced as
   "catholica fides" (compare the edict of Theodosius I. of A.D. 380);
   there is nothing to suggest that the author means also to deal with
   Christology. (2) In § 26 we find, consistently with this, the solemn
   conclusion reverting to the beginning; "Qui vult ergo salvus esse, ita
   de trinitate sentiat." This whole first half is accordingly a rule of
   faith complete in itself and entire, elaborated by the aid of Augustine
   and Vincentius, and anti-Arian. Nothing essential is to be found in it
   which could not have been written by Augustine, if of course the
   sentences may have been only gradually polished afterwards. (3) The
   following section, not hitherto introduced, is, indeed, bracketed with
   the preceding one by §§ 27 and 48; but these brackets testify plainly
   enough that an original organic unity is not to be supposed. For (a)
   § 40 is a replica of § 26, yet (b) the language is somewhat different
   (in the second section we have "fideliter credere," "fides recta, ut
   credamus et confiteamur," "fideliter et firmiterque credere"; in the
   first section: "catholicam fidem tenere," or "integram inviolatamque
   fidem servare"). (4) Looking to the contents, the Christological
   section, §§ 28-39, shows, first, the Antinestorian (32) and
   Antimonophysite attitude (34, 35) completely balanced; secondly, the
   Gallican rescension of the Apostle's Creed ("passus," "descendit ad
   inferos," "sedet ad dexteram dei patris omnipotentis--these could only
   be attributed to Spain); thirdly, the influence of the Nicene
   Constantinopolitan Creed ("passus est pro nostra salute,"), so that we
   can hardly ascend beyond the beginning of the sixth century for this
   part. (5) Weight is to be given to the fact that the author, who has
   adhered strictly in §§ 36, 37 to the curt form of the Symbol, has
   considered it necessary in §§ 38, 39 to make a wordy addition, that at
   Christ's coming all men "reddituri sunt de factis propriis rationem, et
   qui bona egerunt ibunt in vitam æternam, qui vero mala in ignem
   æternum." Is this addition not to be understood as in the interests of
   Semi-Pelagianism? The two portions may have been combined as early as
   the sixth century. If we could date the Sermo Trevir. we would know
   more accurately about this.

   patre per filium instead of ex filio.

   [692] See Mansi, XIV., p. 18 sq. It is very important that the Pope
   objected to the last-mentioned argument of the Franks, saying that
   other things were also necessary for salvation, and were yet not
   received into the Symbol, since it could admit of no change at all.
   This meant (as opposed to the Eastern view) that the Symbol did not
   embrace everything that belonged to salvation. The Pope says (p. 20):
   "Verumtamen, quæso, responde mihi: num universa hujusmodi fidei mystica
   sacramenta, quæ symbolo non continentur, sine quibus quisque, qui ad
   hoc pertingere potest, catholicus esse non potest, symbolis inserenda
   et propter compendium minus intellegentium, ut cuique libuerit, addenda
   sunt?" The Pope, besides, asserted, in a very remarkable way, in the
   interview with the Frankish missi, he thought that all stages of
   culture could not take up the same attitude to dogma, hat accordingly
   what was important to some was not to others.

   [693] The papal legates in Constantinople (A.D. 88o) still subscribed
   the Symbol without filiogue. On John VIII., see Hefele IV., p. 482. The
   Frankish kingdom took the liveliest interest in the controversy in that
   period; but the grounds on which it rested its own view were always the
   same. It is not known how and when the "filioque" was admitted in Rome
   into the Symbol; and we know just as little about how and when Rome
   accepted the Gallican Apostles' Creed and the Athanasian.

   [694] This is true of the cultured, and at that time governing, portion
   of the clergy.

   were Claudius of Turin and Agobard; see Reuter, I., p. 16 ff. We are
   reasonably astonished that Claudius did not fare worse than he did. The
   study of Augustine had opened his as well as Agobard's eyes to the
   contrast between the external, superstitious Christianity of their time
   and the ideal type of Catholicism that had taken shape to itself in the
   work of the great African.

   3. The Development of the Practice and Theory of the Mass (the Dogma of
   the Lord's Supper) and of Penance.

   Three factors co-operated to promote a development of the theory of the
   Lord's Supper in the West in the Carlovingian age. Firstly, the
   influence of Byzantium, where the controversy about images had led
   their worshippers to disconnect the symbolical conception from the
   consecrated elements, in order to avoid the necessity of identifying
   the Sacrament with the images, and of thus robbing the great mystery of
   its unique character. [711] Secondly, the practice of the Western
   Church. The divine service of the Mass was the central point of all
   Christianity, to which everything referred, and from which every saving
   influence flowed for the baptized Christian. But if the ordinary life
   of the Christian was connected with miraculous powers and mysteries, if
   miracles were in the present, and still more in the accounts of the
   past, every-day events, [712] then the sacred act effected in the
   Lord's Supper had to be developed into the wonder of wonders, lest its
   significance should be impaired by comparison with hundreds of miracles
   of a common stamp. [713] Thirdly, theology and Christology come before
   us in this connection. The greater the prominence given in the notion
   of God to the idea that God, because omnipotent, was a mysterious
   arbitrary power, and the more vague became the perception of God in
   Christ and the knowledge measured by moral holiness, the more firmly
   did men cling to the institutions of the Church as the alone manifest,
   and seek in them, i.e., in mystery and miracle, to apprehend the hidden
   God. Further, the more the historical Christ was lost in light which no
   man can approach, and the more resolutely religious speculation, in
   order to be truly pious, only saw in him the God, who had added human
   nature to his fulness (see the Adoptian controversy), the more clearly
   did men feel themselves constrained to seek Christ not in the
   historical picture or the Word, but where the mystery of his
   Incarnation and death was present and palpable. [714]

   The active influence of these combined factors undoubtedly received an
   extremely significant check in the case of Bede, and in the first
   decades of the Carlovingian age, from the rise of the study of
   Augustine, whose teaching on the Lord's Supper had been predominantly
   spiritual. Charles's theologians, or Charles himself, frequently used
   quite Augustinian language, in speaking of the Lord's Supper. But even
   in their case variations occur, [715] and towards the end of the period
   of Louis the Pious, Paschasius Radbertus was able to assert as
   doctrine, what had long been felt by the majority, that the real
   (historical) body of Christ was sacrificed in the Mass, and partaken of
   in the Lord's Supper. [716]

   Paschasius Radbertus was perhaps the most learned and able theologian,
   after Alcuin, as well versed in Greek theology as he was familiar with
   Augustinianism, a coinprehensive genius, who felt the liveliest desire
   to harmonise theory and practice, and at the same time to give due
   weight to everything that had been taught till then by Church tradition
   regarding the Lord's Supper. [717] His great work on the Lord's Supper
   was the first Church monograph on the subject. [718] It is a one-sided
   description of its contents to sum them up in the phrase: "Paschasius
   taught transubstantiation." [719] The importance of the book lies
   rather in the fact that the Lord's Supper is exhaustively discussed
   from all possible points of view, and that a certain unity is
   nevertheless attained. Paschasius did for this dogma what Origen did
   for the whole of dogmatics; he is the Origen of the Catholic doctrine
   of the Lord's Supper, which was placed by him as a theory in the
   central position that it had long held in practice. We can only
   appreciate Paschasius' teaching if we keep it in mind that Greek
   Christological mysticism, Augustinian spiritualism, and--unconsciously
   to the author himself--the practice of the Frankish Church, had an
   equal share in it. But we must also remember that the notion of God as
   inscrutable omnipotence, i.e., arbitrary power, was dominant. Without
   this conception of deity the doctrine of transubstantiation would never
   have been reached. [720]

   To begin with, Paschasius has given most vigorous expression to
   Augustinian doctrine not as something foreign to him, but as if he had
   thoroughly assimilated it. [721] The sacrament is a spiritual food for
   faith; to eat Christ's flesh means to be and remain in Christ. The rite
   is given to faith, and faith is to be roused by it. Faith, however, is
   always related to the invisible; and thus the sacrament in its deepest
   sense can only be received by the faith that has withdrawn into the
   invisible world. Christ, the soul, faith, heaven, and the sacrament are
   most intimately connected--the bodily eye must always look beyond the
   sensuous to the heavenly behind it. Therefore the meal is a meal for
   the holy, the elect. Only he who belongs to Christ and is a member in
   his body enjoys the food worthily, nay, he alone enjoys the food of
   faith actually. Unbelievers receive the sacrament, but not its virtue
   (virtus sacramenti). But even Augustine had so distinguished between
   these two notions that virtus sacramenti sometimes describes its saving
   efficacy alone, sometimes the miraculous nature of the holy food
   itself, so that in the former case the sacrament itself signifies the
   totality of the rite without its corresponding effect, and in the
   latter merely something objective incapable of further definition.
   Radbert, like Augustine, prefers the latter version. The believer alone
   receives the virtus sacramenti as food of faith and incorporation into
   Christ's body--there was no eating on the part of unbelievers
   (manducatio infidelium); Christ's flesh as contained in the sacrament
   did not exist apart from faith. The unbeliever, indeed, receives the
   sacrament--what that is is indefinable--but he does so to his
   condemnation; for without the virtus sacramenti the sacrament exists ad
   judicium damnationis. [722]

   In addition to this Augustinianism, a Greek element is very strongly
   marked in the description of the effects of the holy food; for besides
   incorporation in Christ and forgiveness of venial sins, the chief
   emphasis is laid on our soul and body being nourished by this food for
   immortality. The combination contained in the statement that this is
   effected by baptism, the Lord's Supper, and Holy Scripture (c. 1, 4),
   is Western; but the intention to which prominence is given in
   connection with the Lord's Supper alone, viz. "that even our flesh may
   be renewed by it to immortality and incorruption," [723] is Greek.
   Indeed Radbert even says conversely: "the flesh of Christ spiritually
   digested is transformed into our flesh." [724] But he now went still
   further with the Greeks--Cyril and John of Damascus. He had learned
   from them that although the rite existed for faith only, yet the
   reality of Christ's body was present. [725] This assumption was
   rendered easy, nay imperative, to the Greeks by their view that
   Christ's historical body was itself pneumatic from the moment of the
   Incarnation. Although they then (John of Damascus) completed the
   identification, and assumed a real presence of Christ's body in the
   Sacrament, they still hesitated secretly, because they did not get over
   the difficulty caused by the fact that the body once received into
   heaven did not return. Therefore they assigned the form of the miracle
   (sacramental transformation and assumption) to the "mystery." Radbert
   took up the matter here, at the same time influenced by the popular
   conception and his certainty that the practice of the Church was
   justified. For the first time in the Church he declares without
   hesitancy that the sacramental body is that which had been born of
   Mary, and that this is due to a transformation which only leaves the
   sensuous appearance unchanged. This is a miracle against nature (or
   quasi contra naturam: for nature always depends on the will of God);
   but it is to be believed for that very reason, for we only think
   worthily of God, who can do anything, when we acknowledge him to be the
   power that works miracles. What he does here is a miraculous creative
   act, effected, as always, through the word, in this case the word of
   institution, and this is spoken not by the priest, but on each occasion
   by God through the eternal Word (Christ), so that the priest only
   issues the appeal to God. This constantly repeated creation by God is
   exactly parallel to the Incarnation--Christ's word corresponds to the
   Holy Spirit, the elements to the virgin's womb; the effect is the same.
   The sacramental is the historical body, of course also historically
   transfigured; for from Cyril's standpoint the transfiguration of the
   body in the Resurrection is only the manifestation of the properties
   which it always possessed. [726] In order to explain the startling fact
   that the results of the transformation were not capable of being
   perceived by the senses, Radbert had a number of reasons ready: it was
   unnecessary and repulsive, [727] and besides it would happen often.
   [728] The most important of these was that--it was necessary the rite
   should remain a mystery given to faith alone. We are as far as possible
   from being prepared for this idea, and yet it was very important to
   Radbert. The Lord's Supper always presupposes faith and is meant to
   rouse faith, where it exists, to advance to the undisguised Christ who
   is not daily sacrificed. Hence the sacrament cannot be a manifest, but
   is always a disguised, miracle. Hence, moreover, the elements, in so
   far as they are not perceptibly transformed (colour, taste, and smell
   remaining), must be regarded as symbols of Christ's body, from which
   faith penetrates to the mysterious but really created source of
   salvation. The sensuous appearance of the consecrated elements is the
   symbol of Christ's body, their essence is the true historical body
   itself. [729]

   We readily perceive that in this phase the bridge to the Augustinian
   conception has been recovered. Paschasius intended to unite and did
   unite two positions in his doctrine of the Lord's Supper: the
   Augustinian, that the sacraments are given to faith and everything in
   them is spiritually handled, and the Greek, which also seemed to him
   commended by the letter of Scripture, the Fathers, and a few miracles,
   that we are confronted by a reality existent prior to all faith, since
   only the true body and the blood actually shed can redeem us, and since
   we need the corporeal indwelling of Christ. Both considerations seemed
   to be served by the view, that in the elements we are dealing with a
   miraculous creation of Christ's body, which is, however, effected in
   such a way that faith alone can rise from the still existent semblance
   of the mere bodily figure (figura corporis) to the apprehension of the
   heavenly reality.

   The voluminous books, afterwards written by Catholics and Lutherans on
   the Lord's Supper, prove that Radbert's theory opened up a perspective
   to hundreds of questions, which he did not solve, and, indeed, did not
   even put. His treatment of the part played by the priest at the
   sacrament seemed unsatisfactory. His brief expositions as to the
   creation of the body failed to make certain the identity of the
   heavenly and the sacramental Christ. There was still no definition of
   the relation of the unconverted to the converted object of
   sense-perception. When men began to attempt this definition, nothing
   short of the whole of philosophy necessarily passed before the mind of
   the cultured theologian. The claim of the symbolical view had to be
   determined, and thereby the sacrament, symbol, virtue, reality (res)
   and, again, the graded and yet identical bodies of Christ (the
   historical on earth, the transfigured in heaven, the sacramental on
   earth, the body as Church in heaven and on earth) had to be defined, as
   it were geologically, as intersecting boulders. "One deep called to the
   others"; and the fact that in after times the most intelligent men
   leant an ear to this clamour, and yet remained sane in other respects,
   proved that the most absurd speculations in the sphere of religion do
   not necessarily make the whole reason sick. [730]

   But the most remarkable feature in Radbert's fundamental theory is that
   he did not refer primarily to the Mass, or indeed to Christ's death on
   the Cross; in other words, he did not draw all the consequences which
   resulted from it. Radbert is not the theologian of the Catholic Mass.
   The Incarnation and Lord's Supper were for him more intimately
   connected, as it seems, than Christ's sacrificial death and the dogma
   of the Lord's Supper. From this we see that Radbert was a disciple of
   the Greeks, that he was really a theologian, and his interest did not
   centre primarily on the Church institution of penance, and the divine
   service of the Mass connected with it. [731]

   Rabanus [732] and Ratramnus alone opposed him. The opposition is as
   obscure, logically, as in the controversy about the virgin birth. As
   Ratramnus had then taught that the natural had come to pass by a
   miracle, while Radbert held that the event was contrary to nature; so
   here again Rabanus and, above all, Ratramnus taught that, while the
   external miracle (contra naturam)--the communication in the Lord's
   Supper of the body that was born, that died and rose again--did not
   take place, the true body was potentialiter (effectively) created, yet
   in mysterio, by the consecration of the Holy Spirit. [733] Ratramnus
   examines elaborately the problem that the king had set him, whether
   that which is received into his mouth by the believer, is in mystery or
   reality Christ's body. From the king's question he himself formulates
   other two: whether participation, in the cultus, in the body of Christ
   was an act in mysterio or in veritate, and whether the sacramental body
   was identical with the historical which now sits at the right hand of
   the Father. [734] To the second question he replies that that which
   lies consecrated on the altar is by no means the historical body, but
   only the mystery of the body, as also the mystery of the Church. As
   regards the historical body the consecrated elements are thus only a
   figure (figura), means of reminiscence for our present earthly life,
   since we cannot yet see what we believe. [735] But nevertheless
   believers receive Christ's body and blood in this rite; for faith does
   not receive what it sees, but what it believes, Accordingly in the
   Lord's Supper Christ's body exists in an invisbile reality for faith as
   real food of the soul. [736] The extremely obscure and at least
   seemingly contradictory statements of Ratramnus make it hard to hit on
   his meaning correctly. In any case he taught no mere figurative
   conception. We shall perhaps be most certain to do him justice if we
   observe what above all he did, and what he did not, intend. He meant
   above all to emphasise and verify the absolute necessity of faith
   throughout the rite; the sacrament belonged to faith, existed for it
   alone, etc. [737] In this he coincides entirely with Radbert, who
   shared the same interest equally strongly. But in what he would not
   allow he is distinguished to his advantage from Radbert; since
   everything is given to faith he would not recognise the common reality,
   because in view of the latter faith and disbelief are indifferent. To
   Ratramnus reality (veritas) is concrete being as it presents itself to
   the senses; for this very reason "sub figura" and "in veritate" he
   looks on as mutually exclusive opposites. Faith has its own realities,
   which are real, but only disclose themselves to faith; Ratramnus
   designates them--mistakenly--as "sub figura," because they are copied
   by sensuous realities, or, better, rest behind the latter. Radbert, on
   the other hand, believed himself compelled, precisely as an
   Augustinian, to conceive veritas as reality in general; hence to him
   "sub figura" and in veritate are not opposites, since heavenly
   realities when they appeared as earthly had in his view to manifest
   themselves sub figura. But Ratramnus was superior to Radbert as a
   Christian, in that he did not conceive the presence of the heavenly in
   the earthly to be a miracle against nature, i.e., he followed a
   different notion of God from the latter. [738] The mysteries of faith
   are not brought to pass by a continual interruption of the natural
   order, but they rest as a world administered by the Holy Spirit behind
   the phenomenal world, and what takes place in the Lord's Supper is not
   a departure, by means of a special miracle, from operations such as are
   carried out, e.g., in Baptism (c. 17, 25, 26.) In a word, Ratramnus
   would have the mystery of the Lord's Supper recognised as in harmony
   with the method by which God bestows salvation through Baptism and the
   Word, because as an Augustinian and Christian he shrank from the brutal
   miracle (the idea of God is here involved), and because he was afraid
   that otherwise nothing would be left to faith.

   It is in this that the importance of Ratramnus consists. But it is
   questionable whether the learned king for whom he wrote was any the
   wiser for his book; for not only is Ratramnus confused in his
   terminology, but also in his matter, [739] because he would not give up
   the idea that the efficacy of the sacrament was objective, whence it
   always follows that the miraculous efficacy depends not on the
   recipients, but on the means. Hence we find numerous expositions in
   which he talks like Radbert: by the ministry of the priest the bread
   becomes Christ's body, nay, it is transformed. [740] He does not
   venture to pursue consistently the parallel he seeks to establish with
   baptismal water; for the words "body and blood of Christ" are too
   strong for him. It is sinful to deny that the consecrated elements are
   Christ's body. [741] Thus the difference between Radbert and Ratramnus
   can be reduced to the following formula. The former openly and
   deliberately transferred the spiritual teaching of Augustinianism into
   the realistic conception, and gave clear expression to the belief of
   the Church. The latter attempted to maintain complete spiritualism in
   the interests of a loftier notion of God and of faith, but he was not
   in a position to carry this out absolutely, because he himself was far
   too much under the influence of the formula. Therefore he only speaks
   clearly where he is disowning the miracle. [742] The future belonged to
   Radbert; [743] nay, Ratramnus' book, it would seem, did not even excite
   attention, but afterwards met with the most curious history down to the
   present day. [744]

   The doctrine expressed by Radbert, a Pandora's casket of problems to
   future scholars, was extremely intelligible to the simple. Nothing can
   guarantee the success of a dogma more fully than the possession of
   these two qualities. It received its application, above all, in the
   Mass. The thought of the repeated sacrificial death of Christ, long
   since conceived, was now as firmly established as that of the repeated
   assumption of the flesh. What could now approach the Mass? There was no
   need to alter the ancient wording of missal prayers, which still, when
   they dealt with the sacrifice, emphasised the sacrifice of praise; for
   who attended to words? The Mass as a sacrificial rite, in which the
   holiest thing conceivable was presented to God, had, however, ceased
   long ago to end in participation, but found its climax in the act that
   expiated sin and removed evil. It was received into the great
   institution that conferred atonement. On this a few further remarks are
   necessary, although no dogmatic conflicts arose.

   The frequent repetition of the Mass (in one and the same Church), and
   its simple celebration (without communion), show that this rite was not
   intended so much for the congregation as for God: God was to be
   appeased. The ancient element of commemoration on the part of the
   celebrants had, especially since the days of Gregory I., been made an
   independent service, and the communion had been, as it were, changed
   into a second celebration. [745] The practice, according to which the
   laity looked on while the priests partook, the laity taking merely a
   passive part--the rite being consummated on their behalf--while the
   priests performed the ceremony, corresponded to the prevailing view,
   especially among German peoples, that laymen were second-class
   Christians, and that partaking in the Lord's Supper was for them
   associated with grave dangers. The holy rite belonged to the laity, so
   far as it represented a form of the Church's intercession peculiarly
   effective for the mitigation of sin's penalties.

   The Mass was thereby included in the Church's atoning institute; but
   for laymen the Church had long been essentially a baptismal
   institution, and an establishment for the reconciliation necessary
   after baptism. In order to understand this, and the immense extent and
   value acquired by the practice of Confession in the West, we have to
   observe the following points.

   1. The prevailing notion of God was that of omnipotent absolutism,
   requital and remission. It was in these conceptions that God was a
   present and really living God, and they directed the thought and
   practice of trained theologians and laymen. The hidden God was manifest
   in the fact that he suffered no sin to be unatoned; but he was merciful
   because he granted remissions (through the mediation of heavenly
   persons and the Church) a fact which, indeed, did not contravene the
   general rule that everything must be expiated or punished. This notion
   of God was already complete when the Church entered into the national
   life of Germany. It is accordingly not to be regarded as a German
   modification, but as a conception in harmony with and rising from the
   unrefined religious consciousness, and especially the Latin spirit.
   Cyprian and Gregory I. attest this. But as this conception of God could
   easily combine with German ideas of justice, it was also well adapted
   to train uncivilised peoples. It had long been settled on purely Latin
   soil that no sin committed after Baptism could be simply forgiven, but
   that due penitence (pænitentia legitima), or fitting satisfaction
   (satisfactio congrua) formed the necessary condition of remission. In
   keeping with the strict regard for law and sense of duty, which
   distinguished the Latin Church more than the Greek, ecclesiastical
   methods paid more heed to the sins of Church members in general. And in
   accordance with the conviction that sins represented breaches of
   contract or outrages, of greater or less gravity, the Church had been
   working at the codification of pænitentia legitima, or the definition
   of the measure of satisfaction, since the second half of the third
   century. All this took place without German influence.

   2. This system had originally been elaborated with a view to public
   penance, in presence of the congregation, for the sake of
   reconciliation, and thus referred to open and gross sins, for which as
   a rule only a single act of penance was possible. It therefore suffered
   a severe blow when all society became Christian, and magistrates, being
   themselves Christians, punished these gross offences of different
   kinds, even such as the State had not formerly dealt with. The whole
   ancient institution of penance collapsed in the East. It came almost
   entirely to an end in the West also in its old form, in so far as the
   list of public sins, punished by the Church alone, was always growing
   smaller. [746] But in the German kingdoms, where the Church had not
   sunk to the level of an institution for worship in the State, and had
   not entirely abandoned higher religion to the monks, where, on the
   contrary, it long went hand in hand with the State as a Latin
   institution with its old Roman law, and trained the nations as a
   universal power, it did not renounce its penance regulations, which
   besides suited the German spirit. But a change was necessary in this
   case also, a change in which German dislike to public humiliations had
   perhaps as great a share as fear of purgatory and the tendency of the
   Church to establish throughout the regulations of its monkish castes,
   in other words, to monachise the secular clergy, and finally also the
   laity. From this there sprang a deepening of the notion of sin, since
   new sins, namely, the "roots of sin" themselves were put in the place
   of the old mortal sins, [747] but there also resulted an externalising
   of the notion, as "satisfactions," which are more tolerable in the case
   of great overt offences, were now also applied to these "roots"
   (intemperance, fornication, greed, anger, ill-temper, secret fear and
   dislike, presumption and pride).

   But, above all, this was followed by the intrusion of the Church into
   all affairs of private life. What had been the rule in primitive times,
   namely, the subjection of the private life of the individual to the
   control of the Church, returned in an entirely new form. But then it
   was a congregation of brethren which lived together like a family, and
   in which each was the conscience of the other; now one institution and
   one class ruled the irresponsible community; and while the latter was
   restrained, indeed, from extremes, yet, since no one was really capable
   of properly controlling the life of the individual, consciences were
   sophisticated by incentives and sedatives, by a frequently over-refined
   morality (legislation as to fasting and marriage), and by extremely
   external directions as to satisfaction. The transition to the new
   practice resulted in the laity themselves demanding the intercession of
   the Church, the reading of the Mass, invocations of the saints, etc.,
   to an increasing extent, since preachers had always been telling them
   that they were a sinful people, incapable of coming near God, [748]
   that the priests held the keys, and that the Church's intercession was
   the most effective. But the gradual settlement of monachist practice in
   the world-Church alone explains the facts that actual confession of all
   sins to the priest, and the imposition of all sorts of satisfactions,
   [749] for the hundred and one offences in life and conduct, in a word,
   that private penance in the presence of the priest, became the rule.
   This state of matters began in the Iro-Scottish Church, which was in an
   eminent degree monachist. There penitential regulations--meaning
   private penance--were, so far as we know, first drawn up for the laity,
   who were directed to confess their sins to the priest, as the monks had
   long been enjoined to do in their cloisters. From Ireland, books
   dealing with penance came to the Anglo-Saxons (Theodore of Canterbury),
   to the Franks and Rome; they did not establish this footing without
   opposition, and after they had become a settled institution, they very
   soon gave offence again, since their directions became more and more
   external and questionable. To the practice of private penance which
   thus arose is to be ascribed the new conception of sin, and the new
   attitude to it, which now became the ruling one in the West, namely,
   the facile and deadening readiness with which every one confessed
   himself to be a mortal sinner. What was more tolerable in the ranks of
   the monks, nay, was in many cases the expression of a really sensitive
   conscience--I mean the readiness at once to confess oneself a sinner,
   and to make a less and less distinction between sins and
   sins--threatened when transferred to the masses to become a worthless
   practice, because one that blunted the moral sense. Men sinned, and
   coolly confessed wholesale to a host of sins, lest they might miss the
   miraculous help of the Church, for some one or other actually
   committed. If the men of those days had not been so simple, this system
   would even then have made them thorough hypocrites. But as it was, it
   worked more like an external system of law--a police institution, which
   punished wantonness and barbarianism, outbreaks of wild energy and
   passion. This was not the intention, but it was its actual import, so
   far as a certain salutary effect cannot be denied it.

   3. The institution was already certain in its operations, and made
   great strides especially in the later Carlovingian period, since the
   complete separation of the clergy and laity, which had been obliterated
   in the Merovingian age, was only then made once more complete, and
   measures began at the same time to be taken to make monks of the
   former. Nevertheless the dogmatic theory was still entirely awanting.
   It was not settled that the priest alone could forgive sins--it was
   still conceded that trifling sins could be expiated without the priest,
   by means of prayer and alms. Nor were the value and result of priestly
   forgiveness fixed: was it declaratory or deprecatory? Nor had it been
   stated to be absolutely necessary to confess all sins to the priest.
   [750] And finally no fixed definitions had been deduced from the matter
   itself of mortal and venial sins, or of the treatment of public and
   private offences. It was only long afterwards that all these points
   were decided. We see clearly here that ecclesiastical practice does not
   wait for dogmatic, indeed, that it does not really need it, as long as
   it goes with the great stream. The Church possessed a sacrament of
   penance with all its subtleties for many centuries, during which
   dogmatic knew of no such thing, but span a finer thread.

   4. This is not the place to give the interesting history of the growth
   of satisfactions. Let us, however, notice four points. (1) The old,
   more or less arbitrary, definitions dealing with the selection
   (prayers, alms, lamentations, temporary exclusion), and duration of
   compensatory punishments were supplemented to an increasing extent by
   new ones (pilgrimages), as well as by definitions taken from the Old
   Testament law and German legal ordinances. Charlemagne took a great
   stride in advance with reference to dependence on the Old Testament.
   But this led to the computation of compensatory penalties being itself
   looked at in the light of a divine dispensation, and definitions not
   taken from the Old Testament were also regarded from the same
   standpoint. (2) The performance of penance was a means of compensation,
   so far as--if no sin had preceded it--it would have established merit
   in the sight of God, or would have bestowed something upon him. (It was
   accordingly not merely a substitution for punishment, but also a
   positive property in the sight of God, and therefore a compensation for
   injury.) Accordingly the whole institution was included under the
   conception of merit, from of old connected with works and alms
   (operibus et eleemosynis). But if the performance of penance was after
   all the presentation of something valuable (sacrifice) to God,
   something which gave him pleasure, and that for its own sake, it became
   more effective if as many and as good persons as possible took part in
   it. If a saint helped by his intercession, then God could not really
   resist; for there was nothing to be made good by the saint, and
   therefore his offering was a pure present to God. This dreadful idea
   that the mighty Judge in Heaven could demand nothing more of the
   saints, while they were able to bestow much upon him, makes it evident
   that the system of intercessions necessarily played the most important
   rôle in the system of penance. The conception of Christ taken by faith,
   that he represents men in the Father's presence, was perverted in the
   saddest way, and he was dragged into this system; and since nothing was
   too lofty or precious to be included as investments in this petty
   calculation, the repeated sacrificial death of Christ was itself the
   most important instalment. Masses were the surest protection against
   sins' penalties in purgatory, because in them Christ himself was
   presented to the Father, and the infinite value [751] of his Passion
   was anew brought before him, in other words, the merit of that Passion
   was multiplied. Hence the accumulation of a treasury of masses was the
   best "palliative" against the fire, or the most reliable means of
   abridging it.

   (3) Since performances of penance [752] --the penitent disposition was
   always presupposed in theory--had an objective value to God, and were
   at the same time in part equivalents, they could be bartered. Not only,
   however, could like be bartered for like, but a less valuable act could
   be taken as full payment, if circumstances rendered a complete
   discharge difficult, or if it was supplemented by the intercession of
   others, or if the slighter performance sufficiently displayed the
   penitent mood. It had been the custom in earlier times to shorten the
   duration and diminish the number of penances imposed by the Church
   after the penitent had proved his sincerity. This was appropriate
   enough, for the purpose was to effect reconciliation with the
   community; but it was now applied to the penitent's relation to God. It
   was at the same time remembered that the strict Judge was also
   merciful, i.e., indulgent. Thus arose the system of remissions, i.e.,
   of commutations and redemptions, or of substitutions. The latter
   originated in German conceptions, but they had a latent root even in
   ancient times. Commutations and redemptions are first met with in any
   number in the eighth and ninth centuries. "Weregeld" or blood-money is
   found sanctioned then; but they already follow from the ancient system,
   and had certainly been practised in the cloisters long before the
   Carlovingian age. Therewith, however, indulgences were created, as
   soon, namely, as the possibility of commutation was admitted and
   legally fixed, independently of the special circumstances of the
   individual case. These commutations, which were only established
   against opposition, completely externalised the whole system. Above
   all, they interested the Church financially, and made it, already the
   great landed proprietor, into a banking establishment. How poor was the
   Greek Church, with its scanty trade in relics, pictures, and lights,
   compared with her rich sister, who drew bills on every soul!

   (4) The whole system of merits and satisfactions had really no
   reference to sins, but only to their punishment. But since everything
   ultimately served this system, men were trained to evade sins'
   penalties as well, securely, and cheaply as possible. The element which
   seemingly mitigated the dangers of this whole view--namely, that sin
   itself was left out of sight, since it must be forgiven by God who
   excites penitence and faith--necessarily resulted in the case of the
   multitude in their paying little or no attention to sin, and in their
   thinking only of punishment. Even if they finally entered the cloister,
   or gave their goods to the poor, they did so, not because they loved
   God, but because they wished to escape his punishments. Punishment
   ruled the world and the consciences for whose possession good and evil
   angels contend.

   It would not have been necessary to discuss this practice within the
   limits of the history of dogma if it had not had a very active
   influence on dogma in the succeeding period. It had wound itself round
   Augustinianism from the beginning, and had prevented it from obtaining
   complete sway in the Church; it influenced Christology even in the time
   of Gregory I., and then in the classic period of the Middle Ages it
   acted decisively upon and remodelled all the dogmas that had come down
   from antiquity. [753]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [711] On the development of the mysteries and Lord's Supper in the
   Greek Church, see Vol. IV. p. 268. John of Damascus (De fide orth. IV.
   13), declared expressly: ouk esti tupos ho artos tou somatos all' auto
   to soma tou kuriou tetheomenon. After the Synod of 754 (Mansi, XIII.,
   p. 261 sq.), had called the consecrated elements types and images, the
   second Nicene Synod of 787 (l.c. p. 265) expressly declared that they
   were not that, since neither the Apostles nor Fathers had so named
   them; by consecration they rather became auto soma kai auto aima. Yet
   Transubstantiation, taken strictly in the Western sense, was admittedly
   never taught by the Greeks.

   [712] See Reuter, I., pp. 24 ff. 41 ff.

   [713] In order to perceive that the Lord's Supper needed a special
   prominence to be given to it, notice the view taken by Hinkmar of
   ordeals, on which Augustine, indeed, had already laid great stress
   (Schrörs, p. 190 ff.); he regarded them, namely, as sacraments
   instituted in Scripture, and placed them on a level with the baptismal
   ceremonies. Hinkmar was not alone in the value he attached to the oath
   of purgation and divine judgments (see Rozière, Recueil général des
   formules, Paris, 1859, n. DLXXXI.-DCXXV.; on p. 70, the ceremony is
   described as christianæ religionis officium), but Agobard, who opposed
   them, stood almost alone; see Reuter, I., p. 32 ff.

   [714] The controversies de partu virginis (Bach, I., p. 152 ff.; see
   Ratramnus, Liber de eo, quod Christus ex virgine natus est; Radbertus,
   Opusculum de partu virginis, d'Achery, Spicil. I. p. 52, 44), show
   still better than the Adoptian controversy, the kind of Christology
   that was honoured by the religion of the community and monks. Ratramnus
   described as the poison of the old serpent the fact that some Germans
   denied that Christ had issued from Mary's womb in the natural way, for
   thus the reality of Christ's birth was destroyed, although he also
   acknowledged Mary's perpetual virginity and taught the partus clauso
   utero: "clausa patuit dominanti." Radbert on the other hand, without
   answering Ratramnus, consoled some nuns, who had been unsettled by the
   alleged denial of Mary's virginity, by saying that the Church held
   firmly to the "clauso utero"; for if Christ had come to the light in
   the natural way, he would have been like an ordinary man; everything
   connected with the incarnation, however, was miraculous. He who did not
   admit Christ to have been born clauso utero, set him under the common
   law of nature, i.e. sinful nature, and in that case Christ was not free
   of sin. The difference between the two scholars thus consisted solely
   in the fact that while Ratramnus maintained the natural process of
   birth to have taken place miraculously clauso utero, Radbert taught
   that the birth was a supernatural process, and that Christ had left his
   mother in a different way from other children. Radbert here also is the
   more consistent; Ratramnus seeks to unite natural and supernatural.
   Radbert, at least, in imparting his curious instruction to the virgins
   of the cloister, does not display the pruriency of Jerome, who is the
   father of these gynæcological fancies, and the nuns may have taken this
   question very seriously, as seriously as Marcion and Augustine, because
   they recognised all that was sexual to be the hearth of sin. To later
   scholasticism is clue the credit of having explained the partus clause
   utero scientifically from the ubiquity of Christ's body. Such
   miraculous conceptions having been diffused as to the body of the
   historical Christ, it being held, in a word, to be already pneumatic in
   itself, it was by that very reason sacramental (mysterious). But, in
   that case, it was impossible not to take the next step, and finally and
   completely identify the real with that sacramental (mysterious) body
   that was offered in the Lord's Supper. The lines drawn from the
   incarnation dogma and the Lord's Supper necessarily converged in the
   end. That this did not happen earlier was due, apart from the material
   hindrance presented by Augustine with his sober conceptions of the
   historical Christ as a real homo, to formal difficulties caused by the
   traditional idiom (the sacramental body is figura corporis Christi).
   These had to be removed. Bach remarks very justly (I. p. 156): "The
   cause of present day misunderstandings of the ancient controversies
   regarding the Lord's Supper, consists in mistaking the law that governs
   the formation of language, and that also applies to theological idiom.
   We refer here to the gradual change of meaning of theological words,
   even when they have become, as regards their outward verbal form, fixed
   categories, i.e. termini technici." The admission here frankly made by
   the Catholic historian of dogma is, we know, not always granted by
   Lutheran theologians. We have indeed had to listen, in the controversy
   of our own days, to the wonderful cry that we ought to restore to words
   their original meaning. As if any one still possessed the old die!

   [715] Bede's teaching was thoroughly Augustinian. ("In redemptionis
   memoriam," "corporis sanguinisque sacramentum," "ad corpus Christi
   mystice refertur," "spiritualiter intellegite," "non hoc corpus, quod
   videtis--Christus inquit--manducaturi estis, sacramentum aliquod vobis
   commendavi, spiritualiter intellectum vivificabit vos," "lavat nos a
   peccatis nostris quotidie in sanguine suo, cum beatæ passionis ad
   altare memoria replicatur, cum panis et vini creatura in sacramentum
   carnis et sanguinis ejus ineffabili spiritus sanctificatione
   transfertur"); passages in Münter (D.-Gesch. II., 1 [1834] p. 223 f.).
   But we then see how the conception changed step by step until the
   middle of the ninth century. Alcuin repeats his teacher's principles;
   but both his opposition to the Council of A.D. 754 (De impio imag.
   cultu IV. 14: "non sanguinis et corporis dominici mysterium imago jam
   nunc dicendum est, sed veritas, non umbra, sed corpus"), and in part
   his study of Greek Christology and adoption of sentiments expressed in
   the Church practice led him to make statements like the following (Ep.
   36): "profer nomen amici tui eo tempore opportuno, quo panem et vinum
   in substantiam corporis et sanguinis Christi consecraveris." Münter
   justly remarks (l.c.) that this is not yet synonymous with "in
   substantiam corporis convertere;" but it approaches it. The general
   notion of the Sacrament is completely identical in the cases of
   Isidore, Rabanus Maurus, Ratramnus, and Paschasius Radbertus, and so
   entirely follows Augustine in its construction that we are not prepared
   by it for the strictly realistic version in the doctrine of the Lord's
   Supper.

   [716] See Radberti Lib. de corp. et sang. domini (831), new edition,
   with an Ep. ad Carolum, thirteen years later (Migne, CXX., p. 1267).

   detailed account of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper from Paschasius
   to Berengar is given by Schnitzer, Berengar von Tours (1890), pp.
   127-245.

   [717] Radbert's work, De fide, spe et caritate is also important,
   because it shows greater power to grasp religious doctrine as a whole
   than we expect at this date.

   [718] So far as I know, no inquiry has yet been undertaken as to the
   homily, De corpore et sanguine Christi, which is found in Jerome's
   works (Migne, T. XXX., Col. 271 ff.), being ascribed by tradition to
   Eusebius of Emesa, and of which a copy is also given among the works of
   Faustus of Riez. In it occurs the sentence: "Visibilis sacerdos
   visibiles creaturas in substantiam corporis et sanguinis sui verbo suo
   secreta potestate convertit." The homily belongs to a whole group, on
   which consult Caspari, Briefe, Abhandlungen and Predigten (1890), p.
   418 ff. (see above, p. 254).

   [719] Choisy seeks to show that Paschasius was the father of the
   Catholic dogma even to the manducatio infidelium, and that the
   spiritual form of the dogma of the Lord's Supper is in his case only
   apparent, since ultimately everything is dominated by crass realism.

   [720] Compare Radbert's extremely characteristic introduction to his
   treatise: he discusses the almighty will of God as ground of all
   natural events. God's arbitrary power is the ultimate cause; therefore
   his actions can be described as contrary to nature as well as natural
   (the latter, because even the regular course of things is subject to
   divine absolutism). The new dogma is explicitly based on this
   conception of God. Notoriously everything can be deduced from it,
   predestination, accommodation, transubstantiation, etc. Radbert holds
   the Lord's Supper to be the miracle of miracles, towards which all
   others point; see 1, 5.

   [721] Radbert expressly attacks the Capernaite coarse conception of
   participation in the Lord's Supper; he declines to adopt the crudely
   sensuous ideas diffused in the widest circles (Bach, I. 167 ff.); see
   De corp. et sang. 8, 2. Expos. in Mat. 1. XII., 26. Reality in its
   common sense is "natura" in Radbert's view; but he never says that the
   elements are naturaliter transformed. Therefore also Christ's body is
   not digested.

   [722] See esp. ch. VIII., but also 5-7, 14, 21. This spiritual
   conception, on which Steitz (1.c.) has rightly laid great stress, runs
   through the whole book. But when Radbert positively calls the body
   present in the Lord's Supper a corpus spiritale, he does not mean this
   in contrast with the natural, but the lower bodily nature (caro humana)
   confined to space. C. 21, 5: "Non nisi electorum cibus est." 6, 2:
   "Quid est, quod manducant homines? Ecce omnes indifferenter quam sæpe
   sacramenta altaris percipiunt. Percipiunt plane, sed alius carnem
   Christi spiritaliter manducat et sanguinem bibit, alius vero non,
   quamvis buccellam de manu sacerdotis videatur percipere. Et quid
   accipit, cum una sit consecratio, si corpus et sang. Chr. non accipit?
   Vere, quia reus indigne accipit, judicium sibi manducat."

   [723] "Ut etiam caro nostra per hoc ad immortalitatem et incorruptionem
   reparetur."

   [724] "Carni nostræ caro Christi spiritaliter conviscerata
   transformatur." See c. 11 and 19, 1: "Non sicut quidam volunt anima
   sola hoc mysterio pascitur, quia non sola redimitur morte Christi et
   salvatur, verum etiam et caro nostra, etc. etc.; "nos per hoc in
   incorruptionem transformamur" (therefore as in Justin); the same
   thought already in I. 4, 6.

   [725] "Spiritale" and "verum" are thus not mutually exclusive.

   [726] C. 1, 2: "Nullus moveatur de hoc corpore Christi et sanguine,
   quod in mysterio vera sit caro et verus sit sanguis, dum sic voluit
   ille qui creavit: omnia enim quæcumque voluit fecit in cælo et in
   terra, et quia voluit, licet in figura panis et vini, hæc sic esse,
   omnino nihil aliud quam caro Christi et sanguis post consecrationem
   credenda sunt. Unde ipsa veritas ad discipulos: Hæc, inquit, caro mea
   est pro mundi vita, et ut mirabilius loquar, non alia plane quam quæ
   nata est de Maria et passa in cruce et resurrexit de sepulcro." Further
   7, 2: "corpus quod natum est de Maria virgine . . . resurrexit a
   mortuis, penetravit coelos et nunc pontifex factus in æternum quotidie
   interpellat pro nobis." 12, I: "ubi catholica fide hoc mysterium
   celebratur, nihil a bono majus nihilque a malo minus percipi sacerdote,
   nihilque aliud quam caro Christi et sanguis dum catholice consecratur,
   quia non in merito consecrantis sed in verbo efficitur creatoris et
   virtute spiritus s., ut caro Chr. et sanguis, non alia quam quæ de
   spiritu s. creata est, vera fide credatur et spiritali intellegentia
   degustetur . . . Christi est qui per s. s. hanc suam efficit carnem."
   Cf. 15, 1: "non æstimandum est, quod alterius verbis, quod ullius
   alterius meritis, quod potestate alicujus ista fiunt, sed verbo
   creatoris, quo cuncta creata sunt." 8, 2: "substantia panis et vini in
   Christi carnem et sanguinem efficaciter interius commutatur." 2, 2:
   "sensibilis res intellegibiliter virtute dei per verbum Christi in
   carnem ipsius divinitus transfertur."

   [727] See c. 10 and 13, and esp. 4, 1: "quia Christum vorari fas
   dentibus non est, voluit in mysterio hunc panem et vinum vere carnem
   suam et sanguinem consecratione spiritus s. potentialiter (i.e.
   efficaciter) creari, creando vero quotidie pro mundi vita mystice
   immolari."

   [728] See c. 14; besides Bach I., p. 168 ff. A lamb, or real blood, or
   the Christ-child appeared.

   [729] On this point Radbert speaks like Ratramnus; see 1, 5: "visu
   corporeo et gustu propterea non demutantur, quatenus fides exerceatur
   ad justitiam." 13, 1, 2, "quod colorem aut saporem carnis minime
   præbet, virtus tamen fidei et intellegentiæ, quæ nihil de Christo
   dubitat, totum illud spiritaliter sapit et degustat . . . Sic debuit
   hoc mysterium temperari, ut et arcana secretorum celarentur infidis et
   meritum cresceret de virtute fidei et nihil deesset interius vere
   credentibus promissæ veritatis." Nay the disguise incites to loftier
   aspiration (as with the Greeks): "insuper et quod majus est per hæc
   secretius præstita ad illam tenderent speciem satietatis ubi jam non
   pro peccatis nostris quotidie Christus immolabitur, sed satietate
   manifestationis ejus sine ulla corruptione omnes sine fine fruemur."
   (One imagines that he is listening to Origen or Gregory of Nyssa.) On
   figura and veritas, see 4, 1: ". . . ut sicut de virgine per spiritum
   vera caro sine coitu creatur, ita per eundem ex substantia panis ac
   vini mystice idem Christi corpus et sanguis consecretur . . . figura
   videtur esse cum frangitur, dum in specie visibili aliud intelligitur
   quam quod visu carnis et gustu sentitur. Veritas appellatur, dum corpus
   Christi et sanguis virtute spiritus in verbo ipsius ex panis vinique
   substantia efficitur."

   [730] The doctrine of the real conversion of the elements in the West
   is to be regarded as an importation from the East, and is closely
   connected with the anti-Adoptian version of Cliristology. But it was
   first in the West that the legal mind and dialectics cast themselves on
   this subject, and produced a complicated and never to be completed
   doctrine of endless extent.

   [731] Not primarily; for undoubtedly he more than once in his work
   thinks of the Mass, and draws the inference of the daily sacrifice of
   Christ's body pro peccatis; see 13, 2; 4, 1, etc.

   [732] Ep. ad Eigil. Migne, CXII., p. 1510.

   [733] Ratramnus and Rabanus are nearer each other than is currently
   supposed; but Bach (I. p. 191 ff.) is wrong, when, after the precedent
   of other Catholics, he tries by an interpretation of Ratramnus' use of
   language to make him a genuine Catholic. Ratramnus also holds that a
   miracle takes place, but not the miracle that magically produces the
   body worn by Christ as a person.

   [734] See the opening of the work.

   [735] Following on a reference to Ambrose, he writes (c. 75 sq.): "De
   carne Christi quæ crucifixa et sepulta est, ait, Vera utique caro
   Christi est.' At de illo quod sumitur in sacramento dicit, Veræ carnis
   illius sacramentum est,' distinguens sacramentum carnis a veritate
   carnis. Veritas carnis quam sumpsit de virgine; quod vero nunc agitur
   in ecclesia mysterium, veræ illius carnis . . . sacramentum . . . non
   est specie caro, sed sacramentum, siquidem in specie panis est, in
   sacramento vero verum Christi corpus . . . (elementa) secundum quod
   spiritualiter vitæ substantiam subministrant corpus et sanguis Christi
   sunt. Illud vero corpus, in quo semel passus est Christus, non aliam
   speciem præferebat quam in qua consistebat; hoc enim erat vere quod
   esse videbatur; . . . at nunc sanguis Christi quem credentes ebibunt et
   corpus quod comedunt, aliud sunt in specie et aliud in significatione,
   aliud quod pascunt corpus esca corporea et aliud quod saginant mentes
   æternæ vita substantia . . . aliud igitur est, quod exterius geritur,
   aliud item quod per fidem capitur; ad sensum corporis quod pertinet,
   corruptibile (Radbert also said this) est, quod fides vero capit
   incorruptible. Exterius igitur quod apparet non est res sed imago rei,
   mente vero quod sentitur et intelligitur, veritas rei." Even to the
   last sentence a Radbertian meaning can be given; but this ceases to be
   possible where Ratramnus--as often happens--designates the whole rite
   (and it is the rite with which he is generally concerned) as "figura,"
   in "figuram sive memoriam dominicæ mortis," "repræsentatio memoriæ
   dominicæ passionis," and, further, as "pignus" (see c. 10, 11, 16:
   "figurate facta"; c. 88: "corpus et sanguis quod in ecclesia geritur,
   differt ab illo corpore et sanguine quod in Christi corpore jam
   glorificatum cognoscitur; et hoc corpus pignus est et species, illud
   vero ipsa veritas. Hoc enim geretur, donec ad illud perveniatur; ubi
   vero ad illud perventum fuerit hoc removebitur." Reconciliation with
   Radbert is absolutely impossible where Ratramnus strictly disowns the
   "permutatio corporalis," and reduces everything to a memorial meal; c.
   12: "et quomodo jam Christi corpus dicitur, in quo nulla permutatio
   facta cognoscitur?" c. 15: "dicant, secundum quod permutata sunt;
   corporaliter namque nihil in eis cernitur esse permutatum." Catholics
   excuse him here by saying that he meant to deny "conversion" into a
   crassly realistic body, "Fatebuntur igitur necesse est aut mutata esse
   secundum aliud quam secundum corpus, ac per hoc non esse hoc quod in
   veritate videntur, sed aliud quod non esse secundum propriam essentiam
   cernuntur. Aut si hoc profiteri noluerint, negare corpus esse sanguinem
   Christi, quod nefas est non solum dicere verum etiam cogitare." c. 100:
   "iste panis et sanguis qui super altare ponuntur, in figuram sive
   memoriam dominicæ mortis ponuntur, et quod gestum est in præterito,
   præsenti revocet (dominus) memoriæ, ut illius passionis memores
   effecti, per eam efficiamur divini muneris consortes."

   [736] C. 101: "Fides non quod oculus videt sed quod credit accipit,
   quoniam spiritualis est esca et spiritualis potus, spiritualiter animam
   pascens et æternæ satietatis vitam tribuens, sicut ipse salvator
   mysterium hoc commendans loquitur: spiritus est qui vivificat." C. 49:
   "Christ's true body is distributed in the Lord's Supper according to
   its invisibilis substantia, and that because the invisibilis substantia
   is like the potentia divini verbi. Many similar passages elsewhere."

   [737] C. 11: "Nam si secundum quosdam figurate hic nihil accipitur, sed
   totum in veritate conspicitur, nihil hic fides operatur, quoniam nihil
   spiritale geritur . . . nec jam mysterium erit, in quo nihil secreti,
   nihil abditi continebitur."

   [738] Ratramnus always thinks of the God who excites and nourishes
   faith.

   [739] The difference between Paschasius and Ratramnus is really very
   subtle if we confine our attention to the question of the reality of
   Christ's body (and the transformation); but it is not quite so subtle
   as is represented by Schnitzer (l.c., 167-194). It was, besides, long
   before Ratramnus' work was held to be heretical.

   [740] C. 16, a commutatio is taught, "sed non corporaliter sed
   spiritualiter facta est . . . spiritualiter sub velamento corporei
   panis . . . corpus et sanguis Christi existunt."

   [741] See C. 15.

   [742] Ratramnus has the elements of Zwingli and Calvin's doctrines.
   Besides, in relation to the invisible substance, he assumes the
   identity of the eucharistic and historical body, or, at any rate, will
   not give it up.

   [743] In connection with Matt. XXVI. 26, he defended himself skilfully
   against Ratramnus, whom, for the rest, he does not name.

   [744] Bach, I., p. 191 ff.

   [745] Walafried Strabo was the first to justify expressly the
   celebration of the Lord's Supper without communicants, and therefore
   Masses (Migne, T. 114, col. 943 ff).

   [746] When the State punished, e.g., in cases of murder and theft, the
   ecclesiastical consequences followed without further trial.

   [747] This was also effected in the Greek Church through the action of
   the monks.

   [748] See the view taken of the laity in the forged fragments of the
   pseudo-Isidorian decretals.

   [749] Among these, pilgrimages of a year's duration played a great
   part, a fact that shows the monks' contempt of family life and civic
   occupations; for these were severely affected by pilgrimages.

   [750] I adhere to these statements, in spite of Karl Müller's arguments
   in his treatise "Der Umschwung in der Lehre von der Busse während des
   12 Jahrh." (Abhandl. für Weizäcker, 1892, p. 287 ff.) If I am not
   mistaken, Müller has been misled by Morinus, and has looked at the
   state of penance and confession, at the close of ancient and the
   beginning of mediæval Church history, too much from the standpoint of
   the modern Roman conception; he has at least presupposed too great a
   uniformity of theoretical ideas--if one may speak of such. I cannot
   accept the blunt assertion on p. 292, that down to the twelfth century
   the priest's absolution was always regarded as simply identical with
   divine forgiveness, and therefore as indispensable. There was no
   doctrine proper on this question for centuries, but almost only a
   practice. As soon as the doctrine is again introduced, doubts also
   arise, to be once more gradually allayed.

   [751] In the fourth ch. of the Synod of Chiersey, 853, it is called
   "pretii copiositas mysterii passionis;" that is also an anticipation of
   Anselm's theory of satisfaction.

   [752] The peregrinationes also belong to them. That indulgences rest
   quite essentially on the custom of pilgrimages and their commutation is
   shown by Götz, Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch., vol. XV., p. 329 ff.

   [753] On the history of penance, see Steitz, Das römische
   Busssacrament, 1854; Wasserschleben, Bussordnungen d. Abendl. Kirche,
   1851; v. Zerschwitz Beichte, in Herzog's R.-E. II., p. 220 ff., System
   der Katechetik I., p. 483 ff., II. 1, p. 208. ff.; Göbl, Gesch. der
   Katachese in Abendland, 1880. Further, on the history of the ordinances
   of penance, Wasserschleben, Die irische Kanonensammlung, 2 ed., 1855;
   and Schmitz, Die Bussbücher and die Bussdisciplin der Kirche, 1883. On
   the latter's attempt to refer the regulations of penance to Rome, see
   Theol. Lit.-Ztg., 1883, col. 614 ff. On the development of the
   separation of clergy and laity in the 9th century, and the beginning of
   the monachising of the clergy, see Hatch, "Growth of Christian
   Institutions," Chap. IX. On divine service and discipline in the
   Carlovingian age, see Gieseler II., 1 (1846) pp. 152-170; on the
   constitution of German law-courts, feuds, and penance, outlawry and
   death of the victim, see Brunner, Deutsche Rechtsgesch. I., pp. 143
   ff., 156 ff., 166 ff.; on the principle of personality and the amount
   of blood-money and penances, l.c., p. 261 ff.; on the personal rights
   of the clergy, p. 269 f.; and on the rise of written law, p. 282 ff. If
   we review the state of the development of German law in the age of the
   Merovingians, and compare it with the ecclesiastical discipline of
   penance, as it was independently evolved on Latin ground until Gregory
   I., we are astonished at the ease with which these systems could be and
   actually were dovetailed into each other. The Roman law received by the
   Church underwent great modifications within its pale caused by the
   conceptions of the Communio of the Church militant with the saints, of
   satisfactions, merits, and the claim of the Church to remit sins. Above
   all, the Church's right to punish, which had originally accepted the
   Roman thought of the public character of crimes, and had treated them
   accordingly, became more and more a private right. That is,
   transgressions against God were regarded as injuries done to God--not
   the violation of public order and the holy, inviolable divine law; and
   accordingly the idea arose, and got more and more scope, that they were
   to be treated, as it were, like private complaints. In such cases the
   alternative, either punishment or satisfaction (compensation), was
   appropriate. But as regards satisfactions, all the liberties were
   necessarily introduced that are inherent in that conception, namely,
   that the injured party himself, or the Church as his representative,
   could indulgently lessen their amount, or could commute or transfer
   them, etc. It is obvious how easily this view could fuse with the
   German one. One or two examples are sufficient. German law held the
   principle: either outlawry or penance. This corresponds to the Church
   principle: either excommunication or the performance of satisfactory
   acts of penance. According to German law, vengeance did not require to
   be executed on the evil-doer himself, but might he on a member of his
   clan; nay, it was held in Norway to be a more severe vengeance to
   strike the best man of the clan instead of the murderer. The Church
   looked on Christians as forming a "clan" with the saints in heaven, and
   the performance of penance could to a certain extent, or entirely, be
   passed on to the latter; Christ had, above all, borne beforehand by his
   death God's vengeance on the ill-doing race of his brethren. German law
   held, similarly, that the compensation, the payment of the fine, could
   be divided. According to the practice of the Church, the saints
   interceded if prayed to, and presented their merits to God, taking from
   the sinner a part of the penance imposed upon him. Afterwards the
   Church positively adopted the German institution, and let earthly
   friends, comrades, members of the family, and bondmen share in the
   performance of penance in order to lighten the task. In one respect,
   however, the action of the Church had a softening and beneficial
   effect. It restricted to an extraordinary extent the capital
   punishments closely connected with outlawry. They were objectionable in
   themselves, and doubly so where they were regarded, on the ground of a
   primitive priestly law of punishment, as a human sacrifice offered to
   the gods (Brunner, pp. 173-177). Even in the Roman period the Church in
   Gaul exerted itself to soften the Roman administration of justice where
   the latter admitted capital punishment. It continued its efforts with
   success in the Merovingian age, so that arrangements were more and more
   frequently made in substitution for the death penalty. The chief
   argument urged by the Church was doubtless that God did not will the
   death of the sinner, and that Christ died an atoning and sacrificial
   death for all. Thus Christ's death obtained an extraordinary
   importance. It became the grand achievement, whose value even softened
   the earthly right of punishment.

     * Cum libros Confessionum ediderim ante quam Pelagiana hæresis
       exstitisset, in eis certe dixi deo nostro et sæpe dixi: Da quod
       jubes et jube quod vis. Quæ mea verba Pelagius Romæ, cum a quodam
       fratre et episcopo meo fuissent eo præsente commemorata, ferre non
       potuit et contradicens aliquanto commotius pæne cum eo qui
       commemoraverat litigavit.: [150]1
     * Cum propterea credere jubeamur, quia id quod credere jubemur,
       videre non possumus, ipsam tamen fidem, quando inest in nobis,

     * De Afris quod propria lege sua utuntur, ut rebaptizent, placuit, ut
       si ad ecclesiam aliquis de hæresi venerit, interrogent eum
       symbolum; et si perviderint eum in patre et filio et spiritu sancto
       esse baptizatum, manus ei tantum imponatur ut accipiat spiritum
       sanctum. Quod si interrogatus non responderit hanc trinitatem,
       baptizetur.: [153]1
     * De carne Christi quæ crucifixa et sepulta est, ait, Vera utique
       caro Christi est.' At de illo quod sumitur in sacramento dicit,
       Veræ carnis illius sacramentum est,' distinguens sacramentum carnis
       a veritate carnis. Veritas carnis quam sumpsit de virgine; quod
       vero nunc agitur in ecclesia mysterium, veræ illius carnis . . .
       sacramentum . . . non est specie caro, sed sacramentum, siquidem in
       specie panis est, in sacramento vero verum Christi corpus . . .

     * Deus hominem sine peccato rectum cum libero arbitrio condidit et in
       paradiso posuit, quem in sanctitate justitiæ permanere voluit. Homo
       libero arbitrio male utens peccavit et cecidit, et factus est massa
       perditionis totius humani generis. Deus autem bonus et justus
       elegit ex eadem massa perditionis secundum præscientiam suam, quos
       per gratiam prædestinavit ad vitam, et vitam illis prædestinavit
       æternam. Ceteros autem, quos justitiæ judicio in massa perditionis
       reliquit, perituros præscivit, sed non ut perirent prædestinavit,
       poenam autem illis, quia justus est, prædestinavit æternam. Ac per
       hoc unam: [161]1
     * Deus naturam nostram id est animam rationalem carnemque hominis
       Christi suscepit, susceptione singulariter mirabili vel mirabiliter
       singulari, ut nullis justitiæ suæ præcedentibus meritis filius dei
       sic esset ab initio quo esse homo coepisset, ut ipse et verbum,
       quod sine initio est, una persona esset.: [162]1
     * Deus omnes homines sine exceptione vult salvos fieri, licet non
       omnes salventur. Quod autem quidem salvantur, salvantis est donum;
       quod autem quidem pereunt, pereuntium est meritum.: [163]1
     * Deus ostendens quid magis velit, minorem voluntatem majore delevit.
       Quantoque notitiæ tuæ utrumque proposuit, tanto definiit, id te
       sectari debere quod declaravit se magis velle. Ergo si ideo
       declaravit, ut id secteris quod magis vult, sine dubio, nisi ita
       facis, contra voluntatem ejus sapis, sapiendo contra potiorem ejus
       voluntatem, magisque offendis quam promereris, quod vult quidem
       faciendo et quod mavult respuendo. Ex parte delinquis; ex parte, si
       non delinquis, non tamen promereris. Non porro et promereri nolle
       delinquere est? Secundum igitur matrimonium, si est ex illa dei

       regna subjecit.: [172]1
     * Dominus noster, sicut ipse in evangelio loquitur, leni jugo suo nos
       subdidit et sarcinæ levi; unde sacramentis numero paucissimis,
       observatione facillimis, significatione præstantissimis societatem

     * Dona sua coronat deus non merita tua . . . si ergo dei dona sunt

     * Electi sunt ante mundi constitutionem ea prædestinatione, in qua
       deus sua futura facta præscivit; electi sunt autem de mundo ea
       vocatione, qua deus id, quod prædestinavit, implevit. Quos enim
       prædestinavit, ipsos et vocavit, illa scilicet vocatione secundum
       propositum, non ergo alios sed quos prædestinavit ipsos et vocavit:

     * Eo quod quisque novit non fruitur, nisi et id diligat . . . neque

     * Est Christiani hominis, quod bonum est velle et in eo quod bene
       voluerit, currere; sed homini non est datum perficere, ut post
       spatia, quæ debet homo implere, restet aliquid deo, ubi deficienti
       succurrat, quia ipse solus est perfectio et perfectus solus dei
       filius Christus, cæteri omnes semi-perfecti: [182]1
     * Est etiam præclarissimum lumen prædestinationis et gratiæ ipse
       salvator, ipse mediator dei et hominum homo Christus Jesus, qui ut
       hoc esset, quibus tandem suis vel operum vel fidei præcedentibus
       meritis natura humana quæ in illo est comparavit? . . .
       Singulariter nostra natura in Jesu nullis suis præcedentibus
       meritis accepit admiranda (scil: [183]1
     * Et apparuit mihi una facies eloquiorum castorum. Et coepi et inveni
       quidquid illac verum legeram, hac cum commendatione gratiæ tuæ
       dici: [184]1
     * Et ea quæ dicuntur merita nostra, dona sunt eius: [185]1
     * Et in hac vita virtus non est nisi diligere quod diligendum est;
       faciunt boni amores bonos mores.: [186]1
     * Et pervenit cogitatio ad id quod est, in ictu trepidantis aspectus:
       [187]1
     * Et quoniam (Christianus) quamdin est in isto mortali corpore,
       peregrinatur a domino, ambulat per fidem non per speciem; ac per
       hoc omnem pacem vel corporis vel animæ vel simul corporis et animæ
       refert ad illam pacem, quæ homini mortali est cum immortali deo, ut
       ei sit ordinata in fide sub æterna lege oboedientia. Jam vero quia
       duo præcipua præcepta, hoc est dilectionem dei et dilectionem
       proximi, docet magister deus . . . consequens est, ut etiam proximo
       ad diligendum deum consulat, quem jubetur sicut se ipsum diligere
       (sic uxori, sic filiis, sic domesticis, sic ceteris quibus potuerit
       hominibus), et ad hoc sibi a proximo, si forte indiget, consuli
       velit; ac per hoc erit pacatus, quantum in ipso est, omni homini
       pace hominum, id est ordinata concordia cujus hic ordo est, prinmm
       ut nulli noceat, deinde ut etiam prosit cui potuerit. Primitus ergo
       inest ei suorum cura; ad eos quippe habet opportuniorem
       facilioremque aditum consulendi, vel naturæ ordine vel ipsius
       societatis humanæ. Unde apostolus dicit: Quisquis autem suis et
       maxime domesticis non providet, fidem denegat et est infideli
       deterior.' Hinc itaque etiam pax domestica oritur, id est ordinati
       imperandi oboediendique concordia cohabitantium. Imperaut enim, qui
       consulunt: sicut vir uxori, parentes finis, domini servis. . . .
       Sed in domo justi viventes ex fide et adhuc ab illa cælesti
       civitate peregrinantis etiam qui imperant serviunt eis, quibus
       videntur imperare. Neque enim dominandi cupiditate imperant, sed
       officio consulendi, nec principandi superbia, sed providendi
       misericordia.: [188]1
     * Et sumus et nos esse novimus et id esse ac nosse diligimus.: [189]1

     * Eucharistia panis noster quotidianus est; sed sic accipiamus illum,
       ut non solum ventre sed et mente reficiamur. Virtus enim ipsa, quæ
       ibi intelligitur, unitas est, ut redacti in corpus ejus, effecti
       membra ejus, simus quod accipimus.: [192]1
     * Eum, qui post baptismum peccaverit, per pænitentiam credimus posse
       salvari: [193]1
     * Ex persona beatissimi Petri forma unitatis retinendæ vel faciendæ
       descripta recitatur: [194]1
     * Ex utroque fit, id est, ex voluntate hominis et misericordia dei.:
       [195]1
     * Excepta itaque s. virgine Maria, de qua propter honorem domini
       nullam prorsus, cum de peccatis agitur, haberi volo quæstionem;
       unde enim scimus, quid ei plus gratiæ collatum fuerit ad vincendum
       omni ex parte peccatum, quæ concipere et parere meruit, quem
       constat nullum habuisse peccatum? hac ergo virgine excepta si omnes
       illos sanctos et sanctas, cum hic viverent, congregare possimus et
       interrogare, utrum essent sine peccato, quid fuisse responsuros
       putamus, utrum hoc quod ista dicit an quod Johannes apostolus?:
       [196]1
     * Fatebuntur igitur necesse est aut mutata esse secundum aliud quam
       secundum corpus, ac per hoc non esse hoc quod in veritate videntur,
       sed aliud quod non esse secundum propriam essentiam cernuntur. Aut
       si hoc profiteri noluerint, negare corpus esse sanguinem Christi,
       quod nefas est non solum dicere verum etiam cogitare.: [197]1

     * Fide, spe, caritate colendum deum: [199]1
     * Fides impetrat quod lex imperat.: [200]1
     * Fides non habet meritum, cui humana ratio præbet experimentum:
       [201]1
     * Fides non quod oculus videt sed quod credit accipit, quoniam
       spiritualis est esca et spiritualis potus, spiritualiter animam
       pascens et æternæ satietatis vitam tribuens, sicut ipse salvator
       mysterium hoc commendans loquitur: spiritus est qui vivificat.:
       [202]1
     * Foris ab ecclesia constitutus et separatus a compagine unitatis et

       liberantur.: [209]1
     * Hæc omnia Paulus viderat in apostolis ceteris, qui bono unitas per
       caritatem noluerunt a communione Petri recedere, ejus scil. qui
       negaverat Christum. Quod si major esset amor innocentiæ quam
       utilitas pacis unitatis, dicerent se non debere communicare Petro,
       qui negaverat magistrum.: [210]1
     * Hæreat hoc maxime prudentis animo lectoris, omnibus scripturis
       sacris solum illud, quod in honorem dei catholici sapiunt,
       contineri, sicut frequentium sententiarum luce illustratur, et
       sicubi durior elocutio moverit quæstionem, certum quidem esse, non
       ibi id quod injustum est loci illius auctorum sapuisse; secundum id
       autem debere intelligi, quod et ratio perspicua: [211]1
     * Hæresis Pelagiana multum nos, ut gratiam dei quæ per dominum
       nostrum Jesum Christum est, adversus eam defenderemus, exercuit.:
       [212]1
     * Hae sunt nebulæ Pelagianorum de laude creaturæ, laude nuptiarum,
       laude legis, laude liberi arbitrii, laude sanctorum: [213]1
     * Hi qui de nullo suo opere confidunt, ad sanctorum martyrum
       protectionem currunt atque ad sacra eorum corpora fletibus
       insistunt, promereri se veniam iis intercedentibus deprecantur.:
       [214]1
     * Hic omnino granditer et evidenter dei gratia commendatur. Quid enim
       natura humana in homine Christi meruit ut in unitatem personæ unici
       filii dei singulariter esset assumpta! Quæ bona voluntas, cujus
       boni propositi studium, quæ bona opera præcesserunt, quibus
       mereretur iste homo una fieri persona cum deo? Numquid antea fuit
       homo, et hoc ei singulare beneficium præstitum est, cum
       singulariter promereretur deum? Nempe ex quo homo esse coepit, non
       aliud coepit esse homo quam dei filius: et hoc unicus, et propter
       deum verbum, quod illo suscepto caro factum est, utique deus. . . .
       Unde naturæ humanæ tanta gloria, nullis præcedentibus meritis sine
       dubitatione gratuita, nisi quia magna hic et sola dei gratia
       fideliter et sobrie considerantibus evidenter ostenditur, ut
       intellegant homines per eandem gratiam se justifcari a peccatis,
       per quam factum est ut homo Christus nullum habere posset
       peccatum.: [215]1
     * Hinc post peccatum exul effectus stirpem quoque suam, quam peccando
       in se tamquam in radice vitiaverat, poena mortis et damnationis
       obstrinxit, ut quidquid prolis ex illo et simul damnata per quam
       peccaverat conjuge per carnalem concupiscentiam, in qua
       inobedientiæ poena similis [so far as the flesh here is not
       obedient to the will, but acts of itself] retributa est,

       tam excellentem scripturæ per omnes jam terras auctoritatem, nisi
       et per ipsam tibi credi et per ipsam te quæri voluisses. Jam enim
       absurditatem quæ me in illis litteris solebat offendere, cum multa

     * Malos in unitate catholica vel non noverunt, vel pro unitate
       tolerant quos noverunt.: [253]1
     * Malum est contra interdictum aliquid facere; sed pejus est,
       unitatem non habere, cum possis . . . : [254]1
     * Malum si substantia esset, bonum esset. Aut enim esset
       incorruptibilis substantia, magnum utique bonum; aut substantia
       corruptibilis esset, quæ nisi bona esset, corrumpi non posset.:
       [255]1
     * Manifestum est, fieri posse, ut in eis qui sunt ex parte diaboli
       sanctum sit sacramentum Christi, non ad salutem, sed ad judicium
       eorum . . . signa nostri imperatoris in eis cognoscimus . . .
       desertores sunt.: [256]1
     * Manifestum itaque est, in Adam omnes peccasse quasi in massa; ipse
       enim per peccatum corruptus, quos genuit, omnes, nati sunt sub
       peccato. Ex eo igitur cuncti peccatores, quia ex eo ipso sumus
       omnes.: [257]1
     * Mihi adhærere deo bonum est: [258]1
     * Minorem immortalitatem (i.e.: [259]1
     * Mitissima poena: [260]1
     * Multa præterea quæ de ultimo judicio ita dici videntur, ut
       diligenter considerata reperiantur ambigua vel magis ad aliud
       pertinentia, sive scilicet ad eum salva oris adventum, quo per
       totum hoc tempus in ecclesia sua venit, hoc est in membris suis,
       particulatim atque paulatim, quoniam tota corpus est ejus: [261]1
     * Multo liberius erit arbitrium, quod omnino non poterit servire
       peccato.: [262]1
     * Nam de naturæ possibilitate, de libero arbitrio, et de omni dei
       gratia et quotidiana gratia cui non sit recte sentienti uberrimum
       disputare?: [263]1
     * Nam in illa (catholica) ecclesia quis spiritus esse potest, nisi
       qui pariat filios gehennæ?: [264]1
     * Nam si secundum quosdam figurate hic nihil accipitur, sed totum in
       veritate conspicitur, nihil hic fides operatur, quoniam nihil
       spiritale geritur . . . nec jam mysterium erit, in quo nihil
       secreti, nihil abditi continebitur: [265]1
     * Nascitur credens non ex ministri sterilitate, sed ex veritatis
       foecunditate.: [266]1
     * Naturalia per accidens non convertuntur." "Quod innascitur usque ad
       finem ejus, cui adhæserit, perseverat.: [267]1
     * Natus Christus insinuat nobis gratiam dei, qua homo nullis
       præcedentibus meritis in ipso exordio naturæ suæ quo esse coepit,
       verbo deo copularetur in tantam personæ unitatem, ut idem ipse
       esset filius dei qui filius hominis, etc.: [268]1
     * Ne quis putaret, in solis apostolis aut episcopis spem suam esse
       ponendam, sic Paulus ait: Quid est enim Paulus vel quid Apollo?
       Utique ministri ejus, in quem credidistis. Est ergo in universis
       servientibus non dominium sed ministerium.: [269]1
     * Nec illud mihi placet, quod in ista vita deo intellecto jam beatam
       esse animam (in Soliloquiis) dixi, nisi forte spe: [270]1
     * Nec mulier petiit, nec Christus promisit, sed fides tantum quantum
       præsumpsit, exegit.: [271]1
     * Nec quidquam bene regenerat, nisi bono semine (boni sacerdotis)
       regeneretur.: [272]1
     * Nemo igitur quærat efficientem causam malæ voluntatis; non enim est
       efficiens sed deficiens (that is, the aspiration after nothing,
       after the annulling of life, constitutes the content of the bad
       will), quia nec illa effectio sed defectio. Deficere namque ab eo,
       quod summe est, ad id, quod minus est, hoc est incipere habere
       voluntatem malam. Causas porro defectionum istarum, cum efficientes
       non sint, ut dixi, sed deficientes, velle invenire tale est, ac si
       quisquam velit videre tenebras vel audire silentium, quod tamen
       utrumque nobis notum est, neque illud nisi per oculos, neque hoc
       nisi per aures, non sane in specie, sed in speciei privatione. Nemo
       ergo ex me scire quærat, quod me nescire scio, nisi forte, ut
       nescire discat, quod scire non posse sciendum est. Ea quippe quæ
       non in specie, sed in ejus privatione sciuntur, si dici aut
       intellegi potest quodammodo nesciendo sciuntur, ut sciendo
       nesciantur.: [273]1
     * Nemo sibi arroget, nemo de meritis, nemo de potestate se jactet,
       sed omnes speremus per dominum Jesum misericordiam invenire--quæ
       enim spes alia peccatoribus?: [274]1
     * Neque de ipsis criminibus quamlibet magnis remittendis in sancta
       ecclesia dei misericordia desperanda est agentibus pænitentiam
       secundum modum sui cujusque peccati.: [275]1
     * Neque per ipsum liberaremur unum mediatorem dei et hominum hominem
       Jesum Christum, nisi esset et deus. Sed cum factus est Adam homo,
       scil. rectus, mediatore non opus erat. Cum vero genus humanum
       peccata longe separaverunt a deo,: [276]1
     * Nihil aliud habeo quam voluntatem; nihil aliud scio nisi fluxa et
       caduca spernenda esse, certa et æterna requirenda . . . si fide te
       inveniunt, qui ad te refugiunt, fidem da, si virtute, virtutem, si
       scientia, scientiam. Auge in me fidem, auge spem, auge caritatem.:
       [277]1
     * Nihil aliud nisi similitudo mortis Christi; nihil autem aliud
       mortem Christi crucifixi nisi remissionis peccati similitudinem, ut
       quemadmodum in illo vera mors facta est, sic in nobis vera remissio
       peccatorum.: [278]1
     * Nihil potest per sanctas scripturas probari, quod justitia non
       possit tueri.: [279]1
     * Nisi per indebitam misericordiam nemo liberatur et nisi per debitum
       judicium nemo damnatur.: [280]1
     * Nomen trinitatis est, quod sanctificat, non opus (operantis).:
       [281]1
     * Non agitur de uno Pelagio, qui jam forte correctus est.: [282]1
     * Non autem existimo quemquam ita desipere, ut credat ad ecclesiæ
       pertinere unitatem eum qui non habet caritatem. Sicut ergo deus
       unus colitur ignoranter etiam extra ecclesiam nec ideo non est
       ipse, et fides una habetur sine caritate etiam extra ecclesiam, nec
       ideo non est ipse, ita et unus baptismus, etc.: [283]1
     * Non credere potest quodlibet libero arbitrio, si nulla sit suasio
       vel vocatio cui credat; profecto et ipsum velle credere deus
       operatur in homine et in omnibus misericordia ejus prævenit nos:
       consentire autem vocationi dei vel ab ea dissentire propriæ
       voluntatis est.: [284]1
     * Non est regnum dei esca et potus: [285]1
     * Non nisi electorum cibus est.: [286]1
     * Non omnia nostra Christus explevit, per crucem quidem suam omnes
       redemit, sed remansit, ut qui redimi et regnare cum eo nititur,
       crucifigatur. Hoc profecto residuum viderat, qui dicebat: si
       compatimur et conregnabimus. Quasi dicat: Quod explevit Christus,
       non valet nisi ei, qui id quod remansit adimplet: [287]1
     * Non respublica est in ecclesia, sed ecclesia in republica est, id
       est in imperio Romano.: [288]1
     * Non rivulum nostrum tuo largo fonti augendo refundimus.: [289]1
     * Non sicut quidam volunt anima sola hoc mysterio pascitur, quia non
       sola redimitur morte Christi et salvatur, verum etiam et caro
       nostra, etc. etc.: [290]1
     * Nos autem dicimus humanam voluntatem sic divinitus adjuvari ad
       faciendam justitiam, ut præter quod creatus est homo cum libero
       arbitrio voluntatis, præterque doctrinam qua ei præcipitur
       quemadmodum vivere debeat, accipiat spiritum sanctum, quo fiat in
       animo ejus delectatio dilectioque summi illius atque incommutabilis
       boni quod deus est, etiam nunc cum adhuc per fidem ambulatur,
       nondum per speciem: ut hac sibi velut arra data gratuiti muneris
       inardescat inhærere creatori atque inflammetur accedere ad
       participationem illius veri luminis, ut ex illo ei bene sit, a quo
       habet ut sit. Nam neque liberum arbitrium quidquam nisi ad
       peccandum valet, si lateat veritatis via, et cum id quod agendum et
       quo nitendum est coeperit non latere, nisi etiam delectet et
       ametur, non agitur, non suscipitur, non bene vivitur. Ut autem
       diligatur, caritas dei diffunditur in cordibus nostris, non per
       arbitrium liberum quod surgit ex nobis, sed per spiritum sanctum
       qui datus est nobis.: [291]1
     * Nos minus amasset, nisi et vulnera nostra susciperet: [292]1
     * Nos pro nostris angustiis unum inculcamus, bonum atque optimum esse
       quod deus præcipit. Audaciam existimo de bono divini præcepti
       disputare. Neque enim quia bonum est, idcirco auscultare debemus,
       sed quia deus præcepit. Ad exhibitionem obsequii prior est majestas
       divinæ potestatis, prior est auctoritas imperantis quam utilitas
       servientis.: [293]1
     * Novitas vocum in adoptione, nuncupatione, omnino fidelibus omnibus
       detestanda est.: [294]1
     * Nullus moveatur de hoc corpore Christi et sanguine, quod in
       mysterio vera sit caro et verus: [295]1
     * Numerus ille justorum, qui secundum propositum vocati sunt, ipse
       est (ecclesia). . . . Sunt etiam quidam ex eo numero qui adhuc
       nequiter vivant aut etiam in hæresibus vel in gentilium
       superstitionibus jaceant, et tamen etiam illic novit dominus qui
       sunt ejus. Namque in illa ineffabili præscientia dei multi qui
       foris videntur, intus sunt, et multi, qui intus videntur, foris
       sunt.: [296]1
     * Numquid: [297]1
     * Numquid nihil est veritas, quoniam neque per finita, neque per
       infinita locorum spatia diffusa est.: [298]1
     * Nunc quoniam propria voce anathematizavit Pelagius incertum
       stultiloquium, recte respondens, hominem cum adjutorio dei et
       gratia posse esse sine peccato, respondeat et ad alia capitula.:
       [299]1
     * Nunc quoniam satisfactum est nobis prosecutionibus præsentis
       Pelagii monachi, qui quidem piis doctrinis consentit, contraria
       vero ecclesiæ fidei anathematizat, communionis ecclesiasticæ eum
       esse et catholicæ confitemur.: [300]1
     * Obedientia: [301]1
     * Obsequii ratio in similitudine animorum constituta est.: [302]1
     * Omne bonum ac malum, quo vel laudabiles vel vituperabiles sumus,
       non nobiscum oritur, sed agitur a nobis: capaces enim utriusque
       rei, non pleni: [303]1
     * Omnes quotquot fuerunt sancti, ad ipsam ecclesiam pertinent.:
       [304]1
     * Omnes res origine et radice consistit, et si caput non habet
       aliquid, nihil est.: [305]1
     * Oves dominicum characterem a fallacibus deprædatoribus foris
       adeptæ.: [306]1
     * Parva erat pro nobis domini nostri humilitas in nascendo; accessit
       etiam ut mori pro mortalibus dignaretur.: [307]1
     * Pater . . . filius . . . ne mater quidam ecclesia præteritur. Si
       quidem in filio et patre mater recognoscitur, de qua constat et
       patris et filii nomen.: [308]1
     * Pax cælestis civitatis ordinatissima et concordissima societas
       fruendi deo et invicem in deo.: [309]1
     * Peccata nostra præterita in baptismatis perceptione laxata sunt, et
       tamen post baptisma multa commisimus, sed laxari iterum baptismatis
       aqua non possumus. Quia ergo et post baptisma inquinavimus vitam,
       baptizemus lacrimis conscientiam.: [310]1
     * Peccata, quæ male agendo postea committuntur, possunt et pænitendo
       sanari, sicut etiam post baptismum fieri videmus: [311]1
     * Pelagii nomen cum magna ejus laude cognovi.: [312]1
     * Pelagius et Cælestius hujus perversitatis auctores vel perhibentur
       vel etiam probantur, vel certe si auctores non sunt, sed hoc ab
       aliis didicerunt, assertores tamen atque doctores: [313]1
     * Pensandum est, quod tutior: [314]1
     * Per Christum factus est alter mundus.: [315]1
     * Per eleemosynas de peccatis præteritis est propitiandus deus, non
       ad hoc emendus quodam modo, ut peccata semper liceat impune
       committere.: [316]1
     * Per remissionem peccatorum stat ecclesia quæ est in terris.: [317]1
     * Per sacra eloquia dono spiritus vivificamur, ut mortifera a nobis
       opera repellamus; spiritus vadit, cum legentis animum diversis
       modis et ordinibus tangit deus.: [318]1
     * Per se ipsum considerandus est baptismus verbis evangelicis, non
       adjuncta neque permixta ulla perversitate atque malitia sive
       accipientium sive tradentium . . . non cogitandum, quis det sed
       quid det.: [319]1

     * Perfecta justitia: [321]1
     * Petrus, apostolorum caput, coeli janitor, ecclesiæ fundamentum:
       [322]1
     * Plus facimus quam in lege et evangelis jussum est--gratiam dei et
       adjutorium non ad singulos actus dari, sed in libero arbitrio esse,
       vel in lege ac doctrina--dei gratiam secundum merita nostra dari,
       quia si peccatoribus illam dat, videtur esse iniquus--si gratia dei
       est, quando vincimus peccata, ergo ipse est in culpa, quando a
       peccato vincimur, quia omnino custodire nos aut non potuit aut
       noluit--unumquemque hominem omnes virtutes posse habere et
       gratias--filios dei non posse vocari nisi omni modo absque peccato
       fuerint effecti--oblivionem et ignorantiam non subjacere peccato,
       quoniam non secundum voluntatem eveniunt, sed secundum
       necessitatem--non esse liberum arbitrium, si dei indigeat auxilio,
       quoniam in propria voluntate habet unusquisque aut facere aliquid
       aut non facere--victoriam nostram non ex dei esse adjutorio, sed ex
       libero arbitrio--si anima non potest esse sine peccato, ergo et
       deus subjacet peccato, cujus pars, hoc est anima: [323]1
     * Prædestinatio ad mortem: [324]1
     * Prædicat Christus Christum.: [325]1
     * Præscivit deus hominem ad poenam.: [326]1
     * Primum oportet noveris diem natalem domini non in sacramento
       celebrari, sed tantum in memoriam revocari quod natus sit, ac per
       hoc nihil opus erat, nisi revolutum anni diem, quo ipsa res acta
       est, festa devotione signari. Sacramentum est autem in aliqua
       celebratione, cum rei gestæ commemoratio ita fit, ut aliquid etiam
       signfcari intelligatur, quod sancte accipiendum est: [327]1
     * Pro Augustino responsiones ad capitula objectionum Gallorum
       calumniantium (against the Gallican monks); Responsiones pro
       Augustino ad excerpta quæ de Genuensi civitate sunt missa: [328]1
     * Professio fidei (to Leontius) contra eos, qui dum per solam dei
       voluntatem alios dicunt ad vitam attrahi, alios in mortem deprimi,
       hinc fatum cum gentilibus asserunt, inde liberum arbitrium cum
       Manichæis negant.: [329]1
     * Propter singularitatem personæ, in qua divinitas filii dei cum
       hurnanitate sua communes habeat actiones, qua ex causa aliquando ea
       quæ divina sunt referuntur ad humana, et ea quæ humana fiunt
       interdum adscribuntur ad divina, et hoc ordine aliquando dei filius
       in hominis filio filius hominis appellari dignatur et hominis
       filius in dei filio filius dei nuncupatur: [330]1
     * Punici: [331]1
     * Quæ autem domus dei et ipsa civitas? Domus enim dei populus dei,
       quia domus dei templum dei . . . omnes fideles, quæ est domus dei,
       cum angelis faciunt unam civitatem. Habet custodes. Christus
       custodiebat, custos erat. Et episcopi hoc faciunt: [332]1
     * Quæ potest esse perversitas ut qui suis criminibus reus est, alium
       faciat innocentem?: [333]1
     * Quæ tu si non didicisses, Pelagiani dogmatis machina sine
       architecto necessario remansisset.: [334]1
     * Quæritis necessitatem rei quæ esse non potest si patitur
       necessitatem. Huic motui animi libero, sine coactu originis
       inquieto, si causa ipso motu detur antiquior, non gignitur omnino
       sed tollitur.: [335]1
     * Qua gratia homo Jesus ab initio factus est bonus, eadem gratia
       homines qui sunt membra ejus ex malis fiunt boni.: [336]1
     * Quam porro ineptum, quam pænitentiam non adimplere, ei veniam
       delictorum sustinere? Hoc est pretium non exhibere, ad mercem manum
       emittere: [337]1
     * Quantum ad totius mundi pertinet partes, modica pars est in
       compensatione totius mundi, in qua fides Christiana nominatur.:
       [338]1
     * Quasi vero ex hoc generet unde separata est, et non ex hoc unde
       conjuncta est. Separata est enim a vinculo caritatis et pacio, sed
       juncta est in uno baptismate. Itaque est una ecclesia, quæ sola
       Catholica nominatur: [339]1
     * Quem vero judicem poteris Ambrosio reperire meliorem? De quo
       magister tuus Pelagius ait, quod ejus fidem et purissimum in
       scripturis sensum ne inimicus quidem ausus est reprehendere.:
       [340]1
     * Quemadmodum si fiat ordinatio cleri ad plebem congregandam, etiamsi
       plebis congregatio non subsequatur, manet tamen in illis ordinatis
       sacramentum ordinationis, et si aliqua culpa quisquam ab officio
       removeatur, sacramento domini semel imposito non carebit, quamvis
       ad judicium permanente: [341]1
     * Qui fidem a perfido sumpserit non fidem percipit, sed reatum.:
       [342]1
     * Qui gratiam confirmat, hominum laudat naturam.: [343]1
     * Qui in invidia intus et malevolentia sine caritate vivunt, verum
       baptisma possunt et accipere et tradere. (Sed) salus, inquit
       Cyprianus, extra ecclesiam non est. Quis negat? Et ideo quæcumque
       ipsius ecclesiæ habentur, extra ecclesiam non valent ad salutem.
       Sed aliud est non habere, aliud non utiliter habere: [344]1
     * Qui vero in ecclesia remitti peccata non credens contemnit tantam
       divini muneris largitatem et in hac obstinatione mentis diem
       claudit extremum, reus est illo irremissibili peccato in spiritum
       sanctum.: [345]1
     * Qui vult ergo salvus esse, ita de trinitate sentiat.: [346]1
     * Quia corpus ille catholicum ad omnem hominem habuit, omne quod
       passus est catholicum fecit; id est ut omnis caro in ipso crucifixa
       sit: [347]1
     * Quia intra Catholicam constitutos plures audivi destruere nec non
       et alios adstruere.: [348]1
     * Quia naturalia ab initio substantiæ usque ad terminum illius
       perseverant.: [349]1
     * Quia unum verbum dei est, per quod facta sunt omnia, quod est
       incommutabilis veritas, ibi principaliter atque incommutabiliter
       sunt omnia simul, et omnia vita sunt et omnia unum sunt.: [350]1
     * Quicunque natus est sub peccato, quem ipsa nosciæ conditionis
       hæreditas adstrinxit ad culpam.: [351]1
     * Quid aliud istis restat nisi ut ipsum regnum cælorum ad hanc
       temporalem vitam, in qua nunc sumus, asserant pertinere? Cur enim
       non et in hanc insaniam progrediatur cæca præsumptio? Et quid hac
       assertione furiosius? Nam etsi regnum cælorum aliquando ecclesia
       etiam quæ hoc tempore est appellatur ad hoc utique sic appellatur,
       quia futuræ vitæ sempiternæque colligitur.: [352]1
     * Quid animam faciet beatam, nisi meritum suum et præmium domini sui?
       Sed et meritum ejus gratia est illius, cujus, præmium erit
       beatitudo ejus.: [353]1
     * Quid enim prodest ecclesiæ dei Christum appellare adoptivum filium
       vel deum nuncupativum?: [354]1
     * Quid est gratia? peccati remissio, i.e.: [355]1
     * Quid est, quod manducant homines? Ecce omnes indifferenter quam
       sæpe sacramenta altaris percipiunt. Percipiunt plane, sed alius
       carnem Christi spiritaliter manducat et sanguinem bibit, alius vero
       non, quamvis buccellam de manu sacerdotis videatur percipere. Et
       quid accipit, cum una sit consecratio: [356]1
     * Quid habes, quod non accepisti.: [357]1
     * Quid intelligimus carnis sensum et carnis vitam nisi quodcunque
       pudet pronuntiare?: [358]1
     * Quid inter Pelagium et Cælestium in hac quæstione distabit, nisi
       quod ille apertior, iste occultior fuit; ille pertinacior, iste
       mendacior, vel certe ille liberior, hic astutior.: [359]1
     * Quid opus est, ut eorum scrutemur opuscula, qui prius quam ista
       hæresis (Pelagianorum) oriretur, non habuerunt necessitatem in hac
       difficili ad solvendum quæstione versari? quod procul dubio
       facerent, si respondere talibus cogerentur. Unde factum est, ut de
       gratia dei quid sentirent, breviter quibusdam scriptorum suorum
       locis et transeunter adtingerent, immorarentur vero in eis, quæ
       adversus inimicos ecclesiæ disputabant, et in exhortationibus ad
       quasque virtutes, quibus deo vivo et vero pro adipiscenda vita
       æterna et vera felicitate servitur. Frequentationibus autem
       orationum simpliciter apparebat dei gratia quid valeret; non enim
       poscerentur de deo quæ præcipit fieri, nisi ab illo donaretur ut
       fierent.: [360]1
     * Quid primum, quid ultimum, teneatur, quæ totius definitionis summa
       sit, quod certum propriumque fidei catholicæ fundamentum.: [361]1
     * Quid tam necessarium fuit ad erigendam spem nostram, quam ut
       demonstraretur nobis, quanti nos penderet deus quantumque
       diligeret: [362]1
     * Quis alienam mortem sua solvit nisi solus dei filius.: [363]1
     * Quisquis tibi enumerat vera merita sua, quid tibi enumerat nisi
       munera tua.: [364]1
     * Quod ais, ad colendum recte deum sine ipsius adjutorio dici a nobis
       sufficere unicuique libertatem arbitrii, omnino mentiris. Cum
       igitur cultus dei multis intelligatur modis, et in custodia
       mandatorum et in execratione vitiorum et in simplicitate
       conversationis et in ordine mysteriorum et in profunditate dogmatum
       . . . qui fieri potest, ut nos in confuso dicamus, sine adjutorio
       dei liberum arbitrium sufficiens ad ejus esse culturam . . . cunt
       utique ista omnia, tam quæ dogmatibus quam quæ mysteriis
       continentur, libertas arbitrii per se non potuerit invenire: [365]1
     * Quod bellum gravius et amarius cogitari potest, quam ubi voluntas
       sic adversa est passioni et passio voluntati, ut nullius earum
       victoria tales inimicitiæ finiantur, et ubi sic confligit cum ipsa
       natura corporis vis doloris, ut neutrum alteri cedat? Hic [in
       terra] enim quando contingit iste conflictus, aut dolor vincit et
       sensum mors adimit, aut natura vincit et dolorem sanitas tollit.
       Ibi autem et dolor permanet ut affligat, et natura perdurat ut
       sentiat; quia utrumque ideo non deficit, ne poena deficiat.: [366]1
     * Quod homini proficit, deo servit.: [367]1
     * Quod operum lex minando imperat, hoc fidei Iex credendo impetrat.
       Ipsa est illa sapientia quæ pietas vocatur, qua colitur pater
       luminum, a quo est omne datum optimum et omne donum
       perfectum. . . . Lege operum dicit deus: Fac quod jubeo; lege fidei
       dicitur deo: Da quod jubes. . . . Non spiritum hujus mundi
       accepimus, ait constantissimus gratiæ prædicator, sed spiritum qui
       ex deo est, ut sciamus quæ a deo donata sunt nobis. Quis est autem
       spiritus mundi hujus, nisi superbiæ spiritus? . . . Nec alio
       spiritu decipiuntur etiam illi qui ignorantes dei justitiam et suam
       justitiam volentes constituere, justitiæ dei non sunt subjecti.
       Unde mihi videtur magis esse fidei filius, qui novit a quo speret
       quod nondum habet, quam qui sibi tribuit id quod habet. Colligimus
       non justificari hominem littera, sed spiritu, non factorum meritis,
       sed gratuita gratia.: [368]1
     * Quod ratio arguit, non potest auctoritas vindicare: [369]1
     * Quomodo Adam non perseverando peccavit, qui perseverantiam non
       accepit?: [370]1
     * Quos deus semel prædestinavit ad vitam, etiamsi negligant, etiamsi
       peccent, etiamsi nolint, ad vitam perducentur inviti, quos autem
       prædestinavit ad mortem, etiamsi currant, etiamsi festinent, sine
       causa laborant.: [371]1
     * Rape occasionem inopinatæ felicitatis, ut ille tu, nihil quondam
       penes deum nisi stilla situlæ et areæ pulvus et vasculum figuli,
       arbor exinde fias ills quæ penes aquas seritur, etc.: [372]1
     * Ratio: [373]1
     * Redditur quidem meritis tuis corona sua, sed dei dona sunt merita
       tua.: [374]1
     * Regnat carnalis cupiditas, ubi non est dei caritas.: [375]1
     * Reliqua vero et secundum ipsorum testimonium a me dicta non sunt,
       pro quibus ego satisfacere non debeo.: [376]1
     * Remota justitia quid sunt regna nisi magna latrocinia: [377]1
     * Renovatio = justificatio = sanctificatio = sanctitas: [378]1
     * Res dei ratio, quia deus nihil non ratione providit, nihil non
       ratione tractari intellegique voluit.: [379]1
     * Responsiones pro Augustino ad capitula objectionum Vincentiarium:
       [380]1
     * Restat jam de credentis merito: [381]1
     * Sæpe mihi ignota est humana conscientia, sed certus sum de Christi
       misericordia . . . non est perfidus Christus, a quo fidem percipio,
       non reatum . . . origo mea Christus est, radix mea Christus est
       . . . semen quo regeneror, verbum dei est . . . etiam si ille, per
       quem audio, quæ mihi dicit ipse non facit . . . me innocentem non
       facit nisi qui mortuus est propter delicta nostra et resurrexit
       propter justificationem nostram. Non enim in ministrum, per quem
       baptizor, credo, sed in eum, qui justificat impium.: [382]1
     * Salutis unda a culpa primi parentis absolvimur, sed tamen reatum
       ejusdem culpæ diluentes absoluti quoque adhuc carnaliter obimus.:
       [383]1
     * Sanctas quidem apostoli esse paginas confitemur, non ob aliud, nisi
       quia rationi: [384]1
     * Scripturæ sanctæ, quas ecclesiæ catholicæ commendat auctoritas.:
       [385]1
     * Secundum id, quod unigenitus est, non habet fratres; secundum id
       autem quod primogenitus est, fratres vocare dignatus est omnes qui
       post ejus et per ejus primatum in dei gratiam renascuntur per
       adoptionem filiorum.: [386]1
     * Sed bene quod nos onere talium personarum prior levasti. Nam in
       libro ad Timasium cum s. Pelagius venerabilium virorum tam Ambrosii
       quam Cypriani recordatus fuisset, qui liberum arbitrium in libris
       suis commendaverant, respondisti nulla te gravari auctoritate
       talium, ita ut diceres eos processu vitæ melioris, si quid male
       senserant, expiasse.: [387]1
     * Sed non ex toto vult; non ergo ex toto imperat: [388]1
     * Semen quo regeneror verbum dei est.: [389]1
     * Si Italiæ adjaces habes Romam, unde nobis auctoritas quoque praesto
       est.: [390]1
     * Si per gratiam (De gestis 30) omnia facimus, quando vincimur a
       peccato, non nos vincimur, sed dei gratia, quæ voluit nos adjuvare
       omni modo et non potuit.: [391]1
     * Si qua culpa in episcopis invenitur, nescic quis Petri successori
       subjectus non sit; cum vero culpa non exigit, omnes secundum
       rationem humilitatis æquales sunt.: [392]1
     * Sic enim oportebat prius hominem fieri, ut et bene velle posset et
       male, nec gratis si bene, nec impune, si male; postea vero sic
       erit, ut male velle non possit, nec ideo libero carebit arbitrio
       . . . ordo prætermittendus non fuit, in quo deus ostendere voluit,
       quam bonum sit animal rationale quod etiam non peccare possit,
       quamvis sit melius quod peccare non possit.: [393]1
     * Sic et Non: [394]1
     * Signacula quidem rerum divinarum esse visibilia, sed res ipsas
       invisibiles in eis honorari.: [395]1
     * Singulariter ad absolutionem nostram oblata cum lacrimis et
       benignitate mentis sacri altaris hostia suffragatur, quia is, qui
       in se resurgens a mortuis jam non moritur, adhuc per hanc in suo
       mysterio pro nobis iterum patitur. Nam quoties ei hostiam suæ
       passionis offerimus, toties nobis ad absolutionem nostram passionem
       illius reparamus.: [396]1
     * Spiritale: [397]1
     * Spiritus dei, qui cum a confitentibus non discedit neque dividitur,
       ipse in nobis loquitur et coronatur.: [398]1
     * Sub laude baptismatis eructat Augustinus Manichæorum sordes ac
       naturale peccatum, ut ecclesiæ catholicæ pura hactenus sacramenta
       contaminet: [399]1
     * Tam porro nemo est qui esse se nolit, quam nemo est qui non esse
       beatus velit. Quo modo enim potest beatus esse, si nihil sit?:
       [400]1
     * Tanto quisque tolerabiliorem: [401]1
     * Tantum sentiebam de domino Christo meo, quantum de excellentis
       sapientiæ viro, cui nullus posset æquari; præsertim quia
       mirabiliter natus ex virgine ad exemplum contemnendorum temporalium
       pro adipiscenda immortalitate divina pro nobis cura tantam
       auctoritatem magisterii meruisse videbatur.: [402]1
     * Tenebatur justa damnatione genus humanum et omnes erant iræ filii:
       [403]1
     * Traduciani pro se sursum deorsum plebecularum aut ruralium aut
       theatralium scita commendant.: [404]1
     * Tui profecto sic semper indigent omnes electi tui, quo videlicet
       tibi de te solo semper valeant placere. Quemadmodum palmites
       indigent vite, quo fructum queant ferre, vel aër aut oculi luce,
       quo vel ille lucidus esse vel illi possint videre. . . . te igitur
       supplex invoco . . . ut largiaris indigentissimo mihi per gratuitae
       gratiæ tuæ invictissimam virtutem, etc: [405]1
     * Ubi enim erat illa ædificans caritas a fundamento humilitatis, quod
       est Christus Jesus?: [406]1
     * Ubi ergo malum et unde et qua huc irrepsit? Quæ radix ejus et quo
       semen ejus? An omnino non est? Cur ergo timemus et cavemus quod non
       est? Aut si inaniter timemus, certe vel timor ipse malum est . . .
       et tanto gravius malum, quanto non est quod timeamus. Idcirco aut
       est malum quod timemus, aut hoc malum est quia timemus: [407]1
     * Ubi latuit, ubi dormivit hoc nomen adoptionis vel nuncupationis de
       Christo?: [408]1
     * Unigenitus vocatur secundum divinitatis excellentiam, quia sine
       fratribus, primogenitus secundum susceptionem hominis, in qua per
       adoptionem gratiæ fratres habere dignatus est, de quibus esset
       primogenitus.: [409]1
     * Unitas: [410]1
     * Ut etiam caro nostra per hoc ad immortalitatem et incorruptionem
       reparetur.: [411]1
     * Ut quodammodo peccato moreretur, dum moritur carni.: [412]1
     * Væ tibi flumen moris humani? quis resistet tibi? quamdiu non
       siccaberis? quosque volves Evæ, filius in mare magnum et
       formidolosum, quod vix transeunt qui lignum [ecclesiam]
       conscenderint?: [413]1
     * Venerabilis memoriæ Milevitanus episcopus catholicæ communionis
       Optatus.: [414]1
     * Venit inter homines mediator dei et hominum, homo Christus Jesus,
       ad præbendum exemplum vitæ hominibus simplex, ad non parcendum
       malignis spiritibus rectus ad debellandum superbiam timens deum, ad
       detergendam vero in electis suis immunditiam recedens a malo.:
       [415]1
     * Verumtamen, quæso, responde mihi: num universa hujusmodi fidei
       mystica sacramenta, quæ symbolo non continentur, sine quibus
       quisque, qui ad hoc pertingere potest, catholicus esse non potest,
       symbolis inserenda et propter compendium minus intellegentium, ut
       cuique libuerit, addenda sunt?: [416]1
     * Vides non dubitasse Mariam, sed credidisse et ideo fructum fidei
       consecutam. . . . Sed et vos beati, qui audistis et credidistis;
       quæcunque enim crediderit anima et concipit et generat dei verbum
       et opera ejus agnoscit. Sit in singulis Mariæ anima, ut magnificet
       dominum; sit in singulis spiritus Mariæ, ut exultet in deo. Si
       secundum carnem una mater est Christi, secundum fidem tamen omnium
       fructus est Christus: [417]1
     * Virginibus nec maritus dominus, dominus vester ac caput Christus
       est ad instar et vicem masculi.: [418]1
     * Virginitas et prompta fides Christum bibit alvo cordis et intactis
       condit paritura latebris.: [419]1

       quæ nonnisi æterna est, sine ulla dubitatione perducant: ubi jam
