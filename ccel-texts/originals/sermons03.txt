SERMON I.

  THE GOOD SHEPHERD.

    ST. JOHN x. 11.

   "I am the Good Shepherd."

   OF all the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, there are none more deeply
   engraven in the mind of the Church, none more dear to her than these.
   This is one of those divine sayings in which there is so much of truth
   and love, that we seem able to do little more than to record it and
   ponder on it, to express it by symbols, and to draw from it a multitude
   of peaceful and heavenly thoughts. It is full of figures and analogies
   of loving-kindness. It is almost sacramental in its depth and power. To
   expound or comment upon it, or further to illustrate its meaning, seems
   impossible. The Truth has said of Himself, "I am the Good Shepherd."
   All love, care, providence, devotion, watchfulness, that is in earth or
   in heaven, in the ministry of men or of angels, is but a reflection and
   participation of that which is in Him. Surely nothing but the vision of
   His Presence in glory can exceed this revelation of Himself.

   These words have taken so deep a hold of the hearts of His people,
   that, from the beginning, they passed into a common title for their
   exalted Head. It was the symbol under which, in times of persecution,
   His Presence was shadowed forth. It was sculptured on the walls of
   sepulchres and catacombs; it was painted in upper chambers and in
   oratories; it was traced upon their sacred books; it was graven on the
   vessels of the altar. The image of the Good Shepherd has expressed, as
   in a parable, all their deepest affections, fondest musings, most
   docile obedience, most devoted trust. It is a Title in which all other
   titles meet, in the light of which they blend and lose themselves.
   Priest, Prophet, King, Saviour, and Guide, are all summed up in this
   one more than royal, paternal, saving name. It recalls in one word all
   the mercies and loving-kindness of God to His people of old, when "the
   Shepherd of Israel" made His own people "to go forth like sheep, and
   guided them in the wilderness like a flock." [1] It recites, as it
   were, all the prophecies and types of the Divine care which were then
   yet to be revealed to His elect: it revives the visions of Isaiah and
   Ezekiel; "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the
   lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead
   those that are with young." [2] "As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in
   the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek
   out My sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have
   been scattered in the dark and cloudy day. And I will bring them out
   from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring
   them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by
   the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. I will feed
   them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall
   their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat
   pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. I will feed My
   flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God. I will
   seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away,
   and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which
   was sick." "And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
   them, even My servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their
   shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and My servant David a
   prince among them; I the Lord have spoken it. And I will make with them
   a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the
   land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the
   woods. And I will make them and the places round about My hill a
   blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there
   shall be showers of blessing. And the tree of the field shall yield her
   fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe
   in their land, and shall know that I am the Lord, when I have broken
   the bands of their yoke." "And David My servant shall be king over
   them; and they shall all have one shepherd." "They shall feed in the
   ways, and their pasture shall be in all high places. They shall not
   hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for He
   that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water
   shall He guide them." [3]

   And, moreover, by this Title He appropriates to Himself the fulfilment
   of His own most deep and touching parable of the lost sheep. There is
   no thought or emotion of pity, compassion, gentleness, patience, and
   love, which is not here expressed. It is the peculiar consolation of
   the weak, or of them that are out of the way; of the lost and
   wandering; of the whole flock of God here scattered abroad "in the
   midst of this naughty world." And though it be an Office taken on
   earth, and in the time of our infirmity, it is a Name which He will
   never lay aside. Even in the heavenly glory it still is among His
   Titles. He is even there "the chief Shepherd," "that great Shepherd of
   the sheep;" and in the state of bliss shall still guide His flock:
   though more fully to express the unity of His nature with theirs, and
   His own spotless sacrifice in their behalf, He is called the Lamb. "The
   Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall
   lead them unto living fountains of waters," [4] where they shall be
   filled with brightness.

   In this, then, we see the character and office of our blessed Master
   towards His Church, and the relation in which, though now ascended into
   heaven, He still stands to us. It expresses generally His pastoral
   relation of care and love for the universal flock of the elect: but
   especially the greatness of that love and care.

   Let us, then, consider awhile the surpassing and peculiar goodness of
   the One True Shepherd.

   And this He has revealed to the world in His voluntary death. There was
   never any other but He who came down from heaven that He might lay down
   "His life for the sheep." He is the true David, who said, "Thy servant
   kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a hear, and took a
   lamb out of the flock: and I went out after him, and smote him, and
   delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught
   him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him." [5] When out of the
   countless flock of creatures, one, and that the weakest, was caught
   away from the true fold of God, He came down "to seek and to save that
   which was lost;" to seek it even unto death, and in death itself; and
   to follow the lost along "the valley of the shadow of death," gathering
   the scattered and outcast of His Father's flock, and fulfilling His
   word: "I will surely assemble thee, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
   gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of
   Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold." By death He destroyed
   him that had the power of death; and by His resurrection He made a way
   for the ransomed to pass through. "The breaker is come up before them:
   they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out
   by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head
   of them." [6] "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in Me is
   thine help. I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee
   in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king
   and princes? I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will
   redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will
   be thy destruction." [7] "I am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd
   giveth His life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the
   shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and
   leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and
   scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling,
   and careth not for the sheep. I am the Good Shepherd, and know My
   sheep, and am known of Mine. As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I
   the Father: and I lay down My life for the sheep." [8] This is the one
   perpetual token of His great love to all mankind,--a token ever fresh,
   quickened with life, full of power to persuade and subdue the hearts of
   His people to Himself. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
   lay down his life for his friends:" [9] and therefore the Death of the
   Good Shepherd is the subject of all the Church's testimony. The holy
   Eucharist is a type of her whole office to "shew forth the Lord's death
   till He come." It is the great mystery of love, the mighty power of
   conversion, the true and very life of our love to Him, the pledge that
   He loved us before we were; and that He loves us still, even after our
   fall. "While we were yet enemies, Christ died for us," that He might
   gather together in one the children of God that are scattered abroad."
   "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us." "We love
   Him, because He first loved us."

   Again, His surpassing goodness is shewn in the provision He has made of
   all things necessary for the salvation of His flock in this state of
   mortality and sin. There can no soul fail of eternal life, of reaching
   the rest of the true fold in Heaven, except by his own free will. As
   the blood-shedding of the Good Shepherd is a full and perfect ransom
   for all His flock, so has He pledged the perpetual exercise of His
   unseen pastoral care to give us all that is needed for our salvation.

   1. And for this He has provided, first of all, in the external
   foundation and visible perpetuity of His Church. He has secured it by
   the commission to baptize all nations, by the universal preaching of
   His Apostles, by shedding abroad the Holy Ghost, by the revelation of
   all truth, by the universal tradition of the faith in all the world.
   For the perpetuity of the Church He has pledged His Divine word, that
   "the gates of hell shall not prevail against it;" and in this He has
   provided for the perpetuity both of truth and grace. For what is the
   perpetuity of the Church but the perpetuity of the society of them that
   are "sanctified through the truth?" And how shall this be, unless the
   means of sanctification, the Faith and the holy Sacraments, are
   likewise perpetual? The universal promulgation of the truth, and the
   universal delivery of the holy Sacraments to the Church planted in all
   lands, is a supernatural fact a miracle sustained by Divine power,
   wrought once for all, and containing the surest provisions of
   perpetuity, through the presence of Christ by the Spirit. Therefore, as
   the Church is indefectible, though particular members of it may fail of
   life eternal, so it can never lose the truth, though particular
   branches of it may err. In like manner of the holy Sacraments and
   mysteries of grace. Our Lord said to His Apostles, and through them to
   us, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." The
   commission, authority, succession, and power of the Apostles, is
   included in that presence, and upheld by it. Howsoever it may be
   forfeited by any branches of the visible Church, yet it will be always
   perpetuated with the gift of increase and multiplication, until the day
   of Christ's coming. And in that apostolic commission are contained all
   the acts and sacraments by which the grace of Christ is bestowed upon
   mankind, from the first engrafting of souls into His body, to the last
   strengthening food which is given to the passing saint. It is in the
   tenderness of His pastoral care that He has ordained the priesthood of
   His Church. He who gave His life for all, "would have all men to be
   saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth." "Whosoever shall
   call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call
   on Him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in
   Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a
   preacher?" [10] How shall they? It is the voice not more of the Gospel
   than of the pure reason, that the perpetuity of faith upon earth is
   bound up with the perpetuity of the apostolic commission; nay, further,
   that the evangelical ministry is the means to the perfection of the
   saints. "He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
   evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the
   saints"--and more, the perfection of the true city of God depends, by
   Divine will, on the organization and unity of the apostolic body which
   was ordained--"for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the
   body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
   the stature of the fulness of Christ." And further still, in the
   perpetuity of this same ministry is also contained the perpetuity and
   unity of the faith itself; "that we henceforth be no more children,
   tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine,"--as
   all human schools and teachers ever have been and ever shall be--"by
   the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
   deceive." And lastly, in the same stedfast succession of the Church,
   both Pastors and Flock, is the virtual perfection of the whole mystical
   body of Christ: "but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into Him
   in all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole body
   fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint
   supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every
   part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
   [11]

   How thankless and disloyal are we, then, to the Good Shepherd, if we
   use the great and blessed truths of the Unity of His Fold, and the
   succession of His pastors, as antagonistic and controversial dogmas.
   What can be more meagre and melancholy than to contend for them as
   externals and forms, and theories of Church government? Surely, there
   are no truths more strictly and simply practical than these--none more
   full of direct benedictions to the faithful--more vivid, real, and
   sustaining. For what is the unity of His fold, but the everliving token
   of the presence and love of the heavenly Shepherd, gathering in one the
   world-wide flock under His own pastoral staff? Is it not a living and
   life-giving sign of His perpetual indwelling? Is it a mere pale which
   encompasses His true fold? a hollow external form, remote from the life
   of the Church? Is it not the one Body of the one Spirit--the living
   organization of the life-giving unity of Christ? What then do
   controversies and bickerings about the nature of His Church, and
   divisions for the sake of its unity, prove, but that we have not
   attained to so much as a perception of the spiritual reality that
   quickens the one Fold under one Shepherd? It may seem to be empty and
   lifeless to the wise of this world, but it is full of tenderness for
   the poor and lost. It is specially for them that He has called His
   servants to a fellowship in His pastoral care. "Thus saith the Lord my
   God; Feed the flock of the slaughter"--that is, the elect, despised,
   neglected, slain--"whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not
   guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the Lord; for I am
   rich: and their own shepherds pity them not." "I will feed the flock of
   slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock;" [12] that is, I will send
   and seek you; I will find you, O wandering sheep--the young, the
   ignorant, the helpless; "the poor" shall "have the Gospel preached to
   them."

   If there he one institution of Jesus Christ, in which the love,
   tenderness, care, and providence of the Good Shepherd be revealed, it
   is in the commission and perpetual succession of His pastors: for in
   one word it is this,--that from the time of His going away to the time
   of His coming again, there shall never be wanting, in the darkest day,
   a chosen brotherhood, bound by all the vows which can constrain the
   hearts of men to live a life of pity and compassion, humility and
   gentleness, toil and love; and that not for themselves, nor for their
   own kindred, nor for their own blood; but for "the poor of the
   flock"--for the ignorant, wandering, weary, soiled, outcast, perishing
   sheep of Christ. If the goodness of the heavenly Pastor be not here,
   let any one shew where it may be found. If there be any persuasion, any
   faith, which is full of warmth, life, energy, consolation, love, to all
   the faithful, but above all to the ignorant, helpless, afflicted, and
   poor, it is that of the One Holy Catholic Church, as we confess it in
   our Baptismal creed, the one true Fold of the one Good Shepherd. It is
   He that still visibly discharges upon earth the manifold functions of
   His pastoral office, signing His sheep in holy Baptism, guiding them
   into the knowledge of the truth, carrying the weak in His bosom,
   bringing back again the lost by repentance, binding up the wounded with
   His words of consolation, feeding all souls that follow Him with the
   food of eternal life, folding them within the pale of salvation. What
   the Church does on earth, it does in His power and name; and He,
   through it, fulfils His own shepherd care. This, then, is the external
   ministration of His goodness.

   2. But once more. His love and care are shewn not only in the external
   and visible provision which He thus made beforehand for the perpetual
   wants of His flock, but in the continual and internal providence
   wherewith He still watches over it. The whole history of His Church
   from the beginning--the ages of persecution, and "times of refreshing;"
   the great conflicts of faith with falsehood, and of the saints with the
   seed of the serpent; the whole career of His Church amid the kingdoms
   of the earth and changes of the world, are a perpetual revelation of
   His love and power. He has been gathering in His sheep one by
   one,--apostles, prophets, martyrs, saints, the pure and the penitent,
   the scattered and outcast, drawing them into His one visible fold, and
   gathering them still more closely and intimately to Himself, bringing
   them within the folds of His pavilion, and into the fellowship of His
   peculiar visitations. All that the Father hath given Him shall come to
   Him. "I am the Good Shepherd, and know My sheep." "I know them;" "and I
   give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall
   any man pluck them out of My hand. My Father, which gave them Me, is
   greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father's
   hand." [13]

   The mystical number of His flock is written in the book of life; and He
   is ever fulfilling it; ever saying, through all the course of His
   Church, that which, while on earth, He spake of His elect among the
   Gentiles; "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold;" some not
   entered yet, some not born into the world; "them also I must bring, and
   they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one fold and one
   shepherd." [14]

   Is not this the way He has been dealing with each one of us from the
   time of our regeneration? Is not our whole life full of the tokens of
   His pastoral care? See how He has sought us out, and brought us to
   Himself. Although we were outwardly within His fold, yet for how many
   years were we in heart and in reality altogether lost, wandering in
   follies, plunged in deadly pitfalls. With what unwearied search did He
   follow us through all our blind and crooked paths. We met His eye at
   every turn, and beheld Him at every winding of our evil way. Perhaps
   there is hardly one of us who does not feel, on looking back, that he
   is not able to find the ultimate and true cause of his conversion to
   God in any of the apparent motives which turned him from the sin in
   which he was persisting. If we had been left to ourselves, why should
   we not have held on our original course without turning at all--nay,
   with confidence and settled obstinacy, with perpetual deterioration and
   darkening of soul? What was it that turned us at one time, when we
   would not be turned at another? Why then, and no sooner; and if not
   sooner, then why at all? Why, but that the Good Shepherd had found us
   at length; that having never left off to seek, He had overtaken us at
   last. He had been always seeking; but we refused to be found.

   And, surely, the same is true even in those that live religiously. Even
   after we were found, and our hearts turned towards the true fold; who
   is there that knows the difficulty of repentance,--that is, of
   returning from error, and from wandering without God in the world,--and
   does not feel that, if he had been at any time left to himself, he
   would have sunk down by the way, or been beguiled aside, or even turned
   back again? What has forced us clean away from habits which, by their
   perilous allurement and subtil dominion, had a hold upon our very
   heart's will? What has borne us through the difficulties of
   humiliation, self-denial, chastisement of the flesh and spirit, through
   the difficulties and dangers of repentance, but that the Good Shepherd
   had laid us upon His shoulders, and bare us, all willing and yet
   unwilling, to our home and shelter? And so in like manner with all His
   servants. How is it that they have not fainted in the way; nor fallen
   behind the onward march of the true flock that follows Him; nor lacked
   pasture, strength, light, refreshment, consolation? How is it that none
   have ever been "able to pluck them out of His hand?" All the schisms
   and heresies of proud and evil men; all the baits of the world; all the
   bribes of this corrupt life; all the seductions of earthly pleasure;
   all the attractions of ease and sloth; all the powers of darkness, have
   spent themselves in vain against the hand that covers His elect. He has
   kept and folded us from ten thousand ills, when we did not know it: in
   the midst of our security we should have perished every hour, but that
   He sheltered us "from the terror by night and from the arrow that
   flieth by day"--from the powers of evil that walk in darkness, from
   snares of our own evil will. He has kept us even against ourselves, and
   saved us even from our own undoing. Surely, though He had not taken to
   Himself this loving and blessed Name, our own lives would have taught
   us to call Him the Good Shepherd.

   Let us, then, meditate on this Name of love. Let us read the traces of
   His hand in all our ways, in all the events, the chances, the changes
   of this troubled state. It is He that dispenses all. It is He that
   folds and feeds us, that makes us to go in and out--to be faint, or to
   find pasture--to lie down by the still waters, or to walk by the way
   that is parched and desert. He hath said, "I know My sheep;" not their
   number only, but their needs; their particular state, character,
   temptations, trials, dangers, and infirmities. I know them what they
   are, and what they must suffer and do to enter into the everlasting
   fold. And not only does He know His sheep, but He "calleth His own
   sheep by name." By that new name which in baptism He gave to them; a
   type of the new name which He will one day give--the "name which no man
   knoweth saving he that receiveth it." In this is expressed the familiar
   and intimate knowledge He has of our most hidden and secret condition
   of heart, of our joys, sorrows, losses, desires, fears, and hopes, of
   all our varying moods of mind, and all that makes up our very selves.
   He knows all--as we know those nearest and most beloved--and far more
   deeply and intensely still--by the divine intuition of His eyes, which
   pierce into our inmost depths. When He says, "I know My sheep by name,"
   He means, that there is nothing in them which He does not know; there
   is not one forgotten, not one passed over, as He telleth them morning
   and evening. His eyes are upon us all. And all the complex mystery of
   our spiritual being, all our secret motions of will, our daily sorrows,
   fears, and thoughts, are seen and read with the unerring gaze of our
   Divine Lord.

   Whatsoever, therefore, befal us, let us say: It is He. It is the voice
   of the Good Shepherd. It is His rod and His staff which smite and
   comfort me. It is the work of One that loves me above measure, and
   cares for me with a sleepless providence. "The Lord is my Shepherd,
   therefore can I lack nothing." This will convert all things into
   revelations of His nearness and of His compassion. If it be
   disappointment, perhaps we were too bold and confident, and there were
   in our course pitfalls and death. If it be sickness, we were getting to
   be self-trusting, self-sufficing, unconscious of weakness, averse from
   humiliations. If it be long anxieties, perhaps we were settling down in
   this life with too full a rest. If our long anxieties have shaped
   themselves at length into the realities of sorrow, it was that we
   needed this for our very life; that nothing less would work in us His
   will, and our salvation; that the keen edge must come, or we must
   perish. Let us thus learn to taste, and to see that He is with us--that
   all things which befal us are just such as our truest friend would
   desire and do for our good. They are His doing--and that is enough. Let
   our heart's cry be, "Tell me, O Thou whom my soul loveth, where Thou
   feedest, where Thou makest Thy flock to rest at noon." [15] So let us
   follow Him now "whithersoever He goeth." Be our path through joy or
   sorrow--in the darkness or in the light--in the multitude of His flock
   or in a solitary way, let us follow on to the fold which is pitched
   upon the everlasting hills, where the true flock shall "pass under the
   hand of Him that telleth them," one by one, till all the lost be found,
   and all His elect come in.

SERMON II.

  THE TRUE SHEEP.

    ST. JOHN x. 14.

   "I am the Good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine."

   OUR Lord here says, that He and His sheep know each other; that His
   knowledge of them is one of the tokens of the Good Shepherd; and that
   their knowledge of Him is one of the tokens of the true sheep. "Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the
   sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a
   robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the
   sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice; and he
   calleth his own sheep by name; and leadeth them out. And when he
   putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow
   him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but
   will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers." "I am
   the Good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine." "But ye
   believe not, because ye are not of My sheep, as I said unto you. My
   sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me." [16]

   Now what is this knowledge by which His true sheep are known?

   There are many kinds of knowledge, of which only one can be the true.

   There is a knowledge which even fallen angels have of Him. St. James
   tells us that "the devils believe, and tremble." St. Luke, that the
   spirit of an unclean devil cried out in Christ's presence "with a loud
   voice, saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus
   of Nazareth? art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art; the
   Holy One of God;" and that "devils came out of many, crying out, and
   saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And He rebuking them suffered
   them not to speak; for they knew that He was Christ." And others again
   "cried out, saying, What have we to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of
   God? art Thou come hither to torment us before the time?" [17] This is
   a knowledge of the spiritual intelligence, which may be possessed in
   energetic wickedness, and with direct resistance of the will against
   the will of Christ.

   Again, there is also a knowledge which all the regenerate possess. The
   preaching of the Church, the reading of Holy Scriptures, the public
   commemoration of fasts and festivals, the tradition of popular
   Christianity, and all the knowledge which from childhood we
   unconsciously imbibe, give us a general knowledge of the evangelical
   facts, and of the history of our Lord. But besides and before all this,
   there is a knowledge which is in the grace of regeneration itself.
   There is in every living soul, born again of the Holy Ghost, a gift of
   enlightening. The great truths and laws of God's kingdom are as a germ
   implanted in the conscience; latent, indeed, and undeveloped, but there
   in virtue and in power. For this cause, baptism is called our
   illumination. [18] It is impossible to say what it may bestow upon the
   spiritual capacities of the soul; what faculties and perceptions, what
   passive and subtil qualities may be infused into us by our
   regeneration.

   There seems to be in those who are baptized, whether holy or unholy, an
   inward sense which hardly so much answers to truth as anticipates it.
   They know it almost before they hear it. They, as it were, forebode it
   before it is declared. As the whole power of number seems by nature to
   exist in children, needing only to be wisely elicited by questions and
   leading thoughts; so in those who are born again, the first axioms and
   principles of truth seem mysteriously impressed by the grace of
   baptism.

   The knowledge of Christ, of His name and person, that He is the Son of
   God, the Saviour of the world, born of the Virgin, crucified, buried,
   risen, ascended into heaven, and coming again to judge both the quick
   and the dead, all these things seem as a sort of second consciousness,
   which men may sin against, but cannot get rid of. It clings to them
   whatsoever they do, wheresoever they go, howsoever they deny it. The
   worldly, trifling, lightminded; the impure, false, and sensual; even
   blasphemers, scoffers, infidels,--all are held in a bondage of
   consciousness, which, like the unseen but all-seeing Eye, follows them
   every where. It pierces them with fear, and, when they sin, turns their
   hearts within them into stone. It is this that makes evil men so
   irritable, sullen, reckless, and desperate. When they are most raging
   and vehement against the truth, it is because it is then most intensely
   torturing them. We often think that men are beyond the power of truth,
   because they turn with so much wrath against it, defying and bitterly
   reviling it. But all this vehement emotion shews how deep the barbs
   have pierced, and what a struggle and convulsion of soul they are
   making to tear out the truth which galls them. Their anger gives the
   lie to their professed unbelief. It is one of the offices of truth to
   reveal this wickedness of the human spirit; and their very opposition
   is a testimony to the Divine character of truth itself. Theirs is as
   the testimony of the unclean spirits: "Art Thou come to torment us
   before the time? We know Thee who Thou art; the Holy One of God." "This
   is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved
   darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every
   one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest
   his deeds should be reproved." [19] It is Truth doing its work of just
   judgment upon sinners. What some take as an evidence against their
   regeneration is, indeed, the proof of it. Why is the wickedness of an
   angel worse than that of a man? Because he holds a higher nature in
   unrighteousness.

   It is this same passive capacity, kept from great perversions, and
   instructed by the teaching and worship of the Church, which makes up
   the knowledge of most baptized people; of such, I mean, as live
   Christian lives in the main; that is to say, the great bulk of those
   who are blameless and orderly within the fold of the visible Church. It
   is a kind of unenergetic knowledge; an illumination, which shines
   mildly, but truly, clearly but faintly; and in hearts that cast many
   shadows upon themselves. The Christian knowledge of such persons is
   little more than a history of moving events, or a theory of pure
   morality, or a scheme of elevated doctrine. It is, so far, their guide,
   their law of life, their consolation: but their knowledge of Christ is
   something retrospective rather than present, of a fact rather than of a
   Person, having a relation to His life on earth rather than to His
   presence now. The way in which most Christians speak of Him is more as
   of a system than as of a Lord; and His name stands rather as a symbol
   of a doctrine than as a title of One that is living and mighty; whose
   searching insight "is sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the
   dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and
   is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." Such indeed
   is He whom men quote and speak of as a term equivalent with
   Christianity. He is a Divine Person, not an abstract name: One to whom
   we are all laid bare; "neither is there any creature that is not
   manifest in His sight; for all things are naked and opened unto the
   eyes of Him with whom we have to do." [20]

   This, then, cannot be the knowledge of which the Good Shepherd spoke
   when He said, "I know My sheep, and am known of Mine." It must be
   something of a deeper kind, something more living and personal. It is
   plainly, therefore, such a knowledge as He has of us. It is that mutual
   consciousness of which we speak when we say that we know any person as
   our friend. We do not mean that we know him by name; for many strangers
   we know by name; many whom we have never seen, or further care to know:
   neither do we mean only that we know all about him, that is to say, who
   he is, and whence, of what lineage, or from what land, or what has been
   his history, his acts and words, and the like; for in this way we may
   be said to know many who do not know us, and with whom we have nothing
   to do. When we say we know any one as our friend, we mean that we know
   not only who he is, but what, or as we say, his character,--that he is
   true, affectionate, gentle, forgiving, liberal, patient, self-denying;
   and still more, that he has been, and is, all this to ourselves; that
   we have made trial of him, and have cause to know this character as a
   reality, of which we have, as it were, tasted, by often meeting with
   him, seeing him at all times, under all circumstances and in all
   changes, familiarly conversing with him, doing service to him,
   ourselves receiving from him in turn tokens of love and goodness. It is
   in this way we know our friends; what they are, what they mean, wish,
   and imply; how they would judge, speak, and act in all cases; what
   every look, tone, and word signifies. It is a knowledge, not in the
   understanding so much as in the heart; in the perceptions of feeling,
   affection, and sympathy; by which we are drawn towards them and grow to
   them, love them; choose them out from all others, as our advisers,
   guides, companions; live with them and live for them; trust in them
   with a feeling that we are safe in their hands, and at rest in their
   hearts; that they love us, and would do any thing for our good; and
   though we be often away from them, and alone, and at times seldom see
   them, yet we are as if always with them--always happy in the thought of
   them, knowing that they are always the same to us, and knowing,
   besides, both where and how we shall find them if we desire or need.
   This is the knowledge of friendship and of love. It is something living
   and personal, arising out of the whole of our inward nature, and
   filling all our powers and affections.

   And such is the knowledge the true sheep have of the Good Shepherd. "I
   know My sheep, and am known of Mine." As He knows us, through and
   through,--all that we have been and are, all that we desire and need,
   hope and fear, do and leave undone, all our thoughts, affections,
   purposes, all our secret acts, all our hidden life, which is hid with
   Him in God; so do His true sheep know Him,--His love, care, tenderness,
   mercy, meekness, compassion, patience, gentleness, all His forecasting
   and prudent watchfulness, His indulgent and pitiful condescension. They
   have learned it by the grace of regeneration, by the illumination of
   their spiritual birth, by the light of His holy Gospels, by acts of
   contemplation, by direct approach to Him in prayer, by ineffable
   communion in the holy Eucharist, by His particular and detailed
   guidance, by His providential discipline from childhood all along the
   path of life. It is the knowledge of heart with heart, soul with soul,
   spirit with spirit; a sense of presence and companionship: so that when
   most alone, we are perceptibly least alone; when most solitary, we are
   least forsaken. It is a consciousness of guidance, help, and
   protection; so that all we do or say, and all that befals us, is shared
   with Him. It fills us with a certainty that in every part of our lot,
   in all its details, there is some purpose, some indication of His
   design and will, some discipline or medicine for us; some hid treasure,
   if we will purchase it; some secret of peace, if we will only make it
   our own.

   Now if this be the knowledge which His sheep have of Him, it is plain
   that a great part of baptized men do not so know Christ. The multitude
   of the visible Church live in the world forgetful both of Fold and
   Shepherd: remembering them only in direct acts of religion, which are
   short and few, in the midst of a busy earthly life of buying and
   selling, marrying and giving in marriage, trading and toiling late and
   early. With the very best among us, how sadly true is this. Who is not
   backward in this one science which only it is needful for us to know?
   It is much to be feared that some persons, of seeming devotion, live on
   very strange to Him, and far off, knowing Him rather in the
   understanding and imagination, rather picturing Him upon their fancy in
   the garb and parable of the Good Shepherd, than realising with any true
   and vivid spiritual consciousness the truth and blessedness of His
   pastoral love and care.

   Let us, then, consider in what way we may attain this knowledge, which
   is not of the understanding, but of the heart; not of the mere
   intellect, but in the consciousness of the soul.

   1. First, it must be by following Him. "My sheep hear My voice, and
   they follow Me." By living such a life as He lived. Likeness to Him is
   the power of knowing Him. Nay, rather, it is knowledge itself: there is
   no other. It cannot be by the knowledge of eye, or ear, nor by the
   knowledge of imagination or thoughts, but by the knowledge of the will,
   and of the spiritual reason instructed by the experience of faith. It
   is by likeness that we know, and by sympathy that we learn. "Hereby we
   do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He that saith, I
   know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is
   not in him. But whoso keepeth His word, in Him verily is the love of
   God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him, He that saith he
   abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk even as He walked." "If we
   say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and
   do not the truth." [21] What fellowship can an impure soul have with
   One Who knew no sin: or the self-indulgent with the Crucified: or the
   vain with Him that "made Himself of no reputation:" or a mind that is
   bounded about by this world, and content to move within its narrow
   sphere, in an aimless life of levities and follies, with Him who came
   into this world for one end alone, "that He might bring us unto God?"
   Such as these can have no fellowship with Christ; and if no fellowship,
   then no knowledge, which comes by sympathy, by partaking of His Spirit
   and of His life. We may read, study, toil, write, talk, preach, and
   make discourses which will illuminate, and move others to tears, while
   we ourselves are cold and dark. So too, we may profess and pray, with
   our lips; be strict and regular in the ordinary works and offices of
   religion: and all in vain, so long as our hearts and spiritual life are
   out of sympathy with His. How strange and perverse we are. That which
   is plainest to learn, we put off to the last; that which needs most
   grace to know, we take for our alphabet. How long shall we go on
   professing to judge of His doctrine, before we have begun to learn the
   imitation of His life? Surely the plainest and first lesson is to
   follow His steps. This is the first work of our probation, the first
   condition of His guidance. If we would only take the Sermon on the
   Mount, and read it, not as the world has paraphrased it, but as He
   spoke it; if we would only fulfil it, not as men dispense with it, but
   as He lived it upon earth; we should begin to know somewhat of those
   deeper perceptions of His love, tenderness, and compassion, which are
   the peace of His elect. Such obedience has a searching and powerful
   virtue to quicken and make keen the faculties of our conscience. And it
   would change our whole view of the Christian life, from a solitary
   observance of an abstract rule of duty, into an abiding relation
   towards a personal and living Master. It would make men to feel that
   not only the general and confused sum of life shall, in the end of
   time, be brought into judgment, but that every deed and thought, every
   motive of the heart and inclination of the will, are full of pregnant
   meaning; of obedience or of disobedience, of loyalty or betrayal, to
   the person of our Lord: that our every-day life is either in the track
   of His footsteps, or gone astray from the one only path that leadeth
   unto life. This is the first step to a true knowledge of Christ.

   2. And, further than this: there are peculiar faculties of the heart
   which must be awakened, if we would know Him as He knows us. There can
   be no true obedience without the discipline of habitual devotion. By
   this is signified something far deeper than the habits of prayer which
   we commonly maintain. As obedience to Christ impresses us with a sense
   of His personality, so devotion awakens a perception of His presence.
   And how easy it is to pray for years with little or no sense of His
   nearness--with a dim, cold syllogism of the necessary presence of One
   that must be here, because He is God, for God is everywhere--we all
   unhappily know. Half our difficulties in prayer, half the irksomeness
   of the act, the wearisomeness of the posture, the wandering of our
   hearts, the distraction of our thoughts, may be traced to this one
   great lack,--the lack of a deep consciousness of His personal presence.
   And therefore it is our prayers gain for us so little light, so faint
   an insight into His mind and perfection, so clouded a knowledge of His
   love and will towards us. If we truly knew Him, we should delight to
   speak with Him, to linger and dwell in His presence. We should go from
   our prayers with the slow hearts we now bring to them. How should we
   lay up all day long our thoughts, cares, forebodings, to lighten our
   hearts at night by pouring them out before Him. We should then somewhat
   understand the words, "Casting all your care upon Him, for He careth
   for you." And this would open to us the words of Holy Scripture, which
   to most are so remote, involved, and perplexing. Perhaps there is no
   book that is so much read and so little really understood, because so
   little dwelt upon. And why, but because meditation implies the
   intensity and affection of a devout mind? Prayer and meditation are so
   nearly one, that we may pass and repass from the one to the other,
   almost without perceptible transition. Not that they are indeed one and
   the same: but meditation is the food of prayer, arid prayer is the life
   of meditation, and they are therefore inseparable. It is for want of
   these deeper and more stedfast thoughts that we go on through life
   reading Holy Scripture without piercing beneath the letter. And this
   cursory and superficial habit of mind keeps up our insensibility of the
   presence of Christ.

   Moreover, it is the same unimpressed and unawakened temper of heart
   that leads men to live on in habitual neglect of the holy Sacrament of
   His Body and Blood. They have no sense of hunger and thirst, no
   consciousness of any inward craving, no need felt of sustenance, no
   perception of the constraining love of Him who, in the night of His
   betrayal, left that command to prove the faith and love of His Church
   for ever. Now a Christian, in this torpid unawakened state, cannot know
   Him with the knowledge of His true sheep. There is something which
   deadens and stifles the spiritual affections. Cold devotions will make
   a man's heart dark. Let him profess what he will, let him in the
   intellect know what he may, into the true knowledge which comes by love
   and likeness to Christ he cannot enter. A life of devotion, that is, of
   frequent and fervent worship of our Divine Lord, so awakens and kindles
   the whole inward heart, that there is nothing more real and blissful to
   a Christian than to escape from all the world into the presence of the
   only and true Shepherd. And this is tested above all in the mystery of
   the holy Communion. The eyes of many are, by their own want of insight,
   long holden so as not to know Him, until He makes Himself known in the
   breaking of bread. Even though all along their intellect have been
   opened to understand the Scriptures, there is a knowledge still higher,
   still more personal and intimate, which they cannot have till He
   manifests Himself in that blessed Sacrament. There is a marked and
   visible distinction between those who know Him by the intellect, and
   those who know Him by the heart; those who have sought to know Him by
   mere reading, and those who have sought to know Him by communion. The
   holy Eucharist is the very life-bread of His true servants. It is their
   very Gospel, not written with pen and ink, but by a pierced hand, and
   in the blood of the Good Shepherd. There even the unlettered Christian,
   the weakest of His flock, learns what doctors in the temple neither
   teach nor know. A life of devout and frequent communion is the true and
   infallible way to a personal knowledge and experience of His love. What
   things He may make known to us in that holy mystery, each will
   understand. They are not to be spoken or known by hearsay. But He has
   promised an ineffable fellowship to them that devoutly open their
   hearts to receive His visitation. "Behold, I stand at the door, and
   knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to
   him, and will sup with him, and he with me." [22]

   3. And lastly, this true knowledge of Him is not a transitory state of
   feeling. Out of obedience and devotion arises an habitual faith, which
   makes Him, though unseen, yet perceptibly a part of all our life.
   Without this we shall but run great risks of deceiving ourselves. This
   strong and sustained consciousness of His presence makes all things
   within the veil more real than those we see. The Unseen Head of the
   Church living and glorified; the mystical body knit in one by the Holy
   Ghost; the Good Shepherd tending His one fold on the everlasting hills;
   the familiar image of His loving countenance;--all these, all day long,
   in the midst of work and in their hour of rest, at home and abroad,
   among men or in solitude, are spread before the sight of hearts that
   know Him by love.

   Let us then seek, in this way, so to know Him. He will guide us in a
   sure path, though it be a rough one: though shadows hang upon it, yet
   He will be with us. If we be His true flock, we shall lack nothing. He
   will bring us home at last. Through much trial it may be, and
   weariness, in much fear and fainting of heart, in much sadness and
   loneliness, in griefs that the world never knows, and under burdens
   that the nearest never suspect. Yet He will suffice for all. By His eye
   or by His voice He will guide us, if we be docile and gentle; by His
   staff and by His rod, if we wander or are wilful: any how, and by all
   means, He will bring us to His rest. Not one shall perish, except we be
   stedfastly bent upon our own perdition. Blessed are they who so know
   Him. They alone are truly happy; they alone have that which will fill
   all hearts, stay all desires, and make even the broken spirit to be
   glad. He is enough: even "a strength to the poor, a strength to the
   needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat,
   when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall." He
   is "a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as
   rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a
   weary land." [23] Who is parched and wearied by the glare and drought
   of this dazzling and dangerous world? "Come unto Me, all ye that are
   weary and heavy-laden, and I will refresh you. " Say: Even so, Lord,
   make me to know Thee. It is the unreasonableness, the wilfulness, the
   self-love of my heart, that will not know Thee. Take away all these,
   which hide Thee from me. The veil is not upon Thy Face, but upon my
   heart. "Lord, that I may receive my sight." For "Whom have I in heaven
   but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee."

SERMON III.

  THE GREAT MOTIVE.

    COLOSSIANS iii. 17.

   "Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
   Jesus."

   THIS great command is here given between some of the highest, and some
   of the homeliest duties of the Christian life. St. Paul, a little
   before, has said, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things
   which are above." He then presses upon the Colossians the great
   mysteries of the resurrection and ascension of our Lord, as incitements
   to a holy life. He bids them live as men dead to the world, living in
   and to God alone, in mortification, purity, devotion, and peace. After
   these high counsels of saintliness, he gives a series of minute and
   homely precepts to wives and husbands, parents and children, and
   servants and masters: and then, between these two branches of his
   exhortation, he says, "Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the
   name of the Lord Jesus;" shewing us that all duties are sacred, and
   that none are too little to be done for Christ's sake.

   Now in these words St. Paul gives us the great motive of Christian
   obedience.

   When God in the beginning created man in His own image, the aim or
   motive of his obedience was God; His will, bliss and glory. After the
   fall, by perversion, it became, in manifold shapes, his own self;
   self-pleasing, self-indulgence, and self-worship. This was the true
   fall of mankind. The Divine law of order was lost, and man's spiritual
   being was confounded by the turbulence of his own fallen nature. It had
   no law, or supreme control, and so became its own bondage and
   affliction, This has been the source of all sin and sorrow to mankind.
   His nature had lost its keystone, and fell into a ruin. It was this
   great want of a governing law or motive which was again filled up by
   the Gospel of Christ. The true principle, or moving cause, of all
   obedience in man is the Name of Christ. And this is what St. Paul
   implies in these words. Let us, then, see what this precept means--to
   do all in the name of Christ?

   First, it means to do all things for His sake; and that because, by the
   redemption of the world, we have passed into His possession. We are no
   longer our own, but His. We were dead; He has made us to live again: we
   were condemned, He has blotted out the doom that was against us: we
   were under the powers of sin, and He has set us free. Not only are all
   gifts from Him, but we ourselves have the very gift of our new and
   spiritual life through His incarnation and His atonement on the cross.
   Therefore St. Paul says in another place, "The love of Christ
   constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then
   were all dead" (that is, all died with Him); and that He died for all,
   that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but
   unto Him which died for them, and rose again." [24] "Ye are not your
   own, for ye are bought with a price; wherefore glorify God in your
   body, and in your spirit, which are God's." [25] And again, "Ye are
   Christ's, and Christ is God's." [26]

   But, further, to do all in His name, means to do all in His sight. When
   He was upon earth, His apostles saw and conversed with Him. They went
   in and out at His bidding. All they did and said was as in His
   presence, and in His hearing. Whether they were with Him in the
   mountain or on the sea, by the wayside or in the Temple, He saw all and
   knew all. Even the words they spoke among themselves in secret, and the
   thoughts that arose, as they journeyed, in their hearts,--all was
   manifest to Him. So it was before He suffered. After He rose from the
   dead, still more. In those forty days of mysterious abiding upon earth,
   whether seen or no, He watched all their ways, noted every thought.
   They were under His penetrating gaze while they communed of Him and of
   His departure; while they toiled all night upon the sea of Galilee; or
   wondered among themselves when He should reveal Himself again. And not
   less--nay, even more--when He went up into heaven, after He had sent
   them forth into all the earth, and said, "Lo, I am with you always,
   even unto the end of the world." He sent them into all lands, and He
   went with them unseen. In market-places, and before councils, in
   prisons and in travel, in the desert and on the deep, He was always
   near. And His presence has abode with their lineal successors even to
   this hour. This high promise stands sure. His invisible fellowship is
   with us still, not less than with them. What is the Church, but the
   presence of Christ, and the company of the apostles, drawn out unto the
   world's end? What is the visible Church, but the very fellowship of the
   eleven who were gathered in the upper chamber, then personal and local,
   now universal and perpetual? With Him time is not. He reigns in time,
   but His presence is neither past nor to come, but now and always: seen
   and unseen is nothing in Christ's kingdom; visibleness is but an
   accident. He sees us here and now, as He saw them at Emmaus, or on the
   mountain of ascension. All our whole life bears the same relation to
   Him as theirs; and ought, therefore, to be governed by the same abiding
   consciousness. Wheresoever we be, whatsoever we are doing, in all our
   work, in our busy daily life, in all schemes and undertakings, in
   public trusts, and in private retreats, He is with us, and all we do is
   spread before Him. Do it, then, as to the Lord. Let the thought of His
   eye unseen be the motive of your acts and words. Do nothing you would
   not have Him see. Say nothing which you would not have said before His
   visible presence. This, again, is to do all in His name.

   And, once more, to do all in Christ's name, means, further, to do all
   as a witness for Him.

   This was the commission of the apostles. He bade them tarry in
   Jerusalem till they had received power from on high; and then, He said,
   "Ye shall be witnesses unto Me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea,
   and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." [27] "And ye
   are witnesses of these things;" [28] that is, of His incarnation,
   teaching, and miracles, of His passion and resurrection, of His
   mysteries and sacraments, of His ascension and perpetual presence, of
   the whole invisible kingdom of their exalted Head. This was the witness
   of the apostles. And they bare it by their preaching and suffering, but
   chiefly by their purity of life. He that overcame sin and death, when
   He went up on high, endowed them with His own power to overcome death
   and sin. "I appoint unto you a kingdom, as My Father hath appointed
   unto Me." [29] "All power is given unto Me, in heaven and in earth. Go
   ye, therefore." [30] The whole apostolic ministry--the founding and
   expansion of the Church throughout the world--its resistless might
   against all opposition--its universal mastery, overthrowing altars,
   temples, legions, kingdoms, and whatsoever reared itself against the
   cross--all this was a visible witness for Christ. It proved that they
   were the living members of a living Head; that in them He was still
   ever going forth with the armies of heaven, conquering, and to conquer.
   They were the witnesses of the true and only King, who reigns,
   conquers, and governs in heaven and in earth. And this is our work and
   trial now. There are, at this very hour, two kingdoms in presence of
   each other. The world is still divided between the kingdom of Christ
   and the kingdom of antichrist. For one, or for the other, every man
   must be. These two kingdoms have their standards, powers, and
   tribunals. The one, loud, pompous, and majestic, gorgeous in its
   apparel and in the pageantry of its strength. In its train are
   pleasures, honours, decorations, high estate, refinement, luxury, and
   splendour. This is the kingdom of the world, and its glory. The other
   is lowly and despised--its ensign a cross, and its crown a wreath of
   thorns; in its retinue are the poor and slighted--its badges are
   sorrows, stigmas, and wrongs. It has no splendour of outward array--no
   legions but the army of martyrs--no throne but one that is set in
   heaven. Between these you must make your choice; and yet your choice is
   already foregone and past. It was made for you in your baptism. You are
   set here to witness--by the confession of your baptismal faith, in word
   and deed--by acts of visible worship, especially in the sacrament of
   His death and passion--by visible purity of heart--by a life like
   His--by His light shining in you and from you, overcoming the world, be
   it in the highest or the lowest paths of life, in the homeliest and the
   simplest duties of every day. None are too humble, or too weak, to
   witness for the Holy Name. In the crush and struggle of the world, you
   are on trial at every turn; and your truth, loyalty, and faith, are
   being always proved. A thousand tests touch you on every side: even in
   the still measured round of domestic life, in the home duties of
   parents, children, and brethren, if your motive is His name, and your
   law is His example, if your life be pure and gentle, it bears all day
   long a clear-toned witness for your Lord.

   This, then, is to do all in His name;--to do all for His sake, in His
   sight, and in witness for His person and His kingdom. But who can hear
   it without trembling? If this be our calling, what must be our
   judgment? Our election is fearful and blessed: to live for His name in
   Whose blood alone we can wash our sins, our prayers, and our
   repentance.

   Let us try, as best we may, to lay this great truth to heart, by
   dwelling on some direct and practical inferences from it, bearing upon
   our daily life. It shews us, then:

   1. First, that sin in a Christian is a plain denial of Christ. It
   denies His name more emphatically than to say, "I know not the man." In
   early times, when the Church was under heathen persecution, Christians
   were required by the enemies of Christ to deliver up their sacred
   vessels, the paten and the chalice of the holy Eucharist, and the
   volumes of Holy Scripture. By giving up these consecrated trusts, they
   might make an easy purchase of life; and, more than this, they were led
   to the lighted altars of Pagan worship, and if they would so much as
   cast a grain of incense upon the glowing embers, they were set free.
   But these light acts were pregnant with an intense meaning. They were
   implicit denials of the name of Christ, constructive treason against
   the kingdom of the Son of God. His true servants rather died than deny
   Him by so much as this silent homage to the kingdom of darkness, by the
   slightest ambiguous motion of hands or lips. Such is our probation now.
   The least acts of sin are louder than the loudest recital of the faith.
   One such act drowns all our confessions and creeds. They make
   themselves heard above all our specious and weak words of religious
   intention. One sin of sensuality, pride, falsehood, or malignity,
   deliberately conceived, consciously put in act, is an overt and high
   rebellion. For what is it but to take the side of antichrist, in the
   warfare between heaven and earth--to swell the powers of darkness, and
   to lift up our weapons among the banners of the evil one? Sometimes the
   greatest secret treachery is found under a religious cloak, as in
   schism for spurious charity and lax indulgence of other men's sins. But
   howsoever concealed, it is only an illusion of Satan. Sometimes it is
   by a temper contrary to this. Insubordination, uncharitableness, a
   bitter spirit, selfish insensibility of the spiritual dangers of those
   for whom Christ died, these again are so many denials of His name. What
   will it avail at that day to say, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
   in Thy name; and in Thy name have cast out devils, and in Thy name done
   many wonderful works?" [31] "We have eaten and drunk in Thy presence,
   and Thou hast taught in our streets. But He shall say, I tell you I
   know you not." [32]

   2. And another truth following from the last, is, that worldliness is a
   suppressed contradiction and secret betrayal of Christ. "He gave
   Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil
   world." [33] "The friendship of the world is enmity with God." [34] We
   "cannot serve two masters;" we cannot be a link between two spiritual
   opposites. There is no neutrality between the world and God. God is the
   eternal fountain of truth, purity, and peace. The world without God is
   false, impure, and turbulent; a mighty heaving confusion of fallen
   spirits wrestling with each other and with God. As such the world is in
   eternal opposition to Him. It can only be reconciled by passing out of
   itself into His kingdom; by receiving the laws of truth and obedience,
   of holiness and order, that is, in ceasing to be the world, and being
   taken up into the will of God. Besides the grosser kinds of sensual and
   spiritual evil, this world has a multitude of refined and subtil powers
   of enmity against the Divine will. There is, besides the lust of the
   flesh, also the lust of the eyes; the vain-glory, pomp, glitter,
   ostentation of ease, luxury, and self-pleasing; and there is, moreover,
   the pride of life, the stately self-worship, the fastidious
   self-contemplation of intellectual or secular men. And with this comes
   also a throng of less elevated sins,--levity, love of pleasure, full
   fare, a thirst for money, a hunger for popularity, and its debasing
   successes. These things steal away the heart, and make men false to
   their Heavenly Master. Their obedience becomes habitually double,
   vain-glorious, self-advancing; or heartless, hollow, and reluctant. If
   they do not by express acts betray Him, it is either because they are
   not tempted, or because they would lose in the scale of the world's
   esteem or in their own. Surely there must be something highly incensing
   to our Heavenly Master in such earthly hearts, all fair outside, but
   eaten out by the world even to the core.

   3. Let us, then, learn farther, that obedience in His name, for His
   sake, and in His sight, is the only obedience which is stedfast and
   persevering. It is the only obedience that is sincere. No other
   obedience springs from the heart. This is a principle not to be swayed
   by custom or reputation, or by the maxims and eyes of men. It is always
   the same, in every place, season, and state. All other motives change
   with our outward circumstances, with the judgments, tone, wishes,
   suggestions of those about us. But this is internal, self-supported,
   and unchangeable. And as it never changes, so it is ever gaining
   strength, ever advancing, uniting the whole power of the mind in one
   aim and force, binding all the affections of the heart about the
   conscience and the will, ever growing in self-command, in the pure
   happiness of conscious sincerity, and in the sensitive discernment of a
   tender conscience.

   In such a character all the complex motives of daily life are
   sanctified. The one governing purpose, that is, to do all in the name
   of Christ, consecrates them all. The healthy play of all pure and
   natural affection is not crossed, but perfected by the control of a
   higher principle. God has made man's heart manifold in its thoughts and
   emotions; and for all these He has ordained a manifold counterpart in
   the scheme of perfect obedience. No doubt, when Solomon saw the Temple
   of God rising in silence and beauty, a multitude of thoughts stirred
   within him. The stately shafts and polished corners, the sculptured
   chapiters, and elaborate grace of the house, which was "exceeding
   magnifical," filled his eye and soul with forms of beauty, and
   suggestions of more than visible perfection. There was a pure and
   hallowed pleasure distinct from the one presiding consciousness that
   all this was for the dwelling of the Most High God. So in all the
   sphere of our life. In our homes and relative affections, in our lawful
   use of God's good creatures, in our honest labours, in our temperate
   ease, in all works of mercy and devotion; though a complex multitude of
   thoughts and emotions work upon us, it is but the various movement of
   one manifold and mysterious nature, created in the image of Him Who,
   though manifold, is One. All these motives are pure in His sight, and
   all accepted of Him for Christ's sake, in whose name our highest and
   governing purposes are all conceived. There is no discord so long as
   they are subordinate. As all harmony, however intricate, has some one
   tone high and dominant, by which all are united in a perfect strain.
   And this chief aim, if not always consciously before us, yet may be
   always habitual in our minds. The presence of Christ may be our ruling
   motive, even when the thought of His presence is, for a time,
   suspended. We do not cease to be affected by the will of a friend,
   though we be not always looking upon him. Sometimes the very depth and
   fulness of our habitual feeling makes us less conscious of its detailed
   and momentary action. Like the power of sight and hearing, we do not
   reflect upon them while we hear and see; or like the fondest
   affections, which are seldom uttered, so taken for granted as to he
   passed by in silence, never transgressed, though never abstracted from
   the thoughts and words which flow from them all day long.

   This, then, is our law of life in this confused and perilous world. It
   will be good to try ourselves daily by this rule. The first thing in
   the morning, offer all your intentions and all the works of the day to
   God. During the day, renew this intention by intervals of prayer, or by
   momentary aspirations. Before you begin any new work, ask,--"Am I doing
   this for His name? Can I do this in His sight? Will He accept this as
   done for His sake? Can I ask His blessing upon it? Can I offer it up to
   Him?" If you are met by difficulties, renew the consciousness for Whom
   you are at work. If tempted to impatience or to anger, or to
   resentment, say this holy Name in secret to yourself. If you suffer,
   call to mind, "This I suffer for Him who suffered all for me. This is
   my cross for His sake, the shadow of His cross for mine." Be it
   sickness, pain, anguish, anxiety, sorrow, solitude, it is all one; we
   may join it to His sorrows and to the darkness of His Cross. In this
   you will find consolation, strength, guidance, ever fresh and ever
   near. This will keep your feet in all your ways, be they never so
   slippery, be they never so strait. His Name, through faith in His Name,
   shall hold you up. In a little while, where will be all the things that
   we are fretting about? Where will be honours, wealth, power, ambition,
   high place, science, learning, pleasures, and refinement? Where will be
   home and its soft cares, its keen anxieties, its tender affections, its
   blinding attachments? Where will all these be, when the sign of the Son
   of Man shall be seen in heaven?

   Live, then, in obedience to that great law which binds heaven and earth
   in one. All things on high worship Him; to Him all things in earth and
   under the earth bow the knee. The Name of Jesus is the law of angels,
   archangels, principalities, and powers; it is the healing of penitents,
   the song of God's elect. Be it your motive and your law, and it shall
   be your strength and stay; your shield, and your exceeding great
   reward,

SERMON IV.

  HALTING BETWEEN GOD AND THE WORLD.

    1 KINGS xviii. 21.

   "And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
   between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then
   follow him."

   AFTER the separation of Israel and Judah, the kingdom of Israel fell
   into gross idolatry. Jeroboam, foreseeing that if the people went up to
   Jerusalem to sacrifice in the House of the Lord, they would turn from
   him to the kingdom of Judah, took counsel, and set up two calves of
   gold, and made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest
   of the people. All this he did as a scheme of policy, to keep the
   people of Israel under his allegiance. The effect of it was, that they
   soon fell into the idolatries of the Zidonians and Ammonites. Baal was
   the god of the Zidonians, and his worship was set up by Ahab, through
   his marriage with Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians.
   He also made a grove for the rites of idol worship. Idolatry became the
   popular and national tradition; the whole force and support of public
   opinion sustained it; all the presumptions and usages of public and
   private life were full of it; all things around them confessed Baal,
   his godhead, and his worship. They were thoroughly possessed with a
   belief of his divinity. To dispute it was to attack a sort of religious
   common sense.

   This was the state of Israel when Elijah was sent from God to gather
   out the remnant of His elect. His witness and his miracles had
   confounded, and half convinced the people. Some were, perhaps,
   altogether convinced in secret; but they hung in suspense, wavering and
   doubting what to do. Baal was strong, and his worship was loud and
   splendid. The prophets of Baal were four hundred and fifty, and the
   prophets of the groves four hundred; and they were in the favour and
   protection of the royal house. They did "eat at Jezebel's table." I
   need not recount the detail of this well-known history. In a word,
   Elijah challenged them to a trial on the heights of Carmel. There they
   built an altar, and laid on it a sacrifice, and invoked fire from Baal
   to consume it in token of his power and godhead. And Elijah mocked them
   as "they cried and cut themselves with knives and lancets. "And when
   the heaven was serene and silent, and there was no voice, nor any to
   answer, in the fury of despair they leaped upon the altar and broke it
   down. When mid-day was past, Elijah builded an altar of twelve stones
   in the Name of the Lord, and laid the sacrifice upon it, and poured
   water thrice upon it, and filled the trench round about it with water.
   And about the time of the evening sacrifice, he came near and said, "O
   Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day
   that Thou art God in Israel." "Then the fire of the Lord fell and
   consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the
   dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the
   people saw it, they fell on their faces, and they said, The Lord He is
   the God; the Lord He is the God."

   Now this history strikingly illustrates a very common fault of
   character. I mean, indecision in religion.

   First, we have here a type of the worship of the world set up within
   the Church of God; and of the insensibility which comes upon worldly
   Christians. The greater part of men, if they do not grieve and resist
   the Spirit of their baptism, fall into a low, dim, relaxed
   Christianity, which is the Christianity of the world. They are
   nominally Christians; but splendour, society, rank, high connexions,
   great friends, money, pleasure, and the like, are the real objects of
   their anxiety and labour,--that is, of their worship. To such people
   the rule of life is the custom of the majority. Their standard of
   judgment is the opinion of those by whom they wish to be well thought
   of. They measure their duties by the example of the patrons whom they
   serve or follow. Their maxim and theory of life are founded upon the
   average practice of the society in which they live. Their religion is
   the religion of the greater number. What is practicable in religion is
   what the world will allow them to fulfil. Whatever is beyond it, is
   overstrained, indiscreet, singular, and in bad taste. Sometimes, many
   better qualities are mingled in such minds; as, for example, reverence
   for established usages, the customs of former generations, the names of
   forefathers, and the like. But these, though they mitigate the personal
   fault of yielding to the way of the world, do not change the quality of
   indecision, nor avert the danger of it.

   The effect of all this is, to produce a dulness of spiritual
   perception. Whatever is above the average standard is to them
   enthusiastic and visionary, or conceited and singular. The precepts and
   counsels of devotion and holy living are to them refinements and
   excess. They cannot see them to be a duty, or to be profitable, or even
   to be safe. Such minds have either very faint, or no clear insight or
   faculties of the Spirit, to which you can appeal. The more perfect
   forms of holiness, which ought to be instincts in the regenerate, must
   be laboriously proved to them. The higher those precepts are, the more
   need of proof.

   What is the plain meaning of all this? It is, that the world weighs
   heavy upon the visible mass of Christians, and lowers them to its own
   standard. Only individuals rise above it; and the mass keep each other
   in countenance; denouncing them as dreamers. "The prophets of Baal are
   four hundred and fifty men, and the prophets of the grove four hundred
   men," and "they eat at Jezebel's table." The world loves its own, and
   follows them because they wait upon it.

   But next we see here how light sometimes forces itself upon such
   people. God sends to them a witness and a warning. Sickness, danger,
   the loss of those they love, worldly adversity, such as ruin of
   fortune, disappointments, and the like:--these things make them look
   deeper than the surface. They find the world's religion to be an
   imposture, a conspiracy to keep up a decent appearance, and to keep out
   the stern reality of the Cross. Little by little they begin to see that
   ease, glitter, smoothness, comfort, a free life, a fair opinion of
   themselves, are not the signs of Christ's servants; that in such things
   there are no tokens of the Crucifixion. These are not the array of
   repentance, nor fit trappings for fallen sinners. They begin,
   therefore, to doubt the truth of their past self-persuasion; they begin
   to see that their active thoughts and powers are bestowed with a
   fearful concentration upon this world, and that God and His kingdom are
   but faintly remembered: that their prayers and repentance are not
   states and habits, but momentary acts or feelings. Their whole life of
   private devotion, perhaps, would not fill one hour in the twenty four.
   Whatever is right, this must be wrong. New truths then begin to
   glimmer,--old truths, long slighted, to break out full upon them. They
   see enough to convince them that they cannot go on as in time past;
   that they have been walking in a vain show; that their religion has
   been a dream, and that the world has been their reality; and that this
   is an open contradiction of Divine Truth; for "the world passeth away,
   and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for
   ever."

   They are, in this way, brought to a stand between two things. On the
   one side is the world, as loud, fair, alluring, persuasive, commanding,
   as before. On the other is an inward world, which has burst upon their
   conscience,--awful, majestic, and eternal. Between old habits and new
   convictions, how shall they steer their course? Can they break away
   from the world, forsake its pleasures, refuse its gifts, endure its
   enmity, bear its scorn? Dare they turn from the light of the Spirit,
   the Passion of Christ, the kingdom of God? What shall they do? It is
   not hard to tell what in the end many will do. They will "halt between
   two opinions." They try to reconcile their new and unwelcome
   convictions with their old life of worldly aims and practice. Sometimes
   they plunge into them even still deeper, if by any means they may
   escape the light of truth. But it follows them into every path. They go
   back to the same frivolities and follies, the same hollow vanity and
   noisy levities. They try to drown the warning of Him who stands at the
   door and knocks. But all in vain. His hand has a thrilling stroke,
   which pierces through every other sound;--through the mirth of feasting
   and loud revels, laughter and gladness, and the voice of music. It has
   a thrill which penetrates the ear,--clear, articulate, and emphatic.
   They cannot choose but hear, and know Who calls them. It is the Voice
   come again. They hurry to and fro to elude the pursuit of conscience;
   but go where they will, the truth is there before them. He meets them
   in every house, stands on the threshold of every door, sits at every
   board, is first in every throng. He besets them behind and before, ever
   saying, "How long halt ye between the world and Me?"

   This is not only a very miserable, but a very dangerous state; for such
   people grow to be morally impotent. To know truth, and to disobey it,
   weakens the whole character. Even such truths as they knew and acted on
   before, are enfeebled by it. The whole tone of their character is
   lowered. And with the loss of moral stedfastness comes loss of
   consistency; and with loss of consistency, loss of inward peace: then
   comes irritability of mind; soreness, arising out of self-reproach;
   bitterness to others, because they are galled by themselves. They begin
   to dislike the truth they shrink from, and to rebel against what they
   fear. Religion becomes a sore subject to them; and they grow utterly
   estranged. They lose both their old comfort and their new. According to
   that Divine and just paradox, "Whosoever hath not, from him shall be
   taken away even that he hath." [35] O most miserable religion of the
   world! always promising, and never fulfilling; always fair, and always
   false; strict enough to vex the soul, but not strong enough to cleanse
   the heart; without which cleansing, no man shall see the kingdom of
   God.

   Now, let us not think that this is an extreme or uncommon case. I have
   only stated broadly what in some degree is true of perhaps every one of
   us. It is true of every one who yields to the world more than he feels
   to be right; more than he would, if he dared to break with it: of every
   one who has light higher than his life; convictions beyond his
   practice: of every one who has once been more earnest, and has been
   toned down, or rather dulled and tamed by the world: of every one that
   is easy, consenting, unenergetic, pliant, irresolute in any degree; for
   just in that degree he will halt between the world and God. And who is
   there that can say, "This does not take hold of me?"

   If this be so, let us see what is the reason of it.

   The first reason is, that such people will not decide one way or
   another. Next to wilful sin, indecision is the most pitiable state of
   man. To hang in doubt between time and eternity, the world and God, a
   sin and a crown of life, is, we may believe, if possible, more
   incensing to the Divine jealousy, than open disobedience. It implies so
   much light, and so much sense of what is good, that doubt has no plea
   of ignorance. The irresolution is not in the understanding or in the
   conscience, but in the will. The fault is in the heart. It convicts
   them of the want of love, gratitude, and all high desires after God: it
   reveals the stupor and earthliness which is still upon the soul. It
   proves the absence of faith; of a living consciousness of things
   unseen, and an active power of realising what they believe, without
   which faith is dead. There is upon them a spiritual insensibility, a
   kind of mortal apathy, a listless inattention to any thing which does
   not make itself felt by forcing its presence upon the senses of the
   body. And this at last deadens the perceptions of the soul.

   Such is the moral character of indecision in religion:--surely most
   guilty and ungrateful in His sight Who was pierced for us. To be a
   member of Christ, without an earnest and kindled heart; to look unmoved
   on Him whom we have wounded; for this our Lord has reserved a warning
   of almost unexampled severity. "These things saith the Amen, the
   faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God; I know
   thy works: that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would that thou wert
   cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor
   hot, I will spue thee out of My mouth." [36]

   Another reason of this irresolution is, that sometimes, when people
   have clearly decided in their own minds on the better course, they will
   not act upon the decision. This is the state of many. It is a cheap
   thing to know what is right; to make right decisions; even to resolve.
   The trial is in the act. Many die in their sins, for want of moral
   earnestness to break them off. A weak will is their perdition. But
   there is even a sadder case than the end of those who never begin to
   act upon their faith. There are some who make a struggle, and for a
   while set themselves free, and seem to make their choice for ever.
   After a time they waver; and after wavering, go back. But they are
   never as they were before. As a stream, checked by a momentary dam,
   bursts with greater vehemence; so it is for the most part with
   relapsing Christians. They go back each man to his particular sin, with
   a harder boldness, and a sevenfold greater abandonment of life and
   heart. For instance, worldly people, who have been brought by sickness
   and sorrow to sadder and wiser thoughts, if they go back to the world
   again, are proverbially the most worldly of all. So in other kinds of
   sin: for despised truth deadens the conscience; and light departs from
   those who will not follow it. The darkness of a relapsed soul is of all
   the greatest.

   Now, if this be the cause and the danger of indecision, let us see how
   we may detect and overcome it in ourselves.

   What has been said shews--

   1. That the right way to know the truth, is not speculation, but
   practice; not to reason about it, but to do it. There are many things
   which cannot be proved by reasoning; or if they can, reasoning comes in
   so tardily, as to form no real part of the proof; like as it is in the
   fact of day-light, or of our waking consciousness, or of the sight of
   our eyes. All these are perceived and known in act, by instincts which
   outstrip and go before all reflection. It is by putting the decision of
   the conscience and the will to the test of practice, that we become
   sure we have judged aright. "If any man will do His will, he shall know
   of the doctrine whether it be of God." For instance, people who live a
   free life shrink from a decided course of religion, because they think
   it must be austere and straitened. They would fain taste the peace,
   before they commit themselves to it; and ascertain its freedom, before
   they trust it. When they read, "Delight thyself also in the Lord, and
   He shall give thee thy heart's desire;" they think, If He would give me
   my heart's desire, I would delight myself in Him.' When our Lord says,
   "Ye will not come unto Me, that ye may have life;" they say in
   themselves, Give me life, and I will come;' that is, they would have
   life without coming. In fact, they cannot make up their minds to trust
   God, and take Him at His word.

   And this is specially true in respect to all doctrines of faith. People
   will not believe them till they see the reasons. But they never can see
   the reasons till they have believed. Faith is the condition on which
   we, who were born blind, receive our sight. Intellectual knowledge
   depends in chief on the spiritual perceptions. And spiritual
   perceptions issue out of our spiritual nature, as it is matured by
   faith. But faith is the decision of the soul, trusting itself
   altogether to the hand of God. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
   of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it
   shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he
   that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind, and
   tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of
   the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways." [37] We
   shall never see the harmony of truth, if we first ask for proof. When
   faith has received the doctrine, reason will see it as in the light of
   noon.

   2. Another truth taught us by this is, that the effect of a faithful
   and decided life is to strengthen and confirm the choice we have made.
   There is no knowledge like the knowledge of experience. How hard it is
   to realise the look of any country by description in a book; or to know
   the spirit of a man from his written life: or to appreciate sweetness
   from illustration, or harmony from the written language of music. How
   the least personal experience by sight or hearing gives to all these a
   vividness and reality which makes them at once part of our minds for
   ever. For example, people who live in a habit of prayer will tell us
   that it is full of peace, of a peculiar happiness. They never knew it
   till they tasted it: they never tasted it till they tried it. Take, as
   a proof, those who long shrunk from frequent Communion, partly for fear
   of binding themselves to a stricter life, partly from a notion that
   frequency would produce irreverence or insensibility. Ask them, after
   some years of frequent Communion, they will tell you that they never
   thought to attain such clear and undoubting certainty of the deep
   reality and exceeding reward of that great precept of love: that now
   they have forgotten the duty in the blessedness: that it is not so much
   obedience as delight: that so far from losing the sweetness of that
   Holy Sacrament, they never tasted it before: that now they fear to
   lose, far more than once they feared to approach it: that a new world
   has opened to them, of which the altar is the centre, and the Sacrifice
   which lies upon it is the life. In it they see all God's mercies, the
   incarnation and atonement of His Son, the love of the Holy Ghost. It is
   to them now as a reflection of His goodness and His beauty, His very
   presence and the vision of peace. And so it is in like manner also with
   a life of repentance, from which men recoil as from a life-long
   sadness. Nothing can persuade them that repentance has a peculiar calm
   and joy. In no way can it be realised but by actual participation.
   Every day deepens the sense of the Divine forgiveness: the deeper their
   humiliation, the sharper the yoke upon their neck, the clearer,
   brighter, and more serene their inmost heart, The darker it is to the
   eyes of the world without, the fuller of light within. What the world
   calls ascetic rigour and intolerable gloom, is to them freedom and the
   joy of a holy sadness.

   There is nothing we oftener say than that sorrows are tokens of God's
   love; and yet when they come, how few really so receive them, and give
   themselves up to be led and taught by Him. They shrink, and seek out
   their own consolations, and shape their own ways, with a real though
   disguised feeling that God has made an inroad upon their peace; that
   they must build up again what He has overthrown. And what misery is
   this; to beat ourselves to pieces against the Divine will, which stands
   firm as necessity and iron. Even when we do not directly clash with it,
   yet how sore it is to bear His rod, only because we cannot ward off His
   strokes. How blessed, if we would with a deliberate and decisive choice
   choose what He chooses; and make His will our will, His purpose our
   purpose, and His work our work; so that even in our sorrows we may be
   fellow-workers together with Him, that both by His chastisement and by
   our own desires we may be made "partakers of His holiness." [38] When
   any trial comes, then, let us not halt between His will and our own
   will; but say, "Thou art my God; shew me Thy intent, and accomplish Thy
   perfect work in me." Ask those who have sorrowed after this sort,
   whether even home in its brightest hours had more of peace. Ask even
   those who, after halting long, at last have chosen well, and are now
   entered on the sure though strait path of the Cross. They will tell you
   what is their reward; what they so nearly lost, but now have attained,
   by trusting God, for ever.

   3. Lastly, we may see that where obedience and experience bring
   strength, they give also insight and intuition into the whole range of
   truth. As, for example, we know that God is with us from our childhood;
   but from the time we began to act upon that truth, how different have
   been our perceptions of it. How different has been our sense of awe,
   faith, reverence, in our private prayers, and in public worship; how
   far higher and deeper our belief and knowledge of His mysteries of
   grace, of the Church, and the Holy Sacraments.

   And this intuition spreads outwardly on every side, into the whole
   sphere of our life. All relations, duties, events, are seen under a new
   light; as if, after long twilight, the sun had risen upon the earth. We
   begin to see our real site in God's world, the end of our creation, the
   value of time, the true secret of our own heart, the just price of all
   things that "perish in the using." And this will be found true in the
   whole of our spiritual life.

   But that we may make an end, let us come to particulars.

   Are you conscious of any sin or fault, your chief one, still unsubdued;
   sometimes committed through weakness, sometimes willingly indulged?
   Perhaps you throw this into the general view of your character, as the
   one lingering infirmity, notwithstanding which you may look upon
   yourself to be religious and devout. This is plain halting between God
   and a besetting sin. Sometimes it may be a greater, but for the most
   part it is a lesser sin, as men judge, which holds Christians in their
   irresolute state. A great sin generally decides the balance for itself.
   Carefulness about money, personal vanity, ambition, love of the world's
   honour,--these hold men in a state of religious indecision. Now, are
   they sins or not? If they are not, why does God condemn them? If they
   are, why do you give your hearts into their power?

   And once more: are you conscious of any duty either neglected or seldom
   fulfilled? I will say, the reception of the Holy Sacrament. To come to
   the Blessed Sacrament is either a duty, or it is not. Which is it? If a
   duty, why do you neglect it? If not, why not say so at once? Or if it
   be a duty, why do you come so seldom? If not a duty, why do you come at
   all? Is not this halting between two opinions? Again, the Holy
   Sacrament is either a blessing or it is not. If it be not, why do you
   ever come to it? If it be, how can you turn away? Did our Lord Jesus
   Christ say, "This do in remembrance of Me," or did He not? If He did
   not, why call it a Sacrament? If He did, how can you despise His
   command? What halting and contradiction is all this!

   Perhaps some may say, "All this is right; but I am not fit to come to
   the Holy Communion." And yet this only removes the indecision one step
   higher up. Why do you not make yourself fit? If you are not fit for the
   Holy Sacrament, are you fit to die? or if you hope that you are fit to
   die, are you not afraid of saying that you are not fit for the Holy
   Sacrament? Can you be fit for the greater, and not for the less? Oh,
   let us make up our minds to something; let us be resolved one way or
   the other; let us be either cold or hot; choose life or death. But let
   us not deceive ourselves with a dreamy, heartless, halting
   Christianity. "No man can serve two masters." "Ye cannot serve God and
   mammon." What would you give, upon a death-bed, for one short hour to
   be at last decided? Choose now, and choose wisely; for one false choice
   may become eternal. "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he
   which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let
   him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."
   Oh, just and awful words. Be in earnest one way or the other: for Me or
   against Me. "And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to
   give every man according as his work shall be." [39]

SERMON V.

  THE SINS THAT FOLLOW US.

    1 TIMOTHY v. 24.

   "Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and
   some men they follow after."

   THE special intention of St. Paul in these and the foregoing words, was
   to guide Timothy in the high and dangerous work of ordaining pastors
   for the flock of Christ. But we need not dwell on the context in which
   we read them; for they enunciate a great law in God's kingdom, and
   describe an awful fact in the administration of His perfect justice.
   Some men are open and proclaimed sinners. They stand in the face of the
   Church, and in the sight of God, self-accused, condemned, and branded.
   Their sins go before them as heralds, apparitors, and witnesses,
   carrying the whole history of guilt, with all its circumstance and
   evidence, before the judgment-seat of Christ. The whole life of an open
   sinner is the judicial procession of a high criminal to the bar. It has
   the pomp and solemnity of death about it. The Church casts him forth
   from her altars and from her tribunals. Judgment issues against him by
   a common instinct. Even before the sentence of formal excommunication,
   he is visibly cut off from the mystical body of the Lord Jesus. And
   what is bound on earth is bound in heaven. It is the forerunner and
   visible symbol of the last great award. Such were the sins of apostates
   and of presumptuous sinners in the flesh or spirit, and of the authors
   of heresies and schisms. The whole history of the Church is marked by a
   line of open and barefaced offenders, who have lifted up their heel
   against the Lord, and crucified Him afresh unto themselves. In the
   great conflict of good and evil, they seem to bear a special office; so
   that the manifestation of sin is one of the collateral mysteries of the
   regeneration and perfection of saints.

   Moreover, we see it at this day. The visible Church holds still within
   its outward pale thousands whose lives are their own condemnation: as
   in Philippi, "Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
   you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ."
   These are they whose "sins are open beforehand;" they need no
   penetrating scrutiny, no process of conviction. Their sins go before to
   judgment; sent forward to prepare a place on the left hand of the Judge
   in that great day.

   "And some men they follow after." That is to say, there are men all
   fair without, but within full of disguised and deadly evil. Though in
   their life they be never put to shame, yet in the sight of Him whose
   eyes are as a flame of fire, they are haunted and beset with guilt.
   Secret lusts, long cherished, often indulged, stealthily ventured upon;
   deep subtil intentions, pursued under a cloak of some high profession;
   positive and completed sins, so mixed up with the actings of common
   life as to escape detection. But it does not apply only to these
   grosser forms of sin. There are men who pass for faithful Christians,
   who have free access to the sanctities of the Church; to its offices of
   worship, its sacraments and benedictions. They mix in the fellowship of
   the devout and penitent; they kneel at the altar; they join in acts of
   highest communion. They seem fair and blameless; there is no brand, not
   so much as a spot visible upon them. To our eyes they are not "far from
   the kingdom of God." As they grow old, they grow in reputation. They
   die in honour, and are in high esteem among the faithful. They go to
   meet their Judge; but their sins "follow after." All through life there
   has followed them unseen a throng of sins, concealed, unrepented, or
   forgotten. The sins of childhood, boyhood, youth, and manhood, follow
   on, gathering in number, guilt, intensity; every age bringing in its
   measure of characteristic sins; every year its transgressions, every
   day its provocation;--sins of deed and thought, of desire and
   imagination, of casual self-indulgence and habitual neglect; sins
   against conscience and light, against pleadings of grace, and stirrings
   of the Spirit; breaches of resolutions; contradictions of solemn
   confessions before God; relapses after partial repentance; all these
   mounting up, till from their bulk they spread beyond the field of
   sight, and from their magnitude become invisible. This, perhaps, may
   seem to be an extreme case. Would to God it were so. Will it be
   believed that this is no uncommon instance, not only in people who live
   without God in the world, but also in those whose character is in many
   ways religious?

   Every one confesses it to be true of hypocrites or clandestine sinners;
   but we are now speaking of higher and more hopeful cases. What I have
   described will, on being analysed, be found to be more or less the case
   of multitudes. For instance, this is really the state of thousands who
   have never suspected the possibility of their being in such a
   condition. They have fallen into it, because they never suspected it to
   be possible. There is nothing we are more apt to take for granted, than
   the theory of our acceptance before God. It is disagreeable to think
   ill of ourselves; we are conscious of good intentions; we feel to
   desire the highest and holiest state; sin is both fearful and painful
   to us; after sinning, we cannot be easy so long as we remember it; our
   conscience, as well as our pride is hurt; and we comfort ourselves as
   soon as we can, by thoughts of repentance, and by turning to the better
   side of our character. In this way people get into a habit of consoling
   themselves. They shrink from sterner and deeper truths; shun all high
   standards; keep aloof from the light; and never suspect--as, indeed,
   how can they?--the existence of the evil of which they are unconscious.
   They believe themselves to be, what they know they desire. What they
   are able to discern, they take to be their whole state before God.
   Although at times particular faults distress them, yet their habitual
   consciousness is of the favourable interpretation which men put upon
   their outward life. What they are in God's sight they have never
   suspected, because they have no standard to ascertain, no tests to
   detect it.

   Or, to take another example. This is also the state of those who have
   never, since they came to the full power of reflection, made a real
   examination of their past life. The sins of our early years are but
   imperfectly perceived at the time. It is only by retrospect, and in the
   fuller light of a matured conscience, that their true character is duly
   estimated. The sinfulness of sin consists not only in the specific evil
   of each particular act, but in the whole of our case before God; in our
   relation to Him, His holiness, compassion, and long-suffering; in His
   dealings with us, and our ingratitude, coldness, insensibility, in
   return. Truly to know what we are before God, we must take our whole
   life, with its context, and read it in the light of God's love and
   providential care. Guilt is a complex thing; a balance of many
   particulars on God's part and on ours. It is our sins multiplied by His
   mercies; our transgressions by His gifts of light and grace.

   As another example, we may take those who live without daily
   self-examination. It is impossible for such persons to escape
   self-deception. They become simply and sincerely ignorant of
   themselves. It is perfectly impossible to carry in mind the long
   unbalanced, unexamined account of many years, or even of one year
   alone. It is true in every thing, that neglect in detail is confusion
   in the whole. Sins that are not noted at the time, slip out of sight;
   they pass behind each other. Sins rise one upon another, and become
   foreshortened, so as to hide all but the last of the whole chain. A
   lesser sin which is nearer will hide ten greater if they be farther
   off: a thousand will lie hid behind one. The whole retrospect of a life
   becomes narrowed and shut up into the recollection of a few months or
   days. All that is past goes for nothing; it is as if it did not exist.
   Good were it if it were really so before God; if our forgetfulness
   could blot the book of His remembrance; if what we cease to remember
   were forgotten before the Judge of quick and dead.

   Now, of all such as these St. Paul says that their sins "follow after."
   Let us see what this means.

   1. It means, that all sins have their proper chastisement; which,
   however long delayed and seemingly averted, will, as a general law,
   sooner or later, overtake the sinner.

   I say all sins, because chastisement follows often even upon sins that
   are repented of, as in the case of David; and I say also as a general
   law, because it seems sometimes that God, in His tender compassion to
   individual cases, does hold back the chastisement of His rod, and by
   ways of peculiar lovingkindness make perfect the humiliation of
   particular penitents. It is certain that there are such exceptions. No
   doubt they have their portion of the cross in other and inscrutable
   ways, which make the scales weigh even. In them the cross does the work
   of the rod.

   Nevertheless, these exceptions no more break the general rule, than the
   translation of Enoch and Elijah repeals the sentence of death on sin.
   Our sins follow us by the rod of chastisement. As the sins of the
   fathers upon the children, so the sins of childhood on youth, and youth
   on after years. How little did we know what we were laying up for
   ourselves. How little did we think at that day, in the hour of our
   transgression: This will find me out when I am in middle life, or in my
   old age: though it tarry never so long, it will come at last. And how
   few, when they are visited, lay it to heart, and say: This sorrow or
   this sickness is the just chastisement following upon the sins of my
   life past. These are the scourges of God, which have followed me afar
   off, and now have overtaken me. "Thou writest bitter things against me,
   and makest me to possess the sins of my youth." [40]

   2. Again, past sins follow after sinners in the active power by which
   they still keep a hold on their present state of heart.

   It is one of the worst effects of sin, that, after commission, it
   clings to the soul. Every sin leaves some deposit in the spiritual
   nature. It quickens the original root of evil; it multiplies and
   unfolds its manifold corruption. And worst of all, it brings on a
   deadness and an insensibility of the spiritual nature. The most
   dangerous part of sin is its deceitfulness. Sin can hide itself from
   the conscience. It is most concealed at its highest pitch of strength.
   When at the worst, it is least perceived. Deadly sins, like mortifying
   wounds, have little sensible pain. The cause of most besetting sins,
   and of most sinful inclinations in after life is the indulgence of
   particular sins in youth or childhood. Pride, vanity, selfishness,
   contempt, wrath, envy, scornfulness, and other baser sins, are the
   consequences, or the following of early transgressions. They follow us
   in their moral deterioration. It is so also with the coldness,
   insensibility, indevotion, of which people complain. Some sin
   unrepented or forgotten, and because forgotten, therefore unrepented,
   lies festering in the dark; and the whole character suffers in all its
   parts and powers. It is this that obstructs the whole spiritual life;
   thrusts itself between the soul and the presence of God; bars up the
   avenues of grace; turns the bread of life into a stone; makes the true
   vine seem to be a dead branch; and the communion of Christ's saints to
   be cold and desolate. It is cold to us, and we think it cold in itself.
   Fire has no heat to the dead. Christ did no mighty works among the
   unbelieving. Our early sins of wilfulness, irreverence, self-worship,
   have followed us. As shadows they fall upon our path, and darken our
   hearts, though the light about us "be sevenfold as the light of seven
   days." Temptations cast us down, because within us they have somewhat
   that is in secret league with them. The world overawes us, because, in
   times past, we have wondered after it and worshipped it. Our present
   falls, infirmities, spiritual struggles, afflictions, and dangerous
   inclinations, are for the most part the sins of our past life,
   following us in chastisement, and cleaving as diseases and temptations.

   3. And further, whether or no sins follow in chastisement now, they
   will surely overtake us in the judgment. "Be sure your sin will find
   you out." [41] This is the inflexible destiny of sinners. Secret as
   they may be in this life, all shall be laid open before men and angels
   in the great account. Hidden things shall come forth to confound the
   hypocrite, despised sins to condemn the impenitent. The long quest of
   sin pursuing the guilty shall be ended before the great white throne.
   All masks shall be torn off from all faces there; and we shall be seen
   not as we shew ourselves, but as we are. It will be a fearful meeting
   between a sinner and his very self; when his true self shall confront
   his false; and the multitude of his sins shall clamour on every side.
   Such must one day be the doom of the most successful hypocrite, of the
   fairest and least-suspected sinner.

   So likewise with the self-ignorant, neglectful, self-deceiving. Sins
   they have so forgotten as never truly to repent of, shall be then
   gathered in array. This is the chief danger of spiritual sloth.
   Slothful Christians never really grapple with their sins. They take
   refuge in the generalities of confession, and in set forms of prayer.
   All their faults may be softened, but no one temper is really
   mortified. The moral deterioration of past sin they acquiesce in as
   inevitable, and believe to be beyond all cure in this life, trusting
   that God will somehow cleanse them. Their whole inward being is
   entangled and clouded; no convictions are fully formed, no truths fully
   recognised; they are neither cold nor hot, neither holy nor unholy,
   penitent nor impenitent; but in that fearful middle state for which
   judgment and eternity have no middle doom.

   Who can say what is the burden of sin which rests upon the forgetful,
   negligent, complacent, unexamined, unsifted soul? What a crowd of
   forgotten sins shall follow the unconscious Christian to the judgment!
   The great mass of Christians are neither saintly, nor deliberately
   sinful: and in that mass how much insensibility, how much false
   confidence, how much self-deceit! "Ephraim hath grey hairs upon him,
   and he knoweth it not." [42] "Wo to them that are at ease in Zion."
   [43] "Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
   and some men they follow after." Some men go down unawakened to the
   grave, and "their bones are full of the sin of their youth, which shall
   lie down with them in the dust." [44]

   What sign, then, have we to shew that our sins are not following close
   upon us until now?

   There are only two conditions on which we can be set free from this
   fearful pursuit of sin.

   Either that we have never fallen from our filial obedience, since God,
   in holy baptism, made us to be His children; or that having fallen, we
   have, by a conscious and sincere repentance, arisen and cast ourselves
   at the foot of the Cross. Who is there that will say, that since
   baptism he has not fallen? If there be any, blessed and holy are
   they--sons of the first resurrection, on them the second death hath no
   power, neither, if they persevere, ever shall have.

   But where are they? Then, if we cannot bear this witness, can we say
   that we have, by a deliberate course of self-examination and
   confession, entered upon a life of repentance?

   It was in mercy, for the sake of those who after baptism fell into
   deadly sin, that our Lord Jesus Christ left in His Church the power of
   absolution.

   1 . The first great end of this power was, openly to restore to peace
   both with God and the Church, those who had fallen from the peace
   openly and publicly given to them in their regeneration. And this the
   Church of England every year declares in the Commination service. Nor
   do we declare it only, but openly testify our desire that it may, for
   the health of souls, be restored.

   This power of spiritual discipline entrusted to the Church by our Lord
   Jesus Christ, is inalienable. However bound down by worldly bonds, and
   entangled by the course of our secular state, so as to be for a time
   suspended from activity, there must ever exist an imperishable power of
   judging and chastening sinners now in this life, that their souls "may
   be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." It is indeed much to be desired
   that this godly discipline of repentance were restored. Thousands who,
   in days of ruder but more living faith, would have been chastened into
   penitents, now hide the corruptions which fester inwardly, and die in
   their sins. It is the flock that perishes when the shepherd's staff is
   broken. In this luxurious and unchastened land, it is to be feared that
   multitudes "lie in the hell like sheep," and "death gnaweth upon them,"
   for lack of the loving severity and the stern tenderness of discipline.

   2. But though the first end of this power of absolution be the public
   reconciliation of penitents, yet there is another equally important,
   equally, nay even, if possible, more blessed, and full of Divine
   compassion upon fallen Christians; and that is the private absolution
   to which the Church, in the name of Christ, invites all who cannot
   quiet their own conscience before God. The unbelief and impenitence of
   the world may suspend outward discipline, but the inward consolations
   of repenting Christians are beyond its reach. It cannot thrust itself
   between penitent souls and the pastor who bears the heavenly keys.

   In days when there was more power in faith, more fire in love, more
   abasement in repentance, many of us who pass to and fro unchastened
   would have earnestly prayed to receive the yoke of a salutary penance.
   How do you know but that your sins may be following you now? Many are
   hemmed in by them, and know it not. Guilt hangs upon them, and they are
   not aware. Forgotten sins, though slow, are sure of foot. How have you
   assured yourselves that the sins of childhood, and youth, or of your
   more self-possessed and daring manhood, are put away? They do not
   trouble you. But security is no sign of safety. Your conscience is not
   burdened. But that does not shew that they are taken away. Forgotten
   sins cannot burden us. Sins dimly seen in the twilight of a dull heart
   give little trouble. Insensibility is proof against disquiet:
   unconsciousness leaves no room for compunction. To be free from alarm
   is no sign of true repentance. There must be surer signs than these. It
   may be you will desire upon a deathbed, or in the foresight of death
   approaching, something more than your own self-absolution, to assure
   you that there is no train of sins still following you to judgment. Are
   you so sure that you can make no mistake in this? And what if you be
   mistaken? What if, at your passing hour, you wake up under the flood of
   eternal light, and see yourself all soiled and spotted with forgotten
   unrepented sins? We can make this mistake but once: and what a doom
   hangs upon that once! O better ten thousandfold is all humiliation, all
   bitterness, all shame, a whole life of penance, a whole age of sorrow
   in this present time, than to run into so much as a shadow of peril,
   lest death should first reveal to us this one eternal mistake. How far
   wiser in their generation are the children of this world! Who dresses
   his own wounds, or plays the physician to his own fevered pulses? Who
   is his own pleader in a charge of life or death? Who counsels himself
   even in the vilest matters? And yet for the healing of the soul and for
   the judgment after death, we are all supremely skilled. Alas for us! If
   a mistake can be our ruin, here is one upon the threshold; a mistake
   fraught with eternal perils; the forerunner, it may be, of that mistake
   which is everlasting. It is in pity and tenderness to our infirmities
   of ignorance and fear, that our Lord Jesus Christ has committed to His
   pastors the keys of His heavenly kingdom. He has, by the Spirit, given
   His pastors [45] to the Church, that they may be the guides of sinners,
   and safeguards against self-deceit. It is a benign and loving
   appointment of the Good Shepherd; for after He has marked us for His
   own, we may still perish by our own self-guidance. Happy are they who
   from early childhood have been under a pastor's care; who have been
   thereby restrained from the blind and deadly wanderings of sin. What
   makes men so unwilling to accuse themselves before God, in the hearing
   of His servants, but that long years of self-guidance, or rather of
   self-deceit, have heaped up a multitude of sins before which their
   hearts die away for fear and shame? The longer they keep silence, the
   harder it will be to speak at last. Happy they whom early guidance has
   kept from the shame by keeping them from sin. But happy only in the
   next degree are they to whom God in His love gives grace to break the
   proud or trembling silence of their hearts by a full confession.

   Now, what are the pleas that people make for keeping aloof from this
   office of mercy? They are only two. One is to say, "My conscience is
   not burdened." But how do you know that your conscience ought not to be
   burdened? Are you the best, the most discerning, the most impartial
   judge? May not this very feeling be your one eternal mistake?

   The other plea is, "I repent, and all sins are forgiven to a penitent."
   Yes, but this touches the very quick. Are you so sure that you do
   repent? Is it so easy to be a penitent, that you can forego the office
   of grace especially ordained for penitents? Are you so sure that your
   repentance is not the repentance of fear, that it is perfect in its
   extent, that it is fervent in its spirit; that it is the sorrow of pure
   love; that you have made due restitution in kind and in measure; that
   your confessions are without extenuations, and your self-examination
   without self-deceit? Are you sure of all this? Then you have one great
   reason to mistrust yourself; I mean, because you are so sure. If you
   were less satisfied, you might be surer; because you are so sure, you
   have most reason for misgiving. Why leave any room for danger in a risk
   so great? Make all doubly sure. Ask of God grace to know yourself, and
   to lay yourself open with a full and true confession. Make the
   revelation of your sin, which, after all, must come upon the unwilling
   at the last day, to be now your free and penitential choice. Anticipate
   a shadow of the confusion which must cover all faces, when all hidden
   things shall be brought to light before men and angels. Let us not
   deceive ourselves. Because we are not open sinners, let us not be too
   secure. "Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
   and some men they follow after," stealthily and surely, like shadows,
   cleaving to the whole man--turning as we turn--dwelling where we
   abide--mysterious and inseparable.

   Let us never believe ourselves to be secure, till we have washed the
   Feet that were wounded for us, with the tears of a living, purifying
   sorrow. Let us make haste to accuse ourselves at the foot of the Cross.
   Thither our sins cannot follow us. There only can we be safe from their
   pursuit. But let us not cheat ourselves by an imaginary conversion, or
   by a mock repentance. If you touch the Cross, it will leave its mark
   upon you. If you bear no print of the Cross, be sure that you have
   never touched it yet. Sorrow, humility, self-denial, a tender
   conscience, a spirit of love, these are "the marks of the Lord Jesus,"
   the prints of the nails, and the pledges of our pardon. Slack not your
   repentance, till you have made these your own.

SERMON VI.

  SELF-DECEIT.

    PROVERBS xxviii. 26.

   "He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool."

   BY these words the inspired writer condemns the folly of those who take
   counsel of no one but themselves. He means that whosoever trusts his
   own heart as his light, adviser, and guide, in the complex ways and
   actings of life, is a fool. Half the wisdom of the wise is in the
   choice of their advisers. Wise men discern wisdom in others, and call
   them to council: the wisest man is he who least trusts himself alone.
   He knows the difficulties of life and its intricacies, and gathers all
   the lights he can, and casts them upon his own case. He must, in the
   end, act on his own responsibility; but he seeks all counsellors, the
   experienced, and impartial, sometimes the opposed and unfriendly, that
   he may be aware on all sides; for "in the multitude of counsellors is
   safety." [46]

   There is wisdom in the choice of advisers, as there is also folly. This
   is noted as the folly of Rehoboam, that he passed by the aged, and took
   the counsel of the younger. [47] Unwise men call in only those that
   will advise what they have already determined to do; that is, not to
   advise, but to supply pleas and excuses. This is a high pitch of folly;
   but the highest of all is, to have no counsellor; to take no advice; to
   act upon our own lights alone; to trust our own heart. This, Solomon
   says, is to be a "fool."

   In all the action and probation of life, the chief and universal
   element in our responsibility is our own character. It enters into
   every thing; into every deed, word, and thought. Our whole life, both
   active and passive, even to its remotest relations with those about us,
   our judgments, inclinations, and opinions, will be what we are. Like an
   instrument out of tune, or a rule out of square, any imperfection and
   the particular measure of it will be perpetually reproduced. A biassed
   wheel, if it run a thousand years, will never run true. So it is with
   our hearts. Whatever be our resolutions, convictions, wishes,
   intentions, all will come out at last just as we are ourselves.

   Therefore we may take these words of the book of Proverbs for a warning
   to seek self-knowledge; and as a first step to self-knowledge, they bid
   us beware of trusting our own heart: or we shall but see ourselves, in
   a high moral sense, to be "fools," at last.

   But it may be asked: Is not the heart God's creation and God's gift?
   Did He not plant eyes in it, and give to it light, and discernment to
   guide our ways? Is it not our truest personal guide, given, to each one
   of us, by God Himself? Why must a man who trusts his own heart be a
   fool? Let us see why this is said; and why Holy Scripture, that is, God
   Himself, denounces self-trust with such condemnation.

   First, because our hearts, that is, we ourselves, are ignorant of
   ourselves. If we knew ourselves, we should not trust ourselves; we do
   so because we do not know what we are. We are by nature, and still more
   by personal act, sinners. And sin blinds the heart; so that the more
   sinful, the less it knows its sinfulness: for like death, which is most
   evidently perceived by the living, not at all by the dead, and by the
   dying only in the measure in which their living consciousness is still
   retained; so it is with sin dwelling in us. The dulness and coldness
   which brood upon a soul where the love of God is not, make it
   insensible to sin. For what is sin? Is it not the rebellion of the will
   against the will of God? and the withdrawal of the creature from that
   service and end for which he was created? God made us for Himself, to
   love, serve, obey, and worship Him. This is our end, as much as the end
   or office of the sun is to give light by day. As long as creatures
   fulfil the end for which God made them, they conspire and meet in His
   presence and will; and so long they are full of light. They know
   themselves by knowing Him, and see themselves by seeing Him. He is the
   key of their being, the centre and interpretation of themselves. Such
   is the state of holy angels and of all spirits in heaven. And such was
   man before he fell. While he knew himself, he trusted in God; when he
   trusted himself, he became ignorant, and fell. And sin hid him from
   himself. He knew that he was naked; but he did not know that he had
   fallen from the end for which he had been created. And here is the
   great source of all sin, the chief productive spring of all evil upon
   the face of the earth. "Because they did not like to retain God in
   their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind." [48] "When
   they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful:
   but became vain in their imagination, and their foolish heart was
   darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools." [49]
   They became ignorant that God was the end for which they were
   made,--that He created man for Himself. This is the state of every man
   who is not converted to God by the Spirit; and they who are so
   converted, always mistrust themselves: for habitual self-mistrust
   abides with true conversion. But for the rest, who are either wholly or
   in part turned from God to themselves, they make to themselves a new
   end, for which they imagine that they were created; and that end, in
   some form or other, is self. It may be gross indulgence of self, as in
   sensuality; or it may be refined, as in spiritual pride; but gross or
   refined, it is all one. Their being does not terminate upon God, and
   centre in Him, but in and upon themselves; and therefore they can have
   no true knowledge of sin, not knowing the terms, so to speak, of their
   creation. Not to love God, not to serve God, not to obey God, is no
   perceptible sin to them: at most it is only a negative sin. Not to
   love, serve, and obey Him supremely is no sensible sin, so long as they
   do so in some measure. The proportions of their duty in relation to Him
   are lost. Again, where His will is but faintly perceived, how can they
   be conscious of their own high and direct variance with it? In a
   contradiction there must be two opposites: where one is indistinct, the
   contradiction dies away. So, the less vividly they are conscious of
   God's will, the less they can feel the contradiction of theirs to His.
   Their whole interior being is confusion and darkness, in which law and
   order are lost. This is the state of our hearts by nature, and even
   after our regeneration, if we fall into habitual sin, until we are
   turned to God by the Spirit of holiness and of repentance. So long as
   we live either in sin, or in a slothful, indevout, though pure and
   amiable life, we can never really know for what we were created; what
   is the office of our wonderful and fearful nature; what are its
   capacities and powers, its relations and laws; and what, founded on all
   these, are our duties, and, therefore, our sins. How, then, shall any
   man but a fool trust his own heart? It is ignorant of its own
   constitution, its own end, its own destiny. Apart from God it is
   darkness and disorder; all its powers and emotions cross and mislead
   each other: so that at last we come to believe that each man is a world
   in himself, created for self-guidance, which ends in self-worship. This
   may sound harsh and overstated; and yet what, I would ask, is a proud
   man but a self-worshipper? and what is self-trust but self-guidance?
   What are ambitious, or worldly, or covetous, or selfish people, but
   their own gods? Their chief love, will, and obedience, are given to
   themselves; and what but this is worship? Does this sound hard? So does
   all truth which is too stern to yield, and too real to compromise. Such
   being the state of all except those who, through a spirit of
   humiliation and self-abasement, mistrust their own hearts, what must we
   call them? what must we call the world--the lofty, splendid,
   overwhelming, gorgeous world--and all its million tribes of servants,
   followers, lovers, friends, and courteous observers? Do they, or do
   they not, know the end of their creation? If they do, how dare they
   revolt from it? If they do not, how can they know themselves? And who
   is there among them that does not trust his own heart, except when his
   money or his interest for this life is concerned? Where is the worldly
   man who, in matters of honour and dishonour, right and wrong, sin and
   duty, wisdom and folly, religion and faith, death and judgment, heaven
   and hell, does not with confident assurance trust his own heart? For
   these things, all are able, all are skilful, all are wise. To doubt it,
   is to impeach them in their loftiest capacity. The few who mistrust
   themselves in these things are in their eyes superstitious, slavish,
   unmanly. The world lives by self-trust, and each man keeps up his
   fellow: nothing is so disturbing as the falling away of a bold
   companion. It is like a passing bell in the music of a feast; or a
   sudden death in the full tide of revelling. Such is the state of this
   fallen world, even of people baptized and outwardly Christian. A deep
   ignorance both of God and of self broods in secret on their souls: even
   pure, blameless, upright, benevolent men--many, too, who pass for
   devout, and in the habit of their life are outwardly observant of
   religion--come under this alarming sentence. In the sight of God we are
   told that they are "fools." And what is the sign? It is this: that in
   their judgment of God's will and service, of their own intentions and
   motives, of their own state and character, they trust their own heart.

   Let us take another reason. Not only is the heart ignorant of itself,
   but it deceives itself. Of course these cannot be altogether separated.
   Every one who is ignorant is, in one sense, a self-deceiver; and yet it
   may not be with any laboured illusion. Ignorance is absence of light:
   self-deceivers have light, and visions in that light; but those visions
   are illusions. Ignorance is the danger of unawakened minds; self-deceit
   of the awakened. It is chiefly, though not exclusively, a religious
   temptation; and we are only concerned, at present, to regard it in the
   latter form.

   As we have said, it is one of the miserable effects of the loss of love
   to God, that sins are not naturally hateful to us. We commit them
   readily, and alas, eagerly, from our childhood; with no sensible pain,
   but with a fearful delight. If we loved God, every sin, even in
   thought, would be as a drop of molten lead: it would sear and pierce us
   with anguish. But through our sinfulness it is to us as the droppings
   of the honeycomb. And as we early begin to sin, so we lose the little
   fear which, at first, came over us. We get to sin freely and easily,
   and to form a ready habit, which grows into a second nature, and passes
   into the unconscious emotions of our minds. What we have done from
   childhood, we grow even to believe to be right, or at least not wrong;
   to be venial, or to be indifferent; or what is more likely, by custom
   we lose the consciousness of what we do; and so go on unawares in
   things which make others tremble; and, if we could do them now for the
   first time, would make us stand aghast. So sins grow up, little by
   little, towering unseen to a great height, but hiding themselves from
   our hearts. What is more common than to see men characteristically
   marked by some one sin, which they pointedly censure in others, and
   from which they believe themselves to be absolutely free? It has almost
   become a proverb, that a man's besetting sin is that one sin which
   every body knows but himself. We find this, of course, in its broader
   and grosser forms among worldly and indevout people; but it is equally,
   though more secretly, true of persons in the main religious. What is
   more common than to say, "How wonderful it is that such a person cannot
   see what every body else knows; that he should sincerely believe
   himself to be not so much as tempted to faults which manifestly govern
   his whole mind?" These unsuspected sins are almost universally the
   faults of childhood and early youth, which have become habitual and
   unconscious: for instance, personal vanity, selfishness, a difficult
   and disputatious temper, impatience, resentment, unreality, and the
   like. And they who have these faults in them by long habit, generally
   excuse themselves by ascribing the same to others on whom they have
   inflicted them; as if the wind should chide the roughness of the sea
   for disturbing its repose, all the while believing itself to be at
   rest.

   The same effect, which appears in casual temptations, is more
   dangerously produced in deliberate motives and lines of conduct. An
   early habit of personal vanity, or desire of wealth, sometimes
   unconsciously governs a person's whole life. All thought, labours,
   sacrifices, aims, calculations, are made, not with a present sense of
   vanity or covetousness, but in a direction, along the whole course of
   which both these faults will be indulged: the aim of their whole life
   being just such as a vain and covetous mind would most desire to
   attain. And yet it may be that numberless secondary and contingent
   events may come in, to make such a line at least not unreasonable, and
   perhaps even a duty. But either way the besetting sin converts it to
   its own food and service. It feeds and serves itself of that which
   perhaps the providence of God has ordained for His own glory. The
   majority of people judge of such persons by the ordinary tests of life
   and of the world, and see nothing in them but what is straightforward;
   and they, of course, entirely believe the same themselves: but those
   who know them from within unravel the double fibre of their motives,
   and can clearly distinguish the seeming from the true thread which
   guides their whole life. The same also is true of worse passions, such
   as jealousy, envy, and resentment, which sometimes govern from a secret
   chamber, and unconsciously to the man himself, the career of a whole
   life.

   Thus far I have spoken chiefly of the self-deceit we put upon ourselves
   in matters relating to this world and to our neighbour.--The gravest
   part still remains; I mean, the deceit we practise upon ourselves as to
   our state before God. The same unconsciousness which conceals from us
   our habitual sins, such as anger, or envy, and the like, conceals also
   the impatience and stiffness of our will towards God, and our want of
   gratitude and love, our indevotion, and sluggishness in the spiritual
   life. All these, having been upon us from our earliest memory, have
   become our natural, and, if I may use the word, our normal state. We
   have never known any other; we have no perception of any higher
   spiritual condition even by way of idea, than either our own as it is,
   or by advancing in degree, as it may become. The want of such a
   standard makes us to be a standard to ourselves. We confess, indeed,
   that we are not perfect; that we have many weaknesses and many faults;
   but we think them little and superficial, attaching loosely to the
   surface of our character. And this want of a quick sense of sin makes
   us slow to note what we do amiss. It has all our life long deadened our
   present consciousness of having done wrong; so that one of the effects
   of this unconsciousness is, a ready habit of forgetting our sins from
   childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youth, from youth to age, from
   year to year, at last from day to day and hour to hour, until the
   insensibility becomes continuous, and is broken only by great falls;
   and even these are little appreciated. Such a heart becomes, at last,
   swathed in its own self-trust; and we watch it as we do the rash
   motions of a man who walks blindfold, reeling in the midst of dangers,
   which might sometimes, for a moment, provoke our mirth, if it did not
   always excite alarm. Such self-deceivers comfort themselves with the
   belief of habitual good intentions, being unconscious of their past and
   present self; and so go on before God, approaching Him without fear,
   even within the precincts of His altar. I am not describing the
   character of a gross sinner; but of many who are outwardly pure and
   upright; even of some who have lived from childhood without great
   falls, in a life fair and unmarked, while spiritual faults of a high
   and perilous kind have grown up unperceived, and wrought themselves
   into the texture of their whole character. So that what they most
   believe themselves to be, is furthest from the truth, and what they
   least suspect, they really are. But no power of man can persuade them
   of this fact. Though all the world beside see it at a glance, they
   still trust their own heart.

   This deceit is often not only not corrected, but very much aggravated
   by the growth of religious knowledge and religious practices. But this
   leads us to another cause, which must be taken by itself.

   Another reason why to trust our own hearts is a note of folly, is
   because they flatter us. Hitherto we have spoken of self-deceit as
   hiding from us our besetting faults. Self-flattery imposes upon us with
   the conceit of our own excellence. And this is specially the danger of
   such characters when they become affected by religion. The mature
   intellect is able to apprehend in outline, and with great fulness, the
   description of the spiritual life, and of the saintly character, which,
   under our common condition, it requires many years of devotion and
   discipline really to attain. By a sort of creative imagination, and a
   skill of poetry or oratory, people impress themselves, and others
   sometimes, with the belief that they are what they describe. High
   speculations, and the excitement of talking, carry minds upward into a
   height where they soar in religious fancies; broken only by the next
   slight temptation, or the next call to an irksome duty. But for this
   there is a ready provision. It is their unhappy lot, they think, being
   inwardly called to the contemplation of Mary, to be against their will
   entangled in the cares of Martha. In this way they dream on, investing
   themselves with fictitious characters; playing at saintliness, as
   children imitate their elders. Personal vanity, which in other
   characters takes the direction of ostentatious accomplishments, showy
   dress, egotistical conversation, or concealed invitation of flattery,
   secretly intoxicates itself, in such people, by an imaginary
   participation in the mind of saints. We turn from it, perhaps, when it
   is thus nakedly expressed. But let us remember that to invest ourselves
   with any measure of sanctity which we do not possess, is a measure of
   the same self-flattery. It pleases our self-love. It soothes us. It
   allays the pain of thinking that we are sinners; that some of our past
   sins are hateful, many of our present faults shameful and odious. How
   long have we gone on persuading ourselves that we are meek, poor in
   spirit, makers of peace, merciful, patient, and the like, because we
   assent in desire and will to the Beatitudes, and would fain share in
   their benedictions! How long have we persuaded ourselves that we pray
   both often and enough, earnestly and with devotion; that we love God
   above all, and above all desire so to love Him; that our life is, on
   the whole, not unlike the great Example of humility; and that we know
   our own hearts better than any one can tell us! And yet, what does this
   last persuasion shew? Why are we so sensitive under a reproof? Why do
   we accuse ourselves freely of all faults but the one imputed? Why are
   we never guilty in the point suspected? Why do we wholly guide
   ourselves, and feel so great security in our own direction? but because
   we trust our own hearts. Out of this proceed our visions of devotion,
   our imaginations of sanctity. It is a forge never cold, always at work,
   forming and fashioning devices, which please us by their fair and
   shapely forms, and flatter us, because they are a homage to ourselves.

   Such is our heart; by nature blind, a deceiver, and a flatterer; always
   hiding its own face; shifting one motive for another, changing our
   intentions in the very moment of action, and our aim even when the wish
   is half accomplished; turning aside the reproofs of love, and filling
   us with soothing falsehoods; drawing a veil over sins past, and
   beguiling us with the thought of our present integrity; shrouding us in
   perfect ignorance of self, while it persuades us of our complete
   self-knowledge.

   What a contrast before the Searcher of hearts was Mary the sinner and
   Simon the Pharisee! He was of no ill life, no sensual indulgence, no
   cherished, conscious sins: in his own eyes pure, upright, zealous, and
   devout; in the eyes of the Redeemer, thankless, loveless,
   self-deceived. "Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou
   gavest Me no water for My feet: but she hath washed My feet with tears,
   and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest Me no kiss: but
   this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss My feet. My
   head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed My
   feet with ointment;" [50] And all this becomes seven-fold more
   dangerous when, as often happens, such people believe themselves to
   know their own hearts by the light of God's Spirit. The self-deceit
   then becomes intense. It is a part of their religion to believe that He
   has revealed their sin to them; a point of duty not to doubt that their
   view of themselves is the right one. Mere men of the world see through
   the delusion. The clear, strong, common sense of mankind is offended,
   not without just cause, at the proud and provoking unreality of
   religious self-deceit.

   If this be so, if we be our own deceivers, what security shall we take
   against our own hearts? Out of many we can now take only two.

   1. The greatest security against deceiving ourselves by trusting our
   own hearts, is a careful information of conscience. But this plainly
   runs beyond the period of our responsibility into the account of those
   to whom our childhood was subject. Early training is the fountain from
   which good or evil chiefly flows. The conscience of children is their
   first and highest faculty. Blessed, so far as outward aid can make him,
   is the child who is early taught to know the nature of sin, not only as
   a thing simply wrong or shameful, but as a stain on our Baptism, a
   grief to the Spirit of holiness, a fresh wound in Him who was
   crucified, and a rebellion of our will against the will of God. The
   knowledge of sin in its principle is necessary to explain the nature of
   our temptations, and of the sins of our hearts. From this one truth,
   steadily applied to ourselves, comes a knowledge of our real dangers
   and inclinations. God alone can tell from what evils, committed in
   ignorance both of sin and of ourselves, such an early information of
   the conscience would restrain us. A knowledge of sin in itself would
   interpret to us the true moral character of our own conduct, and all
   its intricate facts of thought, word, and deed. We might, indeed, still
   deceive ourselves; but it would be harder to do so. And this knowledge
   of ourselves, beginning when as yet there is little to be known, makes
   clear the field in which the growth and changes of character are to be
   observed. Our chief difficulty is in the attempt to analyse the
   confused and hardened mass of self, neglected for twenty, thirty, half
   a hundred years; to unravel a world of knots and entanglements; to find
   the beginning of the clue. It is almost impossible to do by retrospect
   what it is even easy to accomplish by continuous watchfulness,
   beginning in early years. Self-examination begun late in life must
   remand the chief part of its discoveries to the day of judgment. It is
   a fearful thought that we may then remember, for the first time, sins
   of which we ought to have spent a life in repenting.

   Another benefit of this early information of conscience is, that we
   should be preserved from the stunning and deadening insensibility which
   early sins bring upon us. There is, as we have seen, a sort of
   self-concealment, by which sin secretes itself the more invisibly while
   it becomes the more dominant in us, It would also be impossible for a
   conscience, early enlightened as to the nature of sin, to deceive
   itself with imaginations which, springing only from fancy and
   self-love, are contradicted by all the discernments of the higher
   spiritual judgment. But all this is both so self-evident and so full of
   thoughts, that we can do no more than touch upon it. No words too
   strong can be found to urge on parents and guides of children to begin
   the information of the conscience as early as the information of the
   reason; and in doing so, not to content themselves with repetitions of
   texts and catechisms, but to proceed to clear and detailed explanations
   of the law of God, the nature of sin, and the office of conscience
   itself. And further, let them remember that, when they offered their
   children to God in holy Baptism, they thereby committed them to His
   pastors. Perhaps one ofthe greatest evils of this day, most fruitful of
   sin, and fraught with peril to the soul, is the neglect of parents in
   not putting their children, one by one, from the age of responsibility,
   under the guidance of their pastors. Until this be done, there can be
   no sufficient instruction of the conscience; no extensive security
   against self-trust and self-deceit; and no adequate cure of the unknown
   spiritual diseases which begin in childhood, and cling to the soul, it
   may be, for ever.

   2. The other security is the only one which remains to those who have
   never enjoyed the first; and that is, to take the judgment of some
   other person, instead of trusting in themselves. It will be, no doubt,
   painful and distressing; it will bring shame and burning of face. But
   is not the stake worth the cast? And are we not in earnest to be saved?
   It is of little use, indeed, to advise people who are not in earnest.
   Let us speak only to such as know the weight of sin, the worth of one
   soul, the difficulty of the narrow path, the horror of the second
   death. If we would really know ourselves, we must begin by taking for
   granted that we are most likely to be deceived in our own case. We
   advise others better than ourselves; so would they us again. It is a
   proverb as wide as the world, that a man is not to be trusted in a case
   where he is a party. And when are we more of partisans than in judging
   of our own character? However truly the needle may commonly point in
   the open sea, there are stations where allowance must be made; that is,
   it can be no longer trusted. So it is with our sincerest intentions. We
   acknowledge it in matters of this world's honour and wealth: but there
   is no subject in which we are so unworthy of trust as in judging of our
   faults; partly because a misjudgment involves no present loss, and
   partly because self-love outweighs the whole weight of the soul. We
   may, indeed, take it as a test of sincerity and of reality, and all but
   assure ourselves, that a man who sticks to his own view of himself
   against the judgment of others, is either not in earnest, or, in the
   grave and divine sense of Holy Writ, "a fool;" that is, rash, blind,
   and self-deceiving. How little do we lay to heart, who he is that would
   fain stop our ears against all advisers. And the man who takes counsel
   of nobody is his easy prey. What a spectacle is a self-trusting heart
   in the sight of holy angels--of those whose eyes are open, and whose
   office of love it is to watch over us against the powers of darkness
   which hover on all sides, night and day. If in childhood we lost the
   blessing of guidance, let us not lose it now. We lost it then through
   no fault of ours; now the fault will be wholly our own. Let us do now
   what we shall desire that we had done when we come to die. At that day,
   it may be, we shall say, "Would God I had trusted all the world rather
   than myself; even my enemies would have taught me self-knowledge; from
   what sins and faults should I have been preserved; from what thoughts
   which haunt me now; from what fears which appal me; from what
   hindrances which slacken my repentance, and beat back my prayers. I see
   now what I might have seen from the beginning. I was warned, but I did
   not believe. I was lovingly withstood, but I would not be persuaded.
   Now all is too clear. God grant it be not all too late."

SERMON VII.

  THE FREEDOM OF THE REGENERATE WILL.

    ROMANS viii. 19-21.

   "The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation
   of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not
   willingly, but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same, in hope.
   Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of
   corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."

   IN these words St. Paul is contrasting the state of the unregenerate
   world with the state of the Church, which is born again through the
   Spirit of Christ. By the creature,' he intends the whole creation of
   God--the entire work of the six great days. He speaks of it as of one
   living and manifold person, stretching forth its head and its hands for
   deliverance from some oppressive burden, straining its sight in earnest
   longing for some great revelation of God. By this he means the silent
   anguish, as it were, of the whole inanimate earth, and the universal
   sorrows of mankind under the dominion of the fall. For the whole
   creation of God was brought into bondage to corruption, that is, to sin
   and death, not by its own act and will, but by the first father of all,
   in whom all fell. And yet not without a hope even from the beginning;
   because through the seed of the woman there was promised a redemption,
   by which the creation of God should be once more restored to freedom
   and to glory.

   But though St. Paul speaks inclusively of the whole creation, even of
   the lower animals and of the world of nature, on which the tokens of
   the fall have manifestly passed, he speaks emphatically of mankind, and
   chiefly of the Gentiles.

   By the bondage of corruption, he means the kingdom of Satan, which
   weighed upon every living soul--the mighty and ever multiplying
   tradition of sin, which for four thousand years had been gathering and
   growing in breadth and intensity over the face of the whole earth; the
   lineal and accumulated inheritance of personal and national wickedness,
   quickened by lusts, idolatry, sensual philosophies, atheism, tyranny,
   and bloodshed; towering to its height in the great empire of Home;
   which embodied, as it were, in one visible form, the kingdom of death;
   the death both of body and of soul, in this world and in the world
   beyond the grave.

   And yet in all this misery and anguish there was an inextinguishable
   consciousness of a holier origin and of a higher destiny. The Gentile
   world was conscious of its own debasement; and, by ten thousand voices,
   uttered a lamentation, a kind of dim prophecy of its own deliverance.
   It had still enough of spiritual life to sorrow and to yearn after
   purity and the revelation of God. By its very expectation, it
   prophesied of the day when the feet of Evangelists should bring glad
   tidings of good upon the dark mountains. The call of the Gentiles,
   which the Church of Israel foretold by inspiration, the nations of the
   earth prophesied by earnest waiting and desire. There were spiritual
   attractions drawing together as the fulness of time came on, preparing
   the hearts of God's elect for the gift of eternal life.

   And this leads to the true meaning of the words, "the manifestation of
   the sons of God," and "the glorious liberty of the children of God."
   They mean the state of the regenerate, on whom was shed abroad the
   spirit of adoption; that is, the members of Christ's mystical body, who
   were taken out of the dead world, and grafted into the living Church;
   over whom sin and death had no power of condemnation. In many places of
   the New Testament, the great grace of the Gospel is declared to be the
   adoption; that is, the grace and state of sonship. As in this chapter,
   "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For
   ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have
   received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The
   Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children
   of God." [51]

   So again St. Paul says to the Galatians, "When we were children (that
   is, in spiritual life), we were in bondage under the elements of the
   world: but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His
   Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were
   under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because
   ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your
   hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but
   a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ." [52] Again,
   to take only one more of many passages: St. John says, "Behold, what
   manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be
   called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it
   knew Him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
   appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we
   shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is." [53] In all these
   places we are taught, that we are now the sons of God; and that there
   is, in virtue of our sonship, an inheritance, a fuller manifestation of
   grace, yet to come. "If children, then heirs, heirs of God, joint heirs
   with Christ." "We know not what we shall be." "We shall be like Him."
   And this exactly interprets the words of St. Paul in this place. He
   speaks of the yearning of the creation of God, and of the Gentile
   world, for "the manifestation of the sons of God;" and then he adds,
   "and not only they, but ourselves also, which have received the
   first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
   waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body." They
   yearn to be like us; we, to be "like the angels of God." Though we are
   manifested as His sons, we are not yet made perfect: though in our
   spiritual life we have been "delivered from the bondage of corruption,"
   yet in the body we must still die; we must wait for the resurrection,
   when He shall make the body of our humiliation like to the body of His
   glory. [54] And this explains also the meaning of the word
   regeneration,' which St. Paul uses of Baptism. It is the grace of the
   new Birth, "the laver of regeneration," the being "born of water and of
   the Spirit." By our blessed Lord it is used also of the resurrection,
   when the work of regeneration shall be made perfect by the redemption
   of the body. "Ye that have followed me, in the regeneration when the
   Son of Man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit
   upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel:" [55] for our
   salvation is all one work, beginning at our baptism here, and carried
   on to the day of the resurrection, when all shall be made like Him, by
   the vision of Himself.

   The plain meaning, then, of the text is that the whole world, conscious
   of its disinheritance, is crying aloud for the spirit of adoption,
   which is even now about to be shed abroad. The nations are teeming with
   gifts of secret grace which shall be gathered and compacted, by the
   power of a new birth, into the mystical body of Christ: they are
   waiting and breaking forth in impatient desire for the message of life,
   which the Father gave to His Son, and His Son hath given unto us. Out
   of that dark waste shall spring up sons and saints of God. "He will
   destroy the face of the covering, and the vail that is spread over all
   nations;" and the powers of the regeneration and of the resurrection
   shall work throughout mankind, casting forth the first and the second
   death, and healing the wounds of all creatures. Upon us who have been
   called this work is already begun. We are united to the Son of God, and
   are made partakers of His life, death, and resurrection. All that He
   has accomplished in His own Person is made ours by the free gift of
   God. The whole Church in the world is a new creation, rising up out of
   the old: sin and death, that is, the gates of hell, cannot prevail
   against it. The powers of the fall are turned back again upon their
   original source: against the Church of Christ they have no power. It is
   the justified body of a righteous Head; the immortal brotherhood of Him
   who is the Resurrection and the Life. We are "no more servants, but
   sons;" [56] no more in bondage, but "in the glorious liberty of the
   children of God." Such is our state as Christians.

   From this we learn, that the great gift of the Gospel in our
   regeneration is spiritual liberty, that is, the true freedom of the
   will.

   God made man with a will perfectly free; a part of His own image. Man
   by sin enslaved it to sin, and yet so as to be always a free agent even
   in sin. Therefore in many passages of Scripture the contrast of the
   state of nature, and even of the Jews, with that of Christians, is an
   opposition of bondage and liberty: as in this place, between "the
   bondage of corruption," and "the glorious liberty of the children of
   God." Speaking to the Jews, our Lord said, "If the Son shall make you
   free, ye shall be free indeed." [57] St. James calls the Gospel "the
   law of liberty;" and says, "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall
   be judged by the law of liberty." [58] St. Paul says, "The law is not
   made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the
   ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane:" [59] meaning, that
   they who are born again by the Spirit of Christ are no longer under the
   dominion of ignorance and lust, as the Gentiles; nor under ceremonies
   and commandments written on stone, as the Jews: they are gifted with
   the light and strength of the Spirit of God, and their law is not a law
   without them, but within, not on tables of stone, but in the heart and
   in the soul. "This is the covenant that I will make with them after
   those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their hearts, and
   in their minds will I write them." [60] Their law is the Spirit in a
   regenerate conscience; they are a law unto themselves. When St. Paul,
   therefore, says, "the law is not made for a righteous man," it is in
   the sense of saying, the first axioms of science, the first rules of
   art, are not for the wise and skilful. Such guides are not for them, as
   the conscious and perceptible rules of their practice. Yet they may not
   contravene the very least of them. The most cultivated reason must obey
   the elementary laws of scientific truth as exactly as the rudest. They
   are a rule to all; only the learned do not lean upon them consciously.
   Such principles of truth have passed into their very nature, and have
   become spontaneous. So it is with the law of obedience in those that
   are faithful to their regeneration. They have received again the
   beginnings of the grace which in Adam was perfect; the impress of the
   image of God who is law to all things, even to Himself.

   From this we may draw some practical lessons of great importance for
   the guidance of our life.

   1 . First, how deep a degradation sin is,--above all, in the
   regenerate. The hatefulness of sin is hardly more appalling than its
   shame. It makes man, who is but little lower than the angels, to be the
   slave of corruption, like the beasts that perish. We hear much of the
   dignity of human nature; and truly a dignity there was when God made
   mankind in His own image and likeness: but in man as fallen, it is but
   the dream of a degraded lineage, of a kingly race thrust from its
   dominion; a mere mockery of its utter nakedness. "By whatsoever a man
   is overcome, by the same is he brought in bondage." A wilful sinner is
   as a slave over whom a barter has been concluded. The money has been
   weighed for him; he is sold under sin; a mere tool, all the more
   degraded because a willing tool; worshipping the master that destroys
   and spurns him. By the abuse of his free will, he becomes the slave not
   only of the world and of the devil, but of his own corruption, of his
   own flesh, and of his own tyrannous passions, which, each one, gain a
   sort of outward personality, and usurp a despotism over the sordid and
   sensual will, degrading him, and, in every several act, making the
   degradation intense, because it is freely chosen and willingly endured.
   Such is every habit of vice, even in the heathen. But how much worse in
   those that have been born again, who, of sons of God, make themselves
   again "twofold more the children of hell than" before--who, out of the
   glorious liberty of the children of God, sell themselves to the bondage
   of lust, pride, revenge, and the like. Every such vice is a taskmaster,
   standing with a lash over his miserable servant. No one that has given
   himself up to such a bondage can call himself his own. He has lost all
   title and property in himself; he is both possessed and used, and made
   away with, by another, and always with his own obsequious consent. So
   false and contradictory is sin. When we seek liberty in license, we
   become "fast bound in misery and iron." There is no slavery so great as
   that of a will which has broken the yoke of Christ, and become, by its
   own free choice, the servant of its own sinful inclinations; for the
   will itself is in bondage to its own lusts. So sinners enslave each
   other. "While they promise them liberty, they themselves are servants
   of corruption." The most slavish will is that which sins with the
   greatest freedom. We must not limit this to grosser vices: far from it.
   The smoother and more refined sins are all in this point alike.
   Ambition, personal vanity, jealous tempers, an evil eye, love of money,
   worldly pleasures, luxury, indolence, insincerity, and many like
   faults, which are for the most part concealed, and very subtil.
   Sometimes they appear under forms that the world admires; and become,
   every one, masters to whom we abandon "the glorious liberty of the
   children of God." There is something very melancholy in the abject and
   eager servility with which men obey their hard commands; sacrificing
   health, peace, freshness of heart, conscience, the light of God's
   presence, the very soul of their spiritual life. They enter again
   insensibly into the bondage of corruption, and groan under the burden
   which weighs on them more heavily day by day. Where is, I will not ask
   "the glorious liberty of the sons of God," but the dignity of human
   nature, in a vain or vicious Christian? We must be sons or slaves.
   Choose which you will be. As you live so you choose. Some men make
   their profession a bondage. They toil for a fortune, or a name, or to
   make a family, and leave a title behind them, as if they were created
   for no other end; as if in that their will had found its true place and
   sphere of responsibility. Others make an abject slavery of a life of
   pleasure, under which they are perpetually complaining, and yet
   perpetually entangling themselves deeper. What is worldly society but a
   thraldom, in which almost every one feels himself both burdened and
   galled by unmeaning customs, by heartless usages, which break in upon
   the order, the peace, and the sanctity of a devout life? Nevertheless,
   people still go on, professing reluctance and unwillingness at every
   step, longing to be free, and yet willingly offering themselves to be
   bound tenfold closer to the wheel which carries them in the endless
   track of a worldly life. Miserable struggles, all in vain. In this way
   some go on through life, and lose at last the perception of their
   bondage; dream that they are free; wear their chains till they forget
   them, or would be ill at ease if their shackles were struck off.

   2. We may learn next, how great is the misery of an inconsistent life.
   It forfeits the true grace of Christian obedience. To be religious from
   mere sense of necessity, that is, against our will, is a contradiction
   and a yoke. To try to love God because we are afraid of Him, what can
   be more piteous? What more miserable than the reluctant, laggard
   unwillingness with which some people do what they call their religious
   duties? The longer they do them against the grain, the more irksome
   they become, and the more estranged their hearts will grow. And this
   must be so, until they have released their will from the bondage of
   worldly or personal temptations. So long as these keep hold on them,
   they are not, in the true and perfect sense, free agents. It is much to
   be feared that many whose lives are pure, who appear devout in all the
   outward usages of the Church, serve God with a heart that has no
   pleasure in obedience. If they would speak out plainly what they feel
   in secret, they would confess that to them God's commandments are
   "grievous," and the yoke of Christ is not "light." Their free will is
   given to another, and it is but a constrained homage they render to
   Christ. The glorious liberty of the children of God turns to a forced,
   necessary observance of commandments. They are under a law, and have
   retrograded in the scale of spiritual perfection; from sons, they have
   turned back again to be servants; and their whole temper of heart
   towards God is infected by a consciousness of indevotion and of a
   lingering undutiful will.

   This it is that makes the spiritual habits of the soul so weak, and the
   faults of the mind so strong. People grow dejected under a
   consciousness of difficulty, and become faint-hearted in temptations;
   and faults come back upon them and regain ascendancy. Such people come
   at last to say, It is of no use; I have tried for years to find my
   happiness in religion, but nothing will do. It is all as irksome as
   ever. I feel no pleasure in any thing holy; and the thought of God
   alarms me. Now what is the true cause of all this? "Because thou
   servedst not the Lord thy God with joy fulness, and with gladness of
   heart, for the abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou serve
   thine enemies which the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger, and in
   thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and He shall put a
   yoke of iron upon thy neck." [61] It is because we do not realise the
   blessedness and the power of a free will; because we will not do God's
   will as sons, out of a loving and glad obedience, therefore we cannot
   stand against the world. It takes us captive, and puts out our eyes,
   and sets us blinded to the mill, to labour in darkness, in an
   involuntary and shameful servitude.

   3. And once more: we may see how great is the happiness and the dignity
   of a formed and mature faith. For what is faith, but the realisation
   and actual enjoyment of the glorious liberty of a free and holy will,
   supported by the unseen world, by the presence of God, and by the
   Spirit of the Father and of the Son? It is through this deep
   consciousness of what their spiritual birth had made them, that saintly
   men in all ages have been strengthened to break through the manifold
   bondage of sin and the world, of this fallen life, and, harder still,
   of their own self-indulgent hearts. It is by this that they have
   conceived and accomplished all great works of mercy, all great
   sacrifices of self. They cleared away the space around their lot in the
   world, and laid down the lines and principles of their life upon the
   scale of that "liberty with which Christ has made us free." Without
   either affected singularity or needless contradiction to other
   people,--tokens always of a weak and little mind,--there has ever been
   a clear and distinguishable character about every such man; a character
   altogether his own, standing out plain, harmonious, and intelligible.
   This is the true development of our new birth; the true secret of all
   strength and force in the individual will; the several and distinct
   personality of the members of the mystical body of Christ. Such a man
   is His freeman. The world has no jurisdiction over him: public opinion,
   the maxims and example of others, the traditions of centuries and of
   nations, have no hold upon him; he pays them no allegiance. The baits
   and lures of ambition, wealth, pleasure, flattery, popularity, have no
   seduction for his will. It stands alone in the centre of his own soul,
   stayed only upon God. No external forces seem to tell upon him.
   Personal infirmities disappear from the outline of his character:
   personal temptations cleave asunder and are passed through without
   perceptible exertion; they seem rather to melt away before him. Great
   sacrifices are the unstrained acts of his daily life. There is a
   perfect sameness about him at all times; all his ways of judging seem
   fixed and invariable; his very sympathies appear to be under laws that
   never change; they may be always foretold and acted on; his perceptions
   of right and wrong grow to be intuitive; and his words, from the
   sameness of his inward character, seem to follow by a certain order,
   and to recur by certain just and accurate combinations. Every thing
   appears to be already weighed, and at once to find its place under some
   deliberate judgment. Such men are not more perfect in strength than in
   gentleness; in their exalted sanctity than in their entire
   self-abasement. They are servants of Him who was at once the Lord of
   all power and might, and also meek and lowly of heart.

   What, after all, is this but the power of a will that is truly free,
   enfranchised by the glorious liberty of God's kingdom? And it is to be
   found not only in highly cultivated men, but in the most simple; not in
   the refined alone, but among the rudest. It is the inexhaustible
   fulness of the Spirit of Christ, issuing, through a will holy and free,
   and filling the whole spirit and soul of man. This is the true and only
   basis of all real Christian perfection; the universal foundation of all
   true sanctity. Under all variety of circumstances, this is the one true
   character of saints. It matters not what be the lot or labour of a man
   in life; he can build securely on nothing else; all other foundations
   will bear only partial and imperfect forms of obedience. The world may
   commend them as rational, moderate, and Christian; but the sanctity of
   apostles, prophets, martyrs, and saints, of all kindreds, and nations,
   and ages,--the full breadth of the life of the Spirit is built on this
   one law of grace alone:--they served God with a will free and powerful,
   as sons adopted in the Spirit of the Son of God.

   We see, then, our calling. Our only pattern is the life of our Lord:
   and by His spiritual grace we may be like Him if we will. Let us not
   weaken ourselves by taking a lower standard: for we shall come short
   enough through our own infirmity. Pray for His daily help, that you may
   strive and watch as long as you are conscious of any warp or bias which
   draws your will from the directness of its intention. If, by God's
   mercy, you are free from grosser vices, yet the world and the customs
   of life, the influence of your employment and your relaxations, the
   temper and dispositions which seem born in us, will make for you many
   temptations, and cast many fetters upon your will. It is a hard thing
   to be truly free; to have no master but One in heaven.

   Remember, then, that as you are under the law of liberty, so by that
   law you must be judged. And that judgment will be not by the letter of
   the decalogue, nor by a scanty and measured rule; but by your gifts and
   blessings, by your opportunities and powers, by the grace of sonship,
   and the law of filial obedience. When you are tempted, say, "Shall I,
   the freeman of Christ, make myself the servant of the world? From a
   child shall I again become a slave?" It is only one stroke that is
   needed to set us at large from most of our temptations. If we had faith
   to be bold, we should strike it, and go free.

   But that you may be weaned from the world which fascinates your hearts,
   pray for the love of God; pray that He will shed abroad in your hearts
   a consciousness of His unspeakable love to you, and make you delight in
   His love as your supreme and exceeding joy. This will make all evil
   hateful to you: every thought and shadow of sin will fall with a
   sensible pain upon your conscience. The light and paltry things of the
   world will be tasteless and irksome. Even the dearest affections will
   be, not destroyed, God forbid, but taken up into a higher and more
   blissful love. Why is self-denial bitter, but because our hold on what
   we love is so tenacious? If we loved Him more, we should let these fall
   from us, that we might delight ourselves above all in God. Even the
   sharpness of the Cross would be sacred and sweet. Every act of a will
   which is like unto His will, Who, of His own free choice, "offered
   Himself without spot to God," would bring a sensible accession of
   happiness and peace. What do our heavy hearts prove but that other
   things are sweeter to us than His will; that we have not attained to
   the full mastery of our true freedom, the full perception of its power;
   that our sonship is still but faintly realised, and its blessedness not
   yet proved and known? An active and ardent love of God would make all
   things easy both to do and suffer. Disappointment, pain, and affliction
   are hard to bear, because He has one will and we have another. We
   suffer, but not willingly; and this collision is the cause of all
   distress. Our consent would turn all our trials into obedience. By
   consenting we make them our own, and offer them with ourselves again to
   Him.

   A little while, and the mystery of this disordered world will be
   accomplished: our deliverance will be fulfilled, and the number of the
   elect be full. Then shall all be made perfect. They who are waiting in
   the rest beyond the grave; they who shall be quick on earth at His
   coming; they and we, if we be faithful, shall be clothed upon with
   life--with a spiritual body, with the glory of the resurrection; and
   the whole creation shall be delivered from the bondage of the fall.
   There shall be no more travailing in pain; no more tokens of sin on the
   creatures of God; no more death. Every scar shall be smoothed out, and
   every soil cleansed away at His coming and His kingdom, when the new
   creation shall rise out of the old, and the morning stars shall sing
   together, and all the sons of God shall shout for joy.

SERMON VIII.

  SLOWNESS IN THE SPIRITUAL LIFE.

    PSALM cxix. 25.

   "My soul cleaveth unto the dust."

   THESE words express with great intensity of humiliation a consciousness
   which is universal among all sincere Christians. I mean, the power of
   the world and of the body over the soul. Such people desire to serve
   God with a free, growing, spiritual service; but they often feel
   impotent, slothful, and sluggish. They strive, but make no speed; toil,
   but make little way: they feel as if they were laden with a great
   weight, and that weight were powerfully attracted to the earth; and the
   earth clings to them, and they to it, as by a kindred nature. In all
   their sorrows, joys, thoughts, cares, hopes, labours of this world,
   they feel vivid, quick, and untiring; as a bark upon the sea, which, in
   all its wanderings and flights, is never weary: but in the service of
   God, in obedience, repentance, prayer, love, worship, they move with a
   dull, heavy pace. They are conscious that earth has more part in them
   than heaven; for out of the dust were we taken, and dust we are. And
   so, says the Book of Wisdom, "the corruptible body presseth down the
   soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth on
   many things." [62] The more they are awakened to the knowledge of God,
   the more they feel their tardiness of spirit. But this does not arise
   only from the sympathy, so to speak, between our nature and the dust,
   of which, in the beginning, we were made; for a sinless humanity would
   cleave not to the dust, but to God. It has a special token of the fall
   in it. The consummation of this fallen sympathy is the wages of sin,
   that is, death itself; "unto dust shalt thou return." The curse laid
   upon the serpent is a proof of this: "And the Lord God said unto the
   serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle,
   and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and
   dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life." [63] And this original
   curse is not taken off from him even in the redeemed world: when all
   creation shall have peace, yet still, as the Lord said by Isaiah, "dust
   shall be the serpent's meat;" [64] that is, humiliation and banishment
   from God. This slowness and sluggishness, therefore, in spiritual
   obedience, is a special proof of the power of the fall still abiding
   upon us, and of our proneness to linger and hold fast by earth and its
   attractions. We will not, however, go into so large a subject as this
   opens, but take only one point in it; I mean, the slowness of spiritual
   growth, which is so great a humiliation and distress to sincere minds,
   or, as they believe and express it, the stubborn earthliness of their
   nature.

   I do not mean to say, that this is not often a very just cause of
   distress and fear: for some people practise great deceits upon
   themselves, and, while they keep up a round of religious usages, really
   give themselves a full and unbridled range of earthly pursuits,
   enjoyments, aims, and thoughts. But we will not speak of them, nor of
   any who by their own inconsistency and indolence hinder the gracious
   inspirations and workings of God in their hearts. Let us take only the
   case of those who sincerely and faithfully endeavour to follow and
   comply with His grace in them; whose pure desire is to grow in the
   spiritual life; and whose chiefest and greatest distress is the
   consciousness of manifold hindrances, obstinate faults, want of
   religious affections, of earnestness, zeal, perseverance, delight in
   God, and the like; or, in one word, of the little advance they make in
   the life of spiritual obedience. No words give fuller utterance to
   their complaint than these: "My soul cleaveth unto the dust."

   1. One cause of this disheartening and saddening feeling is, that
   people aim at models and examples which are too high for them. It may
   be asked, How is this possible, when the standard set before us is the
   life of our Lord Himself, and He with His own mouth said, "Be ye
   therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect?"; [65] And
   again, St. John says, "every man that hath this hope in him purifieth
   himself, even as He is pure;" [66] and "he that doeth righteousness is
   righteous, even as He is righteous." [67] What standard can be higher
   than this? and are we not, by Divine command, bidden to aim at it?

   Now we must distinguish between the perfection of the great Example
   which it is our duty to imitate, and the proportions in which our
   actual lot, strength, and calling, admit of such an imitation. Clearly
   the example of our Lord would seem to exact of us, at once, to be no
   less than sinless. But no one so understands the precept of imitation.
   It lifts up a pattern, and it prescribes a tendency, which is to govern
   our whole life. But the measures and proportions in which that tendency
   may be realized are not only infinitely various in detail, but are no
   less ordained and distributed of God than His gifts of grace. The
   apostles He called to the closest likeness to their Lord in holiness,
   love, suffering, toil for His elect, utter forsaking of the world, and
   even to an imitation of His passion: so also all martyrs, evangelists,
   and successors of the apostles, who have been called out of the world
   to convert it, and be spent for it: so all who have been specially
   called to lives of sanctity, to a full devotion of themselves, for
   life, to works of charity and mercy, to labours of spiritual learning,
   prayer, and repentance: and in like manner through all the manifold
   shades of the religious life, until we enter upon the confines of the
   world and its works, its powers and offices, households and homes.
   "Every man hath his proper gift of God: one after this manner, another
   after that." Every one has his vocation; and his vocation is of God.
   Our vocation is the measure of our powers, and fixes the proportions of
   our duty. This is the first thing to be tried and ascertained. When any
   are called wholly to forsake the world, their duty is plain. They are
   set to imitate the life of Christ with all their strength, and with all
   possible conformity of inward and outward circumstance. This applies
   chiefly and directly to pastors who are united to the Chief Shepherd in
   His work of love and self-denial. It is true, also, of great multitudes
   who are, by God's loving tenderness, called to the peace and happiness
   of a devout life of prayer and mercy, sheltered from distraction. But
   the rest,--that is, the great body of the visible Church, with whom we
   have now to do,--are called to attain each one the fullest measure he
   can of the mind and spirit of Christ, under the proportions and
   conditions of his state. For instance, rulers, statesmen, ministers of
   human law, merchants, men of labour and action, of business and the
   arts of life, parents, husbands and wives, children still in
   subjection, servants, and the poor of Christ's flock--all these are
   limited and restrained by a multitude of necessities: they are
   perpetually under a "present distress;" and they must serve their
   state, and through their state serve God. This makes many things
   impossible to them, many things disproportioned to their vocation; and
   to such things they are therefore not called.

   One remark is to be made on all this. There is one example for all, the
   life of Christ; one tendency wholly unlimited, in the direction of
   which all must press towards His example; but the standard, that is,
   the manner and measure in which we are permitted to advance in that
   tendency, is of God. He proportions it by His providence and His grace.
   All we can do, and the holiest thing we can do, is to apply and mould
   ourselves entirely upon the lot He has meted out to us. For in so
   doing, it is impossible to say what Christians may not attain. There is
   a Divine mystery and paradox about our probation: so that some who are
   called to the lives of apostles may be lowest in the imitation of
   Christ; and some who are called to the service of the world are closest
   in their likeness to His perfection. The tendency, therefore, is the
   same in all; the grace and power of indefinite advance is offered to
   all; to decline it, or to use it slackly, to be wanting on our part in
   zeal and perseverance, is our sin. And yet, after all, there are
   mysteries of proportion and vocation, which flow from the fountain of
   all mystery, the election of God; thither we may trace them upward, but
   there we must stay our search, and worship Him in love and silence.

   The practical rule, therefore, to be drawn from this is, that we ought
   to measure our actual lot, and to fulfil it; to be with all our
   strength that which our lot requires and allows. What is beyond it, is
   no calling of ours. How much peace, quiet, confidence, and strength,
   would people attain, if they would go by this plain rule. We read in
   the lives of great servants of God, how they fasted, prayed, and
   laboured; how many dangers they encountered, sought, and suffered; how
   many works of love they fulfilled;--how many difficulties they
   overcame; and our heads are sometimes turned with a wish to do the
   like. Or, to bring this nearer home; we see persons called out from
   common duties and relations, gifted with aptitudes and powers, placed
   in the midst of ripe opportunities, devising and accomplishing works of
   charity, piety, and mercy; and we are moved with a desire to bid
   farewell to our homes, and disquieted with the thought that we are
   doing nothing, so long as we are not like them. We forget the parable
   of the talents, and Who it is that both distributes them and will take
   account. Now this is one very common and very needless cause of
   discomfort to sincere people; and perhaps chiefly to the most sincere,
   who, as they have a more earnest desire to advance, have also a quicker
   sympathy with higher and more devout examples. We may take, then, this
   comfort, that the standards or visible forms of the spiritual life are
   various, and are appointed to us by God Himself; and that the power of
   tending towards the perfect holiness of Christ is as full and unlimited
   to us in our commonplace life, as it could be in any other; nay, is
   more certainly free to us in that way of life, because it is our own,
   that is, because so God has ordained it for us.

   2. But perhaps it may be said, "This is not my distress. I have no
   desire to go out of my lot into disproportioned habits; but I do not
   comply with this tendency of which you speak. This is the point where I
   cleave to the dust.' I make no advance in the spiritual life." In
   answer it may be said, that we are too hasty in looking for signs of
   advancement. In one sense, indeed, we cannot be too impatient; I mean,
   we cannot too much desire to become sinless. But whatever may be our
   desire, patience is our duty. The dealings of God are wonderful. "The
   husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long
   patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain." [68] God
   has a seed-time, and a burial, sometimes long and strange, of the germs
   of spiritual life, before the feast of in-gathering is fully come. What
   a miracle is the gift of regeneration, which awaits its ripeness in the
   morning of the resurrection. What to all eyes more sickly than the
   soul, more dead than the body? So through all our spiritual life there
   is an order and a cycle of seasons and changes--"seed-time and harvest,
   and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night." [69] All
   things move on in a procession of measured and temperate advance,
   obeying some eternal law of the Divine will, adjusted to the conditions
   of the Divine image as it is in us; and by this law all anomalies will
   be one day solved. The Divine hand never moves like ours, in a lawless
   haste. Even seeming exceptions have their proper laws, unknown to us.
   For it is most true that sometimes it has pleased God to anticipate in
   a moment of time, (as when, by one act, He created the fruit-tree
   having its seed in itself,) the growth and ripeness of years: such was
   the repentance of David, the bitter weeping of St. Peter, the
   conversion of St. Paul. So, a single word, or a moment of intense
   agony, or the aspect of a holy countenance, or realities which, as this
   world neither sees or knows, so neither will it believe, have been
   known to work at once the perfect and abiding conversion of a sinner.
   But such things in the spiritual world are as lightning in the world of
   nature. The day and the night are not illuminated by sudden streams of
   fire, but by steady lights, and by their slow gradual ascents. This
   reveals the gentleness, as the other the sovereignty, of God. It is by
   this same even and stedfast law, that the spiritual world, or the
   sanctification of the soul in man, advances to its ripeness. We must
   not look out for the harvest when we have only cast the seed, nor for
   the vintage when we have but yesterday bound up the vines. The sin that
   dwells in us is strong and stubborn, and the very law of our
   sanctification is, that we should be cleansed from it through the
   persevering struggle of our will, and the entire hatred of our
   spiritual nature. God does not cleanse us as if we were dead and
   passive. Perhaps this would best suit our indolence, but not our
   destiny of bliss. He made us without our act; but He will not save us
   unless we be fellow-workers together with Him. For when He made us,
   "man became,"--not a clod of helpless, lifeless earth, but "a living
   soul." [70] This is our wonderful being; and this shews why sloth is
   one of the seven deadly sins. It is the direct abdication of living
   powers, of the living soul given to us of God. It is spiritual suicide,
   a wilful return into dust and death. This, then, gives us the law of
   our probation, and reveals to us why all growth in grace is slow;
   because it is to be attained by the progressive and persevering action
   of our moral nature, under the conditions of the fall, and against the
   antagonist powers of temptation. There are, without doubt, deeper
   reasons still, which we shall one day know; for we mistake in thinking
   that perfection is to be found only in the ultimate form and fulness of
   any creature. Every stage has its perfect beauty; as childhood, youth,
   and manhood. Indeed, what is the fulness of the creature? what ultimate
   and changeless form has any finite being? Our perfection, it may be, is
   eternal growth; everlasting approach to the Infinite, which is for ever
   inaccessible. So it is in the life of grace. The stages of trial have,
   we may believe, each one of them, a peculiar character and acceptance
   in the sight of God.

   But besides this, there are some very clear and open reasons why our
   growth is suffered to be slow. Nothing so lays the axe to the root of
   pride. We would fain be to-day as pure as angels; but before to-morrow,
   it may be, we should lift up ourselves as Satan. The consciousness of
   sin is very galling and humbling; we chafe and complain of it: but is
   all this trouble a sincere and tranquil sorrow from the pure love of
   God? By no means. Sin betrays us into a thousand faults, and into
   habitual follies; it hurts our self-love, and mortifies our vanity. It
   would be so graceful to be a saint; so lovely in the eyes of others; so
   soothing to ourselves. O, the depth of the craft and of the wiles of
   the Devil! Even our holier aspirations he taints, and turns against our
   souls. There is infinite compassion and infinite care in leaving our
   sins to be our shame and scourge; lest God's best gifts should be our
   snare, and life itself our death. Truly our souls cleave unto the dust,
   not as we complain, but as we are little aware. We are often most
   earthly when we believe ourselves to be most spiritual. So hard is it
   to open our ears. Well might the prophet cry thrice, "O earth, earth,
   earth, hear the word of the Lord." [71] The faults and inward
   temptations which still cleave to us are, doubtless, a lighter evil and
   a less danger than elation and self-confidence. We do not make advances
   in zeal, fervour, devotion, charity, self-denial; and we complain of
   it. Of whom do we complain? Not of God, for He gives more grace than we
   ever take and use; not of Satan, for that would be to accuse our
   probation; not of sin, for it is an abstraction, and has no personal
   existence; not of ourselves, because we are the supposed complainants.
   What, then, is our complaint? It is, that we are what we are. But
   complaints will not make us better; they will not increase our faith,
   deepen our humility, quicken our hope, break our pride; for no man ever
   yet became humble only by complaining; and the one and only cure which
   can break our pride would also take away our complaints; and that is,
   true humility, and a perfect conformity to the will of God; enduring
   and rejoicing to be just as He would have us; and believing that
   whatsoever messenger of Satan buffet us, His grace is sufficient for
   our stay. This, then, is a direct answer for all sincere minds.
   Persevere in patience and obedience, and cast "all your care upon Him."
   "Take no thought for the morrow." "Sufficient unto the day is the evil
   thereof." Get the day well over and done with an upright and open
   heart, and leave tomorrow and growth to Him who alone "giveth the
   increase." Do not be cast down because you feel no religious
   emotions,--such as warmth of thankfulness and kindling of love to God,
   peace, delight in prayer, and the like. This is very blessed, when God
   sees good to give it; but there is something better for us, and more
   pleasing to Him; and that is, persevering obedience, patience in prayer
   and praise, under discouragements, infirmity, and darkness, even as if
   we were forsaken. He loves our love, but He loves our persevering trust
   above all our sensible emotions. The deepest teachers in this high
   wisdom bid all sincere Christians to be thankful when they are led
   rather by this path of the Cross, though they seem to cleave painfully
   to its rugged ways, than by the smoother and brighter avenues of His
   kingdom. Leave all this in His hand. The cup and the baptism are of His
   sole dispensing. If we choose, it may be, we shall even by choosing do
   amiss.

   3. But perhaps it will be said again, "This would be all very well, if
   I were not conscious of positive faults, and sometimes even of falling
   back into those of which I have repented. It is not only that I do not
   advance in devotion, but I am still in the dust of death:' positive
   evils are alive within me, and I often see them even more active than
   before." Now this may be, and will be true, if we give over to watch,
   and to obey the light of conscience. But, speaking still to sincere
   minds, it may be said, that we are no sure judges of this matter. A
   growing consciousness of sin is no certain sign of growing sinfulness;
   but, on the contrary, a probable sign of growing sanctification: as
   sinfulness grows, insensibility increases; as the soul is sanctified,
   its keen discernment of sin is strengthened and enlarged. At first
   sight, then, it is more probable that the very cause of complaint ought
   to be a cause of encouragement. For let us bear in mind that the same
   Will which, in wisdom, has ordained the law of slow growth for our
   spiritual life, has also, in love, ordained a slow perception of our
   sinfulness. Some have ventured to pray without limitation and without
   fear, that God would shew them their inward sinfulness as He sees it: a
   prayer well intended, but withal very rash. It shews how little we know
   of the hatefulness of sin in the sight of God; how faint a
   consciousness we have of our own deformity. If such a prayer were
   granted, if we could see ourselves as an object of sight in all the
   leprosy and death of our sin, we should perhaps perish in despair.
   Nothing but a divine eye, or an eye pure from sin, can look without
   fear and peril upon such a vision of horror as a soul fallen from God.
   Our faith, hope, and love, are so feeble, that a revelation of what we
   are, would perhaps drive us to the end of Judas, and give us our
   portion with him in "his own place." It would seem incredible to
   believe, impossible to hope in forgiveness, and fear would cast out
   love. Now, in this there is great and tender compassion; it is only
   little by little, in measure and gentle degrees, that He reveals to us
   what we are in His eyes; and even that He makes known by giving us His
   grace, so that we see what we are as we cease so to be. We see
   ourselves in reflection, cast behind us, as the reality passes away; we
   discern what we were by becoming what we are. Of what we were, and of
   what we see, we have indeed a consciousness by way of recollection; but
   what we are, by God's mercy to us, is never fully realised. Sickness is
   full of self, but health has no self-contemplation. Therefore, let it
   be supposed that we do far more clearly see, far more keenly feel our
   sinfulness; that is not a proof that we are more sinful, no, nor that
   we are still as sinful as before; but rather that an awakened
   discernment, and an intenser hatred of evil issuing from a real
   endowment of divine grace, has made us perceive with a truer and fuller
   sense the sins which once were our own.

   This will be clearer by examples. What reveals our pride, and makes us
   hate it, but the beginnings of humility? What makes anger a torment,
   but the love of meekness? What makes self-indulgence contemptible, but
   a desire to suffer hardship? What makes want of love, or coldness in
   prayer, an affliction, but a sense of the blessedness of God's
   presence? What makes the thought of declension, or standing still, or
   cleaving to the dust, to be a misery and a sorrow, but the aspiration
   of a heart quickened with the spirit of perseverance, and panting to
   press onward to the face of God? This is the secret way in which the
   presence of God, sanctifying the soul in man, reveals Itself; not by
   direct self-manifestation, but by its effects. As in sight and hearing:
   we perceive external objects, and not our own faculties: the eye does
   not see itself, but lights and shades; the ear does not hear itself,
   but harmonies and discords; still less can the eye or ear perceive the
   true percipient within, which is ourselves. So is it with the Holy
   Spirit of God. He reveals all things besides, while He conceals
   Himself. He reveals past sins of thought, word, and deed: the
   unholiness of childhood, youth, and after years; present sinfulness of
   imagination, heart, and will; pride, hardness, impurity, impatience,
   sloth, softness, anger; want of zeal, thankfulness, love, and devotion:
   all these He sets before the soul in clear array. But He hides
   meekness, gentleness, self-mistrust, self-contempt, charity, sorrow for
   sin, self-accusation, and the like: these things are most hidden from
   those who have them in the largest measures. They are seen of angels,
   confessed by men; but unknown, disbelieved by those in whom they dwell;
   the gift of humility by itself alone conceals them all: so that such
   persons are sure to think themselves to be the least advanced, who, in
   truth, are most advanced; as they are ever the first who believe
   themselves to be the last. Speaking, then, still of sincere Christians,
   it may be said that these complaints of conscious and abiding faults,
   so long as they are not willingly indulged, and this increased sense of
   inward sinfulness, is no sign of cleaving to the dust; but rather that
   God in love is drawing them on. He is making known to them the fall as
   it exists in their inmost life, in prelude to making them conscious
   partakers of the bliss for which they are already unconsciously being
   prepared.

   But as the whole of this subject is so nearly akin to the dangers of a
   self-contemplative state, the surest and best remedy for such
   complaints will be found in practical rules; of which the two following
   may, by God's blessing, be found useful.

   1. The first is, to reduce our self-examination to definite points. It
   is a hurtful mistake to give way to feelings which have no definite and
   ascertained foundation; by which I mean, general feelings of
   dissatisfaction with our state; vague discomfort at what we have been,
   or still are; excited emotions as to our coldness, deadness,
   insensibility, and so on. Like sweeping confessions, these are of
   little use, spring from no real self-knowledge, and issue in no real
   amendment. The only feelings which are good and trustworthy are those
   which arise upon definite and certain facts, either of our past life or
   of our present consciousness. These are penitential; the others seldom
   or never really are. For repentance is sorrow founded on the
   consciousness of distinct acts of sin. The best and safest course,
   then, is to confine our self-examination, at least for awhile, to
   particular points; and for a time to cast aside all other feelings and
   thoughts about ourselves. Now the proper subjects of repentance and
   confession are chiefly these: definite acts of sin, whether in deed, in
   word, or in thought, in which there has been a full and deliberate
   consent of the will. It is this consent which constitutes the act; the
   form of it is indifferent. Whether it issue in deed or in word is all
   one; and whether it issue outwardly or be suppressed within, as in
   thought, yet if the will deliberately consent, it is all the same. Our
   will is our moral nature, as our life is our natural being. All
   circumstances or consequences are only the modes of its acting, or the
   forms of its manifestation. A proud act, a proud word, or a proud
   thought, deliberately indulged, all alike make us guilty of pride,
   though not in equal degrees. It is bad to harbour the thought, worse to
   indulge it in word, and worst of all in act; but these differ not in
   kind, but only in degree. This applies equally to every kind of sin, If
   we can trace any of these in ourselves, they are tokens of cleaving to
   the dust, and subjects worthy of sorrow. But it is vague and useless to
   complain generally, that we are proud, and the like; for that really,
   in the end, only leads us away from specific self-examination and
   specific repentance. But besides these three degrees of sin, there is
   still another over which we must watch, and that is, wrong feelings
   indulged for any length of time. It is impossible to fix: a measure of
   time, by hours or minutes; for the acts of our moral nature cannot be
   told upon a dial. But if we suffer these feelings to dwell in us long
   enough for us to reflect upon them, they become deliberate, and so tend
   to become habitual. As such they are a direct resistance to the Spirit
   of love, joy, and peace; and, therefore, become actual sins and
   specific matter of repentance. Now if we can trace in ourselves the
   increase of these indulged feelings in frequency, duration, or power,
   we may justly fear that we are not advancing. But if not, then let all
   other feelings of fear, discouragement, and sadness, be cast away as
   temptations against faith, hope, and love, the three great gifts of the
   Holy Spirit,--the three fountains of obedience and perseverance. There
   is an unclean Spirit of sadness, which is a special enemy of
   Christians; and the most subtil of all, because so like an angel of
   light. It is he that comes and personates the angel of repentance, to
   lead us into deeps, where we may "be swallowed up of overmuch sorrow."
   [72] This is "the sorrow that worketh death;" [73] but "we are not
   ignorant of his devices."

   2. And, then, having reduced our self-examination to definite points,
   let us, from the sins we have so detected, choose out some one against
   which to direct our chief watchfulness and strength. Whatever be our
   besetting sin, let us take that; be it our worst, or our oldest, or the
   sin we oftenest commit. With that for awhile let our whole contest lie.
   As the king of Syria commanded the captains of his chariots, "Fight
   with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel;" [74]
   so let us turn the whole of our care, watchfulness, and recollection,
   upon that one. The benefit of such a rule is, that it strengthens our
   self-discipline, by bringing it all to bear at once upon one point. Our
   chief danger is vagueness, and the weakness of wandering up and down
   without aim, plan, or perseverance. In this way we shall overcome no
   sin. Like an army making scattered and unsupported attacks over the
   whole seat of war, instead of concentrating its strength, by solidity
   and unity of force, for some decisive stroke; so when people try to
   overcome all their sins at once, they are overcome themselves by each
   in turn. And, further: the self-discipline required to conquer one sin
   is as full and as complete as if we were engaged against the whole
   array. The very same habits of mind are all called into action, and a
   twofold good is the result; first, that while we are consciously
   engaged only with one, we really are, at the same time, more
   effectively keeping down the rest; and next, that when one is mastered,
   the whole principle of self-discipline has gained the victory over the
   whole principle of sin. In conquering one, we have virtually conquered
   all. In taking the king, we have scattered all the host. Great
   conversions even of hardened sinners have been wrought by the
   observance of a single rule. We read of some whose whole change of life
   began by saying once a-day, "God be merciful to me a sinner;" or by
   kissing the ground every day, and saying, "Tomorrow I may be dead;" or
   by coming to a friend or spiritual guide every time they committed some
   one particular sin; all the rest being for a time left without
   discipline, and seemingly, because really it could not be, without
   care. If, then, people would take selfishness, or personal vanity, or
   impatience in argument, or bitter words against others, or indulged
   envy, or any sin of the senses or of the thoughts, or the like, and
   whensoever they commit it, make it known to some one whom they may
   choose, they would find, by God's grace, that their whole religious
   life would put off the moody, complaining, disheartening emotions which
   overcloud their faith, and become definite, practical, and cheerful. We
   should then have a mark by which to know the ebb and flow of the tide;
   and we should leave no room for temptations, which when they sadden our
   hearts, shake our filial trust in God.

   Of course in giving these two rules so barely and nakedly, I leave to
   be understood all that belongs to the higher sources of help and
   strength. I suppose that people of sincere minds, such as I have spoken
   of, will make these self-examinations and confessions on their knees,
   and that they will not resolve with any confidence in their own power,
   but will offer their resolutions with special prayers for aid, at some
   solemn time, as in the Holy Communion, to God. Our only hope, not only
   of advancement in the spiritual life, but of perseverance and of
   stedfastness, is in fellowship with Him. In our ignorance we know not
   what is best for us. "There be many that say, Who will shew us any
   good?" [75] But one thing we do certainly know to be good: "It is good
   for me to hold me fast by God;" [76] and then nothing can fail.
   Whatsoever be our trial, we know that "going through this vale of
   misery, we may use it for a well," whereon at noon, in the burden of
   the day, as at Sychar, we may sit and rest with our Lord; and that, by
   His presence and help, we shall "go from strength to strength, till we
   appear every one of us before" His face in Zion. For He is "the way"
   foretold by the prophets: "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee,
   saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand,
   and when ye turn to the left." [77] For "an highway shall be there, and
   a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall
   not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though
   fools, shall not err therein." [78]

SERMON IX.

  THE GIFT OF ABUNDANT LIFE.

    ST. JOHN x. 10.

   "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more
   abundantly."

   OUR Lord here declares the great end for which He came into the world,
   that we "might have life." He had already said this oftentimes before;
   as to Nicodemus; "God so loved the world, that He gave His
   only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
   but have everlasting life." Again at Capernaum: "The bread of God is He
   which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world;" and "Ye
   will not come to Me, that ye might have life." [79]

   But here He speaks with a still greater fulness of meaning. He does not
   only say, "I am come that they might have life;" but still more, "and
   that they might have it more abundantly;" promising some great
   endowment, some greater gift of God than man had ever before received.
   This is the great grace of the Gospel, the abundant gift of life. Let
   us endeavour, by His help "who our Life," to understand the depth and
   blessedness of this promise.

   It may be thought that the words "more abundantly" are not intended as
   a measure of comparison with any other previous gift of God; but that
   they signify, as is the undoubted usage of the original as well as of
   other languages, only the largeness and fulness of the grace of life,
   which is in Christ. But, after all, it comes to the same; for, in such
   modes of speech, there is always some comparison involved, though it
   may be remotely, and in human speakers almost unconsciously, intended.
   In His words, who is Truth and the Wisdom of the Father, it is
   something more than error to suppose such a manner of speaking. Though
   He humbled Himself to use our speech, "never man spake like this Man."
   [80] There is a pure, divine, and perfect truth in every word of the
   Son of God. When He said, "I am come that they might have life, and
   that they might have it more abundantly," He intended, we must believe,
   that the gift of life through Himself should be in a fulness never
   given to man before. And it will not need many thoughts to shew us how
   graciously this promise is fulfilled.

   St. John has in part led us into the right understanding of these
   words, by saying, "The law was given by Moses; but grace and truth came
   by Jesus Christ:" [81] and our Lord Himself still more fully, when He
   said, "Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This
   is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
   and not die." [82] Life was given under, though not by, the law; and
   yet, not as it was to be given afterwards by Jesus Christ. Before He
   came, it was given in secret and in measure; after He came, openly and
   in abundance. But these words contain a deeper meaning than simply to
   say, that the Gospel of Christ is fuller of life than the law of Moses.
   In one word, they mean nothing less than this, that the gift of life,
   which is by Jesus Christ, is more abundant than was ever given, not
   only under the law, or before the law; not only to saints, prophets,
   patriarchs; but more abundant than in the grace of creation, and in the
   gift of life with which Adam was endowed in Paradise. "I am come that
   they might have life," in measure more abundant, in manner more divine,
   in continuance more abiding, than was ever yet revealed.

   This declares to us the great gift of indwelling life, which is now
   bestowed upon us by the Son of God through the Holy Ghost.

   First, then, the gift or spirit of life dwells in those who are united
   to Christ, in a fulness more abundant than was ever revealed before.

   When God made man in His own image and likeness, and breathed into his
   nostrils the breath of life, he became "a living soul:" he was perfect
   in body and soul, endowed with the grace of God, sinless and immortal.
   We may ask, What more, as man, could he be? St. Paul gives us an
   inspired answer: "The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last
   Adam was made a quickening spirit." And again, "The first man is of the
   earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven." [83] Now, what
   does he intend by these words? He teaches us that Adam was a mere man,
   made of the earth, endowed with life as a gift of God; but that Christ,
   who is God and man, is a man Divine, possessing life in Himself. The
   life possessed by Adam was in the measure of his own infirmity; the
   life which is in Christ is in the fulness of a Divine manhood. Adam was
   united to God only by God's grace and power. Christ is God made man.
   The humanity of Adam was only human; in Christ the manhood is become
   divine. The union of the Godhead with the manhood endowed it with a
   substantial grace, whereby it was deified. And it was from the
   miraculous conception filled with the fulness of all grace. His very
   manhood became the fountain, a great deep of all grace. Therefore He
   said, "As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the
   Son," both as God and as man, "to have life in Himself." [84] "As the
   Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son
   quickeneth whom He will." [85] This was the prophecy of St. John
   Baptist: "I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that
   cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
   bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire." [86] And
   it was His own promise, "If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and
   drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his
   belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake He of the
   Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive: for the Holy
   Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified,)"
   [87] And, after He had entered into His glory, St. John bare witness
   that this promise had been fulfilled: "The Word was made flesh, and
   dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." "And of His fulness
   have all we received, and grace for grace:" [88] that is to say, the
   anointing which was upon Him has flowed down to us. The Spirit which
   descended upon our Head hath run down to the least member of His body,
   even "to the skirts of His clothing." When the Lord Jesus Christ
   ascended into heaven, He "received gifts for men;" that is, the full
   dispensation of grace was committed unto the second Adam. The Spirit
   which proceedeth from the Father and the Son descends upon us through
   Him. Wherefore "He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye
   the Holy Ghost." The third Person of the ever-blessed Trinity,
   eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son, proceeds unto us
   through the Word made flesh. The Incarnation is the channel of His
   influence, of His presence. He dwells in man as He never dwelt before:
   by unity of substance with the Word, by very presence through the Word
   in us. This is the interior life and reality of the True Vine. "It is
   expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter
   will not come unto you." [89] My outward, visible, and local presence
   shall, through His coming, be inward, invisible, universal. "If I
   depart, I will send Him unto you." From My Father's throne He shall
   proceed from Me to you. He shall "abide with you for ever. Even the
   Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him
   not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you,
   and shall be in you." [90] To this end God "hath put all things under
   His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the Church, which
   is His body, the fulness of Him that filleth all in all." [91] For all
   His members are "an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are
   builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit." [92]
   "For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body." [93] "Your body
   is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you." "He that is joined
   to the Lord is one spirit." [94]

   These passages, which might easily be multiplied, teach us that the
   great gift of Christ is life, given to us by the indwelling of the Holy
   Ghost. Throughout the Old Testament, and especially the prophets, as
   Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Joel, [95] the outpouring of the Spirit is
   foretold as the great grace of the Messiah who was to come; and these
   prophecies, as St. Peter teaches, had their opening fulfilment on the
   day of Pentecost. They are fulfilling now, and shall be ever fulfilling
   until the end of the world. The great gift of life has been bestowed
   upon a world dead in sin: not by measure, nor by gifts shed abroad, nor
   in saints scattered up and down in the earth from age to age; but
   first, in the gift of the Word made flesh, in the Divine manhood of the
   Son, in whom dwelt "all the fulness of the Godhead bodily;" [96] and
   then, by the Holy Ghost, "the Lord and Giver of life," who, through the
   Incarnation, has descended into us, to dwell in us, not only by outward
   gifts, and accidental endowments of grace, but by an inward and abiding
   inhabitation in our whole personal nature. If we may speak of heavenly
   things by earthly, we may say that, as our natural life, which is whole
   in all our being, is whole in every part, so the Spirit of Christ,
   which is in all His mystical body, or rather as the finite is in the
   infinite, in which His mystical body wholly is,--that same fulness of
   spiritual life is in every member of the same; in each one of us the
   Spirit dwells, not by division, or mere emanation, or effect, but by
   personal presence, inhabitation, and life. We have it then not as men,
   but as members of Christ, as partakers of His humanity in whom all
   fulness dwells. [97] And the gift of life is not a power, a principle,
   but a very and true Person dwelling in us. This is the regeneration for
   which all ages waited till the Word was made flesh--the new birth of
   water and of the Spirit, of which the Baptism of Christ is the ordained
   sacrament. Here, then, we see a part of this great promise. In one
   word, it is the fulness of life given to us by the personal indwelling
   of the Holy Ghost, which Christ, by His Incarnation, has bestowed upon
   us.

   2. And besides this, the gift of life is abundant, not only in its
   fulness, but in its continuance. To Adam God said, "In the day thou
   eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." He sinned once, and died. "By
   one man"--and by one sin of that one man--"sin entered into the world,
   and death by sin." Not only did he die, but we in him. The head died,
   and the members with the head; "so death passed upon all men." We died
   before we came into the world: we came dead into life; born of a
   family, the head of which died on the threshold of creation. The life
   of God departed from him, and from us, who were summed up in him. The
   endowments of grace, which were also gifts of life, reverted to God who
   gave them. The earth returned "to the dust as it was." Divine and just
   severity; severe and Divine justice! The gift of life departed from
   him, and from all for whom he had received it. This free and sovereign
   gift, which was never ours by right, nor his until freely given, and
   given upon a Divine and declared law of obedience, reverted to the
   Giver. Nay, more, what is the fall of man but the knowledge of good and
   evil? and what is his misery and his sorrow, what are the griefs and
   the thorns of life, but that knowledge which God forbade on pain of
   death? To know it, is to die. God did not more forbid sin than death
   itself. But he chose death, and took it as his portion. Life departed,
   because he chose to die. Such was man's first estate, and such was our
   estate in him. All that we had of God was stored up in him when he made
   shipwreck of himself and us. We were in the power and in the probation
   of another; of a man weak and frail as ourselves.

   But in this the gift of life, which is by the Spirit of Christ, has
   more abundantly restored our original loss. By the regeneration of the
   Holy Ghost we are engrafted into the second Adam, very man, not frail
   and weak, but also very God, changeless and almighty. We are gathered
   under a Head which cannot fail; and are members of Him who hath
   revealed His own Divine Name: "I am--the Life." He has overcome both
   sin and death for us: sin in the wilderness and upon the Cross, death
   in hell and in the grave; and He is gone up on high, above all created
   life, Creator Himself of all. Our Head, the second Adam, is in the
   throne of God, and Himself is God. We are consubstantial with the
   manhood of Him, who is consubstantial with the Godhead of the Father
   and of the Holy Ghost. We are united to God by a direct participation
   of Him who is both God and man; and are thereby "made partakers of the
   Divine nature." [98]

   In this, again, we see the abundance of the life which He has given us.
   We cannot die in our Head, because He is Life eternal; nor can we die
   in ourselves, except we cast out the Giver of life, who is in us. Our
   first head fell, and drew us with him into the grave; our second Head
   is in heaven, and "our life is hid with Him in God." We can die no more
   by any federal death, but only by our own several and personal death.
   If sinners die eternally, they die one by one, of their own free
   choice, even as Adam. And we now die no more by single acts of
   disobedience; but only by a resolved and deliberate career of sinning.
   This reveals to us the wonderful love and miraculous longsuffering of
   Christ and of the Spirit who dwells in us. When once He enters, there
   He abides with Divine endurance. What, alas! is the life of the whole
   visible body of Christ, of every member, every baptized soul, but a
   strife of sin against the Spirit? Even the holiest, even they who are
   sanctified from childhood, and perhaps they more sorrowfully than all,
   confess this. And yet the Spirit of life abides in us, bears with us,
   will not give us up. Though we slight Him, though we grieve Him, though
   our slights and grievings rise into resistance, and issue in acts, even
   in habits of rebellion; though sins, even deadly sins, defile His
   dwelling, and spurn His Presence, and that for years, through boyhood
   into youth, and youth into manhood, aye, into age and grey hairs, yet
   He does not depart. He will still abide, plead, convince, alarm us, day
   by day, and year by year, until that dread time known before the secret
   tribunal in Christ's righteous kingdom, when the regenerate soul can no
   more be renewed unto repentance. But how long that time is in coming,
   we must every one of us fully know. If it were not as far off as the
   end of God's longsuffering, it would have come upon us long ago. We
   should long since have died eternally. One sin,--and death fell on
   Adam. Sins, as the sand on the sea-shore, are upon our heads; and yet
   we live. What makes this balance hang so unevenly in our behalf? The
   Blood of the Son of God. The abundant gift of life through the Holy
   Ghost dwelling in us. What a revelation of the Divine patience is the
   visible Church, in which the Spirit of abundant life these eighteen
   hundred years has dwelt, ruling, enlightening, inspiring, guiding,
   cleansing, enduring with endless longsuffering the wayward wills of
   men. What a miracle of patience is the indefectibility of the Church of
   Christ. "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." This
   is the foundation of our strength. We know that "the gifts and calling
   of God are without repentance." [99] He will not revoke them till we
   have cast them away. On this patient love we have rested unawares until
   this day. He has borne with us, and upheld us even against ourselves;
   and we know, that if we will hold fast by Him, He will never let us go.
   We may stay our weakness upon His strength, our mortality upon the
   Giver of life. In Him we already partake of the eternal world, and are
   lifted above the power of death. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
   that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath
   everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed
   from death unto life." [100] "I am the resurrection, and the life: he
   that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and he
   that liveth and believeth in Me shall never die." [101] Out of His
   fulness we are filled; by His Divine Incarnation we are upheld; by His
   indwelling Spirit we live in the midst of death, in the heart of a
   world dead in sin, in the atmosphere of death, which is the very breath
   of our natural life: so that now death itself is no more death, but
   sleep; a kindly change, loosening the grave-clothes, which swathe the
   true life He has bestowed upon us; and setting us at large, to live in
   the freedom and fulness of the Spirit, and to wait for Him who is "the
   Resurrection and the Life" of the kingdom of God. For what destiny of
   bliss Adam was created, is not revealed. All that we read is of his
   felicity in a Paradise on earth. And though we may believe that he
   would have been, in due time, translated to a nearer access to the
   vision of God, yet it is only through the Incarnation that the eternal
   indwelling of God in man, and of man in God, is assured to us. In this
   we see the perfection of the Divine kingdom, which ascends in a scale
   of infinite perfection. The redemption is not a mere restoration of the
   fall of man; but a deeper mystery of love, carrying the works both of
   the wisdom and of the power of God upward in the order of bliss. This,
   then, is the meaning of His great promise, "I am come that they might
   have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."

   Let us draw from what has been said one or two practical truths of
   great importance in our daily life.

   1. And first, we hereby know that in all our acts there is a Presence
   higher than our own natural and moral powers. We were united to Christ
   by the presence of the Holy Spirit from our Baptism. There has never
   been a moment from the first dawn of consciousness, from the first
   twilight of reason, and the first motions of the will, when the Spirit
   of life has not been present with us. He has created in us the first
   dispositions to truth and holiness; every good desire was from Him. He
   has prevented us in all good intentions, restrained us in all evil. He
   has, as it were, beset our whole spiritual nature, and encompassed us
   on all sides, guiding us into the will of God. From the Spirit of
   Christ we received not our will,--for that was in our nature,--but
   every good inclination. By our fallen state, the will is of itself
   inclined to evil. It is in bondage to its own evil. It can no more
   release itself than water can stand as a wall, or a dry rod shoot with
   blossoms. The law of its fallen nature is to incline to evil, as the
   law of fire is to ascend in flame. By nature, then, our will is both
   free, and not free; freely enslaved, and yet without power to unchain
   itself. And this the Spirit of Christ does for us. He makes sin
   fearful, terrible, bitter, and hateful, till the will shrinks from it,
   as we draw back from a searing fire. He reveals in our soul, the
   hideousness and deadliness of evil, till we tremble at it, and are
   willing to tear ourselves away from its allurements. But this
   willingness, in itself, is impotent. Left to ourselves we should be in
   bondage still. The sin that dwells in us belongs to our very nature,
   because it is fallen; so that when we have received a better will, we
   need the power to be free. We have power to bind ourselves, but not to
   loose; for when we have put on the fetter, there is another hand which
   turns the bolt, and by ourselves we can loose it no more. But the
   Spirit who gave us our new birth is God. Before Him all bonds fall off.
   If only we yield our will to Him, His power shall be ours: and, by His
   help, every sin of the soul is broken through, and we are set free; not
   by our own power, not by our own will; though it be still with our own
   act, willingly and freely. This is the office of the Holy Spirit in all
   our sanctification. He first inspires thoughts, inclinations, desires,
   intentions of holiness. He goes before, leading the way; winning us on
   by soft inward persuasions and by a sweet sense of God's will; giving
   us, with a holy will, also a power above our own. The working of the
   Spirit is, so to speak, co-extensive with our whole moral being. He
   presides over all the springs of thought, word, and deed: by His
   gracious Presence endowing us with power and will to mortify sin, and
   to live in holiness. And this gift of the Spirit of holiness is itself
   the gift of life. "For to be carnally minded is death; but to be
   spiritually minded is life and peace. . . . But ye are not in the
   flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
   Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His. . . .
   But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
   you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
   mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you." [102] What, then, is
   our life but the presence of the Spirit dwelling in us?

   2. Another plain and practical truth is, that this Presence works in us
   according to the revealed and fixed laws of our probation. Because
   there is some apparent difficulty of reconciling these two revealed
   facts, many have chosen to believe either the one or the other, but
   refused to believe in both. As if they could be inconsistent. As if God
   were the author of confusion, the revealer of contradictions. There
   may, indeed, be mystery, but can be no discord. In the kingdom of God
   there must be agencies so diverse as to surpass our knowledge. How is
   it with things nearest to our sense? Who can tell how the material
   brain is the instrument of thought, or how the whole bodily frame obeys
   the complex motions of the will, how the hand answers to every creation
   of the mind? What is the point of contact between intellectual and
   animal life? When we can lay down this as a basis, it will be time to
   build upon it the further knowledge,--what is the point of contact
   between the Divine life and our spiritual life. Nevertheless, there is
   less of difficulty than some would have us believe. If we may
   reverently take as an example the Person of the Son of God, we shall
   see that the Divine and the human wills in Him, though ever two, as the
   two natures were ever perfect, were also in action ever one by a free
   perfect harmony. So is it, in a manner, with us, who are regenerate by
   the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The Divine will is ever present with
   our personal will, presiding, restraining, persuading us. We may,
   indeed, wholly and finally resist it: for we have the power, if we have
   the will; because the power of resistance is the sinful will itself; as
   our Lord has said; "Ye will not come to Me, that ye might have life."
   And as our resistance, so is His persuasion: the force by which our
   will is changed from evil to good, from resistance to compliance, is a
   moral force. If it were any other, it would defeat itself. The force of
   constraint multiplies unwillingness: only moral suasions win the will
   to free assent. And these moral suasions, drawn from all depths of love
   and fear, from life and death, from heaven and hell, from sin and from
   the Cross, are perpetually pressing upon the regenerate will. They bear
   upon it with the pressure of the Divine presence, which reveals them in
   us; as a water-flood presses with the whole weight of its stream upon a
   bolted wheel, waiting till it give way. The wheel may resist, but it
   cannot move alone. So with the persuasions of the Divine Spirit. They
   do not overbear and carry away before them the fragments of our moral
   nature, but wait upon them, and move them according to their own
   natural laws. For who is He that persuades but the same who made us? He
   knows the creature of His hands, and is come not to destroy, but to
   fulfil; to heal and create anew what sin has corrupted. His persuasions
   are by illuminations of truth and inspirations of holiness; and these
   are powers which act not by force, but like the lights and dews of
   Heaven, by a piercing virtue, infusing new gifts of fruitfulness and
   power into the works of God. What we receive of the Divine Spirit is so
   given to us as to become our own, and as our own we use it with a
   perfect freedom of the will.

   3. Lastly, we may learn that the union of this Divine Presence with us
   in our probation, issues in the last and crowning grace of this life,
   the gift of perseverance. "Being confident," St. Paul says to the
   Philippians, ". . . that He which hath begun a good work in you will
   perfect the same unto the day of Jesus Christ." [103] "Faithful is He
   that calleth you, who also will do it." [104]

   If any sincere Christian cast himself with his whole will upon the
   Divine Presence which dwells within him, he shall he kept safe unto the
   end. This is the spiritual union and mutual knowledge ok which our Lord
   speaks when He says: "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they
   follow Me:" then conies the promise of perseverance: "I give unto them
   eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
   them out of My hand." [105] What is it that makes us unable t(
   persevere? Is it want of strength? By no means We have with us the
   strength of the Holy Spirit When did we ever set ourselves sincerely to
   any work according to the will of God, and fail for want of strength?
   It was not that strength failed the will, but that the will failed
   first. There is the seat of all our weakness, the source of all in
   stability. If we could but embrace the Divine will with the whole love
   of ours; cleaving to it and holding fast by it, we should be borne
   along as upon "the river of the water of life." And what is it that
   hinders us? I am not now speaking of those who indulge in wilful sin;
   but of those who desire to persevere in the love of God--what is it
   hinders us? It is the remains of unsubdued faults of mind, such as
   impatience, stubbornness, wilfulness; or of indolence, sloth, and
   coldness; or it is the conscious want of holy affections, of
   thankfulness, praise, love, grace, devotion; and, therefore, of
   endurance and self-denial for Christ's sake. These are the things which
   make our hold of the Divine will so loose and slack. We feel it to be a
   high and severe blessedness, for which our hearts are too feeble and
   earthward. And therefore we open only certain chambers of our will to
   the influence of the Divine will. We are afraid of being wholly
   absorbed into it; lest, if I may so say, "the Spirit of the Lord"
   should take us "up, and cast us upon some mountain, or into some
   valley," [106] far from all joys, consolations, friends, and home. And
   yet, if we would have peace, we must be altogether united to Him. For
   unless we be wholly conformed to His will, we shall never attain the
   gift of perseverance; or at least, we shall always doubt and fear of
   our holding out; and when perseverance is doubtful, there can be no
   true peace.

   Let us, then, endeavour so to embrace the gift of life which is in us,
   that nothing may separate us from Him; that no choice, no intent, no
   affection, no permitted motion of our will, may cast a shadow between
   us and His presence. And then let us fear nothing. We need fear no
   temptations; for He will either turn them aside, or carry us through:
   we need not be dismayed at the stubborn strength of the sins against
   which we are contending; for He will cast them all out at last: we need
   not be out of heart, even at our sensible coldness, slackness of
   intention, impotence of will; for He will kindle the love of God within
   us; and give us, in His own time, the zeal and energy of a fervent
   repentance. We have but one thing to make sure, and He will provide all
   the rest. If His will be our will, He will quicken and cleanse, kindle
   and sanctify us in body, and soul, and spirit. It is not for us to look
   back, except in repentance, or to look on, except in hope. The past is
   no longer ours; the future is His. Now is our probation: to trust, to
   believe His love, to be prompt, compliant to the guidance of His
   inspirations. His Presence is in us, leading us to rest. Our safety and
   our peace is to abide under its shadow. Therein can enter nothing that
   defileth; nothing savouring of death. If the memory of past sin makes
   you afraid, ask of the Spirit which is in you the gift of sorrow; if
   the proved instability of your will makes you almost despair, ask of
   Him the gift of perseverance. He is in you as a fountain of life, deep
   as Eternity, inexhaustible as God. The rivers of His strength, healing,
   consolation, are never stayed, except in hearts barren and dry. In the
   humble, hoping, loving, trustful heart, the waters of life pour forth
   in an exuberant flood. "When the poor and needy seek water, and there
   is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear
   them; I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers in
   high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the
   wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water." [107]
   This is the gift of the "Spirit in the soul of man; and the source of
   it has been revealed from heaven. "And he shewed me a pure river of
   water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God
   and of the Lamb." "The Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let him that
   heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever
   will, let him take the water of life freely." [108]

    SERMON X.

  THE CITY OF GOD.

    PHILIPPIANS iii. 20.

   "Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the
   Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it
   may be fashioned like unto His glorious body."

   ST. PAUL, in these words, is strengthening the Christians at Philippi,
   by setting before them the greatness of their calling and of their
   destiny. They had much need of encouragement; for a time of sore and
   peculiar trial was then upon them. They had to endure not only bitter
   persecutions and the assault of Antichrists, wielding the powers of the
   world to wear out the saints of the Most High, but a still more
   dangerous, because more subtil trial. They were being tried by false
   and sensual men mingling in the communion of the Church. There were
   among them false teachers, who mixed up the law of Moses with the
   gospel of Christ; double-minded men, steering between both; striving to
   escape persecution, and yet desiring to obtain the reputation of
   Christians. These were very dangerous tempters, who entered the Church
   in disguise, defiling it, and destroying souls for whom Christ died.

   There was one special mark by which such men (as we see both from St.
   Paul and St. John) might be known: they lived evil lives. Therefore
   here St. Paul sets before the Philippians a contrast of carnal and
   spiritual Christians, and of the earthly and the heavenly life. After
   saying, "Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
   even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ: whose
   end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in
   their shame, who mind earthly things;" he adds, "For our conversation
   is in heaven."

   The word here rendered conversation' means something further and more
   specific than our word commonly signifies. It means the estate, and
   therefore the rights and the duties of a citizen of any city.

   We see, therefore, that by this word he intends:

   1. First, to bid them remember that God had made them citizens of the
   holy city. "Our conversation is in heaven:" that is, our true home is
   not here, but on high. "Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the
   mother of us all." [109] And we, by our Baptism, are made free of it:
   we are partakers of the freedom which is in Christ. This is the city of
   which St. Paul speaks when he says, "Ye are come unto Mount Sion, and
   unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
   innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of
   the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of
   all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect." [110] And again,
   when he says, "Here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to
   come;" [111] "a city which hath foundations." [112] And St. John, in
   the last great prophecy given through him to the Church, saw that city,
   builded four-square, perfect every way, on twelve foundations, having
   in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. It was built at
   unity with itself, perfect in structure and in symmetry, its length as
   great as its breadth; its walls were of all manner of precious stones,
   and its streets of pure gold, clear as glass: a wonderful vision, full
   of mystery, and of meaning partly revealed, partly hidden, and by
   hiding made even more glorious and majestic. It sets before us the
   unity, multitude, perfection, glory, and bliss, of Christ's saints,
   gathered under Him in the kingdom of God. Of this city and company, the
   whole Church on earth, and, in it, the Christians in Philippi, were
   citizens and partakers. St. Paul tells them this, to remind them that
   they were no longer isolated one from another, but incorporated into
   one body. Sin, as it rends man from God, so it rends man from man. It
   is the antagonist of all unity--a power of dissolution and of
   isolation. But the grace of Christ, by its first gift, binds again the
   soul of man with God, and the spirits of all the regenerate in one
   fellowship. We are taken out of a dead world, to be grafted into the
   living Church. Therefore St. Paul tells the Christians in Ephesus, that
   they were "no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with
   the saints, and of the household of God." They were thereby made
   subjects and servants of the King of saints, the Lord of the holy city.
   It became their own inheritance. Its courts were their resting-places,
   pledged to them and sure. Their names were written among those who
   should walk in the light of God and of the Lamb. This is the first
   meaning of the word.

   2. And next it taught them, that as their state was, so their life
   should be; that as they were citizens of heaven, so their manner of
   life should be heavenly too. Our word conversation' has a very complex
   and extensive signification. It means the whole course and context of a
   man's life, words, and actions; as in the hook of Acts, where it is
   said, "while the Lord Jesus went in and out among us;" [113] that is,
   was familiarly present with us in the whole course and detail of His
   earthly life. By this, then, St. Paul means, that the whole of their
   life must needs be sanctified, penetrated in every part by the spirit
   of their calling. Though they were in the world, they had nothing in
   it, nor it in them. All its provinces and kingdoms, its cities and
   palaces, were nothing to them. All the pomps and gifts, the glitter and
   the pleasures of the world, were but snares and burdens. What part in
   these had they whose lot was in the heavenly Jerusalem? To them the
   fashion of this world was but a vision, luring and false, shifting and
   passing away. They were united to the eternal world, which has no
   variableness, neither shadow of turning; and to it they were fast
   advancing. The maxims, examples, rules of men, were no laws for their
   guidance: their only laws were the lives of God's servants--the order
   and the unity of heaven. As the visible Church bodies forth the
   invisible to the eye of flesh, so the invisible imposes its supremacy
   and dominion upon the visible Church. As the head is the seat and
   source of thought, power, and command, so Christ is the fountain of all
   law, power, and order, to the body on earth. From Him comes holiness,
   and to Him holiness ascends again in adoration. Worship is the intense
   utterance of the sanctity of the Church. We see, then, in what the
   fellowship of the city of God consists: in the unity of the imperfect
   with the perfect; of the Church of one age with the Church of all ages;
   in the presence of Christ the Head through the Holy Ghost, in all the
   body visible and invisible; and this issuing on earth in the heavenly
   conversation of His servants. This has been the mystery at which the
   world has wondered, and upon which, in fear and foreboding, it has made
   incessant war. "Who shall not fear Thee, O King of saints," and Thy
   Body, which is eternal; the Church visible and imperishable, witnessing
   and suffering, but never consumed? This is the marvel of the mystery,
   at which the kings of the earth have shut their mouths, upon which the
   host of heaven look and worship, learning "the manifold wisdom of God."
   This, then, only too briefly, is the substance and outline of those few
   but great words of the apostle, "our conversation is in heaven."

   See, therefore, how high is our calling. We are incorporated with the
   city of the living God. It is all around us even now; we are within its
   walls, builded upon the apostles and prophets, encompassed by a cloud
   of witnesses. It is the city of refuge from the world, the flesh, and
   the devil. Many generations of its citizens have overcome, and are gone
   on before, ascending up on high, There is pledged to you as sure a
   mastery over all these enemies and powers as to them. They have won
   their crown; but yours, too, is sure. They who are now entered into
   rest, a little while ago were sinners and tempted; then penitents, now
   resting and crowned. Their earthly warfare has received its complement
   and fulness: what they strove to be, they are. They who prayed for
   humility, are humble; for meekness, are meek; for purity, are "pure,
   even as He is pure." They who desired to know the truth, now see God,
   the Truth, uncreated, eternal. Remember this in all your temptations,
   doubts, and perils. When you are afraid, when you are ready to give
   way, when sluggish unwillingness weighs you down, and to persevere unto
   the end seems to be impossible,--then remember what they were who have
   entered through the gates into the city. The very same bliss is pledged
   to you: a spirit perfect as the Spirit of Christ, when He shall change
   your vile body, that it may be like unto His glorious body. They whom
   you have yielded up, are only parted for awhile. They have gone up,
   after their mortal toil, and are resting now, laid up for the morning
   of the resurrection.

   How great comfort is there here for all mourners. Be of good cheer,
   every one that is afflicted; for the Lord is preparing you for the city
   of God. Whatever he your sorrow, it is the token of His love, for the
   Man of sorrows is our King: and the path of sorrow is the path of His
   kingdom; there is none other that leadeth unto life. Your reward is
   sure, if you are but true to yourself. Do we believe these things? Are
   they realities, or are they words? They are God's Word, which is a
   reality. "Heaven and earth shall pass away; but My word shall not pass
   away." It is when speaking of sorrows that St. Paul says, that God hath
   "predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son." "O thou
   afflicted, tossed with tempest, but not comforted, I will lay thy
   stones with fair colours, and thy foundations with sapphires. And I
   will make thy windows agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy
   borders of pleasant stones. And all thy children shall be taught of the
   Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children." [114]

   And if our calling be so high, how holy and searching must be the laws
   of that city. They are the laws of the heavenly court, of saints and of
   angels. Our law is the royal law, which has two great chapters, "Thou
   shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
   and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength, and thy neighbour as
   thyself." [115] This is the decree which governs earth and heaven; it
   embraces the whole man, and searches out the depths of the spirit. "It
   was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall
   kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you, That
   whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger
   of the judgment." [116] This command is spiritual, sharper than any
   two-edged sword. It is the law of interior holiness--the Cross realised
   in the will--carried out in the manifold actings of life. If we would
   know how to expound it, we must imitate Christ our Lord. The words and
   the deeds of the King of saints are both text and comment. But if this
   be so, what is the state of the Church visible on earth? What signs
   does it bear of its heavenly origin? Where is its unity, and where its
   holiness? Where is the perfection of its citizens; where are the tokens
   of the royal law? Let us try ourselves by this rule.

   1. It is plain, then, that where there is no outward obedience to these
   heavenly laws, there can be no real citizenship of heaven. A certain
   estate of citizenship there must be, because God gave it to us by our
   regeneration in holy Baptism. He bestowed upon us our justification;
   and gave us an inheritance among the saints in light. This is His act;
   for "it is God that justifieth." But though He bestow this freedom,
   what He gave, we may forfeit. If we break the laws, we thereby
   disfranchise ourselves of "the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
   free." Sinful Christians make themselves outlaws from the heavenly
   city; and the enemies of His Cross have no part in it. They are under a
   ban of outlawry, beyond the protection of the law, though still subject
   to its penalties. Such are all blasphemers, scorners of God and of His
   grace, gluttonous and excessive persons, the impure and sensual,
   uncharitable and bitter, proud, hard-hearted, unmerciful, "whose end is
   destruction." "Into the holy city there shall enter nothing that
   defileth, or that worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie." And what
   is the condition of multitudes in the visible Church but this? It has
   even come to pass, that through the evil lives of the regenerate, men
   disbelieve the gift of regeneration; and deny the grant of heavenly
   freedom, which God of His sovereign grace gives to the Baptized. True,
   indeed, it is, that sinners have no fellowship in the heavenly city, as
   rebels have no franchises or rights: yet they are subjects still; and
   must be judged by the violated laws of their heavenly Prince. Though we
   will not have Him to reign over us, He is still our King, and must be
   our Judge.

   2. Again; this shews us that, even where there is outward obedience,
   there may yet be no true inward participation in the life and freedom
   of the heavenly city. This is a warning specially needed in these
   latter times: for there is much seeming and false Christianity in the
   world.

   The orders and usages of society are a great check upon grosser
   transgressions. Public opinion--a heartless motive--is a very strong
   restraint, and has in these days erected for itself a tribunal from
   which to act the censor, and to exercise an irresponsible discipline.
   The worship of men, self-worship, world-worship, all conspire to keep
   up the semblance of Christian obedience. Civilisation is an extensive
   refiner of outward manners. It purifies, at least, the language of men,
   while their thoughts are all the while uncleansed. It establishes
   higher standards of moral judgment, and gives a tone to private life,
   and to the spirit of laws and tribunals, and to the proceedings of
   commutative justice. Custom also is a powerful support of the better
   habits passively received in childhood. Men float as upon a stream,
   buoyed up, passive, and inert. And intellect has a vast and versatile
   power of putting on the appearance not only of religion, but even of
   high sanctity. It is hard to believe that a man is not what he is able
   both powerfully and persuasively to describe. And what is true of
   individuals is true also of societies. A civilised Christian state has
   a thousand agencies to assist in supporting the belief of its own
   religious character; and the Christian tradition of eighteen hundred
   years yet floats on. This is a danger to which we are specially exposed
   at this time. The powers of the world, though professing to be
   Christian, have grown weary of Christ's yoke, and are divorcing
   themselves, one by one, from Him. We have new ideas, new theories, new
   forces at work. Education now is the regenerator of individuals; and
   civilisation is the modern city of God. We hear of individual and
   social development; individual and social progress; of the destiny of
   mankind, and of the golden age yet to come, when all shall be loyal,
   moral, intellectual; Christian, but not sectarian; religious, though
   unable to unite; one with God, though divided from each other. But we
   seem to forget that, for the development of individual perfection,
   there is needed a principle above nature; and for the development of
   society, an unity above national institutions. In what does
   Christianity differ from philosophy on the one hand, but in revealing
   to us the regeneration of the Spirit; and from Judaism on the other,
   hut in absorbing all nations into the unity of the Church? The true and
   only fruitful principle of education is the gift of our spiritual
   birth; the mightiest power of national development and progress is
   subjection to the city of God. But if we will invert these things, we
   simply adopt the principle of philosophical education, and a Judaic
   nationality. In these days, when Christian realities are fast passing
   away, Christian terms are still retained; but they are retained only to
   be transferred to shadows. We hear on all sides of unity and
   regeneration; but the spiritual laws of the heavenly city are out of
   date. In modern civilisation they are, if not formally rescinded, cast
   aside as obsolete. The powers of the world need something more akin to
   themselves than a "conversation in heaven;" and to uphold their
   religious contradictions, they must find a higher unity than the Church
   of Christ.

   All these things engender a specious outward Christianity, which
   descends from age to age, on the surface of nations and households, and
   under it there is often no fellowship with the world unseen; no living
   hold of the Head, which is our Lord Jesus Christ. This is our peril
   now. Laxity, indifference, false theories of charity, fear of being
   derided for narrowness, or of being assailed for tenacity, make men
   shrink from their heavenly allegiance. They try to make it chime with
   the policy of the world. And where these clash, the world has its will,
   because it is near and imposing: the Faith must give way, because the
   city of God is silent, abiding its time in heaven. Deep-working evils
   eat out the heart of such a Christianity, whether in nations or
   individuals. Vainglory, worldly greatness, luxury, softness, traffic
   and barter, wealth and selfishness,--these make men and empires to be
   secret and stubborn enemies of the Cross and kingdom of Christ. Its
   realities are hateful, because sharp and rebuking. Worldliness,
   follies, and pleasures, with the lusts which are never far apart from
   them, turn the whole heart from God. St. Paul says of all such, "who
   mind earthly things," that is, they buy and sell, and grow fond of
   their gains; ever busy, ever full of thought and care, policy and
   scheming. They live among earthly things, till they catch their taint,
   and themselves become earthly. And all these, and they with them, must
   "perish with the using."

   Such men may be known by this--they never forego any thing for the sake
   of Christ; gain, honour, place, ease, pleasure, and the like. When the
   trial comes, they choose the world; and sell their Master for thirty
   pieces of silver, or for a bauble, or for the gambling hope of
   wealth--for an ambitious dream; whereby we may know that they are none
   of His.

   3. Lastly, we may learn, that there may be living and habitual
   conversation in heaven, under the aspect of the most simple, ordinary
   life. For on what does it depend but on these two things, on faith,
   which keeps alive the consciousness,--or, if I may so say, the vision
   of the city of God,--and on the obedience of our heart to its laws of
   love? And what are faith and obedience but realities of the Spirit,
   which all who desire may attain?

   The greatest mysteries of Christ's kingdom, like the highest laws of
   creation, are the broadest and largest in their range. The communion of
   saints, the consciousness of Christ's presence, and of our fellowship
   with all who are united with Him, is an article of our Baptismal faith;
   and may be, therefore, universal. It is not the intellectual and the
   contemplative, the retired and highly favoured, alone, who may converse
   with the heavenly city, and have fellowship with all who dwell in it.
   We live too little in the presence of the world unseen. Even religious
   minds are too little conscious of it. If some high mountain rose above
   our dwelling, we should never pass our threshold, or look abroad,
   without seeing it. The first lights of the morning would fall upon it;
   the last glow of evening would redden it; all day long the sun's heat
   would burn upon it; all our distances would be measured; all our paths
   guided by it. Such to the eyes of faith is the Mount Zion which is in
   heaven. It hangs over us, and we dwell upon its base. If only our eyes
   were open, as those of Elisha's servant in Dothan, we should be more
   conscious of our heavenly fellowship than of our earthly friends. With
   them would be our true home; the only world of reality; our only
   abiding rest. This would be the universal consolation of every member
   of Christ; the secret stay of souls under the burden of this weary
   world. Wheresoever we be, we may look upward, and see "Jerusalem which
   is above," "the mother of us all." When we kneel down, it, as it were,
   descends, and we enter into it; we pass through its open gates, and
   fall down even before the presence of the King. But at all times, even
   the busiest, and in all lawful ways, even the most crowded by the
   world, we are "still within its shelter and its sphere. A holy life is
   its very gate. And let us always remember that holiness does not
   consist in doing uncommon things, but in doing every thing with purity
   of heart. It is made up of relative duties and of habitual devotion.
   Such works of faith, patience, and charity, as our life admits, even to
   the very lowest state may he sanctified. Some of the greatest saints of
   God have been formed in the humblest paths of life, in private homes;
   as Anna, and Simeon, and in all ages of the Church; for secret
   fellowship with God is the source of all sanctity. The world soon wears
   out and withers up the soul which is familiar with its works, but a
   stranger to the Divine presence. If we do not converse with God in
   daily worship, we shall soon he swallowed up by the attractions of this
   earthly state. In the temptations of the world there is this special
   danger, that they are incessant. There is no moment when they are not
   upon us. Like the law of gravitation, which universally takes effect
   wheresoever it is not kept out by a special counteraction, so it is
   with the cares, pleasures, labours, anxieties of life. Nothing but
   fellowship with God keeps them in check. The moment we relax, they
   resume their power. The earth is nearer to us than the heavenly city;
   and all our affinities are more with earth than heaven. We need,
   therefore, something more than general intentions, and general habits
   of religion, to keep ourselves stedfast to our true home. We need some
   special and definite rules; such, for instance, as a careful reminding
   of ourselves, every morning, of the peculiar dangers of our calling in
   life, and of the particular sins to which we are most inclined; with a
   prayer that God will keep us all day long, by His Spirit, from tempting
   ourselves. At night, again, we ought to review the day, and see in what
   we have fallen, praying His forgiveness. And this habit of watchfulness
   needs two great supports,--the one, a daily recollection of the city of
   God, and the other, an habitual consciousness of God's presence. And
   these, again, run up into the true sources of all spiritual strength,
   which are frequent communion--as often as, if possible not less than,
   once a month and persevering prayer. If we will watchfully and
   patiently walk by this path, then no matter where we be: in the throng
   and turmoil of great cities, in the crowded ways of life, you may live
   as citizens of heaven. There need be no affected singularity of gait or
   speech, nothing outwardly unlike the busy world around you; though you
   be all estranged within. It is a blessed thought, that no lawful state
   is a bar to any aspiration, to any reward in the kingdom of God. Our
   desires may go up direct from the thickest entanglements of life, to
   the throne before which ascend the prayers of saints. In the midst of
   this evil world, "the Lord knoweth them that are His." They are lifted
   up, as it were, out of time, and have their lot among those who are
   already partakers of eternity. They go in and out of the heavenly
   gates, which are open evermore: for "the gates of it shall not be shut
   at all by day," and "there shall be no night there." Little as we often
   think it, there are at our side those who shall be high in the city of
   God. Many that are slighted and despised,--many that now seem afar
   off,--are ripening to be saints. At that day "many that are first shall
   be last, and the last first:" "they shall come from the east, and from
   the west, and from the north, and from the south," from all lands, and
   from all ages, from all ways and paths of life, "and shall sit down in
   the kingdom of God," [117] Be this our prayer, our lot, our rest for
   ever.

SERMON XL

  THE CROSS THE MEASURE OF SIN.

    PHILIPPIANS iii. 18.

   "Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
   weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ."

   ST. PAUL is here speaking neither of Jews nor of heathens, but of
   Christians. These enemies of the Cross were not blasphemers or
   persecutors of the Lord of glory, but baptized sinners: men who bore
   the sign and name of Christ; but by their sins crucified the Son of God
   afresh unto themselves. They were partly false apostles, who began even
   then to divide the Church: men of unsound doctrine and of impure life;
   together with those who followed them: they were partly also the sinful
   members of the Philippian Church, who had fallen from their first
   faith, and lived in the lusts of the world and of the flesh, still
   professing Christianity. No doubt, St. Paul is speaking of gross
   sinners, but not of gross sinners only. He here lays down a principle,
   which applies to all sin, of every kind and of every measure, whether
   great or small. He says of such men, that "they are enemies of the
   Cross of Christ." This is the special guilt of sin in Christians. Let
   us, therefore, see more fully what he means. He does not mean, that
   sinful Christians, openly and in words, deny or blaspheme the Gospel;
   nor that they use force to persecute the Church and body of Christ. For
   it often happens that Christians, as they go deeper in sin, all the
   more profess faith in the freeness of God's grace, the fulness of
   Christ's forgiveness, the perfection of His one sacrifice, the
   sufficiency of His atonement: that is, they become Antinomian; and all
   the more boast of faith in words, as they are enemies of the Christ in
   deed and in truth.

   How is it then, that every sin, even the very least, makes men enemies
   of the Cross of Christ?

   1. First, because it was sin, that, so to speak, created the Cross; sin
   made a Redeemer necessary. It opened some deep breach in the order of
   life and in the unity of God's kingdom, which could be no way healed
   but by the atonement. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death
   by sin; and so death passed upon all men:"--a new dominion was set up,
   where, before, God reigned alone. Out of the abyss of the eternal world
   arose up some awful power, some strong necessity--the antagonist of
   God. One act of one man, the disobedience of one will, called up a
   whole world of rebellion, and let in all the powers of death upon the
   works of God. When we speak of these things, we speak of what we cannot
   understand. The depth is too dark for us. The voice which issues out of
   the eternal throne has said, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou
   shalt surely die;" "The wages of sin is death;" "The soul that sinneth,
   it shall die." This is all we can know until we are beyond the grave.
   Then, it may be, the powers of death will be revealed to those over
   whom it has no more dominion. For the present time, it is enough to
   know, that there could be no life in the world, when fallen, except by
   the atonement of the Son of God. And He, of His free choice and eternal
   love, gave Himself to die in our behalf. The Cross broke through these
   absolute and awful necessities, and henceforth "death and hell" are
   "cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death." [118] Here we
   may see the enmity of sin. If there had been no sin in the world until
   now, the sin we have committed, each one of us, this day would have
   demanded the sacrifice of reconciliation. Such is the intensity of one
   offence; such its infinity of guilt. We may say, one by one, "Though
   there had been no sinner upon earth but myself, I should have created
   the necessity which nailed the Son of God upon the Tree, Though
   sufficient to redeem all the world, yet nothing less than His blood
   could redeem me alone. Infinite in price, His death is needed to blot
   out my sin alone, which is infinite in guilt."

   2. And, again, not only does sin both create and multiply this
   necessity, but, so to speak, it continues to frustrate the work of the
   Cross and Passion of the Son of God. It demands His death, and it
   defeats its virtues: it invokes it from the mercies of God, and it wars
   against it by direct hostility: it first makes it necessary, and then
   would make it fruitless.

   For the blood of the Son of God was shed to blot out the sin of the
   world; but sin blots out again, from the soul that commits it, the
   blood of sprinkling "wherewith it was sanctified." It plucks away, one
   by one, the souls for whom Christ died; and gives the key to those
   fearful words, "Many are called, but few are chosen." "Strait is the
   gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be
   that find it." [119] This is a mystery we can only refer to the mystery
   of the fall and to the origin of evil. The Lamb of God hath taken away
   the sin of the world, yet the elect alone are saved; and "the whole
   world lieth in wickedness." In every soul, sin is still striving to
   tear it away from the life to which through the Cross it is united. In
   every one of us this whole mystery is at work: Michael and his angels
   fighting against the devil and his angels: a fearful conflict between
   spiritual hosts contending for our eternal destiny. And in all the
   earth the same warfare is renewed: the world wrestling against the
   Church; and, worst of all, the regenerate, who have made themselves
   again servants of sin, against the spirit of their regeneration which
   is given to us by our crucified Redeemer.

   3. And, once more, sin makes men enemies of the Cross, because it is,
   in virtue and spirit, a renewal of the crucifixion. Therefore St. Paul
   says, "It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
   tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
   and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
   come, if they shall fall way, to renew them again unto repentance;
   seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to
   an open shame." [120] It acts the crucifixion over again. And therefore
   our Lord, though He was already in the bliss and glory of the Father,
   cried, saying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" In like manner to
   every one of us He stretches forth His pierced hands, and saith, "See
   what I bare for thee, and woundest thou Me again?" St. John also
   writes, "Behold He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and
   they also which pierced Him." [121] He does not only mean Pilate and
   Herod, the priests and His crucifiers on Mount Calvary, but all
   sinners, both before and since His Passion; the whole conspiracy of
   sinful and rebellious wills, by whom He has been betrayed and bound,
   buffetted and wounded, from the beginning until His coming again. In
   truth, it was not the hammer and the nails which crucified Him; nor the
   Roman soldiers who wielded the weapons of His Passion; nor the arm and
   the hand which smote the sharp iron into the wood--these were but the
   blind material instruments of His agony. His true crucifiers were our
   sins,--and we, ourselves--the sinners, for whom He died. This was the
   real power of darkness which set in motion all the array of death.
   Wilful sins renew, in virtue and by implication, the wounds that were
   suffered on Mount Calvary. And this reveals in us the true depth and
   measure of our guilt. By our offences we not only create the necessity
   for an atonement while we frustrate its effects, but we wound Him
   again, who, while we were yet sinners, died for us. The chief guilt of
   sin is its ingratitude--the unthankfulness of heart which endures to
   act over again the Passion of our Redeemer. The very instincts of
   nature would shrink from such unfeeling hardness, Let us but put it to
   ourselves: let us call to mind the sufferings of any one whom we have
   loved and tended in pain: the sights and the sounds of those dark hours
   in which we saw them bowing under the burden of mortal agony,--all
   these things are fixed in our souls as thorns which can never be
   plucked out. Every remembrance of them pierces to the quick: even
   sudden and transient recollections thrill through us. The visions of
   sorrow, which a tone or a strain of music, or the first lights of
   morning waken in our memories, break up fountains of tears, and make
   our hearts to flow with emotion. Would we bring all these back again?
   Would we renew all these sorrows and pains once more? Do our hearts so
   much as willingly consent to the mere passing thought of their enduring
   afresh the last struggles of distress? Would you slight their known
   desire? Would you do what they forbade, or looked upon, even in
   silence, with sad and loving reproof? And yet, when we sin, what else
   do we towards Him who for us hung upon the Cross? The ingratitude of
   our sin renews, so far as can be, the very act of crucifixion. It is,
   then, no mere figure of speech, but a very deep and appalling reality,
   that sin makes every soul that wilfully offends an enemy of the Cross
   of Christ, by converting it into a direct spiritual antagonist of the
   will and intent of our merciful Lord in the mystery of His Passion. And
   yet how little do we lay this to heart. Therefore, we shall do well to
   go somewhat into detail, and to bring this subject to bear upon the
   particulars of our life.

   1. Hence we may see, first, the exceeding sinfulness of every single
   act of wilful sin. We deceive ourselves by dealing with our sins in a
   heap. If we would weigh them by a just measure, we must treat them
   singly. Each one, taken alone, contains the whole principle of
   rebellion against God, and is united to the necessity of the
   crucifixion. Our whole will, that is, our whole moral power and being,
   is in every deliberate act. We all acknowledge this in the greater
   sins, such as bloodshed, blasphemy, hypocrisy, and the like. Of these
   there is no question. But what was the sin by which the world fell, and
   mankind died upon the earth? Was that first transgression, according to
   the measures which men have invented for the Eternal Judge, a great sin
   or a small? Was it a sin of the spirit or of the flesh?--a refined or a
   gross sin?--a sin implying corruption of the heart, or consistent with
   purity, and the benevolence in which men place their perfection? What
   was that sin in its life and reality? It was a willing variance with
   the will of God; a consent of the heart to what God had forbidden. And
   what, then, is pride, vanity, anger, worldliness, self-love,
   ill-temper, falsehood, insincerity? What are these, of which men make
   such little count? Are they not, every one, as they are committed, even
   in single acts, sins of a high and guilty character? Is not every
   consent of the will to sin, a deliberate participation in the wilful
   rebellion against the will of God, which pierced the Son of God? Shall
   we say, "I did not think of this?" Can we say in the day of His coming,
   "Lord, I did not know, or I did not remember, or I did not intend" and
   the like? Will He not answer, "And why did you not think and remember?
   Was it as hard to remember the Cross for My sake, as it was to die upon
   it for yours? Will you clear yourselves by pleading insensibility? To
   be forgetful of My agony, is it not to be ungrateful? And in a redeemed
   soul, what sin is greater?" Shall we, then, dare to say now what we
   shall not dare to plead at that day? No; let us believe it: the Cross
   is the only true measure of our sin. Let us not weigh it in the false
   balances of sinners, or by the double weights of our own self-love. Let
   us try it by this true and only measure. The sins of our whole
   life,--manhood, youth, and childhood,--we must bring them, one by one,
   to the foot of the Cross, and there learn their true meaning, which is
   nothing less than the death and passion of our Lord.

   2. Another practical truth we may learn is, the sinfulness of every
   habitual state or temper of mind contrary to the spirit of our Saviour.

   I have hitherto spoken of acts, in which the consent of the will is
   given. There is a still more subtil danger which besets us. When a
   man's conscience is awakened, he leaves off by degrees his outward acts
   of sin. And yet the inward sins of the spirit are often fondly
   cherished in secret. A great amount of concealed mental sinfulness may
   lie hid under a life which is outwardly without blame. The soul may
   consent to itself in its own images and thoughts of evil: and so keep
   up the virulence of sin, though never suffered to betray itself in
   acts.

   This needs but little illustration; at least in some of its chief
   forms. There are, however, a few examples we may take, not without
   advantage. For instance, how common a sin is secret pride. It may
   seldom betray itself, and yet it may be intense. Worldly
   pride,--whether of birth, rank, riches, or, what is still more inward
   and unbending, pride of intellectual power, is often the true governing
   spirit of the heart, when least suspected. Pride is, so to speak, too
   proud to expose itself. It would be offended, if it were to become
   notorious and censured. It therefore dwells apart, bracing itself up in
   secret, and giving to all the affections of the soul a high and
   supercilious tone. What is more at enmity with the spirit of the Cross?
   Perhaps nothing, unless we except spiritual pride. And this kind of
   pride, also, shews itself in many ways. Sometimes in the pride of
   strictness, that is, in rigour of observance and regularity; in a sort
   of Christian Pharisaism, which leads to want of tenderness, and of
   condescension towards the weak, penitent, and poor; to uncharitable
   judgments, and separation from brethren; though this, perhaps, is the
   least injurious sort of spiritual pride: because it is the most open
   and visible; the most human and material, if I may so say. There is a
   far worse kind, which, instead of building itself upon regularity, sets
   itself up upon disobedience. It does not take a system out of itself
   for its support; but rears itself upon itself; upon the conceit of its
   own sufficient strength. It is its own centre and its own foundation.
   This is the pride which owns no rule of interpretation but its own
   judgment, or its own private spirit; or, what is more dangerous, its
   own supposed illumination. Such spirits make it a point of piety to be
   superior to legal appointments and carnal ordinances; to Catholic
   tradition, general councils, the visible Church, the Christian
   priesthood, the order of Divine worship, the matter of the Holy
   Sacraments. In a word, they will be found, at last, to own no
   revelation but their own thoughts of God, no Church but themselves.
   Little as such people think it, they claim to be inspired; to be
   prophets, except that their predictions are not verified; to be
   apostles, except that they neither labour nor suffer for the Gospel of
   Christ. It may be said, that this is an overcharged picture. Granted
   that it is a full-length exposure of the spirit which relies upon
   itself, conforms to the Church as a thing indifferent, and calls the
   Holy Sacrament an ordinance. But it is the same spirit, differing only
   in degree. The common forms of it are, of course, fainter and less
   pronounced. Outward conformity to the order of the Church, arising from
   custom or private relations, masks this fault in many characters. In
   them it shews itself chiefly by slighting the grace of God in humbler
   souls, and by esteeming obedience to the Church, formality; fasting,
   self-righteousness; and faith, superstition. What fellowship has such a
   temper with Him who received a sinner's baptism in Jordan, and washed
   His disciples' feet?

   Take, again, the mental sins of levity, personal vanity, frivolous
   conversation, love of dress, glitter, and festivities. Is not the
   indulgence of these faults an habitual provocation of that Divine zeal
   which consumed our Master in the sacrifice of Himself? What was the
   fervour of His ardent burning love? of His heart all on fire for us?
   Can we be all lukewarm and languid in return, and be held guiltless?
   What then shall we be, if, through lack of love, we sink into softness,
   self-indulgence, self-pampering, and love of ourselves; into a delicate
   self-considering carefulness which fixes all our thoughts upon our own
   pleasures, comforts, health, happiness, and the like? A love of self
   is, in truth, the very soul of sin. All sins are but as circles issuing
   out from this one productive centre, expanding, some more and some less
   widely, inclosing a narrower or a larger field of our spiritual life.
   And what is such a temper but a deliberate contradiction of the Cross
   and character of Him who "pleased not Himself;"Rom. xv. who "gave His
   back to the smiters, and His cheeks to them that plucked off the hair:"
   [122] and when He could give no more, "through the Eternal Spirit
   offered Himself without spot to God." [123] Such sins as we now speak
   of are the more dangerous, because they are less gross; because they do
   not issue in startling acts, but are wrought into the state and texture
   of the mind itself. They have so little that is sensual about them, and
   are so refined; they are so free from outward transgressions of the
   second table of the law; they wear so much of the array of light. But,
   nevertheless, they concentrate themselves with a fatal intensity
   against the spirit of humiliation; against humility, self-denial,
   self-abasement, compassion, and love.

   To bring this home to our own case: how does our past life appear, seen
   thus under the light of the crucifixion? How will our sins bear to be
   measured by this rule? What is the secret temper of our spirit now at
   this present time? Is it humbled, broken, mortified; or fearless,
   self-supported, and erect? These are questions we must ask, and answer
   with sincerity and a godly fear: for they will be asked in the day when
   we shall see our Redeemer in the judgment. Let us clearly discover now
   what we must confess at that day. If we be living in a high-minded,
   selfish, loveless spirit, let us lose no time to lay down the arms of
   our rebellion at the foot of the Cross; let us there break the weapons
   of our pride in sunder, and bow down our will beneath His pierced feet.

   And, as a part of our submission, let us take two very simple practical
   rules.

   One is: when we are tempted by any approach of evil, to fix our eyes
   inwardly upon Him, hanging upon the Cross. Let us then call to mind His
   five wounds, and His crown of thorns. This will abate our pride, break
   our will, and cast out our evil thoughts. If the temptation be strong
   and abiding, keep your eyes upon Him until you are delivered. Look upon
   Him, as upon the true Serpent of brass, till the fever and the poison
   of your sin be healed. Go, if you can, into some secret place, and
   kneel down in His sight; and, there, stay upon your knees till the
   sting of sin is allayed, and the temptation passed away.

   The other rule is: to pray, day by day, that our will may be crucified
   with Him. This prayer, if we persevere, will, by His grace, slay the
   enmity that is in us, and make us, not enemies, but lovers of His
   Cross. St. Paul says, "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh
   with the affections and lusts;" [124] and again, he says still more, "I
   am crucified with Christ." [125] This shall be even our state at last.
   Happy and blessed are they who are dead to themselves, alive to Him
   alone. Let us, therefore, pray Him so to unite us to the spirit of His
   crucifixion, that we may die to sin, to the world, to our own will; to
   all that flatters, fosters, strengthens the love of ourselves. As in
   Baptism we were signed with His life-giving sign, and charged to fight
   manfully under His banner, so let us pray, that in life and in death we
   may be under the shadow of His Cross. Howsoever He may fulfil this
   prayer, be not afraid. It may be He will send you sickness, or sorrow,
   or contradiction of sinners, or suffering of some kind. For your prayer
   is an appeal to His Passion. He may suffer you to receive the stigmas
   which the world printed on Him. Be it so. Let come what may, if only we
   have upon us the marks of our crucified Master at that day when the
   sign of the Son of Man shall appear, and the angels "shall gather His
   elect from the four winds of heaven,"

  THE CROSS THE MEASURE OF LOVE.

  EPHESIANS iii. 19.

   "And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge."

   AFTER three years, spent, day by day, in teaching the faith of the
   Gospel to the Church in Ephesus, there was still something which St.
   Paul could not make known. He had declared to them "all the counsel of
   God." [126] He had taught all that language could utter; all that
   intellect could receive. But there was something yet to be taught and
   learned. And this, all apostle as he was, full of the Holy Ghost, rapt
   into the third heaven, partaker in the secrets of paradise, he could
   not teach them. Not that he did not know it. He had learned it at
   mid-day in the way to Damascus, in the solitudes of Arabia, in all the
   warfare of a life of the Cross, now drawing on towards its crown. Yet
   though he knew it with this energetic fulness, and burned to make it
   known, it was among those "unspeakable words which it is not lawful for
   a man to utter." The utterance of man was too narrow for it. Therefore,
   after he had forced all the power of speech into one word, language
   failed him for very weakness: he could only approach to what he would
   say by contradiction, "to know the love of Christ, which passeth
   knowledge." Words cannot express, for words cannot contain it. There
   can be no utterance of this love by sounds of this outer world of
   sense. It must be learned inwardly before the throne of God. Apostles
   preach, but the book of the Spirit has seven seals; and One alone can
   open them. The science of the saints has but one Teacher, who is both
   truth and understanding; both language and power: He both reveals, and
   gives the capacity to learn; He speaks, and Himself opens the ear to
   hear. This is what St. Paul could not teach--the surpassing love of
   Christ. He had no language to express; they had no understanding to
   receive it. To reveal it is the office of Christ Himself; therefore St.
   Paul commends his flock by prayer to the one great Teacher: that, as he
   goes on to say, "ye may be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the
   inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye,
   being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all
   saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to
   know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge." [127]

   This exceeding mystery of love is here shadowed forth in words which
   suggest the infinite and eternal. St. Paul does not say what this is
   which has breadth, length, depth, and height. It is no object of sight,
   no created being; something not to be measured by sense, uttered by
   words, comprehended by understanding. It is uncreate, and therefore
   Divine; and because Divine, boundless and everlasting. What is this but
   the love of the Son of God? What is that Divine mystery which St. Paul
   does not express, the name of which is secret, but the love of the Word
   made flesh? In this all things find their source. Its breadth covers
   all mankind; its length is without beginning or end; its depth reaching
   to the grave; its height dwelling in the Godhead. Or take these words
   of Himself: He is God; the mystic circle whose centre is every where,
   and its circumference no where; He is the Son perfect, everlasting,
   infinite, immense. Or understand them of His Cross: its breadth, the
   redemption of all the race of Adam; its length, the eternal
   predestination; its depth, the destruction of death and hell; its
   height, the beatific vision. Or, if we will so meditate upon it, see in
   this, His love, election, wisdom, and majesty; or, the perfection of
   His Mystical Body, the city built four-square, whose length, and
   breadth, and height, are equal; [128] in charity, patience, faith, and
   contemplation; or, the gifts of every saintly spirit, love,
   perseverance, fear, and hope. In whatever way we take these words of
   wisdom and of wonder, they all return again into the fountain from
   which they issue,--the Cross of the Son of God, of which the arms, the
   stem, the head, the foot, are a sacrament of His transcendent love who
   died thereon for us.

   This, then, is that great miracle of the Spirit which the Apostle in
   vain strove to utter." It was to his speech what the world is to our
   sight. We can see as far as the horizon, but the world lies all beyond.
   He spoke all he could, but because it passed all knowledge, it passed
   all speech; and therefore he could do no more than pray, that He who
   alone can reveal it, would take up his imperfect work; that when the
   servant could do no more, the Lord would fulfil the revelation of
   Himself.

   Now let us see what is this Divine language, and what this Divine
   capacity, without which the love of Christ can be neither revealed nor
   known.

   1. What is the language in which Christ reveals His love to us, but His
   Cross and Passion? The love of God for man had been made known from the
   beginning by manifold revelations: all creation, all the Divine
   government, all the powers of nature, declared it. To this God added,
   yet further, promises, visions, miracles, prophecies, benedictions,
   effusions of grace; the election of patriarchs; the ministry of angels;
   the tokens of His perpetual care; deliverance from peril and from
   bondage; a priesthood, and mysteries; seers and prophets; sacraments of
   blessings yet to come; inspirations of truth; revelations of goodness
   and beauty, of peace and pardon; the communion of saints in secret with
   Himself; the growing light and perpetual assurance, even with an oath,
   of the revelation of His kingdom upon earth;--all these, in nature,
   providence, and grace, within and without, to the sense and to the soul
   of man, were as one complex language, uttering the love of God. But
   even this was not enough for that "which passeth knowledge." Something
   more personal and articulate--something with more intimate expression,
   more living, in sympathy, persuasion, and power, was needed still. A
   speech human, and yet Divine; co-equal with God, and intelligible to
   man. And in this Divine language lie spoke to mankind, when "the Word
   was made flesh, and dwelt among us." The words, deeds, and sufferings
   of the Son of God are but one act--they make up one whole, one eternal
   word, by which He speaks to us. This is that secret ineffable, which
   has breadth, length, depth, and height. From the Annunciation to the
   Ascension is one continuous unfolding of His love: His humiliation as
   God, and patience as man; His subjection to authority; His endurance of
   contradictions; His long-suffering of sinners; all the sorrows of His
   whole life, and all the anguish of His last passion; His night of
   agony; the cross which wounded His soul more sharply than the Cross
   which pierced His body; the scourge and the blinding; the reed of
   mockery, and the crown of thorns; the burden of the Cross, and the
   sharpness of Calvary; the gall and the vinegar; the scorn and
   desolation, and after this the humiliation of death, and the dishonour
   of the grave: He who bare all this being God, and we for whom He bare
   it sinners,--this is the only tongue mighty to utter that which is
   beyond the speech of men and angels.

   Let us put it to ourselves in words of this world, speaking as men or
   as fools. Suppose a friend to come and look on us with a gentle,
   pitying gaze, and say, "I love thee;" it may be, we should believe him:
   it would not cost us much to trust his words of kindness. If he should
   say, "I will lay down my life for thee;" it may be, we should not
   believe his words: we might say, "I know you to be good and kind:
   willing to do much, nay most things for me." If he should say, "See,
   then, I have left all that I have for thee. I was rich, I am poor; I
   was in peace, I am in sorrow; I was in a full home of joy, I am alone;
   and I am come to put myself between thee and thy death, which, though
   thou canst not see, is at this hour coming upon thee." If a friend
   should come and say this, we should believe him according to the
   measures of his known goodness, and according to the measures of human
   speech and human self-denial. That is, we should have many doubts, and
   say to ourselves, How would this be if the trial were really to come?
   But, suppose the trial were already come, and that, in the hour of our
   danger, he should, before our eyes, fulfil his words, and give himself
   to ward off every weapon, and to receive every blow: if we should see
   in him our own wounds, hear upon him the strokes of our own punishment,
   and the anguish of our own just condemnation; and, at the last, see him
   die before us in our stead; how would our hearts almost break with the
   fulness of our belief in his love and truth; how would every thought
   and feeling overflow with sorrow, love, and gratitude. We should rebuke
   ourselves with bitter reproaches for having ever doubted his word or
   his love a moment. We should need no more words, pledges, or proofs.
   Pain, wounds, and death, would have testified; and their witness is
   overwhelming. The memory, the image, the very name of such a friend
   would be blessed and sacred for ever. His every look and tone of voice,
   every remembered expression, of wish or will, of guidance or counsel,
   would be our law: we should be jealous for him as for our own life, and
   endure no word of slight or coldness to be cast upon him.

   What but this is the language with which our Lord Jesus Christ has
   revealed His love to us? There is only this difference: we have been
   speaking of a merely human love, but His is divine. When tongues and
   prophecies, blessings and promises, had done their utmost to reveal the
   fulness of His eternal love, He came Himself, a child in humility and
   meekness, a man full of love, grace, gentleness, with works of healing,
   miracles of mercy; speaking to us through our sight and touch, our
   sympathies and affections, our needs and our sorrows, our fears and our
   sins. All the love of God, and all the lowliness of man, united in Him
   to persuade and win our hearts. On our side were only soils and guilt;
   on His were agony and love, patient and enduring: undeserved, yet never
   cooled; slighted, yet never turned away; tender, pitiful, changeless,
   and eternal. Nor is this all. There is this further depth of love. Sin
   bound us by a necessity to die. But no necessity bound Him to redeem
   us: least of all by a life of sorrow, and a death of agony. The
   Almighty knows no necessity: He that is Omnipotent cannot be bound. He
   might have saved us in ways unknown, without number or measure, Other
   ways would have revealed His wisdom, power, and sovereignty of grace.
   But none would so reveal His love , none so satiate, or slake the
   Divine thirst of love, as humiliation and sorrow, passion and the
   Cross. There was a necessity upon Him, not external, which is
   impossible, but internal, which is of Himself. The necessity was His
   own free choice, and that choice was the utterance of love. Divine
   power and grace sufficed not to reveal it. Therefore He willed that He
   should die and reveal His love upon the Cross. Here it is written in a
   mystic character, the fulness of which shall be interpreted in
   paradise, and yet never fully known.

   2. But further, the language of His love is two-fold, both without and
   within. He not only reveals it by His passion to us, but also by His
   presence in us. And this is the divine capacity by which alone we can
   understand it. Therefore St. Paul prays, "that Christ may dwell in your
   hearts by faith." This does not simply mean, that the knowledge of
   Christ may dwell in the intellect; but that His Spirit, His very
   presence by the Spirit, may dwell in their hearts: as he further says,
   being "strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man." In this
   way He speaks to us from within, giving us the capacity to hear what
   cannot enter by the ear, and to understand what the intellect cannot
   comprehend. Wherefore when He went up into heaven, He poured out upon
   the Church the gift of the Holy Ghost, who is the love of the Father
   and of the Son. And in Him, He who is by visible presence in heaven,
   returned by spiritual presence into His mystical body. From His
   glorified manhood, as from a fountain, perpetual effusions of life and
   love descend upon the Church. By His overflowing gifts of grace the
   whole Church is born again; and into every soul which puts no bar of
   sin, the fulness of His grace comes down. This, in one word, is the
   Spirit of love, creating penitents, saints, and martyrs; revealing to
   all who are sanctified the mystery of the Cross, both that on which He
   suffered, and that on which they must hang beside Him--the cross of
   witness and contradiction, of conflict and death, of patience and
   sorrow, of sickness and affliction, of temptation and fiery assaults;
   and, in the midst of all, revealing the breadth, and length, and depth,
   and height of His love, which is never so full of life and consolation,
   as when the Cross is sharpest upon their shoulder, and the thorns run
   deepest on their brow. This mystery of the Cross has been from the
   beginning the object of contemplation to all His true servants; before
   He came, under a veil in hope; since He came, openly by faith. It is
   set up in the centre of the mystical body. Upon it all eyes of
   penitents and mourners, of contemplative and solitary spirits; and of
   all who, in the throng of life, the weariness of toil, the cares of
   home, serve Him in secret, continually dwell. All alike gaze on that
   sign as their light and healing--as the great eternal mystery of life,
   reaching to hell and heaven, and gathering all God's elect into its
   world-wide embrace.

   "To comprehend" this "with all saints" is to share in the depth of
   their spiritual vision, and in the love which love kindles in them; to
   comprehend the greatness of His love and the greatness of our sin, the
   twofold mystery of goodness and of guilt; and to be changed, as we look
   upon that which is both the shame and the glory of our Lord, "into the
   same image" of love and patience, "from glory to glory, as by the
   Spirit of the Lord." There is, as it were, a precinct within the
   visible Church, into which all are called, but few enter. For into this
   interior presence of Divine love no human teaching can lead; no
   preaching, not even of apostles; no hook, not even inspired; no, not
   the Epistle to the Church in Ephesus, all kindled as it is with the
   fire of God; still less can intellect, imagination, or emotion,--all
   these are weak and cold. It is the office of a Divine Person, of Him
   "who hath the key of David;" He alone can bring us within His holy
   place; that is, Christ, by His Spirit, revealing His own love to us, by
   kindling our love to Him, that we, "being rooted and grounded in love,
   may be able to comprehend;" for there is no other sight which sees
   love, but love; love alone can measure love, can perceive, can feel it.
   He has been teaching us His love by making us love Him. There is no
   other way. Till we love Him, all is dark. Even the plainest truths seem
   shadowy and changeful; the highest doctrines of faith appear remote,
   and above our sphere; the whole mystery of the Incarnation, and of the
   Cross; of the Resurrection, and the kingdom of Christ; the unity of His
   Body, and the glory of the saints; the gifts of the Holy Sacraments,
   and the universal sympathy of the new creation of God,--all these are
   realities which surpass the intellect, and are comprehended only by
   love; that is, by the spiritual reason in the light of charity.

   This inward and divine work of grace is no special gift of certain
   Christians, but the common heritage of the regenerate. If we do not
   possess it, the loss is ours, and the sin; for all our life through,
   whether we have heard or no, He has been speaking to us by this
   interior voice; sometimes, perhaps, making our hearts to burn within
   even when we have not understood, and revealing Himself in clearness
   when we have ever so little turned to Him in love. Wonderful kingdom of
   love in the soul of man! Who has not seen its tokens? Who has not
   perceived its presence? He who is in all His mystical body, is whole in
   every member; not severed or divided, but full, infinite, divine. In
   each one His presence is the same, revealing in each what He reveals in
   all. Though He uses many and various ways, yet He makes all that desire
   it to know His love; bearing with us in our sin, even after baptism;
   preventing us by His guidance, preserving us from perils we never knew,
   restraining us from manifold perdition; opening again the eyes we have
   wilfully blinded, and the ears we have closed in obstinacy; restoring,
   as by miracles of love, the spiritual gifts we have abused; converting
   us to Himself. Whensoever we have turned, or inclined towards Him, He
   has revealed Himself, waiting to be gracious, overwhelming us with a
   consciousness of tender care, and of love that nothing can estrange. In
   this way He deals with us, that He may root us and ground us in love.
   When the soul is once kindled with this divine flame, and the sins of
   flesh and spirit begin to consume away in the fire of His presence, it
   is as if scales had dropped from our spiritual sight, and the Cross
   stands visible, bearing the mystery of love. Then all things change
   their aspect. New lights fall from it on every side. At first they come
   in strange contradictions, greater joys and greater sorrows, livelier
   hopes and more trembling fears. After a while the repentance of alarm
   relaxes into the contrition of a broken spirit, and the rigour of
   conscience into the tenderness of compunction. Then the whole inward
   life is turned back upon its true source, and lives by looking upon the
   Cross. The kingdom of Christ, both in earth and heaven, is then
   revealed from its true point of sight; that is, from Christ's presence
   in a loving heart. It is then seen in its divine unity and perfection,
   reigning with Him, and suffering, loving, sympathising, interceding,
   and worshipping; sustained by one life, one bread, one altar, one
   sacrifice; cleaving to one Cross, quickened by one Spirit, united by
   one bond of love, holy and universal, under one High Priest, who is at
   the right hand of God. O "the breadth, and length, and depth, and
   height"--"the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge!" which can be
   uttered only by the Passion of the Word made flesh, and revealed in us
   only by the indwelling of Christ Himself. O divine mystery! and
   language equally divine; ineffable gift of the Father, and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost; the Incarnation of the Eternal Word, ever with
   us in the Presence of the Eternal Spirit, Himself "the First and the
   Last," the Truth and the Teacher, the Light which reveals itself, "the
   bright and morning Star." [129]

   But to whom does He reveal this surpassing love? Are they not chiefly
   these?

   1. First, those who have faithfully obeyed the grace of their
   regeneration. In them the spiritual life takes the lead and guidance of
   their whole intellectual and moral being, going before it and leading
   it in the way of purity and love. They are sheltered from the soils and
   stains which pierce the souls of such as fall into disobedience; they
   are never clouded by the dimness and darkness which gather upon a
   rebellious and uneasy conscience. Their union with Christ is a source
   of inward light, which sheds abroad a fuller radiance as they grow in
   love. A sanctified will is in them the root of the illuminated reason.
   By purity of heart they see the Cross, even in childhood, according to
   its measures; in youth and in the full ripeness of age, with a
   continual expanse of light filling the whole field of
   contemplation:--there they behold the signet of love, the law of their
   will, the purification of their heart, the flame at which their love is
   kindled, the life of all their soul. Such Christians are in many ways
   children of light; all brightness within, and like the light, silent,
   soft, and noiseless; so that this loud busy world takes them for weak
   and stagnant, without vividness or energy. What the world admires is
   the visible and audible piety of converts. It cannot conceive a life so
   tranquil to be fervent; as if the zeal of penitents were more perfect
   than the ministry of angels. So truly is "the secret of the Lord with
   them that fear Him;" so hidden is that new name which is known only to
   him that receiveth it. To those who have been thus signally blessed of
   God, through the watchfulness and prayer of parents, or sometimes, so
   far as we can see, even without these secondary agencies, and have been
   kept within the light of that gift which by nature they could not
   have--to them what things others learn late and with toil, and, after
   all, for the most part, with less clear perceptions, are as original
   truths, axioms of the regeneration, instincts of their spiritual
   nature. They are unclouded and unchilled, and have a clear transparent
   purity of heart, quickened by a consciousness of the, presence and love
   of Christ, which neither intellect nor speech can conceive. It is as a
   part of their own being; it sustains the unity of their own life,
   derived through the Spirit from Him who is their life. They live more
   and more in the habitual consciousness of His love to them. The world
   cannot draw them from Him. It has no sweetness like fellowship with
   Him; no brightness like the light of His countenance; no fairness like
   the beauty of His presence. They rest all their weight on Him in
   loving, confiding trust; and look on without fear to the day of death,
   as the way that leads, it may be through a narrow and rough pass, but
   speedy and sure, to the fulness of His love unveiled.

   2. And besides these, who are blessed above all, there are others also
   who are specially strengthened to comprehend with all saints the
   surpassing love of the Cross; such are all who habitually and devoutly
   communicate in the sacrament of His passion. Nothing so visibly reveals
   the Cross to us; nothing so renews before our eyes the language of
   divine acts and sufferings, by which He has revealed His love. It
   represents to us the mystery of His humiliation, His incarnation, His
   self-oblation, His crucifixion, the rending of His body, the shedding
   of His blood, the whole mystery of His passion. These are set before
   our very sight. He is lifted up visibly before us. And what is so
   represented to us from without by symbols, is applied to us within by
   His intimate presence. He makes every devout soul to partake of
   Himself, to share that love which nailed Him upon the Cross; to share
   even the Cross, by sharing His love. He makes over to us His atonement
   and His priceless blood, the infinite merits of His incarnation; and
   with them His Spirit and His charity. But of these things it is hard to
   speak in words. They are of that secret which passeth knowledge; which
   can be comprehended only in the spiritual light by which He reveals
   Himself at the altar, high and lifted up upon the Cross, radiant with
   love; then higher still in the throne of God, angels ascending and
   descending in the ministries of His compassion; and highest of all, in
   the midst of His heavenly court, ranged around Him in the breadth, and
   length, and depth, and height, of the eternal glory. These things are
   only for the inward utterance, which is spiritual and silent; heard
   always in the still tones of a voice divine, by those who are meet for
   the heavenly feast. The more meet, the more clear their spiritual
   sense; and the oftener they feed with devotion on the living bread, the
   meeter they become. This is the point or centre of light in which
   obedience, purity of heart, prayer, contemplation, faith, all conspire
   in one; and here He vouchsafes to come down, as it were, to meet the
   aspirations of His own Spirit in us, and to reveal the eternal love
   which is Himself.

   3. And, lastly, there are, blessed be His mercy, others among whom we
   may hope to have our lot. If it were only to spirits of love and
   spirits of knowledge, such as we have spoken of, that the Cross were
   revealed, where should we have our portion? But here again is the
   wonderful mystery of His compassion; what the highest attain by grace,
   is by gift granted to the lowest. In this the first and the last are
   all alike. It is not only to purified and devout hearts, but also to
   penitent and broken spirits, that He reveals His Cross: to all who
   after their sins, whatsoever their past life has been, are now truly
   and sadly repenting. "There stood by the Cross of Jesus His mother, and
   His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene."
   [130] A blessed company: One all pure, that had borne Him in her bosom
   as a child; one all love, who had lain upon His breast at supper; and
   one all sorrow, who had pierced Him with her sins. Once they were "not
   all clean," but all were clean then; for the Cross had cleansed them
   all as white as snow. Blessed and healing type of the great grace of
   repentance; the renewal of the new creature, the all but second birth
   of the regenerate. "How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways
   past finding out." The pure in heart see God with a speed and depth of
   sight which seems given to none beside: but to penitents, even in their
   tears, is granted an intensity of vision which seems to outstrip all
   others; yet with what strange intimations of a manifold and diverse
   perfection. John, in the zeal of love, outran Peter to the grave; but
   Peter entered first, while John only stooped and looked into the tomb.
   John first knew the Lord upon the shore, but Peter first hastened to
   His presence. Love outstripped repentance, and repentance left love
   behind. Repentance was bid to follow, and love was left to linger
   without a token of His will. Yet neither was before or after other; for
   both saw Him, and were full. So it is now. If we be broken in heart:
   not filled with a clouded and moody self-contemplation, or with a
   shrinking, unhoping fear, still less with a lukewarm and variable
   temper, wavering between sin and penitence, but with a loving sorrow;
   if we have a heart pierced fivefold, bleeding inwardly, issuing in
   patience, humility, gentleness, trust, and hope; even to us He will
   reveal His Cross in all the fulness of its perfection, in pardon, in
   long-suffering love, and in life eternal.

   But let us take great heed, lest we try to ascend the height before we
   have gone down into the depth of His passion. Let us, as penitents,
   beware how we think to comprehend it by spiritual strength and
   intuition, by high devotions, and sensible affections of love and
   ardour. We shall but turn our heads, and fall from the ascents which
   are not for us to climb. Our way to the Cross is below, in humiliation
   and abasement, in conscious poverty of all strength and of all
   attainments of a devout life. Our path will be safest in shadows and
   silence; loving the lowest place; and gladly enduring slights,
   especially when undeserved, as most nearly likening us to Him in His
   shame. Penitents have need to watch, lest they grow to be strict, cold,
   upright, blameless, indignant at sinners, unconscious of themselves.
   Our only hope is to be abased, and kindled with indignation against
   ourselves, absorbed in the thought of our Blessed Lord, if so be we may
   be like her whose whole soul flowed with a living stream in the kiss
   with which she embraced His sacred feet.

   This shall reveal all we need to see; and all the changes of life will
   receive new and unforeseen lights cast upon them from the Cross.
   Blessings, rebukes, sharp checks, chastisements, and a lowering
   to-morrow, will all bring out some new aspect of His personal love to
   us. The deeper we go down into the depths of sorrow for our sin, the
   more will He reveal the Great Sorrow by which our sin was taken away:
   and the fellowship of sorrow is the fellowship of love; for without
   love sorrow is not repentance, and without sorrow love dies. These two
   are united in the Cross. In its unity they fulfilled His passion; they
   are now the fountains of our repentance.

   What but this Love, when sorrow is passed away, shall be the bliss of
   the redeemed in heaven? What but this shall be the song of the blessed
   before the Lamb which was slain, when the sealed book is opened; and
   every one, with harps and golden vials full of odours, shall fall down
   and sing a new song, "saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to
   open the seals thereof; for Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to
   God by Thy Blood." [131] It is still and evermore the same hymn of
   praise, the Cross and the love of the eternal Son, there seen in all
   its expanse unveiled; and with a perfect capacity of sight, by the
   vision of uncreated light, where each one shall be more blessed, the
   more deeply he beholds it. But, for us now, we must begin upon the
   lowest step, with sorrow for the sin of an unloving heart. Hereafter we
   shall know, even as we are known; nothing shall pass knowledge then,
   when all shall be taught of God. For this we must wait His time and
   will. Let us now make sure, if by His grace we may, of the first and
   lowest elements of this science of all saints. As yet our sin passeth
   knowledge. Let us learn this first. This is enough for us on earth; and
   then, when we have learned to know this in a life of compunction, we
   shall hereafter know the love of Christ without measure in the fulness
   of eternal peace.

SERMON XIII.

  A LIFE OF PRAYER A LIFE OF PEACE.

    PHILIPPIANS iv. 4, 5, 6.

   "Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. Let your
   moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for
   nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with
   thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of
   God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds
   through Christ Jesus."

   ST. PAUL, in these words, bids the Christians in Philippi to carry all
   their sorrows and fears to the throne of Christ. He specially bids them
   remember the nearness of our Lord; and the freedom we may use in
   speaking with Him. And in so doing he has taught us a great and blessed
   truth, needful for all men, in all ages: I mean, that a life of prayer
   is a life of peace. It is not in times of persecution only, but at all
   times, that the presence and fellowship of Christ are the peace and
   consolation of the Church. We are born into a world of perturbations;
   we carry them in our own heart. The world is the counterpart of man's
   fallen nature, turbulent, restless, and distracted. Every man gives in
   his contribution of disquietude; and the life of most men is made up of
   cares and doubts, perplexities and forebodings, of fruitless regrets
   for follies past, and of exaggerated thoughts of trials yet to come. On
   men who live without God in the world these things press sorely. They
   fret and wear them without alleviation. This is the "sorrow of the
   world" that "worketh death." It is a bitter and embittering disquiet of
   heart. The plague of evil thoughts, inordinate cravings,
   disappointments and losses, vain hopes and wearing fears, these are by
   nature the portion of us all. Even religious people have their yoke of
   cares. But there is this difference between them and others; they know
   where to carry the recital of their troubles, where to lay down their
   burden, and Who will bear their griefs and take away their sorrows.

   1. St. Paul here tells us, first of all, that there is One, ever near
   us, who can fulfil all our desire, and over-rule all things in our
   behalf. "The Lord is at hand." How soon He may reveal Himself in person
   we know not; but soon or late, it is certain, that although unseen, He
   is ever near us. His presence departed not from the Church when He
   ascended into heaven. He is withdrawn from the eyes of our flesh; but
   in the sight of our hearts He is always visible. Though He be at the
   right hand of God, yet He is in the Church, and in our secret chamber.
   Though He is the Lord of heaven and earth, yet He is ever in the midst
   of us, watching and guiding, disposing all things for the perfection of
   His kingdom, and, in it, of each one of us. He is both able and willing
   to fulfil all our hearts' desires; and nothing is hid from His sight.
   He knows all; even our most unuttered thoughts, our most concealed
   desires; and with this assurance we might lay aside all our burdens. It
   might seem enough for us simply to cast all our care on Him, knowing
   that He careth for us; to refer ourselves to His love and wisdom, to
   His all-comprehending knowledge of our wishes and our wants. This would
   be a sure and sufficient pledge against all the evils we forebode and
   shrink from. But there is a relief in speaking out our wishes; and even
   this He does not deny us.

   2. Therefore St. Paul tells us further, that we may make all our
   desires known unto God. We may speak with Him as a man speaks with his
   friend. We all know the relief, as we say, of unburdening ourselves,
   and opening our hidden cares, even to an earthly companion. We seem to
   have laid off a weight when we have told our sorrow. When any one we
   love shares our anxiety, and divides our forebodings with us, we seem,
   to have either only half the burden, or a twofold strength to bear it.
   We feel this relief all the more, in the measure in which our friend is
   wise and compassionate, loved by us, and loves us in return. And yet
   there is a point beyond which we do not reveal ourselves to our fastest
   and nearest friend. There is something of imperfection still in them
   that makes us lay bare only one side, and lay open only one chamber of
   our heart. There is always something still concealed, some reserved
   infirmity, something over which we must needs draw a veil and silence;
   which we would not that any fellow-creature should discern; which we
   can only shew to the world unseen, and to the eyes of Him "that
   searcheth the hearts, and trieth the reins." But with Him, not only is
   it impossible to conceal, but we do not desire to hide any thing from
   His sight. Though He be the Holy One of God, and "His eyes as a flame
   of fire," so piercing and so pure, yet we do not shrink from making all
   known to Him: for though He be perfect in purity, He is likewise
   perfect in compassion: He is as pitiful as He is holy. We may come
   before Him, and say, "This have I done, and this have I left undone. I
   am sinful and unhappy, beset by temptations, harassed by myself." We
   may make known the facts and particulars of our trial, its
   circumstances and details; and plead, as it were, against ourselves,
   praying to be delivered from the power of sin which still dwells in us,
   and draws us aside into darkness and transgression; overclouding our
   heart by imaginations and visions of evil. We may say, "Thou knowest
   what I cannot speak, and why I cannot. Thou knowest all things."

   When we are overcome by a sense of what we are, and for shame or sorrow
   even fear to speak at all, we may place ourselves before Him,
   passively, and in silence, casting ourselves down under His feet, to be
   read, searched by His penetrating sight. Though unworthy to ask the
   least, yet we may make our requests known unto Him by silent
   humiliation, and by secret appeal to His perfect knowledge.

   Now, this is what St. Paul bids us to do. "Be careful for nothing; but
   in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
   requests be made known unto God." And the promise is, not that we shall
   have whatsoever we may ask, but that we shall have peace. "And the
   peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts
   and minds through Christ Jesus." We shall not, indeed, always have what
   we ask; but if we ask in faith, we shall always have peace. Of this we
   shall never fail.

   1. First, because whatsoever we ask which is truly for our good, that
   He will give us freely. No father so much delights to give the very
   thing his children ask for, as our Father in heaven. It is
   well-pleasing in His sight both that we should know what to pray for as
   we ought, and that He should bestow the thing we ask. "Verily, verily,
   I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will
   give it you." [132] But it is a high grace to know what things to ask
   in the name of Christ. Men make strange prayers to Heaven, and couple
   the Name at which every knee shall bow, of things in heaven and things
   in earth, with foolish and unreasonable prayers. Whatsoever we desire
   that is in harmony with the Eternal will, with the love of our
   Redeemer, and with the mind of the Holy Ghost, those things we shall
   without fail receive. All good things; all good, eternal and created;
   all blessing, grace, and truth; all the benedictions of the kingdom of
   God; all the promises of the Gospel, and all the pledged mercies of
   redemption; all these we may ask importunately, and shall assuredly
   receive. Even things of this life solace and deliverance, the reversal
   of threatened chastisement, the restoration of blessings half
   withdrawn; these too, and a multitude of mercies infinite as the
   changes and chances of man's life, we may lawfully desire. It may be we
   shall also receive these very things we ask for. At all events, we may
   make "our requests known unto God:" leaving with Him to open and to
   shut His hand as He shall see best for us.

   . For whatsoever we ask which is not for our good, He will keep it back
   from us. And surely in this there is no less of love than in the
   granting what we desire as we ought. "What man of you that is a father,
   if his son ask for bread, will he give him a stone?" And if he ask for
   poison, will he not refuse it? Will not the same love which prompts you
   to give a good, prompt you to keep back an evil, thing? If, in our
   blindness, not knowing what to ask, we pray for things which should
   turn in our hands to sorrow and death, will not our Father, out of His
   very love, deny us? In this entangled twilight state of probation,
   where the confines of good and ill so nearly approach, and almost seem
   to intermingle, there needs a keen and strong spiritual eye to discern
   and know the nature and properties of all things which encompass us
   about. They allure us, and we desire them, and ask not knowing for
   what. How awful would be our lot, if our wishes should straightway pass
   into realities; if we were endowed with a power to bring about all that
   we desire; if the inclinations of our will were followed by fulfilment
   of our hasty wishes, and sudden longings were always granted. Such a
   power in an imperfect being, drawn aside, as we are, by the
   solicitations of evil from without, and hurried away by impulses of an
   imperfect and variable heart within, would be an intolerable misery.
   And yet what but this would it be, if all our prayers were granted--if
   there were no all-wise, all-holy One to review our imperfect choices,
   to sift out the poisons, and to keep back the sorrows which we have
   ignorantly prayed for?

   In the commonest things of this world, how valuable is the counsel of a
   wise and trusty friend, who revises and checks our aims and plans. From
   what unnumbered errors and falls are we preserved by taking counsel of
   some tried and discerning adviser. How, on the retrospect of years, we
   see whole trains of evil consequences lying hid behind some act we were
   once vehemently bent on taking; from which we were hardly turned aside
   at the very moment of action. In like manner, what a current of happy
   and prosperous events has carried us along, as we now can see, since
   the day when some decision was made at the guidance of another, to
   whose advice we could hardly be brought, at that time, to consent. And
   what but this loving care, if it may be reverently spoken, is ever
   taken for us in heaven? Our vehement, blind, tumultuous hearts are
   continually sending up their wishes and prayers on high, all mingled
   and infected with our own earthliness. In the golden censer of our
   great High Priest they are purged by the living fire of His love; the
   evil separated from the good, and our rash and wayward choices refined
   till they unite with the wisdom and will of our Eternal Father. One day
   we shall bless Him, not more for what He has granted than for what He
   has denied. Though now we think our most needful requests are put
   aside, we shall then perceive the real meaning of what we asked, and
   the rashness of our prayer. Alas for us, if all our prayers should be
   given us: if the meting out and tempering of our own lot were thus left
   in our own hands; if all we desire were made our own; if the windows of
   heaven were never shut against us. He gave them their desire, and "sent
   leanness withal into their soul." [133] Alas, if health, prosperity,
   prolonged enjoyment of the bright things of life, and freedom from
   sorrows and deprivations, were continued to us as long as we desire; if
   the wholesome sharpness of pain, bodily humiliation, the breaking up of
   hopes, and the over-clouding of our happiness, were kept back as long
   as we should prescribe. Ours would be a blind discipline of healing for
   sinful hearts. We should be poor physicians of our own maladies. And
   this is the reason why our Father in heaven uses a loving severity, and
   at times confounds our wishes with the strokes of His hand. He denies
   us what we ask, and sends instead what we most recoil from. We ask for
   bright lights, and He sends us shadows; we crave for soft things, and
   He sends us hardness for our portion; we pray Him to take away our
   anxieties, and He turns them into present sorrows; we ask for the
   allaying of some instant pain, and He sends us a double share; we
   desire to be free from chastisement, and He besets us on all sides with
   His correction; we beseech Him to heal some friend over whom we watch
   in trembling, or to give back to us one that already hangs between life
   and death, and He seems to read all our prayers backward, and to answer
   us by contradictions. Yet in all this, what is there but the order and
   harmony of the wisdom and the will of God? The confusion and perplexity
   is all our own. It is not that He contradicts our will, but we are
   contradicting His. We cross Him, not He us. We would be reigning in His
   kingdom, and making His sway to follow our choice. We would be the
   granters of our own petitions--make our will the law of His dealings
   with us. But He has His own purpose in all refusals; a purpose deeper
   than we can reach. It was an apostle and a martyr that said, "For this
   thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me; and He
   said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for My strength is made
   perfect in weakness." And He who gave that answer was even the same who
   in the days of His flesh "offered up prayers and supplications with
   strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to save Him from death,
   and was heard in that He feared;" "for though He were a Son, yet
   learned He obedience by the things which He suffered." [134] There was
   a time when He, too, went apart from His disciples a stone's cast, "and
   fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it be possible,
   let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou
   wilt:" [135] and even "the third time He prayed, saying the same
   words." And yet the cup did not pass from Him: the Father's will was
   not so. Nevertheless, "there appeared an angel unto Him from heaven,
   strengthening Him." [136]

   3. But, besides this, we know certainly that if He refuse us any thing,
   it is only to give us something better. It may be we asked amiss. We
   asked for something that would thwart His higher purposes of mercy to
   us. We would have, it may be, the fair things of this life; but He has
   in store for us better things in His kingdom. You desire to be as
   others, to have what they have, enjoy what they enjoy: but He has
   chosen you, perhaps, to be nearer to Himself; to sit at His feet and
   listen, while others go abroad into the mid-stream of life. For a time
   it may seem to be sadness and a cross; and you are not able to read its
   meaning, till some better thing begins to shadow itself out before your
   inward sight; and you see that what you would have chosen for
   yourselves would have been a less blessing, instead of a greater; a
   transitory, instead of an abiding consolation. Sometimes He upbraids
   our narrowness of heart by His refusals. It may be that we have not
   asked enough; that we have asked scantily, when He was ready to give
   largely. When Solomon asked for wisdom, the Lord gave him also "riches,
   and wealth, and honours." [137] If we ask the great things of His
   kingdom, He will add unto us the less. If we ask of Him life eternal,
   He will provide for the life that now is. "Take no thought for
   to-morrow." "Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of these
   things." "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness."

   Ask not for the right hand or the left hand in His kingdom, but for a
   place, though it be the lowest place, beneath the feet of His elect.
   Ask of Him a clean heart, that you may see God, that you may trace His
   hand in all the ways of life; and He will give you not only things of
   this life, but also your throne and crown in the manifestation of the
   sons of God.

   4. For, lastly, though He should seem to refuse all we ask, He will not
   refuse to give unto us Himself. The more you converse with God, the
   more He will manifest Himself to you. The very act of prayer will make
   you familiar with His presence. Though He be pleased to take from you,
   one by one, as from His servant Job, all things you cleave to; yet as
   all other things are withdrawn, He will compass you about with a more
   sensible presence of His love. Even as at the last, when there was
   nothing more to be taken away from the man of many sufferings, the Lord
   answered Job out of the whirlwind; so from the darkness and perplexity
   of His providence, there come forth, to those whom God chastens, such
   tokens of His presence, that they are constrained to say, "I have heard
   of Thee with the hearing of the ear;" such was all my past knowledge,
   hearsay and a dream; "but now mine eye seeth Thee." [138] Now all is
   clear; all stands out before me in full outline and completeness. So
   shall it be with those that pray without fainting. By habitual converse
   with God, they are drawn within the veil through which His providence
   controls our mortal life. They rise above it; and their "life is hid
   with Christ in God." [139] Their "conversation is in heaven." [140]
   They begin to see into the hidden meaning of His government over the
   Church, and of His dealing with themselves; into the secret of the
   secret, whereby "to principalities and powers in heavenly places is
   known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God." [141] Whatsoever
   befalls them, they know to be better than they could choose; the best
   that can be chosen. "I have learned, in whatsoever state I am,
   therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how
   to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be
   full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all
   things through Christ which strengtheneth me." [142] To those who are
   His, all things are not only easy to be borne, but even to be gladly
   chosen. All events and changes are the will of God in Christ Jesus.
   They are also the will of those who have fellowship with Christ, and
   through Him with God the Father. Their will is united to that will
   which moves heaven and earth, which gives laws to angels, and rules the
   courses of the world. It is a wonderful gift of God to man, of which we
   that know so little must needs speak little. To be at the centre of
   that motion, where is everlasting rest; to be sheltered in the peace of
   God; even now to dwell in heaven, where all hearts are stayed, and all
   hopes fulfilled. "Thou shalt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
   stayed on Thee." [143]

SERMON XIV.

  THE INTERCESSION OF CHRIST THE STRENGTH OF
  OUR PRAYERS.

    HEBREWS vii. 24, 25.

   "This Man, because He continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
   Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto
   God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them."

   THE Church on earth, in its mysterious probation, is waiting without
   the veil, until the day of Christ's coming, while He, in the presence
   of God, is carrying on the work He began on earth. He is gone up on
   high to accomplish His mediatorial office in our behalf. When He
   ascended into heaven, He began His intercession with the Father. "This
   Man," says St. Paul, that is, the Man Jesus Christ, who in our very
   manhood ascended up above all thrones, dominions, and powers; above
   cherubim and seraphim; above the nine orders of angels; above all
   created spirits, to the throne of the Eternal, and to the right hand of
   God;--"this Man, because He continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
   priesthood."

   He is the one true Priest, of whom all priests that came before Him
   were but shadows, faint and fleeting, dying and succeeding the son to
   the father from generation to generation: but He being eternal, hath a
   true and eternal priesthood. He is not Priest only but Sacrifice, the
   one true oblation offered by Himself unto the Father,--a sacrifice,
   like Himself, almighty and eternal.

   The fulfilment of His office as High Priest required that He should
   appear for us in the presence of God. In the Law this was foreshadowed
   by typical acts once every year. On the great day of atonement, the
   High Priest took the blood of the sacrifice, and entered in, alone,
   within the veil to sprinkle it before the mercy-seat, and to intercede
   for the sins of the people. Our Lord, by His death and ascension,
   fulfilled these types; for after He had shed His own blood for us, He
   went within the veil, that is, into heaven itself. He is gone up to
   stand before the true mercy-seat, in the true temple of God. "For
   Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are
   the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the
   presence of God for us." [144] And as He passed through the veil of the
   heavens into the holy place, so He has opened for us a way; "a new and
   living way, which He hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is
   to say, His flesh." [145] By which St. Paul means, that His incarnation
   is an avenue or path for us to God; that through His flesh we have a
   way and a plea by which to draw nigh to His Father and our Father, to
   His God and our God. There is in the Divine presence a Man to whom we
   are united, through whom we may approach the throne of God. This is
   what our Lord meant when He said, "I am the Way;" that is, by His
   incarnation, by our union with Him, and by the gift of His merits to
   us.

   The types of the law further shew us that He is gone into heaven to
   intercede in our behalf, that is, to stand between God and man as an
   Advocate and a Mediator. His office of Intercessor is so full of divine
   mysteries of grace, that to understand it as we ought, we must, under
   the guidance of His truth and Spirit, dwell for a while upon the depth
   of its meaning.

   He intercedes for us chiefly in two ways.

   1. First, by the exhibition of Himself, in His Divine manhood, pierced
   for us, raised, and glorified. His five blessed and holy wounds are
   each one a mighty intercession in our behalf. The glorious tokens of
   His Cross and Passion, exhibited before the throne of God, plead for us
   perpetually. The one great atonement, the one great sacrifice, offered
   with shedding of blood once upon the Cross, and now offered
   perpetually, is a continuing sacrifice. His very presence in heaven is
   in itself an intercession for us. His sacrifice on the Cross, though
   perfected by suffering of death only once in time, is in its power
   eternal. Therefore it stands a divine fact, ever present and
   prevailing, the foundation and life of the redeemed world--before the
   throne of God.

   2. But further, we are told in holy Scripture that He intercedes, that
   is, that He prays for us. This is a vast mystery, of inscrutable depth.
   As God, He hears our prayers; as our Intercessor, He prays in our
   behalf.

   How are these things to be reconciled? And how are we to understand
   that He who is God Himself can pray? Is not prayer a mark of
   inferiority, and a sign of humiliation? How can He who is co-equal with
   the Father and with the Holy Ghost be any way inferior? or how can He
   bear any mark of humiliation in His glory? To pray, is the token of
   need and of infirmity; at least, of a desire which the intercessor
   cannot grant himself. How, then, can He who expressly promised, "If ye
   shall ask any thing in My name, I will do it," intercede by way of
   prayer? Is it not altogether beneath the glory of the Word made flesh?
   Is it not the office of a merely human, and not a divine advocate?

   But these difficulties have no reality. They arise from not clearly
   remembering what and who is our High Priest. He is both God and man: as
   God, always in glory, the object of worship, the giver of all good: as
   man, once humbled in the flesh, now glorified. As God, He could never
   intercede by way of prayer. When it is said that the Holy Ghost "maketh
   intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered," it is not
   spoken of His Divine Person and office, but of His inspirations in us:
   "The Spirit helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should
   pray for as we ought." [146] As God, then, the Son does not intercede
   by prayer. Neither as Man does He pray by any reason of need or
   humiliation. While He was on earth, He prayed as having infirmity: He
   prayed not only for us, but even for Himself. "In the days of His
   flesh, He offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and
   tears, unto Him that was able to save Him from death;" and this is
   doubtless spoken of His prayer in the agony at Gethsemane; and though
   the cup did not pass from Him, "was heard, in that He feared." [147]

   While He humbled Himself, "in the days of His flesh,"Ibid. He prayed as
   a part of the work He had to do: it was for the accomplishing of the
   redemption of the world; for the blotting out of the sin of mankind.
   This prayer of humiliation passed away with the sharpness of the Cross,
   to which it was related, of which it was the shadow. The prayers which
   He offered, being yet on earth, were a part of His obedience and
   suffering, to take away the sin of the world. All this, therefore, is
   excluded from His intercession now in heaven. When He entered into the
   holy place, He left all these tokens of infirmity outside the veil.

   What, then, remains? There remains yet both His intercession of the
   High Priest; and as Head of the Church for the body still on earth. And
   in this there is nothing of humiliation, but all is honour and power;
   it does not cast a shade upon the glory of His Godhead, unless it be
   humiliation for the Word to be incarnate, at the right hand of God. His
   present intercession is a part of His exaltation to the throne of His
   mediatorial kingdom. But in so high a mystery it will be safer to use
   the words of another: "God could bestow no greater gift on men than to
   make His Word, by whom He created all things, to be their Head, and to
   unite them to Him as His members; so that He might be both Son of God
   and Son of man: as God, one with the Father; as man, one with man: so
   that, when we speak with God in prayer, we might not separate the Son
   from Him; and when the Body of the Son prays, He might not separate His
   Body from Himself; so that He Himself, the Saviour of His Body, our
   Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, might be One, who prays for us, and
   prays in us, and is prayed to by us. He prays for us as our High
   Priest, He prays in us as our Head, He is prayed to by us as our God."
   [148] He prays, then, for us as our Priest and Sacrifice, in His own
   Name, and by the power of His own atonement; now no more in
   humiliation, but in glory. Time was when He prayed that His work might
   be made perfect in His own person, and in itself; [149] "Father,
   glorify Thy Son;" now His prayer is, that what He has accomplished may
   be made perfect in His whole mystical body, and in every member of the
   same. His intercession is for His whole Church, and for every one of us
   in particular, that the work of His Cross and Passion may be applied to
   the healing of our souls: that what He wrought for us may be wrought in
   us by the power of the Holy Ghost. Therefore, His intercession is
   continuous and unceasing. It ever has been, and ever shall be, until
   the last of His members upon earth shall be made perfect: then cometh
   the end. Until that day, it is the source of all grace. From it all
   sacraments and mysteries derive their power. The whole work of the
   incarnation is applied to us by His intercession within the veil. The
   whole fruit gathered by His Church on earth, is the visible
   accomplishment of His Divine prayer in the world unseen. It is the
   strength of our prayers, the stay of our hope, our help in temptation,
   the source of our perseverance. For consider how great are the
   perfections of His intercession. It is the prayer of His Divine
   charity; of that love which brought Him from heaven, and nailed Him
   upon the Cross. It is also the prayer of perfect knowledge. As God, He
   knows all our necessities: he knows our spiritual condition with a
   knowledge which only He can possess. None can know us as He who is
   "quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing
   even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
   marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
   [150] He knows us as our Maker, and our God.

   But His intercession has also this further perfection. It is the
   prayer, not only of Divine love and knowledge, but of perfect human
   sympathy. "We have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the
   feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we
   are, yet without sin." [151] What as God He could never taste, as Man
   He tried to the uttermost. He knows us as perfect Man. The mysterious
   knowledge of personal experience, of personal suffering in human flesh,
   which He gained on earth, He has still in heaven. Even before the
   eternal throne He has still a perfect sense of our infirmities, of all
   the mystery of human sorrow which He learned on earth, from the manger
   to the Cross. And it is specially in this connexion that St. Paul goes
   on to encourage us to pray: "Let us, therefore, come boldly," he says,
   "unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to
   help in time of need." [152] Out of this perfect love, knowledge, and
   sympathy, He perpetually intercedes for each one of us according to our
   trial and our day. There can come upon us nothing which has not its
   counterpart and response in His perfect compassion. While He prays for
   us, He feels with us. To Him we may go as to one who is already
   pleading for us; and through Him we may draw nigh to God in His perfect
   merits, which He has given us for our own. They are ours, because they
   are His; because they are His, therefore He hath given them to us. Such
   is the mystery of our Lord's gracious intercession in our behalf. Let
   us, therefore, see how it bears upon us in our daily life, as an
   incitement, solace, and support.

   1. First, there is here a great warning for the sinful. What is our
   great High Priest now praying for? He prays for the perfect overthrow
   of sin; that all enemies may be put under His feet; that out of God's
   kingdom may be cast every thing that offendeth. His perpetual prayer
   is, the purification of His Church. By virtue of it, every sin, and
   every unclean spirit, shall be cast into outer darkness; and therefore
   every sinner, if he will not let go his sin, shall be likewise cast
   out. If, indeed, he will break off from his sin, it shall be cast out,
   and he shall abide; but if he will embrace it to his soul, he shall be
   cast out with it. Every sin of the flesh and of the spirit is doomed to
   the "lake that burneth with fire." Christ's intercession is day and
   night prevailing against the kingdom of the wicked one. Little by
   little, one by one, with sure advance though slow, it is thrusting out
   every thing that defileth from the bounds of the kingdom of God. As the
   sun rises with resistless light, first a few clear beams, then a broad
   stream of brightness, till it stands in midday splendour; so is the
   intercession of our Lord. Nothing can withstand it; all the powers of
   darkness are even now scattering before His face. "He must reign till
   He hath put all things under His feet," [153] and the Sun of
   righteousness be revealed for ever in the kingdom of the Father.

   How, let us ask, does this bear on us? And how does His all-prevailing
   prayer affect our life? If we be earthly, sensual, false-hearted,
   proud, impure, vain-glorious, all the Divine power of His perpetual
   intercession is arrayed against us. Awful thought! "Wo unto him that
   striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of
   the earth." [154] Let us bear this in mind. Let us remember it when we
   are tempted, and say, "The intercession of Christ will either separate
   me from this sin, or cast both me and it out of the kingdom of God.
   This is the choice before me." It is a great law like the course of
   time; stedfast, silent, ever advancing, resistless,--when past,
   irrevocable. Throughout the whole Church on earth this work of secret
   purification is accomplishing. In the Divine foresight it is already
   perfect. In the Divine government it is day and night fulfilling. His
   "fan is in His hand, and He will throughly purge His floor, and gather
   His wheat into the garner; but He will burn up the chaff with
   unquenchable fire." [155]

   2. But in this there is also great comfort to all faithful Christians.
   "He ever liveth to make intercession for us." Day and night are held up
   on high the pierced hands, in which is strength and mastery for the
   whole Church militant on earth. We may take a sure consolation from
   this in our manifold trials. As, for instance: how great an
   encouragement is this to those who are cast down with fear lest they
   should fall away. Some people are severely afflicted by this
   foreboding. Perhaps all at some time have known what it is. Who is
   there that cannot look back on seasons compared with which his present
   state seems to be a declension? After our first repentance, we may
   remember how deep and lively were our feelings of shame and sorrow. We
   recollect, perhaps, when we felt as if the memory of our sins could
   never fade, or lose even a shadow of their appalling dye. They were, in
   our eyes, as "scarlet," and "red like crimson." [156] And we felt as if
   the eyes of the whole unseen world were fixed upon us in sorrow; as if
   the thoughts of all around us were dwelling on our detected sinfulness.
   We hoped to go through life repenting; growing more perfect, and more
   fervent in compunction, to the end. And what are we now? Or, take, as
   another example, our first communion. It may be that after long
   expectation and many fears, you came for the first time to the altar,
   with an awed and ardent feeling of devotion. You felt as if you had
   been lifted into a new world, where all thoughts and images, shadows
   and lights, were realities of heaven. It seemed impossible that the
   freshness and awakening nearness of these great mysteries of the spirit
   should ever wear away. And you thought that every communion would
   deepen these perceptions, keep you from all relapses, and sustain you
   "from strength to strength" till you should "see the God of gods in
   Sion." So we deceive ourselves, till our sloth or our sin falsifies our
   hopes. In like manner, also, after a first sickness, when you had once
   looked death near in the face, and gone down ankle-deep into the cold
   river, you thought that nothing could ever deaden your intense
   perception of the sinfulness of sin, the vanity of life, the awfulness
   of dying. How humbled, chastened, trembling, you were in the day when
   the shadow of death fell upon your heart. You thought, "If I live, this
   shall be my state for ever. Surely the bitterness of death is past; and
   I can never go back to an easy fearless life; never again be taken
   unawares." How, then, are you now that your heart beats firm, and your
   strength has returned into its old channels again? Are you not ready to
   say, "Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God
   preserved me, when His candle shined upon my head, and when by His
   light I walked through darkness. As I was in the days of my youth, when
   the secret of God was upon my tabernacle." [157] What, then, is the
   source of all this conflict and alarm, of this conscious declension and
   of this enduring hope? If our eyes were open, we should see ourselves
   to be the subjects of a fearful controversy. We should see the power of
   Satan striving to wrest us from the intercession of Christ. "Simon,
   Simon, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat;
   but I have prayed for thee." [158] This is both your peril and your
   safety. What but this are all our trials? When you are watching a dying
   bed, or bearing secret anxiety, or buffeted with temptations, though
   you seem all alone, and tost upon the sea, He is in the mountain in
   prayer, alone, the only and true High Priest interceding for you. You
   are crying, "Out of the deep have I called unto Thee, O God;" [159] and
   He is interceding either that your trial may pass from you, or that you
   may have strength to endure it unto the end: which we know not; the
   issue will shew; the day will declare it. Whichever way your sorrow
   turn, that will be the token what His prayer has been, and what for you
   is best.

   And, once more, His intercession for us is a consolation in a heavier
   trial even than these: I mean, in the distractions and wanderings which
   break in upon our prayers, and sometimes make us feel as if we were
   cast out altogether from His presence. Nothing is so heavy to bear as
   this sense of banishment and separation. At times we feel as if He had
   "covered Himself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass
   through." [160] And this He sometimes permits for our chastisement and
   humiliation; sometimes to try our patience; sometimes to prove our
   faith. The feeling of cold, dead, sluggish insensibility; the
   unconsciousness of His presence, or rather, if I may so say, the
   feeling of His absence; the unreality of our words, specially the most
   sacred, when we are on our knees before Him; these make us, day by day,
   turn with thankful trust to His ever-perfect, all-prevailing
   intercession. I do not mean that we may take this comfort while we
   indulge or make light of our distractions, but only when they are our
   sorrow and our affliction. Then we may say, "If any man sin, we have an
   Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:" [161] and may
   stay our feeble prayers on His which cannot fail.

   But beyond this, there are seasons of still greater trial, with which
   He suffers even those He best loves to be overcast. There are times
   when you are in doubt or misgiving as to His purpose towards you, or of
   your own path of duty; when you hardly know what you ought to do, or
   ask, or will. When you strive to pray, your words outrun your meaning,
   and seem to ask for things you fear and shrink from; such as greater
   crosses and denials of your will; things which, when you hear them
   uttered, you are afraid to have spoken in His sight. At last you are
   even speechless upon your knees; then take comfort in the thought, "He
   ever liveth to make intercession for us." You may then say, "What I
   cannot utter, or discern, He is pleading in my behalf, with a more than
   human sympathy, with a perfect knowledge, and a Divine compassion. No
   discernment of mine is enough. I know not what is for my good; I am
   darkness even to myself. Undertake for me." We should, indeed, be in an
   evil case, if we had no Head sustaining us in heaven; if we had to bear
   alone the whole weight of our own anxieties and of our own helpless and
   erring hearts. There is no time when we more truly feel our own utter
   weakness than in prayer; for then His presence and our consciousness
   meet, as it were, with a direct ray; no trust in ourselves, or
   confidence in others, or dependence upon lights of our own, whether of
   conscience or of intellect, will endure before Him. We then feel that
   we are dark, weak, and helpless. All our hope is, to cast ourselves
   upon Him, and to pray Him to choose, order, overrule, and reveal our
   way,

   From all this let us draw two rules for our practical guidance, and
   then come to an end.

   1. The one is, to make the intercession of our Lord the measure of our
   prayers. It is expressly said, that "we know not what to pray for as we
   ought." We ask amiss, for things hurtful, dangerous, unseasonable. We
   ask blindly, out of the turbulent emotions of our hearts, and not out
   of the clear judgment of our consciences. There are in us two wills; a
   superior, which is the gift of God's Spirit, revealing what is right;
   and an inferior and sensitive, which is made up of our own feelings,
   desires, and fears. The former is given us to be our light and guide.
   The latter, through our sin or infirmity, is the chief rule by which we
   pray. How often have we asked for things which afterwards we see, if
   they had been given us, would have been our destruction. They would
   have defeated blessings, or precipitated upon us, at a burst, a
   thousand secret temptations. Happy for us there is interposed a wise
   and loving will between our prayers and their fulfilment. If we could
   bring about the accomplishment of all we ask, we should need no other
   scourge.

   Blessed thought, that all our prayers are sifted out by His unerring
   wisdom. Whatsoever is good He gives us; whatsoever is for our hurt He
   turns aside; and yet He never refuses us any thing, but to give us
   something better. Whatsoever He refuses, He will always give
   Himself--His own presence, help, and strength. Let us, then, pray for
   ourselves, as He prays for us. Let us ask nothing but what He asks.
   Nothing, so far as we can, that is contrary to His will. Our best rule
   is this: to ask the great things of His kingdom, the cleansing of His
   blood, and the gift of His Spirit. All other things we may leave in His
   hands; and they shall, as He sees good, be added unto us.

   But this need not restrain us from pouring out our own hearts before
   Him, as He did before His Father: "Father, if it be possible, let this
   cup pass from Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt." We may
   tell and ask all under this condition. God is indulgent, and loves to
   give the very thing we ask for. To doubt this would dishonour His
   fatherly compassion. He is not only merciful and loving, but has a
   divine indulgence, a refined and perfect tenderness in blessing us. He
   gives us not only what we need, but much more; not only what is enough,
   but what may make us glad: even in the manner, and in the measure of
   bestowing His gifts on us, He reveals the tokens of His Fatherly
   affection.

   2. The other rule is, to make His intercession to be the law of our
   life. We ought to be what He prays we may become. He prays that we may
   be cleansed and perfected. Strive, then, so to be. Let your life answer
   to His prayer for you. Bear this in mind all day long, in your daily
   toils and cares. Let your will be one with His will, and be glad to be
   disposed of by Him. He will order all things for you. Every thing shall
   fall into its own place--joys, sorrows, blessings, the rod of
   chastisement, and the sharpness of the Cross; all shall be but the
   carrying out of His intercession, and the fulfilment of your own
   desires. What can cross your will, when it is one with His will, on
   which all creation hangs, round which all things revolve? "All power in
   heaven and in earth is given unto" [162] our Head; and in Him all is
   ours, if our will be His. Keep your hearts clear of evil thoughts; for
   as evil choices estrange the will from His will, so evil thoughts cloud
   the soul, and hide Him from us. Whatever sets us in opposition to Him
   makes our will an intolerable torment, a foretaste of "the worm that
   dieth not." So long as we will one thing and He another, we go on
   piercing ourselves through and through with a perpetual wound; and His
   will advances moving on in sanctity and majesty, crushing ours into the
   dust.

   If you will keep your life in harmony with His intercession, you will
   find the tokens of His prevailing prayer. We are wont to be faint
   believers in the power of prayer, and therefore we fail either to
   obtain or to recognise His answers of love. We utter our petitions as
   children let arrows fly, without aim, or care to find them. If we would
   keep a watchful note, both of our prayers and of our life, we should
   find them solving each other as a key and cipher. Both in answers and
   in refusals, or rather in all answers--for refusals are answers more
   full of love, perhaps, than all--we should see the accomplishment of
   our own petitions. Whatsoever you specially desire, ask before the
   altar. What He does in deed and truth on high, the Church does here in
   representation and memorial. He offers the one great sacrifice, and
   prays with perpetual intercession: we spread before Him the memorials
   of His sacrifice, and pray over them in the virtue of His one great
   oblation. Bring your deepest desires, the unuttered craving of your
   soul to Him in that blessed sacrament, and persevere in your petition.
   Though He be long silent, even though He say, "It is not meet to take
   the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs;" [163] still wait, and
   persevere. You shall have the desire of your heart, or something better
   than you can either ask or think. He is standing with the blood of
   atonement before the mercy-seat. We are worshipping in the outer courts
   of the eternal temple, awaiting His return. When He comes forth again,
   it will be to bless the Israel of God. Until then, the prayers of
   hearts which no man can number, of saints, penitents, and mourners, in
   all lands, the perpetual intercession of His whole body, as one great
   waterflood, lifting up its voice on high, ascends through Him, who for
   us has "entered into that within the veil." Wherefore let us draw nigh
   to Him; for He is able "to save to the uttermost" the greatest of
   sinners from the deepest abyss of sin, with a perfect salvation, even
   unto the end.

SERMON XV.

  PRAISE.

    PSALM cl. 6.

   "Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord."

   THESE words end the Book of Psalms--the volume of the Book of God's
   praise. The Spirit of God, who filled psalmists and seers with these
   songs of Divine joy, utters here the great law of creation as the last
   note of this heavenly strain. God made the world for His glory; and the
   breath of all living is due to Him in praise. "Let every thing that
   hath breath praise the Lord." We need not straiten these words to the
   letter. Breath is life; and it is a summons to all living, in heaven
   and in earth and under the earth, to all spirits of men and angels, to
   pay their homage of praise to the Lord of all.

   It is a remarkable token of the unity of the mystical body of Christ,
   both before and since His coming, that the Catholic Church should
   receive from the Church of Israel its chief songs of praise. Though
   "they without us" could "not be made perfect," yet we without them
   should have inherited no Psalter of Divine joy. Without doubt, the
   Spirit of Christ, who dwells in all fulness with His Church, would have
   multiplied the sweet singers of His true Israel, so that praise should
   never have been silent before His altars. But it may be, that He would
   teach us a lesson of perfect sympathy and of mutual help among the
   members of His body; and above all, a lesson of humility and fear. He
   has so ordained His kingdom, that the Psalter should every day admonish
   us to remember that we bear not the root, but that the root bears us;
   lest, being high-minded, we, like them, should be cut off.

   In the history of Israel there is, perhaps, nothing more striking than
   the spirit of praise which broke forth at solemn seasons from the whole
   people of God. They seem to move before us in a procession of joy.
   "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord,
   and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed
   gloriously; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. . . .
   And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her
   hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
   dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath
   triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the
   sea." [164] Again: "So David went and brought up the ark of God from
   the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness. And it was
   so, that when they that bare the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he
   sacrificed oxen and fatlings. And David danced before the Lord with all
   his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. So David and all
   the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and
   with the sound of the trumpet." [165] "And David spake to the chief of
   the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with
   instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by
   lifting up the voice with joy. . . . And David was clothed with a robe
   of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers,
   and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had
   upon him an ephod of linen. Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and
   with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and
   harps." [166] And again: "It is well seen, O God, how Thou goest; how
   Thou, my God and King, goest in the sanctuary. The singers go before,
   the minstrels follow after; in the midst are the damsels playing with
   the timbrels." [167] "Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy
   solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe
   to come into the mountain of the Lord, to the mighty One of Israel."
   [168]

   This sets vividly before us a state of heart, a temper of love and
   thanksgiving, a filial and almost childlike simplicity of grateful joy;
   and in this way it brings out, more clearly than any words, what is the
   full meaning of praise; from what source it springs, and in what ways
   it is expressed. If we are to define it in words, we may say that
   praise is thankful, lowly, loving worship of the goodness and majesty
   of God. And therefore we often find the word praise' joined with
   blessing' and thanksgiving': but though all three are akin to each
   other, they are not all alike. They are steps in a gradual scale--a
   song of degrees. Thanksgiving runs up into blessing, and blessing
   ascends into praise: for praise comprehends both, and is the highest
   and most perfect work of all living spirits.

   Let us, then, see in what praise consists, what are its elements, or
   rather from what source it flows.

   1. First, then, it arises from a consciousness of blessings already
   received. In one sense we may say that all the promises of God are
   actual possessions; for in Christ, whom the Father has given us, "all
   the promises of God are yea, and in Him Amen;" [169] that is, all are
   sealed and sure. And again, "Faith is the substance of things hoped
   for." [170] The faithful do really possess even things to come; and
   they, therefore, praise God for His promises, on which they rest as if
   they were already fulfilled. But this is not the consciousness we are
   now speaking of: I mean, the consciousness of particular blessings
   bestowed upon us, one by one, of which we have personal and present
   enjoyment. As, for example, the gift of regeneration; the grace of
   conversion; the spirit of repentance; the spiritual food of the Body
   and Blood of Christ: or again, the blessings of life, health, peace,
   happiness, and home; or restoration from sickness, danger, and the
   gates of the grave; and the numberless, and therefore nameless,
   blessings and gifts of this world and of the next, both for the body
   and for the soul, of which our life is full. Now one great difference
   between Christians is this, that multitudes take all these as things of
   course, without any conscious recognition of the gift as such, and of
   the Giver. The rest see in every blessing a several token of God's
   loving care, and are conscious that each one comes direct from His
   hand, and is an expression of His good-will. Those of whom we spoke
   first, imagine to themselves a general scheme, in which such things are
   so interwoven, as to make a kind of woof or texture--one
   undistinguished continuous whole, beginning, indeed, in the will of God
   afar off, and all along drawn onward by the movement of His
   providence--this they at once, when reminded of it, will acknowledge;
   but they have no sustained and separate consciousness of His direct
   personal care of them in detail. I pass by, of course, all who receive
   God's blessings in unbelief, or cold unthankfulness. We are now
   speaking of a better kind of people. And yet this vague general way of
   taking the gifts of God, produces great evils in the heart. . It forms
   a habit of insensibility, and, therefore, of undesigned ingratitude. We
   well know what we think of a friend who takes all kindnesses as matters
   of course, and makes no remarks; who enjoys all, and gives no tokens of
   acknowledgment. So some men deal with God: and the evil does not stop
   here; for unthankfulness, though it sounds only like a negation--that
   is, giving no thanks--is really a positive sin; for such people are
   repining, impatient, and gloomy, if blessings are withheld. What they
   give no thanks for, they use as if it were their own; and when it is
   kept back awhile, or taken away, they feel as if they were defrauded;
   forgetting that they have been all the while robbing God, not God them.
   Now as lights are best seen against a darkened sky, so we shall best
   see what is the spirit of conscious gratitude, by setting it against
   such a spirit as this. It consists in a watchful, minute attention to
   the particulars of our state, and to the multitude of God's gifts,
   taken one by one. It fills us with a consciousness that God loves and
   cares for us, even to the least event and smallest need of life; and
   that we actually have received, and do now possess as our own, gifts
   which come direct from God. It is a blessed thought, that from our
   childhood God has been laying His fatherly hands upon us, and always in
   benediction; that even the strokes of His hands are blessings, and
   among the chiefest we have ever received. When this feeling is
   awakened, the heart beats with a pulse of thankfulness. Every gift has
   its return of praise. It awakens an unceasing daily converse with our
   Father: He speaking to us by the descent of blessings, we to Him by the
   ascent of thanksgiving. And all our whole life is thereby drawn under
   the light of His countenance; and is filled with a gladness, serenity,
   and peace, which only thankful hearts can know.

   2. Another source of praise is a sense of our own unworthiness. To
   receive blessings as if they were no more than we may expect, betrays a
   strange unconsciousness of what we are, and of what they imply. Even
   though we were as pure as Adam when he was created, we should have no
   claims on God. He cannot be our debtor. The very gift of life is free,
   and makes us debtors to Him in all we are. Our whole being is His by
   creation: He might sustain or forsake us at His sovereign will. How
   much more after we became sinners, fallen and dead. Every blessing,
   therefore, is to us as the ring and the best robe which were given to
   the prodigal, a token of forgiveness, and gift of fatherly compassion.
   Of what peace and solace do people rob themselves! They abound in
   blessings which to their palate have each its own natural sweetness,
   but they perceive in them no further or higher tokens of especial
   grace. They do not, perhaps, challenge God's gifts upon their own
   deservings, but they do not see in them God's love to sinners. A sense
   of their own unworthiness would change all into a revelation of
   compassion. Every blessing would then be a pledge of eternal love,
   which even in our sins still holds us fast. Our daily bread would be a
   sign of pardon, and, if I may so speak, a sacrament of perpetual grace.
   "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down
   from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow
   of turning." [171] His love is changeless; and His mercies, as the
   light and life-giving influence of heaven, flow down in an everlasting
   flood, pouring forth in boundless streams upon all "things that have
   breath." "He maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and
   sendeth rain upon the just and on the unjust." In His sight there is
   none good, none clean: "Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not;
   yea, the stars are not pure in His sight." [172] "His angels He
   chargeth with folly:" [173] and "putteth no trust in His saints." [174]
   and yet upon us descends, without measure or stay, the fulness of
   goodness and of grace. Unworthy of the least, we have the greatest
   gifts: life and being, and all sustenance of life; the Blood of His
   Son, the Spirit of holiness, the earnest of "the inheritance of the
   saints in light." The more conscious we are of our unworthiness, the
   larger will His gifts appear, the more full of all kind of sweetness.
   It is this that fills the humble with such especial joy. Therefore St.
   Paul says, "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace;" [175] and
   again, "We joy in God." [176] There is no surer sign of a heart which
   knows the love of God and its own sinfulness than a spirit of joy. It
   is a great mistake to think that clouded and heavy looks, mournful
   tones, and great words of humiliation, are signs of pure repentance.
   Even in its lowest depths the spirit of penitence is a spirit of
   praise. "Great is Thy mercy toward me, and Thou hast delivered my soul
   from the nethermost hell." [177]

   3. And once more: this sense of unworthiness opens another, and that
   the highest source of praise--the pure love of God. It is in every way
   both right and lawful that we should love God from a sense of His
   goodness to us; from a grateful acknowledgment of His manifold gifts;
   which sustain the life both of our body and soul. He is the Giver of
   all that gladdens and cheers our hearts; the fountain of all peace and
   solace. He is our shelter, home, rest, and everlasting bliss; and as
   such we must love Him who is the true end for which we were created.
   But this love is not pure. It may not, indeed, be mercenary, or for our
   own sake; though some desire to love God only because it is the way to
   be happy in themselves. The pure love of God is to love Him as He loves
   us; freely, because He is love. He loves us, all sinful as we are; but
   He is mercy, love, goodness, and beauty. Pure love loves Him not for
   the sake of obtaining the inheritance of life, nor of being saved from
   death; but because the Father loves us, and gave His Son for us:
   because the Son loves us, and gave Himself to die in our stead; because
   the Holy Ghost loves us, and with miraculous long-suffering still
   dwells in us. We love Him because He is love, and because He first
   loved us; because He is our King and our God; because "great is His
   goodness," and "great is His beauty." To this perfect state pure love
   aspires as the flame points to heaven. God is the desired end of love,
   as the running brook is of thirst. Here is the true fountain of praise
   and worship--love ascending out of self to rejoice in God. This is the
   meaning of the Psalmist. Let all created life bow itself before the
   majesty of God; before the beauty of holiness, the glory of uncreated
   love. "Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord."

   Such, then, is praise; a high gift of God's Spirit in us, a sure token
   of His presence in the soul of man.

   1. It is, therefore, a sacrifice most acceptable in His sight. There is
   in praise this special grace, that it looks for no answer, no wages, no
   reward. It is the free loving joy of a heart grateful for the past, and
   for blessings now in our hands. And this shews us why it is so much
   harder to praise than to pray. Our necessities bring us to our knees:
   our sins, fears, sorrows, the thought of death, the vision of the Face
   before which heaven and earth flee away; these bring us down upon the
   earth. Prayer may be, and often is, no more than the cry of self in
   pain or terror. Even in sincere and religious minds prayer is the ready
   utterance of a burdened and troubled heart. The memory of disobedience,
   a sense of personal sinfulness, a desire of forgiveness, repentance,
   and the love of God, drive us day by day to Him. The more we know our
   own needs, emptiness, weakness, and estrangement from God, the more we
   are excited to pray. And many live in the practice of habitual and
   persevering prayer, to whom praise is still a difficult task, a
   conscious effort, in which the heart lags behind the lips. We may all
   know this from the fact, that we find it easier to realise the thoughts
   and the spirit of Lent than of Easter; so that there is a strange sense
   of regret and fear when the forty days are at an end, and Easter-eve
   comes in. We feel as if we were parting from the presence of a true
   though mournful friend, a sad but a safe instructor; as if the freeness
   and brightness of Easter-day were come too soon, and were all too high
   for us. And so in truth it is; for festivals are foretastes of
   heaven--the praise of eternity begun. They raise us up from earth
   towards God, and demand uplifted hearts. The tones of spiritual joy are
   loftier than the notes of litanies and penitential psalms. To feast
   with God needs more trust, more hope, more thankful joy, more kindling
   love. And therefore it is more acceptable before Him, who so desires
   our bliss, and loves our love, that He has made it the first law of His
   kingdom, that we should love Him with all our strength. He not only
   suffers us to love Him; He commands it. And praise is the voice of love
   lifted up in thanks, blessing, and worship. Sorrow, tears, sighing,
   humiliation, penance, confession, self-affliction, these things are not
   the genial tokens of God's kingdom. They came with sin, and with sin
   they will pass away. To Him they are acceptable only as the just
   abasement of sinners: He accepts them in us for His Son's sake, as
   signs of our submission to the sentence of death recorded upon the
   Cross: He accepts them, because He accepts us in the Beloved. In
   themselves they have no favour before the eyes of love. They are
   shadows which follow sin, and with sin they shall be cast out, when
   "God shall wipe away all tears" from the eyes of His children; "and
   there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall
   there be any more pain." [178] Blessing, gladness, and praise,
   festivals of spiritual joy, and the great sacrifice of thanksgiving,
   the perfect Eucharist of the whole mystical body with its glorious
   Head--this is the homage in which God delights, the true worship of His
   kingdom.

   2. And this shews us further, that as praise is most acceptable to God,
   so it is most blessed for us. To live in a spirit of praise, is to live
   a life as near to heaven as earth can be. What can be more blissful
   than the state of the Psalmist: "Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all
   that is within me, bless His holy Name:" [179] that is, my whole living
   spirit: my heart, with all its trust and all its love, all its
   gratitude and all its joy; my conscience, with all its witness of
   righteousness and equity; my will, with all its obedience and all its
   patience; my understanding, with all its reason and all its light; my
   whole being, with a full assent and fast adherence to God, my
   "exceeding great reward." [180] Can the spirit of a man reach nearer to
   the blessedness of angels; of those pure spirits who dwell in God, and
   live in Him by knowledge, love, and service? "I will praise Thee with
   my whole heart; I will shew forth all Thy marvellous works. I will be
   glad and rejoice in Thee." "The Lord is my strength and my shield; my
   heart trusted in Him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly
   rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise Him." "I will also praise
   Thee with the psaltery, even Thy truth, O my God: unto Thee will I sing
   with the harp, O Thou Holy One of Israel." [181] And that, too, even in
   darkness and affliction.

   This is a sure test of the purity of our love. We are ready to praise
   when all shines fair: but when life is overcast; when all things seem
   to be against us; when we are in fear for some cherished happiness; or
   in the depths of sorrow; or in the solitude of a life which has no
   visible support; or in a season of sickness, and with the shadow of
   death approaching,--then to praise God; then to say, This fear,
   loneliness, affliction, pain, and trembling awe, are as sure tokens of
   love, as life, health, joy, and the gifts of home: "the Lord gave, and
   the Lord hath taken away:" on either side it is He, and all is love
   alike; "blessed be the Name of the Lord:" this is the true sacrifice of
   praise. What can come amiss to a soul which is so in accord with God?
   What can make so much as one jarring tone in all its harmony? In all
   the changes of this fitful life, it ever dwells in praise. "The Lord
   will command His lovingkindness in the daytime"--in all the full
   activity and bright lights of life,--"and in the night"--in sorrow,
   sadness, and chastisement--"His song shall be with me." [182] "O send
   out Thy light and Thy truth, that they may lead me: let them bring me
   unto Thy holy hill, and to Thy tabernacle. Then will I go unto the
   altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea upon the harp will I
   praise Thee, O God, my God." [183] What is this but the spirit of
   heavenly bliss? What is this light but the uncreated Brightness; this
   truth, but the eternal Wisdom? What is this holy hill, this sanctuary,
   and this altar, but the presence of God, already seen by faith--the
   object of all praise, the fountain of all joy? This is heaven itself in
   the soul of God's servants, who shall one day reign among His saints.
   Here in this life for awhile prayer is our chief work: yet praise is
   mingled with it as a promise and an earnest of blessedness to come. Our
   worship, like ourselves, is encompassed with infirmity. And our
   necessities draw us about Him, as the lame, blind, dumb, and maimed,
   who came that they might be healed. Blessed are they who rise from the
   life of prayer into the spirit of praise, and learn that prayer is but
   the earthliest form of worship. They are passing on into that state
   where praise begins to fill all spirits with the fruition of endless
   joy. They who are waiting in the outer courts of the Eternal Presence,
   while our great High Priest is within the veil, cease not to pray; but
   their chiefest homage is the sacrifice of praise.

   In the perfect bliss of Heaven prayer shall rest for ever. What room
   shall there be for prayer, when there is no more sin? And what rest
   from praise, when all eyes shall see "the King in His beauty?" In that
   Home of Saints, "they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy,
   Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. . . . And fall
   down before Him that sat on the throne, and worship Him that liveth for
   ever and ever, and cast their crowns before Him, saying, Thou art
   worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for Thou hast
   created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created."

SERMON XVI.

  THE GREAT CONTROVERSY.

    JOB x. 2.

   "Shew me wherefore Thou contendest with me."

   GOD has declared so plainly, that He rebukes and chastens all whom He
   loves, that we can hardly dare desire to he free from chastisement.
   Much as we shrink from the thought of God's heavy hand coming down upon
   our weakness, of the sharpness of bodily pain, and of the anguish of
   affliction, yet we must still more shrink from such words as, "If ye be
   without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards,
   and not sons: for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
   Better any thing than this. God is so divinely gentle in His
   visitations, that if a light stroke, even the shadow of His hand, will
   suffice for our sanctification, He will send no more. Happy and blessed
   are they whose conscience is so sensitive and tender, that a slight
   sorrow, or a soft smiting of His rod, is enough to waken them into an
   eager and fervent desire of perfecting their conversion. To be easily
   awakened, and to open all the ear of the soul upon a fainter call of
   His voice, is a great sign of a state of grace. It is not, however,
   enough that it be a prompt, unless it be persevering attention. "When
   He slew them, they sought Him, and turned them early and inquired after
   God." [185] "But within a while they forgot His works, and would not
   abide His counsel." [186]

   When, therefore, we are in any way smitten of God, the first thing we
   ought to ask is, "Shew me wherefore Thou contendest with me." Some
   reason there certainly is: some special, and, by His light, some
   discoverable cause.

   Let us take one or two of the commonest causes of God's chastisement.

   1. The first is clearly an unconverted life. By unconverted, I do not
   mean the life of those, if such there be, who have never received the
   grace of God; for in them it would be no special and personal sin, as
   it is in us, not to turn to God, because, without His grace, it would
   be for them impossible. But who are they among baptized Christians? I
   speak, therefore, of those to whom an unconverted life is a special
   state of sin, because they have received God's grace, because they are
   regenerate. This is the condition of great multitudes in the visible
   Church. They have received that thing "which by nature they could not
   have." They have in them the gifts and power of a new life, of a life
   which should be always turning more and more fully and intimately to
   God, until it be altogether filled with the Divine Presence. But they
   hold these gifts in unrighteousness, and bring this spiritual power
   into the bondage of an evil or worldly will. Even in childhood, the
   seven deadly sins often begin to wax strong, and to grieve the Spirit
   of our new birth. Then we proceed to positive breaches of God's law and
   of our three baptismal vows; the mind of the flesh outgrows the spirit,
   and gains an habitual mastery in the soul. In this way a deceitful
   childhood grows up into a rebellious boyhood, and a stained and wilful
   youth, until the force of reason, and a few remaining fears, make a
   sinner in his manhood to put on a seemly disguise over an uncleansed
   heart. And many there are who thus become in fact, though not by
   intention, hypocrites. Or to take a fairer case. It often happens that
   men grow up without great and actual falls, and yet without any real
   knowledge of God or of themselves. The unseen world for them does not
   exist. All qualities, purely spiritual, and all realities of a holy
   life, are to them imperceptible. They have no sense for them; no eye,
   no ear, no spiritual capacity by way of imagination or of sympathy.
   Such people are often among the most blameless of ordinary Christians.
   They are upright, amiable, tenderhearted, full of fond affections;
   within the instincts of nature and of home, loving and beloved; but
   towards God they have little sorrow, little zeal, little love--no fire
   of devout worship. Such people are really unconverted. They are not yet
   turned to God. The world hangs between them and the True Light, and
   they are dark in the whole disk of their spiritual being. We might take
   many more cases; but as they would be, for the most part, shades of
   these two kinds, what has been said will suffice. Now all of these have
   one thing in common. They are not conscious that God has a special
   quarrel against them. It is a part of an unconverted state to mask
   itself. It draws an insensibility over the conscience and the heart.
   "Ephraim hath grey hairs, and he knoweth it not." This, then, is one
   question to be asked when God afflicts us: "Shew me wherefore.' Is it
   that I am walking after the flesh, or after the world? Is the grace of
   my regeneration supreme in my soul? or have I served myself, and
   crossed the Divine intention of my baptism? What was my childhood,
   boyhood, youth? What am I now? What is my chief end in life, the
   current of my desires, the habitual inclination of my will? What is the
   world unseen to me? what is my heart before God, and what is God to my
   soul? Am I living for Him, moving towards Him, passing out of myself
   into Him?" If not, this is the quarrel God has against you; and He will
   not leave off to smite until either you come to yourself, and confess
   the stroke to be just and merciful, or He be weary, and give over to
   chastise: which God forbid.

   2. Again, another cause is some sin visible to Him in those who are
   converted. It may be some one of our original stock of sins not yet
   mortified; or some new sin into which we have recently fallen; or some
   relaxation of our spiritual life, out of which has arisen, perhaps, one
   dangerous temptation, such as lukewarmness, selfishness, or vainglory.
   There is hardly any thing more alarming than the thought that Satan
   appears to withhold his other temptations from those who are surely
   entangled in any one sin. He will let them go on and even prosper in
   all the circle of their religious life, so long as he can keep his hold
   by one such sin as pride, envy, or sloth. To be sheltered from
   temptation by the shadow and shield of God's keeping, is, of course, an
   unspeakable mercy; but freedom from trials is so often a source of
   spiritual relaxation, and therefore of spiritual danger, that they who
   suffer from them are specially called blessed. "Blessed is the man that
   endureth temptation."

   Now it is certain that in the course of a religious life sins gain an
   entrance with inconceivable subtilty. Just as we contract slight
   peculiarities of manner, tone, or gait, without knowing it, either in
   the course of acquisition or after it is acquired, so it often happens
   in a life of religion. A person who before his repentance was proud,
   will, after he has become religious, often insensibly grow to be
   self-confiding, or self-complacent; soft people become vain or unreal;
   selfish people become isolated and unsympathising. The sap of the old
   stock rises into the graft, and lowers the quality of the fruit. Most
   of our religious difficulties are old faults with new faces, working
   now upon the desires, relations, and objects of faith, as before upon
   those of the world.

   Or again: through infirmity may we fall into faults entirely new, from
   which, in times of less religion, we were wholly free. For instance:
   sometimes those who before they were awakened to a sense of their
   personal danger were easy and indiscriminate, become almost
   schismatical in their abandonment of old and even religious friends:
   others who were formerly humble become opinionated and contentious,
   thinking it a duty to testify, as they say; that is, to thrust their
   own change upon the consciousness and senses of all about them. It is
   easy to see how soon pride and anger may spring up in such cases.

   But a greater danger than these to every one who is turned to a life of
   religion, is the disposition to relax, which may steal unawares upon
   the most watchful. The lightest rules, if they be perpetual, become
   severe; and in that measure our indulgent natures shrink from them;
   much more from the practice of repentance and the habits of devotion,
   until they have become the food and delight of the soul. Very few go
   through a life of penitence and of devotion without many ebbs and
   floods, many rises and falls of zeal and sorrow. To persevere without
   drawing back, to go from strength to strength, without intervals of
   darkness and coldness, is a rare grace, and rarely seen. Let any one
   look back over his past life, and measure if it be only the quantity of
   time spent, morning and night, in prayer during seasons of anxiety and
   fear; or during the first days of repentance, sorrow, or sickness--I
   say the quantity of time; for the quality and intensity of desire and
   contrition are not easily measured--and he will feel how often and how
   great has been his need of God's merciful visitations to contend with
   him for the upholding and saving of his soul.

   This, then, is another question to urge home upon ourselves. What does
   God see in me not yet rooted out? what new dangers have I added to my
   original stock of evil? into what have I fallen unawares? Surely He
   sees something in me that I see not; something that hinders my
   repentance, prayers, and love. Is it in the heart, or the imagination,
   or the will? is it in the tongue, or in the "lust of the eyes and the
   pride of life?" Is it towards Him, or towards others, or towards
   myself? My own discernment is not enough, I cannot discover it. Nothing
   but a light from Thee will reveal it. "Shew me wherefore Thou
   contendest with me."

   3. And still further: even on those who are truly turned to His
   service, and in whom, it may he, there are no special sins, such as I
   last spoke of, beyond the measure of our fallen state, His rod at times
   comes down: and for great purposes of love. There is one sure and
   sufficient cause inviting the chastisements of mercy; I mean, the dull
   sense we, most of us, have of our original and actual sinfulness.
   Perhaps there is nothing more awful and wonderful to those who truly
   repent, and are drawing closer and closer into the folds of God's
   presence, than the changes which pass over the aspect of their life and
   state. Ever since they were awakened, sinners they have known
   themselves to be. But how great they have never known. They go on, like
   the prophet in the secret places of Jerusalem, from chamber to chamber,
   seeing always "greater things than these." Their whole life seems to be
   a region full of places dark and deep. At first they saw but the
   horizon and a few gloomy hollows; here and there, a black form and a
   thick shadow; but, for the most part, all fair and clear. Year by year,
   new shapes arise, new shadows fall; the lights grow clearer, but make
   the scene less fair. Holy seasons and holy Sacraments cast upon us a
   fresh and searching brightness. Our life, seen before the altar, is a
   new revelation of the past. So, if possible, still more in sorrow and
   in sickness, when the spiritual sense is quickened to a sensitiveness
   which the world calls morbid, because it torments it "before the time."
   At first, we measure our sins by quantity, by number, and by greatness.
   We have a sort of bead-roll, on which we set down the catalogue of
   greater acts; of things still visible above the flood of forgetfulness
   which broods upon the past. The path and series of our life has its
   marking-points of sin and shame; and we soon learn to look back upon
   them as through an avenue, closing as it recedes, and hiding its
   farthest objects. This is, perhaps, the first view we have of sin--a
   view of its quantity, as an object external to the spiritual
   conscience, seen rather by the memory than by the soul.

   But, all our life long, so far as we are walking in the light of God's
   presence, and especially in times of chastisement and warning, we are
   learning to measure our sins by another and a truer rule; I mean, by
   their quality. What can be more clear than that the greatest breach of
   God's law may be almost wholly free from malice, and the least sin of
   the heart contain an inconceivable malignity? The true measure of sin
   is the intensity of its conscious rebellion against God. And this we
   learn in proportion as we throw off the deadening power of sin which
   weighs upon us. It is a change in us, which is needed to reveal us to
   ourselves. What we were and what we are is as objectively real as the
   firmament of heaven. But the blind cannot behold it, and dim eyes see
   but little of it. Whenever, then, any trial comes upon us, we may with
   great safety assure ourselves, that one reason why God is contending
   with us is, because we do not enough perceive the malignant quality of
   sin. And in so speaking, I do not mean only of the greater and grosser
   sins, far from it; but of such sins as are purely spiritual--self-love,
   self-worship, envy, spiritual sloth, ingratitude, want of love and of
   joy in God. If we would but slowly say to ourselves, "I was made to
   love God, and to be happy in Him;" and then remember not our
   rebellions, but the great gulf of coldness and distance which stands
   open between Him and us; we should feel that to love God is itself life
   everlasting--not to love God is itself eternal death. It may be that
   there are many more lessons He would have us learn in every visitation;
   but certainly this is one. So long as we are happy and in health, full
   of active thoughts, with busy hands, serving and admonishing others, we
   live abroad, unconscious, and forget ourselves. God loves us too well
   to let this go on for ever. At any cost, at any pain of heart or flesh,
   He will contend with us; as much as to say, "Why wilt thou die? What
   shall it profit thee to gain the whole world for thyself, or even for
   Me, and to lose thine own soul; after preaching the Gospel to others,
   thyself to be a castaway?" Every body knows that a busy life in the
   world, in commerce, or politics, or society, or literature, is very
   distracting, and calls off our gaze from ourselves. But we do not so
   often reflect or realise, that a life of punctual religious observance,
   or of active benevolence, or even a life of pastoral acts, may be
   eminently beguiling to the spiritual consciousness. It is so nearly
   united to the interior life of the spirit, and may yet be fulfilled for
   years with such a perfect want of habitual and conscious intention,
   that it is most difficult to discern our actual state, For instance,
   thinking and speaking are acts of our living consciousness so
   absolutely, that our whole energy and soul is commonly thrown into our
   words and thoughts: and yet we both speak and think in sleep; nay, we
   speak without thinking, and we think, even waking, without presence of
   mind. We may think, and yet be unconscious; or, as we say, with a
   powerful and true figure, we are absent. So it is, as we all know, in
   religion. Who has not complained of absence of mind in reading holy
   Scripture, in prayer, in church, and even at the holy Sacrament? Every
   one has felt this at some time; and what is true, at times, with all,
   with some grows to be their habitual state. Their eyes rest upon the
   book, or upon the altar; they kneel for half an hour in their closets;
   they are busy in almsgiving; devout in the imagination and in the
   intellect; but they are absent in all their spiritual life. This is the
   secret reason of many falls, declensions, fruitless endeavours,
   obstinate temptations, and efforts to advance long made in vain.

   Who does not, in some measure, know what this means? And how is it
   possible, that in such a condition we can weigh the quality of our
   spiritual state? How can we feel the malignity of not loving God
   without love to Him? It is love alone that reveals the sinfulness of
   not loving. How can we measure our ingratitude, without a spirit of
   praise? or our indevotion, without delight in prayer? How can we
   perceive the darkness of past evils in thought, desire, and will, but
   by a will and a heart in which the pure light of the Spirit is shed
   abroad? How can we estimate the exceeding sinfulness of a settled,
   morose, wilful life of conscious distance from God, without a present
   perception of the sin of being, even for a moment, estranged from Him,
   by any consent of our own? Granted that, by God's exceeding mercy and
   patience, we have in some measure come to feel all this. But at most
   how little. How much need of the rod to waken us. "My soul cleaveth
   unto the dust; quicken Thou me according to Thy word." What is the
   intensest perception we have of our sinfulness, even in times of
   sickness and sorrow, to that which we shall have in the day of
   judgment, or even upon our deathbed? How great, then, the need of
   discipline, how blessed the visitation, how loving the Rebuker!

   And now, perhaps, it may be asked, "What shall I do when God visits me?
   How shall I find out what is the cause wherefore He is contending with
   me?"

   To this I can but give two answers, both so plain as hardly to need
   giving.

   1. The first is, Search yourselves and see. And with a view to this, it
   will be well for us to begin by making, even in writing, in as few
   words as possible, or by signs or symbols if we will, a review of our
   past life; dividing it into its chief seasons, such as childhood,
   boyhood, youth, and manhood; distinguishing also any periods marked by
   change of state or calling, which, as they bring new duties, bring also
   new qualities to our life, and new responsibilities upon our
   conscience. It will then be well to note under each period all the sins
   we can remember, especially the first of each kind, fixing, if
   possible, the beginning, the first opening of each bitter spring; then
   to trace the widening and increase of each, and their confluence in the
   broader stream of our after-life; and to see how it all connects itself
   with our present character and trials. It will be right to remember any
   persons, in every age, who have been implicated with us, or by us, in
   our past history. The tale of our life will hardly be more truly
   written than when our hand is under God's hand. A time of trial,
   therefore, is specially meet--I may say is sent--for a time of
   self-judgment. If we throw it away on other things, we shall find that
   we have lost what nothing, it may be, but another chastisement will
   restore.

   But when we have done this, there still remains the greater scrutiny.
   Thus far we have only laid up matter for our examination--answers for
   the questions of God. The next thing is, to try our life as before the
   throne of Christ, and with the accuser at our right hand; to fix our
   eyes, as if we were out of ourselves, upon ourselves--kneeling before
   the Judge, bound as guilty, with our hands at our back. And the rules
   by which to try ourselves are four: the seven deadly sins, the
   commandments of God, the three vows of our baptism, and the two
   precepts of the Gospel. If we deal truly with ourselves, we shall find
   that our whole life will put on a new appearance. What we once thought
   to be a full account, we shall find to be no more than an outline.
   Every stage of it will be seen to be fuller of transgression than the
   whole appeared before; every branch of our character to run out into
   endless fibres of self; what seemed single events, to unite in a chain
   of habits; even single acts, to contain a world of evil. The
   enlargement of our sin seems preternatural. It is seen to be manifold,
   and yet indivisible; untraceably complicated, and yet absolutely one;
   identified with the very being of our soul, with the very soul of our
   life. Only, be not afraid when you see these things. See them one day
   we must: one day, when to see them may be too late, in the light of the
   Son of man and of His holy angels; when all things now forgotten shall
   awake, like the piercing consciousness of drowning men; and all our
   whole life, with every deed, word, and thought of heart, shall he
   crowded into one intense and all but infinite consciousness of guilt. O
   fearful day, even though it were but the twinkling of an eye! How
   sweet, how soothing, how sadly blessed, is a whole life of penance,
   rather than one moment of eternal shame! Let us, then, take heart, and
   search to the very quick; trying ourselves by the letter of God's law;
   reading it in all its spiritual perfection. And what we learn let us
   never again forget; let us never again permit the veil to fall between
   us and the past; nor suffer any the least part of it to withdraw into
   concealment. Through life let us go on adding to this awful secret of
   self-knowledge; reviewing, at fixed times and often, the record of the
   past, as we saw it in the day of visitation.

   2. The other rule is, if possible, plainer than the last. Pray God to
   shew you your very self. Without the effusion of His light, this is
   impossible. We are dark to ourselves, and we walk in darkness. Our eyes
   are outward: what is within is, as it were, behind their gaze. There
   is, by nature, a spirit of slumber upon the soul, and it cannot wake
   itself. Like the breath of life, it must come from God into our dust;
   and such a breath is the free grace of God in our regeneration. There
   is nothing that more shews the love of God in our election than the
   gift of His preventing grace. Even after our new birth, we are still,
   for the most part, in a slumber; especially such as either fall into
   sin, or live without active habits of devotion. We are as unconscious
   of the great realities of God's kingdom and our own sinfulness, as if
   we were asleep; and sleeping men cannot wake themselves. What but God
   drew us out of this insensibility? What first made our hearts to thrill
   and tremble, to fear and yearn, to feel about, groping at noon as in
   darkness? What but the Spirit of God? So it has been to this day. Let
   us, then, pray Him to shew us to ourselves, especially when He is
   contending with us in sorrow, sickness, crosses, or disappointments.
   All these are tokens that He is come to carry on His work of love; that
   He has not left us, nor given us over: that there is still "hope in the
   end:" though now it be neither dark nor light, yet "in the evening time
   it shall be light." Let us, then, pray for the illumination of His
   Spirit; not fearing to see ourselves as we are, though they who have
   asked and obtained this prayer have prayed in haste, that they may be
   hid from themselves again. When we pray for this sight of fear, let us
   also pray that He will, at the same time, reveal unto us the Lamb of
   God, lest we be overwhelmed. It is a blessed thought, that if we
   sincerely desire to know ourselves, we may leave all to Him. He will
   reveal it in such measures and ways as for us is best. All our life
   through, we shall be seeing some reality of our spiritual state more
   clearly, more broadly, more deeply; and as we see the worst of
   ourselves, we shall see most of His love. These things go together, and
   revealing, temper each other to our infirmity; so that all through
   life, as we draw nearer to Him, we shall more abase ourselves. Ever
   more and more shall we behold this twofold vision of our shame and of
   His sanctity, till we shall be without sin before the throne, and in
   His light see ourselves without spot or blemish in the kingdom of God
   and of the Lamb.

SERMON XVII.

  PREPARATION FOR DEATH A STATE OF LIFE.

    ISAIAH xxxviii. 1.

   "Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and
   not live."

   PERHAPS the most awful moment of our lives is when we first feel in
   danger of death. All our past life then seems to he a cloud of words
   and shadows; one less real than another, moving and floating round
   about us, altogether external to the realities of the soul. Not only
   childhood and youth, happiness and sorrow, eager hopes and disturbing
   fears, but even our communion with God, our faith in things unseen, our
   self-knowledge, and our repentance, seem alike to be but visions of the
   memory. All has become stern, hard, and appalling. The thought of
   passing out of this kindly and familiar state, from loving faces,
   partial friends, soothing offices of religion, hopeful persuasions of
   our own peace at last, to go into the world beyond the grave, among
   souls departed, and the spirits who stand before the presence of our
   Judge; all things now wound up, all sins weighed and doomed: this is
   full of unutterable fear. Such is the burst of consciousness which
   breaks upon the soul, when any great event in life says to us, "Set
   thine house in order." It is as if it were the beginning of a new
   existence; as if we had passed under a colder sky, and into a world
   where every object has a sharpness of outline almost too severe for
   sight to bear. Such was the effect of the prophet's words upon
   Hezekiah. Even he, a saint of God, was overwhelmed. He "turned his face
   toward the wall," and "wept sore." He said, "He will cut me off with
   pining sickness: from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me. I
   reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will He break all my bones:
   from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me. Like a crane or a
   swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with
   looking upward: O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me. What shall I
   say? He hath spoken unto me." [187]

   If this was the effect upon so great a servant of God, what must be the
   first breaking and the first realisation of approaching death to us?
   The first feeling which would overwhelm any of us would be fear: fear,
   that is, of the sight of God, and of the just judgment upon our sins.
   It is, indeed, true, that to believe in God's mercy through Christ is a
   chief act of faith; and that to refuse to trust in Him is a sign either
   of consent in a temptation to despair, or want of the virtue of faith.
   It is, moreover, a dishonour to the perfect tenderness of our Lord, not
   to go to Him with a full trust in His supernatural mercy. All this is
   most true; and yet they who have realised the thought of death as
   probable or near, tell us, that with this perfect conviction of faith,
   there is also a deep emotion of fear, which arises out of a
   consciousness of what we have been, and what we still are, in the sight
   of Him whose "eyes are as a flame of fire." And although it is also
   true, that "perfect love casteth out fear," and that it is the very
   office of faith to extinguish this feeling of alarm which is akin to
   mistrust; yet, after all, it is absolutely certain that such a feeling
   does exist, paradoxically, in the soul even of men of great faith and
   love. With all their perception of the Divine mercy in Christ, they
   still feel within, the consciousness of great sins and insufficient
   repentance. Who can judicially pronounce his own repentance sufficient?
   and who without a sufficient repentance can be free from fear of dying?
   We talk very boldly of death, and of calm hopes, and willingness to
   depart, and the like; but when the time really comes, we shall find it
   something different from our sincere but shallow imaginations. Next to
   sin, death is the most terrible of all realities; the very instincts of
   nature shudder at it; the soul of all men, except great saints, must
   shrink from it. And even they, though filled with the love of God, are
   fullest of the consciousness of our fallen state at that last and
   fearful hour.

   Let us, then, see what we ought to do when God warns us.

   I will not say repent; because, alas for us at such a time, if we have
   not repented long ago. We are now speaking not of sinners, or careless
   people, but of those who in the main serve God, and have been long
   before in the path of eternal life. What they have to do is, to try
   their repentance, to see whether it be real and true. But this is
   hardly to be done by any direct measurement of the quantity or
   vividness of our sorrow for sin. We have no gauge or balance for such
   experiments. We have to judge, not so much of past feelings as of our
   present condition. The true test of our repentance, and the exposition
   of its real character, is our moral habit before God at the time when
   His warning overtakes us. Let us, therefore, see how we may try this
   state.

   1. First, we must ask ourselves this question: Is there any one sin,
   great or small, of the flesh or of the spirit, which we willingly and
   knowingly commit? This is, in fact, the crisis of our whole spiritual
   life. We might say, that all Christians may be simply divided into
   those who do, and those who do not, with will and knowledge, allow
   themselves in any, even a single sin. To say that we do not so allow
   ourselves, does not imply any very high state of spiritual advancement,
   still less does it imply freedom from the commission of all sin. There
   are sins of ignorance, weakness, strong temptations, sudden assault,
   which go to make up a heavy account day by day, even against those who
   neither knowingly nor willingly consent to them. Therefore the state is
   neither so high as to discourage us, nor so far advanced as to be any
   great temptation to self-complacency. It is, indeed, the lowest and
   first step in a converted life. For what conversion of heart can there
   be, so long as a man willingly commits sin, knowing it to be sin? He
   thereby plainly declares that sin, as such, is not hateful to him. By
   consent in one sin, he is guilty of the whole principle of rebellion,
   of the whole idea of anarchy in God's kingdom and in his own soul. His
   will and his heart, with its love and inclination, are still under the
   power and attraction of evil; and this is virtually equivalent to any
   form or measure of disobedience. It is a fealty and service to the
   kingdom of darkness. In truth, both sin and holiness have a perfect
   unity in their several principles; and they are mutually irreconcilable
   and expulsive of each other. A holy man is not a man who never sins,
   but who never sins willingly. And a sinner is not a man who never does
   any thing good, but who willingly does what he knows to be evil. The
   whole difference lies within the sphere and compass of the will. This
   is the meaning of St. John's words, so often mistaken: "Whosoever is
   born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him: and he
   cannot sin, because he is born of God." St. John does not intend us to
   understand that the regenerate are those only who never sin: for then
   their would be no regenerate in this world: because "There is no soul
   that liveth and sinneth not." And who "cannot sin," if even St. Paul
   might be a castaway? St. John's meaning is plainly this, that the will
   of the regenerate is so bent against sin that he does not sin by
   consent, but, if so be, by ignorance, surprise, infirmity; that is, his
   will is universally holy. And so, on the other hand, St. James,
   speaking of the unity of sin, says, "Whosoever shall keep the whole
   law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all;" because consent
   to any sin, as such, is consent to the whole principle of sin. In this
   sense, then, we must question ourselves. Is sin, as such, in its
   principle hateful to us; and is our will bent universally against it?
   Is holiness, in its principle, lovely and a delight to us, and does our
   will, in its intentions and desires, universally embrace it? Are we
   with our whole soul and strength on God's side in an evil world? There
   are many ways of putting this to the test. The sins of infirmity which
   daily beset us, are they grievous, afflicting, and humbling? When we
   have fallen, as by an impatient word, a peevish tone, a selfish desire,
   an unguarded eye, or a fearless thought, do we turn and, if we can,
   make amends to our fellow sinners, and in all make our instant
   confession to God? Do we stand in fear in the morning lest we should be
   overcome? Do we grieve at night if we have been cast down? Do we find
   our infirmities fewer, or less often committed, or sooner corrected
   than before?

   This is the first scrutiny we must pass upon ourselves; for great and
   awful is the mystery of the will. Its contents, so to speak, for good
   or for ill, are infinite. Virtually, it contains our whole state, and
   is itself our whole character in the sight of God. What a meeting with
   Him would that be of a heart which still consents to any thing against
   which the will of God is turned as a flame of fire! "Who may abide the
   day of His coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth? for He is
   like a refiner's fire." [188] What wonder we fear to die, so long as we
   know that to meet God is to meet an Almighty will which we habitually
   slight? This, then, is the first point in which to try ourselves; and
   it naturally leads us on to another.

   2. We must next search and see whether there is any thing in which our
   heart, in its secret affections, is at variance with the mind of God;
   for if so, then so far our whole being is at variance with His. We have
   hitherto been speaking of our will as it shews itself in the acts of
   our life. Now we are considering it as it exists, if I may so speak,
   passively in the heart. It is very certain that even in those who fear
   to consent actively in any sin, there may still exist the inclinations
   of sin, suspended in the will, and held under the restraint of fear
   rather than of holy affections. Such people often really desire what
   God forbids, and dislike what God desires. Though their will does not
   openly cross His will in act and deed, yet it reigns in them, and
   within its own sphere is in conscious opposition to the Spirit of God.
   The way in which this shews itself is by the affections of love and
   hate, hope and fear, joy and sorrow, which are feelings of the mind.
   Though they be never acted upon, yet they are as real as a thousand
   acts. We may love what God hates, as the pride of life; or hate what
   God loves, as crosses and humiliations. So also we may hope for what He
   wills that we should never enjoy, as earthly happiness or ease in life;
   and fear what He wills we should endure, as bodily pain, unjust
   suspicions, and the like; or we may seek our joys where He would have
   us bestow no care, and sorrow where He would have us without choice or
   concern. All this implies ill-regulated affections; and what produces
   so much consciousness of moral opposition as a contrariety of desire
   and love? What are the affections He blesses and accepts? Love,
   holiness, purity, meekness, humility, and self-denial, as they exist in
   sanctified hearts; a hatred of sin, zealous sorrow, humiliation,
   self-chastisement, as in penitents. Such Christians are truly united to
   God in will; so that nothing comes amiss to them, nothing is a
   contradiction to their will. Even crosses are no crosses to them.
   Sorrows, sickness, failures, disappointment, the hardest trials of the
   world, such as its false witness and inexorable enmity,--all these, as
   they come by God's permissive will, so they are objects of the positive
   will of His true servants.

   But what is the case with most of us? How many are happy and at ease in
   their possessions, full of innocent but active thoughts, with plans and
   aims laid up for many years. They hold fast to friends and home: they
   delight in the happiness of religion, in its sunny side, in the beauty
   of worship and the majesty of truth; they love religion, because it is
   their chief source of joy and comfort: but they have no love for its
   "clouds and thick darkness," its discipline of the Cross, and the
   mysteries of sorrow by which God works in us both perseverance and
   perfection. Though we love one aspect of God's will, we have often but
   little love for the other. Now here is a moral variance between us and
   Him; a variance which cannot but make us strange to Him, and give to
   every thought of passing out of life, and going to a direct intuitive
   vision of His presence, a peculiar quality of fear. Imagine, if we can,
   before the great white throne, a soul which shrinks from home truths,
   painful memories of sin, and a sharp discipline of self. Imagine a
   gentle, amiable heart, without deep convictions of sin or of the Cross,
   standing before the Word made flesh.

   Who does not fear that, if he now were called to stand before God, he
   would be as the stubble in the blast of the furnace? Surely we ought to
   fear so long as we are conscious that our will is surrounded by a
   circle of desires over which self and the world so cast their shadows,
   as to darken the tracings of God's image upon them. Yet such too often
   is our state. In the main, we know that we are on the right side; but
   we suffer our hearts to run to waste in unchastened and wandering
   affections, which wind about the world, and cling to life with a
   tenacious hold. What fellowship have you even with those whom you once
   knew in the flesh, now made perfect? Would you not shrink from their
   gaze, and from the sanctity of their presence? How, then, can we but
   tremble at the thought of entering the world unseen? The apparition of
   one angel would overwhelm us. How, then, could we endure to pass into
   the presence of all angels and all saints gathered in the heavenly
   court? Nay, further, what communion has our heart with the spirit of
   the Cross? And if not with the Cross, what sympathy with Him who was
   crucified? Must there not, then, be between Him and us a certain though
   secret variance, a contradiction of the heart, making us shrink from
   the thought of meeting? But thus far we have been speaking only of a
   negative fitness, of the absence, that is, of moral unfitness, for our
   departure.

   3. A third test by which to try ourselves is, the positive capacity of
   our spiritual being for the bliss of heaven. When St. Paul bids us to
   follow after "holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord," [189]
   he surely meant something more than a negative quality. He did not
   mean, that to be free from the soils of sin, or the opposition of an
   imperfect will, was a sufficient meetness for the beatific vision.
   Doubtless he meant by "holiness" to express the active aspirations of a
   spiritual nature, thirsting for the presence of God, desiring "to
   depart, and to be with Christ." [190] How unreal and unintelligible are
   many of the Psalms in our mouths. They were the utterances of holy
   souls yearning for union with the true centre and life of their
   spiritual being. "Like as the hart panteth for the water brooks, so
   panteth my soul after Thee, O God. My soul is athirst for God, yea,
   even for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?"
   [191] "O God, Thou art my God; early will I seek Thee: my soul
   thirsteth for Thee: my flesh longeth after Thee in a barren and dry
   land, where no water is." [192] Even then, when the unseen world was
   veiled, and the heavenly court was not as yet laid open, they yearned,
   by a spiritual instinct, for something which the presence of God could
   alone supply. Much more now that the Word made flesh has sat down in
   His Father's throne, angels and principalities being made subject unto
   Him; now that patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, and saints, are
   gathered round about Him, and the bliss and glory of His kingdom are
   revealed. With what ardent desire has the spirit of holiness, in all
   pure souls, thirsted to "see the King in His beauty." As the souls
   under the altar cried, "Lord, how long?" much more have His saints on
   earth cried, "Make no long tarrying;" wo is me that my sojourn is so
   long drawn out; "Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly." This is the voice of
   true sanctity, of those that "hunger and thirst after righteousness,"
   and are joined to God by love, as rays hang from the splendour of the
   sun. But what do we know of these great things? It confounds and
   overwhelms us so much as to utter, it bewilders and blinds us even to
   think upon them. These things are for such as delight in God, live in
   meditation, seek no solace but in prayer, no joy but in worship; are
   eager for no food but the living bread which is broken at the altar.
   For these fervent souls, set on fire of heaven, there is nothing on
   earth but patience, waiting, and desire. Their true home is in God.
   Their holiness is a fervent aspiration to be unclothed, and to be
   clothed upon with incorruptible flesh in the kingdom of the
   resurrection.

   But what must we confess? Is it not true, that for the most part our
   love of God is rather a conviction of the reason than an affection of
   the heart? our communion with Him more, an excitement of the emotions
   than an embrace of the will? our prayers full of conscious effort? our
   approaches to the altar rather dutiful than fervent? Are we not
   conscious of more sensible pleasure in reading devout books than in
   acts of devotion? and still more pleasure in the freer exercise of our
   thoughts and affections among earthly friends, than in consciousness of
   the presence of God? Nay, do we not shrink at the thought of beholding
   the host of angels, and even our own friends now made perfect? And what
   does this betray, but a great incapacity of the heavenly bliss? How
   long shall we go on deceiving ourselves? It is not only a life stained
   with sin and kindled with fires of evil, or a soul drowned in worldly
   cares and in the depths of sense, or a will braced and strung up to
   intense worldliness and self-worship, or a mind squandered and lowered
   by levity and empty trifling; but also a heart which is coldly
   observant of duty, devout in the conception of the intellect, and
   fervent in the pictures of the imagination, this, too, is a real
   incapacity for the state of heavenly rest. We must learn to live here
   on earth by the measures and qualities of heaven, before the altar,
   kneeling in our closets, in fellowship with saints and angels, and with
   the ever-blessed Trinity, before we can think to find our bliss in the
   kingdom of God. His presence, if I may so speak, is the centre of that
   orb of light and blessedness in which all who love Him live and worship
   here on earth. The blessed stand at the fountain of light,--we in the
   outskirts of its glory. If, then, we had our warning now, "Set your
   house in order," what should we do? If we were to know that we are
   going to leave all the easy, hopeful, relaxed devotions of our present
   life, to stand in the brightness of God's eternal throne, what should
   we feel? Should we not shrink at the thought of eternal worship,
   spotless sanctity, the vision of the blessed, and the majesty of God?
   Are we meet to behold and to mingle in the awful realities of the
   Divine presence? Does not the remembrance of our last communion, or of
   this morning's prayers, make us tremble at the sense of our unheavenly
   state? Even though we be consenting in no sin; even though our will be
   passively subject to the will of God; still are our active affections
   and the energies of our spiritual being so put forth, and so centred in
   loving and adoring God, that to die would be not so much a change as an
   expansion and perfection of our present state? It is the will of God
   that the capacities of our regenerate life should be here unfolded,
   that they may be there made perfect--should be here matured, that they
   may be there fulfilled. To be pure from the acts and affections of sin
   is not holiness. We may be free from sin, and yet may lack all the
   energies and capacities of heavenly bliss; for what are these but the
   active perfections of pure and fervent love of God, and of all the new
   creation in God and for God?

   These are some of the questions you must needs both ask and answer when
   the shadow of death falls upon your dial. Happy and holy are they who
   can say, "Lord, I am in Thy sight but sin and death. But if, through
   weakness, I offend, it is a wound which straightway makes my heart to
   bleed. Thy will is my will; in holy obedience or in holy patience, in
   life or in death, Thy will be done in me. Thou, in Thy mercy, hast
   gathered in my heart and my love from this life and from this world,
   and hast hid them in Thy kingdom. Whom have I in heaven but Thee, and
   there is none upon earth I desire beside Thee.' All the thoughts,
   desires, affections, powers of my soul are set upon Thee, and upon the
   bliss and fellowship of Thy saints. This is my pilgrimage; that,
   through the Blood of Thy Son, shall be my rest for ever."

   There are now two short counsels which it may be well to add.

   1. The first is, that we strive always so to I live, as to be akin to
   the state of just men made perfect. This is to live in fellowship with
   God, and in the communion of saints. If we live for, or in, this world,
   so as to sympathise with it, we cannot be fit to die. A life of sense,
   or of imagination, or of intellect, withdraws the affections from the
   sanctity and peace of God. We may live a life of almsdeeds, or in vivid
   imaginative communion with all the members of Christ's mystical body,
   or in active intellectual fellowship with all saints from the
   beginning; and yet have no communion with God. For the seat of this is
   a holy will; and the bands of it are holy affections of repentance and
   love, of joy and abasement. The chief end and prayer of our lives ought
   to be, that we may so pass out of the sphere of sense, imagination, and
   intellect, into the region of the will, that our whole spiritual being
   may, as far as sin and dust can, be united to the purities and worship
   of heaven; that as the children of this world are bound in sympathy to
   the world, so we may be knit by a mighty and transforming sympathy to
   the new creation of God. This, if we would die well, must be not the
   ultimate, but the habitual state of our hearts. Blessed are they who
   have a fervent will, set on fire of God; to whom this world, and all
   things in it, are cheap and pale; and their only ardent desire is for
   the eternal years. For them all things are more real as life draws on.
   What is passing away is but shadow and decay: their treasures and joys
   are yet to come. The things they love most, and live in with greatest
   delight, are but foretastes and reflections; though most real, still
   but shadows of good things yet to come. Even the sanctuary and the
   altar, and the mysteries upon the altar, are but the beginning of joy.
   God's love, God's will, God's holiness; the glory, the rest, the beauty
   of His presence; the illumination of the soul, its purity, its peace;
   what are all these but anticipations of the perfect bliss of heaven? If
   the beginnings are beatific, what shall the fulness be? if they are
   blissful in faith, what shall they be in vision? O happy life, in unity
   and in continuity with the perfect joy! O that we may live in it
   altogether! Let us come down upon the water, for it will bear us up;
   let us not fear to walk where He walked; above all, when we walk with
   Him.

   Even if the duties and works of life be upon us, let us not be cast
   down. In the midst of all we may have our chiefest love in heaven. The
   busiest may live ready to die. If the substance and heart of our
   spiritual life be "hid with Christ in God," all duties and works of our
   lot are but occasions either of obedience or of patience, and therein
   of our perfection. Let this, then, be one counsel: to live habitually
   in that state in which, if we should depart, we should pass from a
   lower to a higher condition of the same spiritual order; from faith to
   sight; from the first faint tastes of uncreated peace, to the overflow
   of the eternal fountain.

   2. And the other counsel is, that we often rehearse in life the last
   preparation we should make in death. We know not whether we shall have
   time for the last dressing of our soul, when God calls us to His
   presence. A sudden death may cut us away in an hour; a wandering mind,
   or the distractions of pain, or the weight and burden of our mere
   mortality, may take our last hours or days out of our control. It is
   good, therefore, in times of health to try to realise our last passage;
   to see ourselves upon our bed of death; and to surround ourselves with
   all the probable images and sights of our last hour; with the objects
   and the words, even with the very looks which may be fixed upon us
   then. Joseph made his sepulchre in his garden, in the midst of his most
   familiar scenes. And he had his reward; for that tomb became a pledge
   of his election. It will be good for us to set apart some day, as the
   day of the departure of a sainted friend, or the day of our own birth
   by nature or by baptism, and to spend it as if it were our last,
   praying God to forgive our stains of soul and body, the sins of all our
   thoughts and of all our senses. And also to approach the holy Sacrament
   at some certain season, as if we were receiving it upon our bed of
   death. This will make death a benign and familiar thought. And it may
   be that God, in His tender mercy, will accept these our timely
   preparations as if they were our last; and draw over our whole life the
   spirit of a holy fear, and of a continual readiness to die. Alas! it is
   no good sign that Christians should so fear to see His face. If heaven
   be the presence of our Lord, and if death be the passage to His throne,
   our fears betray how little we know of heavenly blessedness, and how
   little capacity we have for the fruition of its peace. Let us, then,
   try, day by day, so to live, that if we were to die, we should but pass
   out of the conflict and clouds of this earthly trial, into the
   fulfilment of our most kindled and ardent longings. And, further, let
   us each one seek, not by high imaginations or by excited emotions, but
   by deepening in ourselves, and praying God to increase in us ever more
   and more, both zeal and sorrow, the grace to live the life and to die
   the death of a perfect and fervent penitent.

SERMON XVIII.

  THE DEATH OF CHRIST OUR ONLY STAY.

    ST. JOHN xv. 13.

   "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
   his friends."

   IF the thought of sin, death, and judgment, be so terrible, as in truth
   they are to every soul of man, on what shall we stay ourselves when our
   time is at hand? Not upon the smallness nor the fewness of our sins,
   for our whole life is full of stains; nor upon the multitude or the
   greatness of our good deeds, God knoweth; for where shall they be
   found? When we come, as it were, into the range and presence of death,
   our whole consciousness is penetrated with a sense of sin. We see not
   only the evil we have done, but the good we have left undone. And the
   good, if so be, that we have striven to do, we seem to see for the
   first time revealed by some strange and searching light, in which all
   looks blemished, marred, and sullied. The holiest soul will, perhaps,
   be the most overwhelmed, for a time, by this vision of humiliation; so
   sure is it, that they who do most works of holiness, trust least in
   them. They cannot but feel, that there is not an hour nor an act of
   their life in which, if they have not crossed the end of their
   creation, they have, at least, fallen short of fulfilling it.

   On what, then, shall we stay ourselves in the day when the fear of
   death falls upon us?

   1. First, upon the love of God, in giving His Son to die for us. "God
   so loved the world;"--that is, so almightily, so divinely, with the
   infinite love of the eternal Godhead;--"that, He gave His only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life." [193] "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
   that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our
   sins." [194] "God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were
   yet sinners, Christ died for us." [195] This is our first foundation,
   that God loves the world; that He looks upon the works of His hands
   with an eternal and stedfast love, with a tender, yearning compassion.
   Whatever be doubtful, this is sure. Light does not pour forth from the
   sun with a fuller and director ray, than does perfect and eternal love
   overflow from the bosom of God upon all the works that He has made. The
   mere fact of creation is a proof of love. "He hateth nothing that He
   hath made." All being is His work, the subject of His power, the object
   of His love. The force of this truth is boundless. It is true that God
   hates sin, and, therefore, whatever in us is sinful; for, so far, we
   have unmade ourselves; we have undone His work; uncreated, so to speak,
   His creation; so far, we are not His creatures; so far, we are under
   the shadow of His wrath. But, as the work of His hands, we are objects
   of a changeless and eternal love. This is a wonderful mystery; a
   contradiction to the guilty consciousness of sinners. In them the
   sinner has absorbed, as it were, the creature of God; and all they feel
   is fear, and a sense of His just aversion. But the everlasting truth
   still stands fast, that God loves us, It is specially declared by our
   Lord, that "God so loved the world," fallen as it is in sin, as to give
   His Son for it. St. John says, that He loved us, though we loved Him
   not: St. Paul, that while enemies He loved us. All this shews that the
   love of God is the sphere in which the world is sustained, and that
   every living soul is encompassed by that love as stars by the firmament
   of heaven.

   And from this blessed truth flows all manner of consolation. Not only
   does God hate sin, but He hates death; not only does He abhor evil, but
   the peril and perdition of so much as one living soul,--of one, even
   the least of all things He has made. The Lord hath sworn by Himself
   saying, "I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth." [196] It
   is as much, nay, far more, against His loving will that we should
   perish than against our own. Let us, then, sum up all our fears,
   terrors, and shrinking, our abhorrence of death, judgment, and eternal
   sorrow, and then know that, while God hates our sins, He abhors our
   death and misery far more than we. What words do we further need to
   assure us that He desires our salvation? What promises do we ask? Why
   do we so far tempt Him as to exact a promise, or to ask a sign? Does a
   child bind his father by promises to give him bread, or a mother to
   foster him in sickness? Do not the instincts of nature suffice, in
   silence, for this perfect trust? Surely the character of God is enough.
   "God is love." What more do we ask? What more would we receive? "He
   cannot deny Himself." And therefore when He was "willing more
   abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of His
   counsel," He "confirmed it by an oath." [197] And "because He could
   swear by no greater, He sware by Himself;" that is, His promise was
   confirmed by His oath, and His oath by Himself; and both His oath and
   His promise returned into His own perfection. "Surely blessing I will
   bless thee." [198]

   But for us God has done still more. He has, besides His promise, found
   a pledge to give us. He has given us "His only begotten Son." Here is
   the very type of absolute love; higher He could not go: for if God
   "spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He
   not with Him also freely give us all things?" [199] Into this mystery
   of Divine love and sacrifice we cannot penetrate. The love of the Holy
   Three, the Blessed One, is a depth before which we can only fall upon
   our face and worship. As if His eternal character were but a small
   thing for our assurance, God has added this further, that He has given
   unto us His Son, "the Son of His love." He gave Him up to suffer all
   humiliation, agony, and death; all that the Divine nature most abhors;
   and He gave Him to be ours in so full a right, that we might offer Him
   as our own in sacrifice for our sins. Here, then, is the first
   foundation, the basis of the spiritual world, in which the new creation
   of God is laid,--the love of God in the gift of His Son. When we are
   overtaken by the fear of death, or the consciousness of sins of which
   we desire to repent, let us first rest ourselves upon the infinite love
   of our Maker. It must be a strong and strange necessity that can thrust
   itself between Him and us; and so contradict the will of both as to
   turn aside His love, and to destroy our soul. "Like as a father pitieth
   his children, even so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him. He knoweth
   our frame; He remembereth that we are but dust." [200] His creative
   love alone would be enough to still our fears, and to shew us that, if
   any perish, it is not because He is austere, but because they are evil.
   The whole will and kingdom of God is love; and to Him, in that kingdom,
   we may come with boldness of hope and trust. How much more now that He
   has revealed His love to be two-fold, in creation and in redemption, by
   first giving us unto Himself, and then by giving unto us His Son; now
   that He is "in Christ," not waiting our overtures of peace, but
   "reconciling the world unto Himself." [201] It is He, the Almighty and
   the offended King, who sends an ambassage of love, lowering Himself to
   be beforehand in the tokens and effusion of His mercy.

   But it is certainly true, that we are not able to stay ourselves on
   this alone. If we were upright as in the beginning, or perfect in our
   conversion, we might need no other consolation; but being, as we are,
   fallen, and soiled, weak, and, at the best, imperfect in repentance, we
   cannot but stretch out our hands for more and more assurances of His
   tender mercy,--of the mercy we need, not as creatures, but as sinners.
   That is to say, we are convinced of it as an object of faith, but we
   are full of misgivings in applying it to our own soul, and to our own
   hope of life. We want something to assure us with a more intimate
   personal conviction. And even this He has given us besides.

   2. For we have, as a second foundation on which to build our trust, the
   love of the Son in giving Himself for us. "Greater love hath no man
   than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." When we
   remember who He is that gave Himself, and for whom, and to die what
   death, we cannot find capacity of heart to receive it. As an
   intellectual statement it is easy to enunciate; but as a moral fact in
   our affections it is hard to realise: so deep is the mystery of love.
   If He had saved us by a new exertion of His creative will, it would
   have been a miracle of lovingkindness. If He had spoken once more the
   first words of power, and created us again in light, it would have been
   a mystery of sovereign grace. If He had redeemed us by the lowliness of
   the Incarnation, still revealing Himself in majesty, though as a man,
   and lightening the earth with His glory, as Saviour, God, and King, it
   would have seemed to us a perfect exhibition of the Divine compassion
   to a sinful world. How much more when He came to suffer shame and
   sorrow, all that flesh and blood can endure, to sink, as it were, into
   the lowest depths of creation, that He might uplift it from its
   farthest fall? There was no creature of God, as a creature, beneath His
   estate. Nothing but sin itself can sink lower than the Son of God. Of
   all men, as man, He was the last; "a worm, and no man; a very scorn of
   men, and the outcast of the people." [202] He came to "lay down His
   life." Even the mystery of the Incarnation, His words of grace, and His
   works of power, were all too unemphatic, too inarticulate, to express
   His love. There was needed something deeper and more awful still.
   "Being in the form of God," He emptied Himself of His glory. His
   Godhead He could not lay aside for us; but He took to Himself
   something--the dearest and most precious to the soul of man--He took
   our nature, and therein a life, the most loved and priceless of all
   gifts of God. There is nothing to be compared with life. We cherish it
   as our very self; it is the centre of every care; the end of all our
   labours. "All that a man hath will he give for his life." [203] Such He
   took unto Himself; and thereby He possessed Himself of something He
   might give for us. "Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay
   down My life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from Me; but
   I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
   to take it again." [204] It was a distinct personal act, a deliberate
   choice, first made in His own will, then followed out in suffering to
   its fulfilment. He had, by the mystery of the Incarnation, obtained a
   price of greatest worth, of which He could strip Himself for our sake,
   ascertaining to us thereby, in some measure, by the scales of a man,
   the love He bare to us.

   If He so loved us as to die for us, what will He not grant or do? If He
   gave His whole self, will He keep back any partial gift? Will He not
   save us, who Himself died for us? If He loved us when we loved Him not,
   will He not love us, now that we desire to love Him again? If He gave
   Himself for us when we were in sin, will He not hear us now that by Him
   we are regenerate? Notwithstanding all our manifold provocations, yet
   if He offered Himself for those who were impenitent, He will surely
   listen to us now that we grieve at the wounds wherewith we have pierced
   Him; now that we count ourselves among His scourges, mockeries, and
   thorns. Well might St. Paul call it "the love of Christ which passeth
   knowledge;" well might he pray for the illumination of the Holy Ghost,
   that we might "comprehend with all saints what is the length, and
   breadth, and depth, and height" of the mystery of the Cross, its
   eternity, its infinite embrace, its fulness, and its perfection. When
   sin and conscience overwhelm us, here is our pledge of pardon. No man
   ever loved us as He. Neither friend nor brother, father nor mother,
   sister nor child, none ever loved us with such intense, changeless,
   discerning love. Sinners though we be, we may say, "None ever so loved
   me--not for what is in me--not for any love of mine--not for any mutual
   joy--but for my own sake, because I am a living soul, created in His
   own image, capable of eternal weal or woe. He loves me, not for what I
   am, but in spite of what I am. He has loved me always, and loves me
   still; and to that love I go, as to a supernatural mercy, to a
   miraculous pity, to a divine compassion. He will not cast me out, much
   less will He cut me off, if at least an almighty justice can save my
   soul alive."

   And this touches upon the quick of our fear. Loving, pitiful, and
   tender, He is also holy, pure, and just. It may be, you are saying to
   yourself, "Though He gave even His own life to reveal His love and
   desire to save us, am I such that He can save while He is also just and
   pure? My sins have created a necessity that, if He cannot shew mercy,
   He must be just. Guilt and soils cannot enter the kingdom of God; and I
   have both. I do not mistrust His love; for "greater love hath no man
   than this;" and He has given me His pledge, even His very life. But I
   fear the eternal necessities of justice, and the sinfulness which has
   clung to me since the first awakening of power and will.

   3. Now it is specially against this deepest fear of the soul--this only
   fear, for none can really doubt His perfect love--that He has given us
   an absolute assurance. He has laid a foundation which cannot be
   moved--His own death for us upon the Cross. Hitherto we have looked
   upon it only as a revelation of Divine love to us; now let us look upon
   it as a Divine atonement for our sin. How it is so, we may not eagerly
   search to know. That by death He has destroyed "him that had the power
   of death," [205] and taken "away the sin of the world," is enough. In
   that death were united the oblation of a Divine person and the sanctity
   of a sinless man; the perfection of a holy will and the fulfilment of a
   spotless life; the willing sacrifice of the sinless for the sinful, of
   the shepherd for the sheep that was lost, of life for the dead. How
   this wrought atonement for the sin of the world, we cannot say further
   than is revealed. God "made Him to be sin for us." [206] "He bare our
   sins in His own body on the tree." "By His stripes we are healed." How
   the guiltless could take the place of the guilty; how the penalty due
   to our sin could be laid on any but ourselves, above all, on One who
   was sinless; and how such a translation of punishment could also
   translate us from the throng of the guilty to the company of the
   guiltless; how the eternal Righteousness has been pleased to unite this
   atonement to His own changeless severity; how the iron link between sin
   and death has been broken through, and the power of both
   abolished,--and all this at once, by the death of a Divine and sinless
   Person,--must, at least in this our wayfaring on earth, be a mystery
   unsearchable, and a depth past finding out. We may, perhaps, be
   admitted within the veil in the heavenly kingdom; we may behold this
   secret of eternal justice in the vision of peace. But in this life, it
   is enough for us to know that He hath tasted "death for every man;"
   that "there is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus."

   Deeply convinced as we are of this corner-stone of truth, we are still
   only able to realise it in part. The consciousness of personal guilt,
   both original and actual, the sense of indwelling and habitual
   sinfulness, makes us to shrink even in the presence of the Cross; as if
   by it the sin of all the world were taken away except our own. We are
   wont to say, "If I had not this consciousness, I would firmly trust
   that my sin is also taken away. But this consciousness cries out, and
   clamours against my intellectual convictions. My spiritual nature
   contradicts this flattery, and forbids me to rest upon a truth of the
   abstract reason."

   Now what does this mean? It is, in truth, as much as to say: "I would
   trust in the death of Christ, if like Him I were without sin." Or, "I
   would trust, if sin were first so wholly cleansed away from me, that in
   all my consciousness there remained no memorial of the fall." What is
   this but a virtual rejection of the atonement, that is, of a sacrifice
   for sinners? What is it but unbelief to say: "I would trust in it, if I
   had no need of it; but because I am conscious of the need, 1 dare not,
   or I will not?" What does this mean but, "If I had no need, I would
   therefore trust" (having then no need to trust at all); "but because I
   need, I dare not," that is, "I have no faith?" Surely this is the very
   crisis between the religion of nature, which teaches no fall and no
   atonement, and the Gospel of life, of which sin and the sacrifice of
   Christ are the beginning and the end. Therefore, in one word, the
   reason why we may,--nay must, cast ourselves upon the atonement of His
   death, is this same consciousness of sin, which crushes us to the dust.
   To whom else shall we go? To what power in heaven or earth, to what
   purging fires, to what healing streams? "If I ascend up into heaven,
   Thou art there; if I go down into hell, Thou art there also." We cannot
   fly from Him: we cannot fly from ourselves. The sin that is in us
   cleaves to our very life. Where we go, it goes; when we lie down, it
   broods upon us; all day long it wakes with us, all night through it
   moves with our sleeping thoughts; it follows us as the shadow of our
   being; and its blackness always lies full length upon our hearts. Such
   we are, and must be, till He change us; and as such, we must go up to
   the foot of the Cross, and fall down, and hold fast by His pierced
   Feet. Just such as we are we must go: though it is all the more fearful
   as it is the more blessed: the more we need that atonement, the more we
   must shrink as we draw near to it. But He will suffer us to make no
   terms, nor compromises; to prescribe no conditions on which we will
   believe ourselves to be forgiven. He will have faith, undoubting,
   unreasoning, simple,--childlike, hopeful, loving faith. Do we, then,
   know so much better than He the necessities of the eternal world, the
   prerogatives of His own kingdom, the harmony of His attributes, the due
   measure of His holiness, the glory of His throne; that we will not
   accept our pardon on such unequal terms? Do we so far better know than
   He what is our own state before Him, that we may put His atonement by;
   as self-trusting patients analyse the skill of their physician? What He
   would have, is not the sight of our eyes, nor the discernment of our
   wit, nor the measures of our intellect; but the affiance of our will,
   and the trust of our hearts. It is the very trial of faith, as much to
   contradict within its own sphere the doubts of our natural
   consciousness, as the impressions of our natural sense. If "we walk by
   faith, not by sight;" [207] much more are we saved by faith, not by the
   sensations of a fallen nature.

   But here an objection may be made,--of great weight, if well founded;
   and of apparent weight, ill founded as it is,--namely, that
   consciousness is the reflection of conscience, and that conscience is a
   guide given us by God. And as we cannot put two divine gifts in
   contradiction, we therefore cannot put faith against a conscience which
   convinces us of sin.

   Now to this we must answer, strangely to the ears of some, that we must
   not, and yet that we must so contradict ourselves. And with a few words
   of explanation we will make an end.

   1. First, then, it is clear, that we must not putt! faith in
   contradiction to our consciousness of sin, if by that we mean a
   sentence of our heart, convicting us of any wilful sin. In this sense,
   conscience and consciousness are one and the same; conscience implying
   the judicial sentence of the soul upon itself, and consciousness, the
   diffused sense of its own condemnation. When we can find in ourselves
   sins wilfully committed, and not repented of, or sins wilfully repeated
   after repentance, whether they be grosser and less frequent, or more
   refined and of habitual commission; or if we know within ourselves,
   that we are living without any true relation to the presence of God;
   consenting in the evil and darkness of our hearts; cold and dead in our
   religious affections; formal and lifeless in prayer; without
   humiliation, self-discipline, self-knowledge; without thought of death
   and of God;--if this or any such state be our settled and habitual
   condition in His sight, then without doubt, it is mere antinomianism,
   or presumption, or blindness of heart, to talk of faith in the
   atonement of Christ. "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
   When the moral and spiritual nature is so estranged from God, so
   severed and deadened,--I may say, so opposed and hostile to the Divine
   holiness, love, and will,--it is worse than self-deceit to talk of
   resting upon the death of Christ. This is most certain, and can never
   be too often or too strongly repeated, This describes the character of
   wilful sinners, open or secret, worldly and unconverted souls;
   pharisees, hypocrites, sluggards, self-deceivers, and the like. But
   surely it is no discovery to find out that such as these can, in that
   state, put no trust in the blood of the Cross. When really sifted to
   the bottom then, the objection means nothing more than this: "Why call
   ye Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" "A man may say,
   Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works,
   and I will shew thee my faith by my works. But wilt thou know, O vain
   man, that faith without works is dead?" "What doth it profit, though a
   man say he hath faith, and have not works; can faith save him?" "Faith,
   if it have not works, is dead." [208] In this sense, then, let it be
   said, with all words and tones of warning, that the love of God, and of
   Christ, and His precious death upon the Cross, are all in vain to the
   man who is conscious of wilful and unrepented sin.

   2. But, lastly, there is a sense most true and most blessed, in which
   we not only may, but must rest by faith in the death of Christ, in
   despite of our consciousness of sin; and that is, when that
   consciousness is a memory of sins, wilful indeed in time past, but
   repented now, or committed through weakness, with instant sorrow, and
   against our habitual will. For what is this but the state of every true
   penitent, or of every just man not yet made perfect? If such Christians
   as these may not trust themselves to the atoning death of Christ, the
   Cross must stand deserted and fruitless as a dry and barren tree. What
   are penitents but those in whom memory, imagination, thoughts,
   tumultuous emotions, vehement drawings of the will, and struggles of
   the heart against the conscience, cloud and disturb the consciousness
   of the soul? They are haunted by a sense of the presence of sin, and
   yet "who shall separate" them "from the love of Christ?" Nay, what is
   the condition of those who have long been converted to God but one of
   warfare, of frequent self-accusation, and of trembling self-mistrust?
   Take the most watchful and stedfast of God's servants, and ask whether
   his consciousness is so clear and cloudless, that he can therefore,
   without a fear, apply to himself the sacrifice of the Cross. "To which
   of the saints wilt thou turn?" Ask of the chosen vessel, the elect
   apostle. "I know nothing by (that is, of, or against) myself; yet am I
   not hereby justified. But He that judgeth me is the Lord."1 Cor. iv.
   Even he must say, "I count not myself to have apprehended;" and, "if by
   any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead." [209] It
   is, then, most true that no one may deceive himself by trusting in the
   death of Christ, so long as his conscience condemns him of wilful sin;
   hut it is equally and as absolutely true, that no man can rest his
   trust in that atonement upon the possession of a sinless consciousness.
   The grace of faith is a gift specially meted out to the necessity of
   those who are in neither of these states; but in that middle condition
   in which a heart, sincerely converted, clings with all its grasp to the
   atonement of the Cross. This is its only safety against the malignity
   of the devil, the power of temptation, the infirmity of our manhood,
   and the flexible treachery of our own will. The full, perfect, and
   sufficient sacrifice of the Cross is the only stay of the soul, from
   the hour of its sincere conversion to the change which shall make us to
   be "pure even as He is pure." Let us, therefore, guard with all
   watchfulness and prayer against every consent of the heart in any thing
   of evil. Let us withdraw ourselves by the whole power of our will,
   through the help of the Holy Spirit, from all communion with "the lust
   of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." What then
   may come upon us is from without. It is not our sin, but our scourge;
   permitted to try and to humble us. Even though we fall, as saints have
   fallen, yet let us not cast away our trust. When trust is gone, hope is
   dead; and where there is no hope, there can be no repentance: for where
   there is no love, there can be no contrition; and love cannot survive
   the death of hope; for the loss of hope is despair, that is, the fear
   of certain perdition, "the fearful looking for of fiery indignation."
   Therefore it is that Satan strives above all to destroy in us the power
   of faith, hope, and love,--the three blessed gifts of grace infused by
   the Holy Ghost in our regeneration. If these can be destroyed, and
   their spiritual antagonists implanted and matured in the soul, it
   matters not what we profess or practise. The revealed object and the
   productive source of these three virtues of the Spirit is the atonement
   of the Cross. Let us hold fast by this; and they will be replenished by
   a perpetual effluence of His Divine love, streaming into our souls, and
   drawing them back, as by a tide, unto Himself. He has so united us unto
   Himself, that when He died for all, we died together with Him; and
   because He liveth, we shall live also. His life and His death are
   inseparably ours. Death has done its worst against us already upon the
   Cross. And "our life is hid with Christ in God." Let us, then, strive
   to say to our own heart, in the words of a saint now in His kingdom:
   "While there is life in thee, in this death alone place all thy trust;
   confide in nothing else besides; to this death commit thyself
   altogether; with this, shelter thy whole self; with this death array
   thyself from head to foot. And if the Lord thy God will judge thee,
   say, Lord, between Thy judgment and me I cast the death of our Lord
   Jesus Christ; no otherwise can I contend with Thee. And if He say to
   thee, Thou art a sinner; say, Lord, I stretch forth the death of our
   Lord Jesus Christ between my sins and Thee. If He say, Thou art worthy
   of condemnation; say, Lord, I set the death of our Lord Jesus Christ
   between my evil deserts and Thee, and His merits I offer for those
   merits which I ought to have, but have not of my own. If He say that He
   is wroth with thee; say, Lord, I lift up the death of our Lord Jesus
   Christ between Thy wrath and me." [210] Let this be our confidence. The
   love of God in Christ; the love of Christ in dying; the death of Christ
   upon the Cross; lifted up for us; a perpetual sacrifice; one, spotless,
   all-prevailing; ever fresh, ever full of life; infinite in price,
   virtue, and power. In life and death, in our last agony, in the day of
   judgment, be this our only stay, our hope, our all.

SERMON XIX.

  THE TEARFULNESS OF DEATH.

    PSALM lv. 4.

   "My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen
   upon me."

   IN the version of the Psalter used in the Prayer-book, this verse
   stands with a more homely and expressive simplicity, "My heart is
   disquieted within me, and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
   Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and an horrible dread hath
   overwhelmed me." The fear of death is upon all flesh. It is no sign of
   manhood to be without it. To overcome it in the way of duty is courage;
   to meet death with patience is faith; but not to fear it is either a
   gift of special grace or a dangerous insensibility. No doubt great
   saints have been able to say, "I have a desire to depart." And many
   have rushed to martyrdom, as to the love and bosom of their Lord: but
   for the rest, the multitude of His flock, who are neither wilful
   sinners, nor to be numbered among saints, the thought of death is a
   thought of fear. We see that on the first feeling of their having so
   much as set foot in the path leading to the grave, even good men feel
   the "terror of death,"--"a horrible dread," which makes every pulse to
   beat with a hurried and vehement speed. Their whole nature, both in
   body and in soul, trembles to its very centre; and their heart is
   "disquieted," "sore pained," within them.

   Now why is this? Let us try to analyse the feelings which swell so
   tumultuously, and to separate them into their distinct elements; that
   is, let us see what are the causes or reasons of this "fear of death."

   1. The first must needs be a consciousness of personal sinfulness. A
   sense of unfitness to meet God, our unreadiness to die, a multitude of
   personal faults, evil tempers, thoughts, and inclinations; the
   recollection of innumerable sins, of great omissions and lukewarmness
   in all religious duties, the little love or gratitude we have to God,
   and the great imperfection of our repentance;--all these make us
   tremble at the thought of going to give up our account. We feel as if
   it were impossible we could be saved. Shame, fear, and "a horrible
   dread" fall upon us. It is n answer to this to say, "We are not saved
   our own righteousness, but by the righteousness of Christ. We must look
   not at ourselves but at Him." This is as true in the abstract as it may
   be untrue in the application. We must look to ourselves, when we would
   know whether we may so forget ourselves; for He Himself has said, "Not
   every one that saith unto Me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
   of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven."
   [211] It is but an empty saying of "Lord, Lord," to talk of faith, and
   trust, and the like, without a real living belief in Him; and this is
   to be known and tested by the facts of our life. The only cognisable
   form of faith is obedience; and alas for us, if we trust to it in any
   other shape. It is said that Satan, who can transform himself into an
   angel of light, has before now come to tempt men in many seeming
   appearances of Christ. But he never has shewn himself as upon the
   Cross. This one aspect is to him impossible, because it is divine and
   true. So it is with faith. We may be tempted by a faith of the reason,
   a faith of the imagination, a faith of pious desires, and a faith of
   good intentions. And all these may be no more than snares. But a faith
   embodied in obedience is Divine faith, which Satan cannot feign, and by
   this none can be deceived.

   How few, then, when they are called suddenly to make ready, can say
   that their faith has been a life of holy obedience. For the most of us,
   we must confess that our sins are "more in number than the sand of the
   sea." How, then, can we think of death without fear? whither, and to
   what doom would it carry us away?

   It is very easy to talk theologically (and, therefore, in one sense
   truly) on the subject of our acceptance through the blood of the Cross;
   but examine your hearts at the time when you begin to realise the
   thought of being judged before God (how soon or when, you cannot tell),
   and say whether, after all, there is not a feeling of most just and
   reasonable fear, of which you could not divest your mind, without also
   putting off a part of your regenerate nature. Let any man say to
   himself, "I am now going to be judged before God;" and if he knows and
   believes the meaning of his words, it is impossible he should be
   without alarm. Let him say, "Now all my whole life must return upon me,
   as the consciousness of one moment. Childhood, boyhood, youth, manhood,
   with all their remembered sins, and, still more awful, with all their
   sins now forgotten." What can be more alarming than the thought that
   the perpetual waste of memory is more profuse in nothing than in the
   remembrance of daily and hourly sins? Who knows what, after his
   often-repeated confessions, may still be against him? We shall know it
   all when we shall see God, and in Him see ourselves; but then will be
   the time not of repentance, but of judgment. How often do we discover
   some little danger, of which we are afraid, while others discern some
   much greater peril, of which we are altogether fearless. How often, in
   a sickness, people alarm themselves with trifling symptoms, or take
   full and confident hope at trifling amendments, when some vast and
   prominent danger, unperceived by themselves, stares every body else in
   the face. So it may be with our souls. We see some of our sins; we take
   comfort at marks of a better mind; but sins black, countless, and
   forgotten, are bare to the eyes of God, and of His holy angels. This,
   then, is one great reason for fear; and this explains the common
   saying, founded on a various reading of the first verse of the ninth
   chapter of Ecclesiastes, that "no man knows whether he is worthy of
   love or hatred;" that is, at most, he knows his own case so little,
   that after all his hope and trust in God's mercy through Christ, he
   cannot shake off a fear that he may, in the light of God's presence,
   see himself to be very different from what he believes now. No one can
   have used habitual self-examination, or watched the treacherous
   uncertainty of his memory, or measured the growth of his convictions of
   sin, without deeply mistrusting, at every stage, his knowledge of
   himself; and feeling it very possible that he may see himself before
   the throne of Christ to be as far different from what he thinks now, as
   he sees himself now to be from what he once thought before his
   conversion, or in the beginnings of his religious life.

   2. Another reason, closely following upon the last, is the
   consciousness that death is judgment. At the death of each several
   being, a particular judgment upon the soul is passed and recorded
   before God. Wherefore in the thought of death, there is an awful sense
   that all is over, all is run out, wound up, sealed, stamped, and bound
   over for eternity: that all the predestination of God towards us is
   fulfilled; that life is spent, regeneration has been conferred upon us,
   with all holy inspirations of truth and grace, and all discipline of
   Providence and probation; that all which was once possible has now
   become either actual or impossible; that we have had our time and
   trial; and that, for weal or for woe, our eternal state is fixed for
   ever. There is something sorrowful and moving in the full end of any
   thing. It is sad to know for certain that we shall never go to any
   particular place again; never again see this or that person, do such or
   such definite act, or hear a certain strain of music, and the like.
   Even the end of a hard toil is mixed with sadness. The words "no more,"
   "never again," are severe and melancholy; as they know, above all, who
   have wept over their dead: though with them, if they be Christ's, such
   words are false, yet the thought of a full end, as if something were
   extinct for ever, is very sad. It clashes with the first instinct of
   our being. How much more when that which is over is the day of grace,
   the acceptable year of the Lord? No more hopes and restings on a future
   amendment; no more trust, half-blind, of a more devoted life; no more
   feasts or fasts; no more sacraments of cleansing; no more worship and
   adoration; no more secret abasement in the sanctuary; no more sacrifice
   and communion at the altar; no more words of hope, encouragement, and
   comfort; no more warnings, discipline, and chastisement; all the whole
   life of grace, with all the ministries of the Church, and all the
   loving expostulations of God, have been fully tried, exhausted, and,
   for us, brought to a full end for ever. Such as we are, such we shall
   be eternally.

   And when this end is come, and the revelation of our doom is as yet
   uncertain, how can we but say, "Oh, if I had known, even I, at least in
   this my day, the things which belong unto my peace; if only a little
   earlier, what sins should I have avoided; if only I had taken this
   warning or that counsel; if only I had been more fearful, more fervent,
   more sincere: but now, such as I am, such I must go, with all these
   shreds and weeds of misery,--a memory laden with sins, a soul darkened
   by itself, and a heart beating itself asunder for fear. No time now; I
   am on my way to God. His bidding has overtaken me in my present
   disorder, full of active thought of ten thousand cares, under which the
   consciousness of His presence and will lies buried. I am going to hear
   that one great revelation which, to me, is heaven or hell." This ought
   surely to abate the confidence with which people talk of dying; not
   fearing to die, because not knowing what death is. What is it but the
   absolute fulfilment either of God's will in our salvation, or of our
   own will, if sinful, in our perdition? What is it but either the
   sealing of a saint, or the branding of a reprobate soul?

   3. Thus far I have spoken only of the fears which arise from the
   departure of the soul. There is also in the body a reason for fearing
   death. The thought of pain and distress is very searching. Bodily pain
   is hard to bear. It is a fearful mystery. What is it? and whence does
   it come? God did not make pain. It is no part of the first creation,
   neither has it any place in the second. There was no pain in the world
   which He blessed in the beginning. His works were all good, and good
   only. But among the hosts of evil, pain is one of the foremost. It is
   the direct forerunner of death, and the scourge of hell. It so
   penetrates the whole of our being, that when it enters one part, it is
   felt throughout the entire reach of our consciousness: whether it be
   pain of the body or of the soul, it has the intensity of a focus, with
   an universality which knows no limit but our sensation. Who, then, can
   but fear the pains of death? Who can but tremble at the thought of an
   unseen and mysterious power entering, against our will, into the depths
   of our nature, and wasting the source of life? Pain is, in fact, the
   presence of death: and the only question is one of measure and time,
   that is, how soon it shall put forth its whole strength, and appear in
   its full array. It is a terrible thought to forebode the withering and
   corrupting of the body. All men must have a last sickness, which, when
   once begun, either is soon ended, or else keeps on its stubborn and
   stealthy way, in spite of the skill and science of healing. It is like
   a smouldering fire, which, when it breaks out, is for a while got
   under, and yet by suppression is but thrown in, to spread more widely
   and deeply than before. So death creeps on, under a fair aspect, till
   it has gained its entire hold; then it unmasks itself and reigns
   supreme. We may well shrink from the thought of helpless and motionless
   distress, palsied limbs, clouded eyes, broken speech, unsteady
   thoughts, and an impotent will. Such are the tokens of death in its
   short dominion. Who does not shrink from being that from which he has
   shrunk upon another's deathbed? It is a bitter humiliation, with a
   living consciousness, to be changed into corruption; and to lie under
   the eyes of bystanders as a thing to be talked of and endured.

   4. Again, there is another reason which is full of melancholy. Death is
   the end of a multitude of pure and blessed enjoyments. "A pleasant
   thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun." [212] Fallen as this world
   is, it is very beautiful. The sky and the earth, lights and clouds,
   colours and brightness, the lofty mountains, the teeming earth, the
   rank rich valleys, "the streams that run among the hills," evening and
   morning, the long shadows of the east and west, the song of birds, and
   the voice of all things living these are blessed and soothing; much
   more the softness, peace, and loveliness which is shed abroad upon the
   earthly homes of those that fear God; fond affections, close
   friendships, bonds of gratitude; the joy of receiving, the blessedness
   of bestowing alms and kindness: but above all these, the bonds and
   order of mystical charity between pastor and flock, friends in the
   fellowship of God, between guests at the same altar, penitents and
   their guides, mourners and the messengers of consolation--all these
   make up an inner world of beauty fairer than the fairest aspect of this
   outward creation. We may a little understand what St. Paul meant when
   he said, "What mean ye to weep and to break my heart;" and what they
   felt who "sorrowed most of all for the word which he spake, that they
   should see his face no more." [213]

   Feeble and earthly as we are, the love of earthly friends, and the
   company of others as weak, or weaker than ourselves, is very soothing.
   We bear each other's burdens, are blind to each other's faults; we make
   , allowances, give dispensations, lower ourselves to each other's
   weakness, and create a sort of unexacting, compassionate world, in
   which we help and soothe each other's sorrows and infirmities. This is
   wonderfully healing and grateful to our hearts when they are wounded,
   or bowed down, or galled by a sense of our own evils. We take refuge in
   each other, and in each other, for a while, forget ourselves. Even
   sorrows become sources of consolation, by unsealing the deepest
   affections, and laying foundations for the closest sympathies. All
   things bind together those that love God. Good things by the attraction
   of goodness; evil things by the force of evil. And the presence of God
   on earth, in which they "live and move and have their being," makes the
   very element of being, motion, and life to be one in all. Now, unless a
   man be dead to the world with the deadness of a solitary, he must feel
   these strong bonds of love; these links of our common humanity,
   purified by the Incarnation, that is, the sympathy of the mystical body
   of Christ. Even the professedly religious, though separate from all the
   world beside, are bound to their brotherhood with a peculiar intimacy
   and power of love. Indeed, as men become dead to the world at large,
   these inner bonds of love become more intense. In one sense, life has
   more blessedness in it to those who are most dead to its allurements.
   That is to say, it is that very deadness which makes their perception
   of what is of God in the communion of the faithful so sensitive and
   keen.

   Here, then, is another reason why Christians cannot but fear death. It
   strips them of a multitude of well-known, long-tried, and familiar
   joys. When they feel their summons, they begin to look abroad, and to
   call up round about them all the persons and the faces in whom they
   delight; the seasons of holy fellowship, whether in joy or sorrow, the
   mutual service of love, the acts and the thoughts of united worship, of
   solace, aspiration, and hope.

   There is something cheerless and solitary in the thought of going out
   from this home of their spiritual life, and faring forth, one by one,
   into the valley of the shadow of death. The thought of such perfect
   isolation is full of awe. I am, of course, speaking only of the world
   we leave, not that to which we go, of which it will be time to speak
   hereafter. We know our present state, with all its sorrows and trials,
   to be blessed and soothing. We know not to what we may be going. This
   state is certain; that, to us, uncertain. And to let go all our certain
   enjoyments which have supported us these many long years, from our
   earliest consciousness, through every trial of life--to go out, as it
   were, from our kindred and our father's house all alone into the
   uncertain shadows of the grave, is mournful and amazing. It appeals
   peculiarly to what is human in us, to the vivid emotions and sensations
   of earthly though purified hearts; they still sympathise with life and
   its imperfect realities, with its sensible beauty and its visible
   affections. This is another reason why the approach of death comes with
   terror even upon religious minds.

   5. And, lastly, it may be objected, that in what has just been said,
   the thought of the rest and bliss of heaven ought not to have been
   excluded. It may be said, Why dwell on the beauty of earth, when the
   departing are on their way to the glory of heaven? Why speak of earthly
   affection and peace, when they are advancing to the love and rest of
   God? Why of loneliness, when to depart is to be with Christ and all His
   saints? The reasons are two: first, because whatever judgment may
   result by comparing them together, it is nevertheless certain that the
   earthly state is in itself absolutely and positively an object of love.
   For instance, what dying father ever left wife and children without a
   sensible sorrow? Even St. Paul said, "I have a desire to depart and to
   be with Christ, which is far better; nevertheless to abide in the flesh
   is more needful for you."

   But the other and the truer reason is this, that the reality of the
   eternal world is so severe and high, that, blessed though it be, it is
   in itself a thought of awe, from which, while we desire it, we cannot
   but also shrink.

   Let any one try to realise what it would be, in any solitary place, as
   in a twilight church, or at any late hour, as in the night, when he is
   in prayer with every desire and thought of his heart in its most fixed
   intention,--let him conceive before him the form of Him who came and
   stood in the midst when the doors were shut, or the presence of an holy
   angel, or the countenance of the most beloved among departed saints;
   even though such a vision should approach with all the tokens of
   tender, compassionate love, with the condescensions and humiliations of
   a Divine pity, would it not smite us to the earth as dead? Such a
   meeting of our earthly consciousness with their exalted spirit would
   almost break down the powers of the mind and of life. What, then, must
   be that change, when the eyes which close upon nurses and weeping
   friends, and the ministries of pity, shall open upon an "innumerable
   company of angels," the "Church of the first-born which are written in
   heaven, and God the Judge of all?" We may trust that in the passage,
   God, through His tenderness, will endow the soul with a firmness of
   spiritual sight and being which shall endure the revelation of majesty
   and glory. But judging, as we must, by the conditions and presumptions
   of our present consciousness, we must be penetrated with a sense of the
   unutterable dread which must attend on such a transit. Blessed as these
   things are in themselves, they are blessed only to those who are in a
   spiritual capacity to perceive and embrace their blessedness. And is
   this our state? On what do we found our belief that we are meet for
   this vision of eternal light? Surely, if we know ourselves, and the
   clinging sympathies with which we hold to the infirmities of life, we
   must confess that nothing but new spiritual endowments will suffice to
   sustain us under this effluence of the Divine glory. In saying this,
   nothing is detracted from the love, tenderness, compassion of our
   Divine Lord, and of God, who is love. I am speaking only of that
   Majesty before which the beloved disciple fell as dead; of the
   unimaginable awe with which even the least of all saints and the last
   of the angelic hosts would strike us. How much more the whole hierarchy
   of heaven, the gathered election of God's people, the visible presence
   of the Word made flesh, the uncreated splendour of the Godhead?

   These seem to be some of the reasons why the thought of dying is so
   alarming at first to all. Can it be otherwise when you are brought to
   say, "Now it is my turn; now He has sent for me; now all my life is at
   a stand; all things fall off from me as if they had nothing in me; I
   seem to stand alone, and no one can come near me; the kindest friend
   cannot so much as touch me now; my soul has withdrawn itself out of his
   reach into my inmost self; and there is only one thought upon which I
   can throw myself, and that is, the love of God in His Son Jesus Christ.
   My sinfulness overwhelms me; I am full of fear that I have been
   flattering myself, and that my soul in God's sight has ten thousand
   stains where I see one; that where I remember ten, I have forgotten ten
   thousand times ten thousand. But now the time of repentance and
   self-chastisement is over: all that can be done for eternity is done
   for ever; and on the strength of this most imperfect preparation, I
   must go and hear the sentence of my everlasting lot. It is fearful to
   lie down upon a death-bed, and to give up myself to the power of
   corruption. Who knows what may be the last straits and anguish of my
   passage? Even He who gave Himself for me shrunk from the sharpness of
   death. I have a baptism to be baptised with; and how am I straitened
   till it be accomplished.' Moreover, it is sad to go alone from all I
   hold so dear; and my whole soul shrinks from the realities of the world
   unseen. To dust and ashes, to a worm, and a sinner, such as I, it is
   terrible to die. My heart is disquieted within me, and the fear of
   death hath fallen upon me.'";

   I do not know that there is either religion or safety in trying to
   throw off such thoughts as these. They are plainly real and true. They
   are evidently founded both on revelation and on the consciousness of
   our regenerate nature. Their office is, to penetrate us with a holy
   fear, which is akin to abasement, to pure and humble confession, to
   devout and earnest prayer, and to a repentance both perfect in its
   extent, and fervent in its spirit. On this fear of death is raised the
   best and surest preparation for our last passage. The more we feel it,
   the more we realise in truth the change that is before us. Above all
   things, then, let us avoid false comforts, which excite the heart, and
   make the pulses beat for a while with a fictitious hope. Let us avoid
   all high feelings, and attempts to persuade ourselves that we are what
   we are not; that God is not what He is; and that the first meeting of a
   sinner with Him can be any thing but awful. If there is one thing more
   essential than any other to deep repentance, true peace, and to a holy
   death, it is perfect truth, perfect reality in these first perceptions.
   They are surely gifts of God, issuing out of the dictates and
   discernment of our spiritual consciousness. Let us thoroughly receive
   them into our heart; and though they brood in darkness, from the sixth
   hour unto the ninth, over the whole face of our soul, we may be sure,
   without a wavering of doubt, that in His good time we shall, through
   the darkness, see the Cross, and upon it the Son of God, pierced for
   us, our spotless sacrifice, our perfect atonement with the Father.

SERMON XX.

  THE BLESSEDNESS OF DEATH.

    PHILIPPIANS i. 23.

   "I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with
   Christ, which is far better."

   LET us never forget whose words these were, and what he was who spoke
   them. They are the words of a saint and an apostle, at the end of a
   long life of love and patience for Christ's sake. After he had suffered
   the loss of all things,--name, honour, reputation, friends, rest, and
   home,--and for thirty years had borne stonings and the scourge,
   shipwreck and the daily peril of death, he could well say, "I have a
   desire to depart." With a great sum obtained he this freedom. It is
   well to remember this, that we be not either cast down at our conscious
   inability to speak as he did, or, what would be much worse, tempted to
   use such words too soon. For us humbler thoughts are more in keeping.
   Nevertheless, the same desire which was so ardent in him may be kindled
   in our hearts. If we cannot burn with love, the flax may at least
   smoke. In our shallow capacity, and at a distance not to be measured,
   we may desire with fear what he yearned for with such unclouded
   longings. His desire is, at least, to us an example of what ours ought
   to be; and as such we may set it before us as a pattern.

   With this view, then, let us consider what are the reasons for this
   desire. They must needs be quick and powerful, not only to cast out the
   fear of death, but to change it into aspiration. And in so doing, we
   will take, not the special reasons peculiar to martyrs and apostles,
   but such as are universal, and within the spiritual reach of all who
   are born again through Christ.

   Why, then, should departure out of this life be an object of desire to
   a Christian?

   1. First, because it is a full release from this evil world. There is
   something very expressive in the word we here render by depart.' It
   means the being set free, after the breaking up of some long restraint;
   or the unyoking of the oxen wearied with the plough; or the weighing
   again of our anchors for a homeward voyage. On every side its
   associations are full of peace and rest. What can better express the
   passage of Christ's servants from this tumultuous and weary world? The
   longer we dwell in it, the more cause we must see to shrink from its
   temptations. I speak not only of sickness and pain, of crosses and
   hardship, bereavements and afflictions, and the bitterness of
   adversity; these are sensible evils, which all men desire to be rid of.
   Sometimes they even revile their tardy life, because they are impatient
   of the rod. To be free from all trial would be indeed blessed. But
   these are not the things which make true Christians desire to depart.
   They look on them as part of their Master's Cross, and count themselves
   happy to bear so much as its shadow. Their true affliction is the
   presence of sin; its fiery assaults without, its alluring subtilty
   within.

   Is it not wonderful that men who immoderately fear death, should have
   no fears of life? To die, is in the last degree alarming to many; but
   to live, is as free from alarm as if it were impossible to fall from
   God. This shews us how little we realise the world in which we are, and
   the sin which dwells in our hearts. Is it possible that we can be so
   blind to the snares which are on every side? Are the nets of the fowler
   so frail that we have no fear of them, or so fine that we cannot see
   where they lie? Is it not certain that no man can promise to himself
   the gift of perseverance; and that all his life long, the enmity of the
   world, the flesh, and the devil, "the blast of the terrible ones, is as
   a storm against the wall?" [214] Do we not console fathers and mothers
   who weep over the early death of children, by telling them that their
   young spirits are sainted, and that God has, in mercy, come between
   them and the defilements of this naughty world? We bid them remember,
   that in a few short years those they mourn might have lost their
   baptismal innocence, and sullied their fresh purity of heart. We bid
   them be consoled because now they know that their loved ones are safe,
   following "the Lamb whithersoever He goeth;" and God alone could
   foresee what might have been the career and end of a longer life. And
   what does all this mean but that this is a perilous world and full of
   evil? Who, then, shall dare not to fear it? Who can say into what he
   may fall, or how he may be led astray; how he may fall into the snare
   of the enemy, or under the illusions of his own mind? what declensions,
   what spiritual deteriorations may wither us from the very root? Indeed,
   we shall not be safe if we leave off to fear any peril to the salvation
   of the soul. So long as we are in this warfare, we must be open to the
   shafts of evil; and who would not desire a shelter where no arrows can
   reach us any more? What must be the peace of having put off this
   mystery of probation; when the struggle and the strife shall be over,
   and breathless, panting hope, dashed by ten thousand fears, shall be
   changed into a certainty of peace, into a foretaste of our crown! This
   one thought alone is enough to make death blessed. Let us muse, as we
   say to ourselves, "I shall then be landed on the everlasting shore, no
   more again to fear any fall from God. All will be changeless and
   eternal." Nay, putting all this aside, who will not yearn to be free
   from the disorder and contradiction of a world that has rebelled
   against God, and "crucified the Lord of glory?" Is this a home for any
   soul that is united with Him in love? So long as He wills, it is our
   home, not of choice but of obedience, not of desire but of patience.
   Our Lord has said, "I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the
   world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil." So long as He
   wills, we remain content.

   But it is an awful sentence: "Every man that will live godly in Christ
   Jesus shall suffer persecution." This is to tell us that the world is
   unchangeably at enmity with God. A man need only declare himself on
   God's side, to bring the world upon him. But even this power and
   kingdom of the devil is our discipline of patience and perfection, of
   suffering and submission. It is the school of martyrs and of saints.
   Nevertheless, to depart from it, by the will of God, is blessed. And
   besides all this, what is our life on earth at best, but a life of
   clouds and shifting lights; that is, of trust, and faith in mysteries,
   of which we see only the outer surface? A veil is spread over the face
   even of the Church, through which the realities of the hereafter are
   faintly discerned. There is, indeed, a special benediction on all who
   believe without seeing; and yet the blessing is still greater of those
   who, having believed, afterwards behold; for the reward of faith is
   vision. Strange as it may seem, the greatest earthly solace and the
   most humbling thoughts come hand in hand. When we are in the sanctuary,
   there, if any where on earth, we have peace. And yet it is there we are
   taught, by visible sacraments and a veiled presence, that we are
   impotent and sinful; unable and unworthy to see His face. Our highest
   boon is a memorial of our fall. Our own hearts, with many tongues, bear
   witness of our sin, and of our unworthiness to touch His feet. Even in
   repentance we tremble, lest our repentance be found wanting; in our
   most recollected prayers we are half insensible and half unconscious;
   in our purest obedience our hearts throb with a multitude of thoughts;
   our faith, hope, charity, are all tinged with emotions of self; our
   most intent communion, even at the altar, is faint and fleeting. We see
   the outlines and the order of the heavenly court rather by the
   imagination than by the vision of the spirit. And our whole earthly
   life, even at best, is weariness and twilight, strife and conscious
   infirmity, great hopes and greater fears, high intentions and bare
   fulfilments, dust and ashes, and conscious exile from the enjoyment of
   God. Well may evangelists say, "Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly;" and
   souls already martyred, like St. Paul, desire to depart. Even to us it
   may be permitted to feel our hearts beat thick with hopeful and longing
   fear, when we wait for the voice which shall say to the least of
   penitents, "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away; for, lo, the
   winter is past:"--sorrow and sin, anguish and cold fear, dark days and
   lingering nights, penance after sins, and sins after repentance, dim
   faith and failing perseverance--all these are past; "the rain is over
   and gone." "Come with me from Lebanon; look from the top of Amana, from
   the top of Shenir and Hermon," [215] unto the everlasting hills and to
   the eternal years.

   2. Thus far we have spoken of the desire to depart which springs from a
   longing to be set free from sorrow and an evil world; from the
   temptations and burdens of mortality, which weigh upon the soul. But
   these are the nether, not the upper springs of such desires. St. Paul
   thrice desired of the Lord that the thorn in the flesh might depart
   from him; and yet it was not to leave this behind that he desired to
   depart. His were positive longings for the fruition of bliss. And in
   his second Epistle to the Church in Corinth, he has fully uttered his
   desire. "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
   eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be
   clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: if so be that being
   clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this
   tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be
   unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of
   life." [216] His desire was for the spiritual body, raised in power and
   incorruption at the day of Christ; and, meanwhile, for that personal
   perfection in measure and foretaste, which is prepared for those who
   die in the Lord, and await His coming.

   What is the misery and the burden of a fallen nature, we know. What a
   yoke is our own unwillingness to serve God;--that strange
   self-contradiction, in which we intend what we do not fulfil, and begin
   what we leave undone, and desire what we shrink from. We will, and we
   will not. We have, as it were, two wills; like the fable of the two
   serpents which preyed on either side of a man's heart; a will divided
   against itself; its superior part decreeing obedience, its sensitive
   shrinking from the task. What a mystery is personal imperfection, and
   the image of God upon which it fastens. Who does not desire to be
   unclothed, and yet still more "to be clothed upon?" Is it not strange
   that the sick should shrink from perfect health; that they should be so
   enamoured of decay, that they are unwilling to be whole? Perhaps it is
   that we do not, and cannot realise the thought that we shall one day be
   without sin; that, in the kingdom of God, our whole soul and our whole
   being will be in as perfect and pure a harmony with God as the hosts of
   angels. It seems a dream, or the imagination of a heated brain, that we
   who have sinned, as we bitterly remember, who have walked in wilful
   darkness, soiling ourselves to the very seat of life, and making our
   whole being an energetic discord with the holiness of God;--I say, it
   sounds as something of almost presumptuous aspiration, to conceive
   that, one day, we shall be in body deathless, and in soul without a
   spot. Verily we are "like unto them that dream;" but it is as the dream
   of prophets, full of truth and God. We may say to ourselves, "Through
   the tears of repentance, and the blood of the Cross, there will come a
   time when I shall love God with all my strength, and His saints even as
   myself; when my whole desire will he His glory, and my whole energy His
   praise; when the vision of His presence shall be my endless peace, and
   to adore Him my ineffable delight. In that sphere of bliss all
   consciousness of self will be extinct; and in the blessedness of others
   I shall find my bliss. To contemplate the glory of His elect, and to
   sit beneath their feet, will be more blissful then, than to be exalted
   is alluring now." O wonderful mystery of love! To forgive all our guilt
   is beyond our understanding; to change our corruption into the purity
   of angels is almost beyond our faith. Who would not desire the struggle
   of death to be over, that he might be perfect? who would not long, if
   only he could believe his sins forgiven, to go and to be sinless in the
   kingdom of God? What thought more intensely joyful, what so inspiring
   to the holiest of God's servants? what more full of strength and solace
   to the tempted and the penitent? If St. Paul had a desire to depart,
   whose whole soul was under the sway of an ardent and holy will, what
   ought to be our desire of release from the dominion of corruption?
   Surely of all earthly sorrows, sin is the sharpest. The heaviest of all
   burdens is the bondage of a will which makes God's service a weary
   task, and our homage of love a cold observance.

   3. And this leads to another reason why to depart is blessed. It unites
   us for ever with the new creation of God. It is for this that the world
   has waited, and the whole creation groaned and travailed in pain
   together. What is this new creation, but the new heavens and the new
   earth, in which are gathered the whole order and lineage of the second
   Adam; all saints from Abel the just, of all ages and times, in the
   twilight and the dayspring, in the morning and the noontide of grace;
   all made perfect, whether on earth or in rest, by the omnipotence of
   love? This is our true home; where all our reason, all our desires, all
   our sympathies, and all our love, have their perfect sphere and their
   full repose.

   In this life, even the best things are crossed and marred with
   imperfection. We are sensibly in exile from some state for which our
   souls are craving, though still unprepared. What is the fastest
   friendship, the most intimate union, the fondest love, to the unity of
   saints? What is our best earthly state, but the sum of our individual
   imperfections? and what the condition of the blessed, but a perfection
   in which all are, therefore, perfect? Can we think, without an awful
   feeling of delight, that we shall enjoy the vision of those friends of
   God who are exalted in the hierarchy of His love; that we shall not
   only behold, but love them with a love we as yet have never known for
   friend or child? It makes our hearts thrill even to read their names
   and their deeds in holy writ; what will it be to converse with them, to
   hear the very tones and accents which were heard in the wilderness and
   on Carmel, at Bethlehem and by Jordan, at Philippi and at Ephesus? If
   the savour of their lives, their words, their writings, even while they
   were imperfect here on earth, be so sweet to us, what shall their
   presence be when they and we are without spot or blemish? What a
   fellowship, and what grace that we may share it! We are bidden to that
   marriage festival. In all that host of hallowed souls, there will not
   be so much as one motion or inclining of the will from the will of God.
   All will be harmony. As the countless voices of the great deep unite in
   its majestic swell, so in the depth of life all living spirits shall be
   several, and yet one eternally. What shall it be to behold those who
   have been chosen of God to work together with Him in the salvation of
   the world; as witnesses and forerunners, as types of sanctity and the
   Cross, as stones of foundation,--yea, even to minister, under the
   shadow of the Holy Ghost, as she the ever-blessed Mary of her very
   substance to the incarnation of the second Adam? We believe these
   things, and we confess them in chants and creeds; but how little do we
   lay to heart, that one day, if, through the adorable passion of our
   blessed Lord, we guilty may behold His face, we shall dwell among them
   in a fellowship of direct vision and love, as we dwell now among our
   kindred here on earth. O miracle of peace! How majestic and how
   glorious must be that heavenly court, in which the Blessed Virgin,
   Mother of God, and all His ancients, patriarchs and prophets, apostles
   and evangelists, martyrs and saints, are gathered in sanctity and love!
   We cannot but shrink with fear at the thought of their perfection and
   our sin; and feel that, if we were suddenly called, we should have no
   sympathy with them, nor they with us. And yet there would be sympathy
   with us, and love--even there, even in the presence of eternal glory,
   among the hosts of the blessed. For will not every redeemed soul live
   each in the other's joy? Will not our own lamented and beloved be
   there, in the array of happy spirits? Will they not hail, if we reach
   the shore, our coming with delight? Do they not remember us now, even
   in the sight of God? For to see His face does not extinguish but
   perfect all holy loves. God's love gathers up and perfects all pure
   love like His own, all love that is for His sake. When we meet our
   beloved in Him, we shall both know and love them so as we have neither
   loved or known before. Even earthly happiness will be renewed in its
   absolute perfection, and made eternal in the fruition of God. If to
   dwell among the holy and loving, the wise and tender, be blessed; then
   most to be desired is that change which shall carry us thither, where
   the lowest is an angel of God. We do not enough realise this blessed
   mystery, "the communion of saints." If we meditate upon it, we shall
   see that the highest force of the second great commandment of love must
   bind us above all to love the saints departed. For they are the
   holiest, the most endowed with grace, the nearest, the most familiar
   with God. On them, next after Him, our love, by the law of its own
   perfection, must repose. Blessed exchange, to pass from the tumultuous
   imperfection of the visible Church, to the stillness and perfection of
   the Church beyond the grave.

   If only the heavy consciousness of guilt were lifted off, what should
   make us tarry here? What hopes or what hereafter, what aspirations or
   what schemes, what powers or what gifts of life, would make us rather
   linger for one day than enter the home of the redeemed, the rest of the
   saints of God?

   4. But lastly, and above all, let us take St. Paul's full words. He did
   not only say, "I have a desire to depart;" but also, "and to be with
   Christ." This is the true fountain of heavenly joy. "To be with
   Christ;" that is, with Him who is "altogether lovely," [217] and
   beautiful before the sons of men:--to be with Him who loves us; whom
   also we love again; who loves us with a love above all human intensity,
   and whom we love in turn, if we dare so speak, with a love before which
   all human affections melt away. If, indeed, we could say this, if only
   we dared to think that we could leave all and lose all for love of
   Him:--if this were so, then the thought of departure would be blessed.
   Then we might say, "Life and God's world are beautiful: the light of
   the sun is sweet, friends are dear, and home is more sweet than all;
   but there is One more beautiful, more sweet, more loved; and to Him I
   desire to go, with Him to be." If we could say this, if we could feel
   it in the inmost soul of our heart. To be with Him, to see His face, to
   follow Him whithersoever He goeth; to be conscious of His eye; to hear,
   it may be, His words of love; to see the gathered fruit of His Passion
   in the glory of His elect; to be filled with a living consciousness
   that the work of His love has been for ever made perfect in ourselves:
   what, if not this, is heaven? It is only our dull love of this world,
   or our blindness of heart, or, alas, our consciousness of penetrating
   guilt, which makes this desire of saints a thought of fear to us. We
   fear the meeting of our darkness with His light, not knowing what may
   be revealed both in us and against us. But for this, how blessed to go
   to dwell in Him for ever.

   What, then, shall we do to make ready for that hour? There is one thing
   which is enough. Let us go to Him now. Let us live in Him by holy
   obedience, and by continual prayer. It is prayer that makes us love and
   desire His presence unveiled. If we knew that He was on earth, sitting
   "at meat in the house," should we dare to go to Him? What should we do?
   should we not desire and yet fear to go? Would not our hearts beat
   backwards and forwards, with a trust in His exceeding tenderness, and a
   "horrible dread" of our own guilt? Should we not desire, and, at last,
   should we not dare to go and stand behind Him,--not to meet His eye, as
   unworthy to come into His sight, but to draw near to Him in shame and
   tears? Would it not be a consolation to be in His presence? Should we
   not feel ourselves half forgiven, shielded altogether from the power of
   sin, if it were only by being where He is? It is strange what relief we
   feel from fears when we come into the presence of those we dread. It
   seems to take off half the terror, by taking away all the waiting and
   foreboding. Would He cast us out? He has said Himself, "Him that cometh
   unto me, I will in no wise cast out." Would He say, Thou art a sinner?
   Would He say, Touch Me not? Would He not rather say, "Come unto me.
   Thou art heavy laden, but thou art wounded with fear and sorrow. Thou
   art sincere at last; come, and sin no more." So may we trust it will be
   hereafter. Perhaps the poor Magdalene little thought to kiss His feet,
   when she first drew near to Him. She came to anoint them in reverence;
   but His love cast out her fear. So it may be with you, when the word is
   brought, "The Master is come, and calleth for thee." At first, thick
   bursts of fear beat full upon the heart, and life seems to come down
   like a waterflood, in an overwhelming consciousness of sin; it seems
   impossible that you should see His face and live. But we may trust that
   He will so inspire us with the persuasion of His love to sinners, that
   we may insensibly draw near, until we are bold in faith to touch, even
   to embrace, His feet, in silent and imploring faith. Let this be your
   daily preparation for departure. Strive to live in a perpetual
   readiness to die; and this you shall attain, if you learn to love His
   presence now. If you go to Him even saying, "Depart from me, for I am a
   sinful man, O Lord;" or, "I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come
   under my roof:" or if you come day by day, trembling, to "touch so much
   as the hem of His garment," He, of His tender compassion, will breathe
   into your hearts an abasing trust in His forgiveness, and a fervent
   desire of His presence. What but sin makes you to shrink from the
   thought of your departure? and if your sin were blotted out, what could
   make you endure to linger here?

SERMON XXI.

  THE SNARE OF THE WORLD AND THE DRAWING OF CHRIST THE TWO GREAT ANTAGONISTS.

    SONG OF SOLOMON i. 4.

   "Draw me, we will run after Thee."

   THESE are the words of the Church praying to be drawn to the presence
   and vision of Christ. They express the love a faithful soul bears to
   Him for His holiness and His passion, and a desire to be drawn more and
   more into fellowship with His sanctity and His Cross,--a desire, that
   is, to walk the way of the imitation of Christ. But they express more
   than this desire: they confess also our spiritual impotence and our
   spiritual slowness to follow Him. "Draw me," for alone I cannot move a
   foot; I cannot begin my course; in me there is no power to originate:
   all comes from Thee, both to will and to do, to desire and to begin.

   It is also to be noted that the Church here says, "Draw me, we will
   run," as implying with what a fervent affection and kindling heart it
   would put forth all its strength to do the will of Christ, revealed in
   His gift of preventing grace. "My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken
   Thou me according to Thy word." [218] This is first a cry of distress
   under the clog and hindrance of an earthly and sluggish nature, and
   then a pure aspiration, mixed with intense desire to speed into His
   presence. There is in it a tone like the words of St. Peter when he
   first refused to suffer his Master to wash his feet, and then, lest he
   should lose his part and lot in Him, eagerly desired more: "Lord, not
   my feet only, but also my hands and my head;" [219] or as when he said,
   "Lord, why cannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy
   sake." [220] It is such a longing as we may believe the beloved
   disciple had, when Peter turned and saw him following, and our Lord
   said, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"
   [221] such an aspiration as they all felt within when He "led them out
   as far as to Bethany, and lifted up His hands and blessed them, and
   . . . while He blessed them . . . was parted from them, and carried up
   into heaven." [222] Each one, as he looked up stedfastly and
   worshipped, said, (no doubt, in his heart,) "Draw me, we will run after
   Thee." And this has been the longing desire of the Church in every age
   from then till now. There has been in the midst of this rough world,
   and under the soiled array of the visible Church, a deep and living
   pulse beating with love for Christ, yearning and panting as the hart
   for the water-brooks.

   This is the perfect and blessed life of a Christian upon earth; a state
   very high, far above our heads, though, God be praised, not out of our
   reach. If we were left to scale these ascents of love and peace in our
   own slothful weakness, they would indeed be unattainable; but it is He
   that "maketh our feet like hart's feet," and carries us up to walk with
   Him "on high places." There is no measure of love, joy, peace, light,
   gladness, fellowship with Him, to which He will not draw and exalt
   those that seek Him in humility.

   Now the spiritual life has three states through which all who attain to
   the love of Christ seem to pass; and these states are so marked that we
   may take them one by one. Although to every soul born again by the
   Spirit of Christ He may say, as He said of old, "I have loved thee with
   an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee;"
   [223] although this loving attraction of His Spirit has been all
   through life drawing each one of us to Himself, yet we, by our backward
   and reluctant hearts, have kept far away, or followed with a slow and
   struggling will. We are between two objects of love, two attractive
   forces; as if two loadstones, one seen and one unseen, were playing
   upon us. Let us see how it has been with us.

   1. First, I suppose that most can remember a time when we were drawn so
   strongly to the world that the drawing of Christ's love and Spirit was
   overbalanced by a more powerful attraction.

   Happy are they who have no memory of actual sin, and of its clinging
   hold, by which they were once kept in bondage. The most dreadful part
   of sin is its sweetness, by which it fascinates even those who know its
   hatefulness and shame. It mocks a sinner while it destroys him. It
   unbinds all his resolutions, loosens his strictest intentions, relaxes
   his firmest purposes, and changes him, with his eyes open, from a half
   penitent to a fool. To pass by all other examples, take such a sin as
   anger. Before the temptation it is hateful: during the temptation, to
   indulge it is positively sweet. It gratifies a strong present impulse,
   as abundant food cloys a hungry palate. An angry man goes on word after
   word, reply after rejoinder, lash after lash, with a sensible and
   increasing elevation of spirit. He revels in it. For a time every thing
   is lost in the swell and sway of his excitement. It adds strength,
   vividness, and eloquence to his thoughts and words, which delight him.
   In a moment all the promises, rules, and prayers of years, it may be,
   are scattered and forgotten. In another moment he stands alone, stung
   to the quick at his own folly. No reproof can go beyond the rebukes he
   lays upon himself, no contempt exceed his own. Why did he not feel it a
   few minutes before? A little sooner would have saved him. But sin is
   sweet, and it draws steadily and smoothly, as the shoal-water of a
   whirlpool, with an imperceptible and resistless attraction. One such
   sin will overbear the meek and gentle drawing of Christ. Such a man
   needs no more than this one bond to keep him fast bound to this dying
   world. So it is with every sin. Take them one by one: change only the
   terms, and the same outline will serve for all. In such hearts the love
   of Christ takes no root: for them His holiness has no beauty, His
   passion no sharpness of compunction.

   But we will pass to another kind of state. I mean, the state of those
   who love the pleasures, rank, honours, riches, refinement of the world.
   These things, free as they are from necessary evil, are among the most
   subtil and tenacious snares. Unnumbered souls perish in their meshes.
   Thousands struggle in vain to get beyond the sphere of their
   attraction. But their power of allurement is only less than the power
   of the Spirit of God: far too great for the infirmity of man. It is
   wonderful how fast worldly people are held; how the world embraces
   them, and weaves its arms about their whole being. "The children of
   this world are," indeed, "in their generation wiser than the children
   of light:" for except in a few, where do we ever see such intense,
   concentrated, energetic, loving devotion as in aspiring and ambitious
   men, in the hunters after popularity, and the traffickers in gold? The
   human character is in them exhibited in all its range, versatility, and
   unity of force. They lack but one thing. They are "without God in the
   world." [224] And the world has them for its own with a quiet and
   unchallenged possession. No drawings of Christ's truth or Spirit make
   them waver or vibrate for a moment. The game is up, and their spoil
   before them. They plunge deeper and deeper into the manifold and
   multiplying attractions of the world, until their freedom of auction is
   stolen from them, and their will ceases to be their own.

   And, further than this, we may take an example which comes nearer to
   ourselves. It is not only the greater sins, or the worship of the
   world, which hold us back against the drawing of Christ; but the soft
   pure happiness of home, the easy round of kindly offices, the calm and
   blameless toil of a literary life, the gentler and more peaceful
   influences of earthly cheerfulness:--all these too, with the lights and
   shades, the anxieties and joys which fall across an even path, steal
   away the heart, and wind all its affections about a thousand moorings.
   Happy men drop their anchors into the quiet waters of life; the very
   smoothness of its surface lulls them, and a conscious innocence makes
   them fearless. This world is very fair; and the elements of peace and
   joy still bear the marks of a divine hand; so that we love them freely,
   and with fondness. A great part of such a life rests on duty, and is
   blameless; it has therefore nothing to awaken a suspicion that the
   world is nearer to the soul than God. How many homes, how many
   families, how many hearts, how many parents and children, husbands and
   wives, brethren and friends, even pastors of Christ's flock, does this
   describe!

   But these fascinations are dangerously strong: they so fill the eye and
   heart, that little is desired more, and nothing is sought with
   earnestness beyond. Such people are often, indeed almost always, up to
   a certain measure, religious; but often not devout. They are pure, but
   not zealous; afraid of sin, but without compunction. They think they
   fear the world, while they love its happiness; and so hope to escape
   the danger of its allurements: they fear to offend God's holiness
   rather than His love; and by this pious fear disguise from themselves
   their want of fervour. They serve God from conscience, not because it
   is their joy. His worship is a cool and satisfying duty; but neither
   sweetness nor delight. The vision of life is lovely and vivid; the
   outline of heaven veiled and dim: their enjoyment of life is present
   and sensible; the thought of death bitter, as an end of happiness, and
   fearful, as an entrance upon a state unknown. To sum this up in one
   true word, such people love the world more than they fear it, and fear
   God more than they love Him. The attraction is greater on one side, and
   the repulsion is all on the other. What a searching point of reality
   and truth there is in the words of the son of Sirach: "O death, how
   bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liveth at rest in his
   possessions, unto the man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath
   prosperity in all things!" [225] I have been describing no evil or
   irreligious character; but one which, to a great extent, is Christian.
   In all the duties of the second table they are strict and sincere; but
   towards God their conscience is clear and cold. The warmth, pulse, and
   tide of life sets towards the visible objects of affection. This is a
   state in which it is hard to die. They are little prepared, either for
   so great a wrench, or for so high and awful a meeting with their Lord
   and Judge.

   2. Let us take the next state. It may be that by sorrow, or
   chastisement, or by some other of His manifold strokes of love, it has
   pleased God to break or to relax these bonds, and to dispel the vain
   show in which they walked. Let us suppose that the world has lost its
   attractive power, and draws them but feebly to its centre. Little by
   little they get weaned from their stronger attachments. They see less
   fairness, and no stability in its best gifts; they have found its
   insecurity; and its sounds, even the most glad, ring hollow. They are
   not soured or fretful, nor love friends less, nor brood upon any
   disappointment, nor wince under any cross; but they have found out the
   emptiness of all that is not eternal, and the poverty of all that will
   not satisfy the soul. In this state they break, one by one, through the
   old attractions of life; they withdraw themselves to the outer sphere
   of its influence, where it plays feebly upon them, not as yet wholly
   escaping; sometimes for a while falling under it more fully again, and
   retracting in their escape; but upon the whole, the world draws them
   less, and the presence of Christ attracts them more. Still, the most
   that can be said is, that they begin to fear the world more, and love
   it less; and to fear the presence of Christ less, and to love Him more.
   After all, it is but a mingled state, a sort of mottled sky, neither
   the cold of winter nor the sun of summer; a dubious, veering,
   inconstant temperature between love and fear, life and death. If life
   does not draw them, death affrights them; though they have lost their
   fondness for earth, they have not attained a yearning for heaven. The
   fresh, calm repose of life is more soothing to them than the thought of
   the heavenly court, ardent with love, and arrayed in the glory of God.
   From this they draw back, both with conscious incapacity of such
   exalted bliss, and with a sense of personal sin. They are
   intellectually convinced of the blessedness of a life "hid with Christ
   in God, "and that there is no true happiness but to dwell in His love.
   Their whole life takes a new direction; they recast it upon the order
   of the Church, and with a direct intention to aim only at a holy
   resurrection. This disentangles them from a multitude of hindrances,
   and gives something of unity and purpose to their life. Their chief
   work, thenceforth, becomes the search and knowledge of their own state
   before God, their chief study His will, their chief rule of life the
   practice of devotion. But there is yet one thing sensibly wanting: the
   love which "casteth out fear." The deliberate choice of their superior
   will, that is, of reason and conscience, is fixed upon the kingdom of
   God; but the feelings and affections of their hearts, that is, of their
   sensitive and inferior will, are lively and prone to relapse. Their
   whole religious life is to be sustained against a force which strongly
   keeps its hold; and the attractions of the unseen world are faint. They
   are convictions rather than affections; they work by reason rather than
   by love; and this accounts both for the slight and uncertain enjoyment
   they find in devotions, as in prayer and the holy Sacrament, and the
   continual resistance, both of body and spirit, which must be overcome
   before they can begin to pray.

   Perhaps nothing so certainly proves how we are related to the unseen
   world as our prayers. If they be irksome and tedious, cold and
   tasteless, it is a sure proof that our delight is not in God, and that
   we love Him chiefly, if not only, in the reason; that we are living if
   not lives of sense, at best of intellect and of imagination, rather
   than of the will. So long as we are in this state, however much this
   world may lose its hold upon us, the next has not as yet won our
   hearts. The thought of entering it must be appalling; and the
   expectation of death full of fear.

   And does not this describe the state of many who pass for devout, and
   believe themselves to be so, at least in desire? Such persons are in a
   balanced state between two attractions; of which, if the one be weaker,
   it is the nearer and the more sensibly perceived. This condition is at
   times dreary and overcast, and cannot last long. It must incline one
   way or the other. Either the world, by almost unperceived reaction,
   gets its hold again, or God in His mercy multiplies the power of His
   grace, and draws them almost unwilling to Himself. Whether it be by
   larger measures of His Spirit, shedding abroad His sensible love, or by
   fresh visitations of merciful discipline, matters not. Whatsoever draws
   us out of the range of worldly desires, and within the sphere of His
   heavenly kingdom, the issue is all one. It turns the scale, and "we run
   after" Him.

   3. And this leads on into the third and last state, in which the
   balance is so turned against this world, that it can allure no longer;
   and the hope of God and His kingdom attracts alone. He has unnumbered
   ways in which He thus draws us to Himself: sometimes it is by a flood
   of blessings, wakening the whole heart to gratitude and praise;
   sometimes by revelations of His truth, overwhelming the soul with
   light; sometimes by a word read in silence, or spoken to us, which
   wounds like a shaft of fire; sometimes by the overflowing grace of the
   holy Sacrament, or by such a spiritual perception of the Cross as fills
   the heart with love and sorrow: besides all these, He has ministries,
   operations, and agents, countless as the angels of light. In some of
   these special ways He is often pleased to break the bonds of this
   world, and to draw His servants once for all under the abiding
   attractions of the world to come. Perhaps nothing does this so surely
   as a realisation of death.

   There is great reason to doubt whether we ever realise what death is,
   till it comes home to ourselves. We may see it in others, and stand
   daily by dying beds; and yet it is with death as with bodily pain, we
   can all sympathise, but we cannot transfer it to ourselves. However
   familiar we are with the sights and sounds, the thoughts and fears of
   such a state, by seeing others die, it is only, as it were, by proxy.
   Such warnings are very wholesome, and dispose the mind to realise it,
   one day, for ourselves; but they can do no more. The consciousness that
   our time is come, and that we personally are going out of this world,
   is wholly incommunicable. That which makes it our consciousness,
   forbids its being shared by others. It is our own, because it is no
   other's. The consciousness of our personality is as our own life,
   which, though common in nature, is incommunicable. So the thought of
   our own death; of our own personal appearing before God; our own
   personal account, judgment, destiny,--that which makes it different
   from all other perceptions is, that it is no other's but our own. When
   we have once realised this, a change passes upon all things: sin
   becomes hateful, the world fearful, earthly happiness pale, and almost
   undesired. One great reality absorbs all--eternity; and in eternity the
   vision of God and of Christ, the kingdom of saints, the bliss of the
   soul, the glory of the body, the judgment, the resurrection, the armies
   of the quick and dead;--this one mighty vision draws the whole soul
   into itself, and we seem caught up out of the bonds of flesh and earth,
   free into the air. Perhaps no other words will fully express the
   feeling. It is as if our feet rested upon nothing but the spiritual
   world; as if we saw nothing but the presence of God.

   This thought once realised, may, indeed, be wholly lost again. We may
   taste the "powers of the world to come," and yet again fall away; but
   we are not now speaking of that danger, but with its direct opposite:
   the blessedness of such an awakening. It is as if our eyes were opened,
   or gifted with a twofold power of sight, and a reed were put into our
   hand "like unto a rod," [226] to measure happiness and life, sin and
   death, hope and fear, time and eternity, "the temple and the altar,"
   the shadows which fall both upon the world and from it,--as if we were
   lifted into space beyond its path. How strangely do all things then
   change their magnitudes, and with them their force of attraction: what
   a new law of proportion and of power is seen to reveal itself on every
   side. Once we were in earnest for all manner of aims, objects, and
   schemes; we panted for this, were all energy for that undertaking; all
   on fire, all abroad: and now all is spoken in one calm word: "If by any
   means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead." [227]

   But it is not the mere fading of earthly and transitory things. A mere
   loosening from this world would do little. It might make us sour and
   restless, bitter and complaining, or even haters of mankind and enemies
   of God.

   The true and blessed change wrought upon the heart is an awakened
   desire of God, by which He draws it to Himself. After much trembling
   and fear, penitent self-accusation, and sincere restitution, so far as
   they are able; after passing through the depths of a repentance, those
   whom God so blesses pass on, by faith in the blood of Christ, into a
   state of calm and cheerful desire, which collects all the affections of
   the soul into one longing hope. "One thing have I desired of the Lord,
   that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
   the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of the Lord." "This
   shall be my rest for ever; here will I dwell; for I have a delight
   therein." If they could venture they would say, "I have a desire to
   depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better;" or, "Even so, Lord
   Jesus, come quickly."

   It seems at such a time as if they could never fall back into old
   channels, never go abroad again into this unreal world, never be in
   earnest for any thing of time, never bestow an hour or a care on any
   thing which is not eternal. The whole life of their heart seems brought
   to a focus in the desire of peace in heaven.

   Let us now suppose that God in His mercy has brought any of you to this
   state; that He has borne with you when you loved the world, and served
   Him only with fear; that He has drawn you out of this spiritual death
   into the second state, where you hung in a dubious balance of
   attraction: let us suppose, I say, that He has, in love, broken your
   bonds asunder, and drawn you, by the full force of love and holy fear,
   unto Himself. How will you answer to this mercy? Suppose yourselves
   awakened by some of His gracious visitations: what should you do?

   1. First, it would be the plain will of God that you should strive with
   all your soul and strength to follow whither He is drawing you; that
   is, to prepare yourselves to dwell with Him for ever, and, as a first
   step to this, to put off all that weighs you down to earth. I need not
   say all sins, for we have been speaking only of those who have long
   ago, by God's grace, been cleansed of wilful sins. But there remains
   the burden of the past, the consciousness of sin dwelling in us, and
   much that is written in God's book against the judgment of the great
   day. Our first step must be to put this off, by an humble accusation of
   ourselves before Him. So long as sin has any part in us, the world
   retains a hold. It can light up fears, and so withdraw the soul from
   God. But confession fairly casts out the embers and the ashes of death;
   so that the world has nothing on which to cast its fires.

   The next thing is, to offer up to God all pure affections, desires,
   regrets, and all the bonds which link us to home, kindred, and friends,
   together with all our works, purposes, and labours. These things, which
   are not only lawful, but sacred, become then the matter of thanksgiving
   and oblation. When He calls us, they can be ours no longer; He has
   resumed what He lent, and we must yield them up. If we would hold them
   back, and dwell upon them, they would only disturb the balance of
   attraction, and make us draw backward to life again. Memories, plans
   for the future, wishes, intentions; works just begun, half done, all
   but completed; emotions, sympathies, affections: all these things
   throng tumultuously and dangerously in the heart and will. The only way
   to master them is, to offer them up to Him, as once ours, under Him,
   always His by right. In fact, as we would restore, at our last hour,
   all loans to their lawful owners, so we ought at all times to make
   restitution to God.

   And after this we ought to awaken in our will the grace of faith, hope,
   and love, calling to mind all that He has done for us from
   childhood,--the pledges of His truth, goodness, and love to us. These
   things powerfully draw us on towards His unseen presence:--faith by
   realising His beauty, hope His mercy, and love His fatherly and pitiful
   compassion.

   But when all this is done, there remains one thing still, the chiefest
   and best of all; which is, neither to go back in fear and misgiving to
   the past, nor in anxiety and forecasting to the future; but to lie
   quiet under His hand, trusting in the Cross alone, and having no will
   but His. This is the greatest speed we can make to His presence; for he
   that has no will hut God's will is not far from His kingdom; for "the
   kingdom of God is within" him.

   2. But next suppose it to he God's will that you should be once more
   set free from the trial He has sent for your instruction: what shall
   you do? It is plainly His will that you should give your whole heart
   and strength to perpetuate and to perfect what you have learned, to the
   very end of life.

   His visitation was sent either to prepare you for His presence, or for
   a life which should he spent in an habitual and ripening fitness for
   departing. So it pleases Him, as it were, to build up our earthly life
   in mercy, as once He ordained in displeasure, laying the foundations in
   sorrow, arid setting up the gates in sickness; rearing it story upon
   story, every one resting upon some visitation of chastisement or
   warning. This is what He would have you learn now. He saw that you were
   still entangled in the world, deceiving others less than yourself with
   the belief that you were dead to it. He saw that your heart must be
   struck sharply on the cold flint, before it could give out fire, and
   kindle. He saw how much of truth hung suspended in vapour and
   imagination, and needed a rude touch, as from the presence of death, to
   fix it in reality. He saw how much devotion had no deeper springs than
   in the reason, leaving the heart dry; how weak an allurement would draw
   you from His kingdom; how slack a love held you to His service. And all
   this He would heal, and send you back into life, to prove you once more
   upon a deeper law, and with a clearer insight into the realities of
   death and judgment. This is now your trial; to perpetuate your present
   spiritual perceptions; to shelter them from the breath of common-place,
   which men call common sense, sobriety, and the like; and to keep them
   as keen and unearthly as you feel them now. Nay, more: your trial is
   not only to prolong your present convictions, but to carry them out and
   to perfect them by exercise and discipline, and the confirmation of
   habitual stedfastness. It will be a heavy and sad account if, twenty or
   ten years hence, when sorrow, or fear, or death comes near once more,
   you be taken unawares, or found no fitter than last time. Alas for us,
   if these things leave us on the same low level where they found us at
   the first,--if sorrows do not prepare us for affliction, and sicknesses
   do not make us ready to die; if, having once gone down midway into the
   cold waters, we stand next time trembling upon the bank, to begin all
   over again, with all the same infirmities and fears!

   Now, to keep alive and to ripen the convictions and perceptions which
   God's mercy gives in such visitations, take these two counsels: first,
   to sustain in your minds the thoughts, and to perpetuate the prayers,
   rules, and practices you used while His hand was upon you. This, if any
   thing, under God, will keep up your inward state, and ripen it into an
   habitual consciousness. To this it will be well to add special
   commemoration of events and days. And the other counsel is, as far as
   you can to take upon yourselves the special care and consolation of
   those who are led by the hand of God into the cloud through which He
   has once guided you. In them you will see the liveliest memorials of
   what you were, of your fears, pains, faults, anxieties, and weakness.
   You will learn how to humble yourselves; and you will know, by a
   special knowledge of sympathy, how to help and soothe them. The safest
   and most blessed life for you will be to make such as the poor and
   penitent, mourners, the sick and dying, your spiritual kindred, under
   our common Father; and to live in them and for them, in thanksgiving
   for mercies to yourself, and as a preparation for the hour which must
   come at last.

   What a wonderful mystery of paternal love will be revealed at that day,
   when, from the kingdom of their Father, the elect shall see the virtues
   which issued from the Cross to draw each one of them unto itself. What
   a two-fold revelation of cold unwillingness and of divine charity. "I
   drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love." [228] With the
   cords of Adam, with the sacred manhood of the Word made flesh, with the
   tenderness, pity, meekness, sympathy of our crucified Lord and God.
   Truly these are "cords of man and bands of love;" of love "which
   passeth knowledge," whose goings forth are from everlasting; whose
   virtues are infinite, whose patience is eternal. From every wound of
   His Divine manhood issues forth, as it were, a radiance of love,
   drawing the hearts of His elect into the fellowship of His passion. All
   through our life this effluence of grace has been shed abroad upon us;
   even in our sins, in our unconscious and turbulent worldliness,
   restraining, preventing, and at last converting us to Himself. Ever
   since that day, virtue and holy inspirations have gone out of Him,
   silently persuading and secretly attracting us nearer and nearer to the
   foot of the cross. Even in our coldness, reluctance, relapses, He still
   held us fast. He knew us better than we knew ourselves, and the bands
   of love were still wound about us by His tender care. Little by little,
   He has brought us where we stand now: between Him and us, if we
   believe, there is but a veil, impervious to sight, to faith as open as
   the day. Happy they whom He has drawn to the horizon of this visible
   world, and there bid them wait in sustained and ripening preparation
   until their time shall come. Let us, then, say unto Him, "Lord, Thy
   cross is high and lifted up; I cannot in my own strength ascend it; but
   Thou hast promised, I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
   men unto me.' [229] Draw me, then, from my sins to repentance, from
   darkness to faith, from the flesh to the spirit, from coldness to
   ardent devotion, from weak beginnings to a perfect end, from smooth and
   open ways, if it be Thy will, to higher and holier paths; from fear to
   love, from earth to heaven, from myself to Thee. And as Thou hast said,
   No man can come to Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw him,'
   [230] give unto me the Spirit whom the Father hath sent in Thy Name,
   that in Him and through Him I being wholly drawn may hasten unto Thee,
   and go no more out' for ever."

SERMON XXII.

  THE GREAT BETROTHAL.

    SONG OF SOLOMON ii. 16.

   "My Beloved is mine, and I am His."

   WE need not go into the literal and historical interpretation of this
   Song of Songs. It is enough to know that "a greater than Solomon is
   here." It is a vision and a prophecy of one "falling into a trance, hut
   having his eyes open;" [231] conscious, and not conscious; seeing, and
   not seeing, how great things he foreshadowed and spake. It is verily
   and indeed the song of Him who "loved" His spouse the Church, and gave
   Himself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
   of water, by the word, that He might present it to Himself a glorious
   Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; hut that it
   should be holy, and without blemish." [232] This song is the ineffable
   communion of the Bridegroom and Bride, both in this wayfaring upon
   earth, and at the marriage supper of the Lamb. It utters, in human
   words, and by human figures and emotions, because spoken by man, and
   addressed to man, things which surpass not only words but knowledge;
   realities of the spiritual world,--the instincts, energies, and
   consciousness of the soul. For these what language is deep or fine
   enough? what can ear or eye attain to those things which even the heart
   of man hath not conceived? They can be perceived only by the intuitions
   of the Spirit, and by a power of vision granted to us by God.

   Such is the mystery of peace here expressed. "My Beloved is mine, and I
   am His." High as these words are, yet they are for all. Not only might
   His chosen disciple so speak, but the stained and penitent "Magdalene,
   for she loved much." Wonderful is His pity and compassion: the least
   may say this with the greatest. Even now in measure, as hereafter; for
   in the firmament of His kingdom, though "one star differeth from
   another star in glory," yet all are bright and pure: some burning with
   a ruddy and glorious light, in might and splendour; some pale and meek,
   in purity and softness; but all are hallowed, sainted, and beloved.

   Let us see, then, what these few deep words may mean. They express the
   bond or hold of love between Christ and His elect, whether they be
   saints or penitents, and they fasten it by a twofold strength. "My
   Beloved is mine;" and not this alone, but "I am His." At first sight
   these words might seem to change the order of love given by St. John,
   "We love Him, because He first loved us;" but it does not. The order is
   eternal, laid deep in the bosom of God, and cannot be changed. What,
   then, do these words express? They teach us:

   First, that He is ours in the very sense in which we speak of our
   father or our child, our life or our own soul. There is nothing we
   possess, either without or within our inmost being, which is more our
   own than He is. He is our Maker, our Redeemer, our Helper, our Light,
   our Daily Bread, our Hope, and our Portion for ever. We may be stripped
   naked of all other things which are most our own; but of Him we can
   never be deprived, except we cast Him away. And how has He become ours?
   Not by deserving or earning, by finding or seeking; not by climbing up
   to Him, or taking Him for ours; but because He gave Himself to us. He
   gave us His truth, His holy sacraments, His promises; He gave us sight,
   power, reason, and life; and because He gave them, they are ours; ours
   in full, as if there were no other regenerate soul, no other
   illuminated heart, no other intelligence, no other living spirit. We
   share an universal gift, which is whole in all, and perfect in every
   one; of which none can challenge our right, or rob us of our portion.
   So it is with Himself. He took our manhood, and was made one with us;
   and gave Himself for us as an atonement, and to us as a Saviour. Our
   possession of Him, therefore, is full and absolute, by His own
   "unspeakable gift."

   But this does not reach up to the fulness of this mystery. He gave
   Himself to us as the bridegroom gives himself to the bride. It was an
   act of His love stooping to us, giving up, as it were, His right over
   Himself, and putting Himself into the power of His Church, so as to be
   Head to none other than to her. And this is why St. John says, "He
   first loved us." It was,--it could only be,--His own free choice; His
   own first advance; His own unsought, unknown love, by which He gave to
   His Church the dowry of Himself. In this mystery of love is summed up
   all that is inviolable, binding, and eternal. The force of this
   betrothal has all strength, human and divine. He will never draw back
   from it, or release Himself, or annul His vows, or cast us away. On His
   side this is impossible. The pledge of His love is everlasting, as His
   love itself. But not only is this a mystery of strength and of
   eternity, but of tenderness, care, pity, and compassion. "No man ever
   yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the
   Lord the Church: for we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of
   His bones." [233] These things are not to be explained away into
   figures and metaphors, or to be lowered by lax interpretations. They
   reveal great verities of the Spirit; eternal realities of the new
   creation, Husband never loved a wife; bridegroom, in the first gladness
   of perfect affection, never loved a bride, with a love so deep,
   fervent, tender, self-forgetting, as that love which binds the Son of
   God to the Church for which He died. The coldness of our natural heart,
   and the remote abstractions of reason, make us to content ourselves
   with a theory of God's love which belongs to the schools of philosophy,
   not to the revelation of the Gospel. But the love that is revealed to
   us in Christ, is all that is of God, with all that is of man. It is
   divine in its perfection, and human in its intimate embrace of our most
   vivid and tender emotions. "My Beloved is mine" He has so given,
   pledged, and bound Himself to me; He has so fulfilled, confirmed, and
   assured me of His bonds and pledges; that I ought sooner to doubt that
   He made me than that He loves me; that my own sight or soul are mine,
   than that He is mine; mine by every sense in which the word can be
   spoken; mine as my help, head, shelter, protection, guide, happiness,
   and everlasting rest.

   2. And next, these words mean that, in giving Himself to be ours, He
   took us to be His own. "And I am His." It is a full contract, binding
   both, though made and accomplished by Himself alone. He created us when
   we were not; He redeemed us when we were dead in sin; He regenerated us
   when we were born in uncleanness; He called us by all the vocations of
   His truth and Spirit when we were unconscious, forgetful, or
   rebellious; He strove with us when we were impenitent; He converted us
   when we should have perished; He made Himself ours by a gift, and He
   has made us His own by the power of His Spirit. We are His, therefore,
   by every bond and title. We are bought, purchased, redeemed; we are
   pledged, vowed, and betrothed; but better than all these, He has made
   us to be His by the free, willing, and glad consent of our own heart.
   This is why we may call Him, "My Beloved." Because after all His
   miracles of creation and redemption, of our new birth and of His
   long-suffering, He has wrought one more, greater than all; He has made
   us to love Him in return. Who that remembers what he was in childhood,
   boyhood, and even the riper years of life; who that remembers the sins
   and provocations of his corrupted will, the cold ingratitude and proud
   defiance of his rebellious heart; nay, who that knows what has been the
   frigid, reluctant, soulless religion of his seemingly devout and
   penitent life; but must wonder at the kindling of his own heart, as if
   the touch of an angel had brought fire out of a rock? It is nothing
   less than a miracle in the order of the new creation of God; and to be
   the subject of such a miracle is full of wonder and awe. It is no less
   a work of the Holy Ghost than the tongues of fire which sat upon the
   apostles in the day of Pentecost. What more wonderful than that we
   should begin to desire His love whom we habitually slighted; and to
   sorrow most of all that we cannot love Him again? Strange, that what
   was once without savour should now be sweeter than the droppings of the
   honeycomb; that our hearts should beat, and thrill, and tremble with
   the desire, not so much to be loved by Him as to love Him above all;
   that our chief disquiet should be our own loveless spirit, and our
   highest joy the least kindling of our soul towards Him. What is this
   but "a change from the right hand of the Most High?" The gift of love
   to Him is the greatest gift of all. If we have this one gift, though
   besides we have nothing, yet we have all things; though we had all
   things, without this we should have nothing. What a mystery of wonder
   is the company of His elect; from righteous Abel to the Annunciation,
   and much more from that time unto this day. What is the inward life of
   that great company, of whom the world was not worthy? What was their
   aim, hope, and stay? What drew them out from home and kindred, and knit
   them into a new fellowship,--in the world hut not of it,--neither a
   temporal State nor a retired household, but a kingdom wide as the
   earth, in every land, of every tongue, under every sky, always
   suffering, never failing, perpetually replenishing from some unseen
   source, outliving races and dynasties, awing and binding kings in
   chains, subduing the roughest wills, and changing the rudest
   natures,--what, I say, has been the secret life, energy, and power of
   this miracle of God, but the mystical union and marriage between Christ
   and His elect, "the love of" His "espousals," the divine virtue of
   these few words, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His?" This has been the
   strength of prophets and apostles; this has made martyrs, saints, and
   penitents; the love of Christ and His Church, uniting both in one flesh
   and one spirit, with one heart and will, in life and in death. This,
   then, is the plain meaning, shortly expressed, as needs must be, of
   these words. And they are full of all manner of consolation. For
   instance:

   1. They interpret to us the whole discipline of sorrow. It is most
   certain that, if it were not necessary for our very salvation, He would
   never send affliction. That we should be afflicted, is more against the
   tenderness of His love for us than against the delicacy of our love for
   ourselves. When it comes, it is a proof how much He loves us; so much,
   indeed, that He would rather afflict us than let us perish. Most of our
   sorrows are the close followers of positive sins. We draw them upon
   ourselves. And He, in His mercy, turns what we make penal into
   purification. Sometimes they are sorrows not in the order of nature but
   of providence; and are then laid on by Him to purge us of some
   spiritual disease, which, if left alone, must be our death. Such are
   the deadly sins and their chastisements.

   But passing over these; the love He has to us, and the right to our
   undivided love, make Him impatient of our estranged affections. He is
   "a jealous God, even a consuming fire." And He will not endure that we
   should give to others or to ourselves what is due to Him alone. If you
   would take this as a key, it would open to you the darkest passages of
   your past life. He has been weaning you from irregular and excessive
   affections. After the love of gross sin is cast out, self and the world
   long hold their sway. Men love and aim at power, rank, reputation,
   wealth, high relations, great friendships; or it may be they turn to
   intellect and literature, and to the subtil allurements of a purer and
   more refined self-love; or still more subtil, they take up even the
   sanctities of religion and of His service as the subject-matter of
   their energy and self-esteem, or of their repose and self-indulgent
   consolation. They love power over other minds, and the more so in
   proportion as that power is higher, purer, and more intense. They make
   to themselves thrones in the reason or the imagination, in the
   conscience or the heart of others. And what is sadder still, they use
   even the name, the person, and the passion of the Son of God as the
   occasion and material of ministering to their own service. This sounds
   very startling and sinful, and perhaps many may say that they are
   wholly innocent of it; indeed, perhaps few will confess themselves to
   be guilty. And yet, what is ambition, vanity, self-importance, whether
   worldly, literary, or spiritual, but this? The plain interpretation of
   such sins is, that they are a transfer of your affections from the
   heavenly Bridegroom to the world, or to yourselves. And this, in His
   love, He will not suffer. He will lay on the rod, stroke after stroke,
   till He has wakened you to know yourselves. He will never leave you
   till He make you to desire that you may be supplanted, dispossessed,
   dethroned in the heart of every creature, so that you may rest on His
   heart alone. Sharp as the discipline may be, and sick at soul as you
   must be under it, yet the time will come when you will feel it a
   sharper anguish to be conscious of any affection at variance with your
   love to Him; when you will sicken with a far deeper self-abasement at
   every feeling or thought which betrays the stubborn vividness of
   self-love.

   There is something unutterably humbling in the inward consciousness of
   any one heart-sin, such as envy or vanity, which makes it impossible
   for us to rest sincerely and altogether in His love. Such sins shew at
   once that we have not passed out of ourselves, but that we are still
   festering in the very core of self. Now all these He will expel, one by
   one; gently if it may be, or all together, if it must be, by some
   overwhelming stroke. And besides this purgation of sins, He also will
   not cease to visit us till He restore unity and measure even to our
   pure affections. The order of love is, that we should love Him with all
   our soul, and others as ourselves. Such is the charity of Heaven; the
   love of blessed spirits round His throne. But with us, all is disorder
   and division. What is the order of our sensible and active love? We
   love first ourselves greatly, then our friends a little, and then God
   least of all. Therefore He will not stay His hand till all this be
   reversed. Hence come losses and disappointments, baffled hopes, and a
   multitude of graves. The lesson must be learnt; and if you cannot learn
   it in a throng, you must learn it in solitude. He will be "the first
   and the last," the chief and all in your hearts; and that not for His
   own sake, but for yours. He will have you to draw out and realise the
   whole of your bond and betrothal with Him, that you may sit down with
   Him, and with all your beloved ones, at the great marriage supper. It
   is a good thing, then, to try ourselves often, and to ask, "If such or
   such a solace were taken away, could I stay myself upon His love? If I
   had none of these things, would He suffice me? If He should say, Keep
   all without Me; or give up all, and keep Me alone; which should I
   choose? If I could now leave all, and go to sit at His feet, would this
   be happiness?" If not, then let us not wonder if we be chastened. Let
   us not doubt His tenderness in afflicting. It is because He sees that,
   with this blessing or that happiness, with this friend or that child,
   you will never be able to say, "I am His." Therefore He makes your
   heart empty, that your love may gather itself again in strength, and
   fasten upon Him alone. Not only are His chastisements in love, but they
   are for love, for the sake of love. The final end is, that we may be
   made perfect in love; that the gift of His love may be shed abroad in
   us, and a drop of that holy fire which He came to kindle may fall into
   our hearts, and purge them seven times for Himself.

   2. But in this we see further the true pledge of our perseverance unto
   the end. Our whole salvation is begun, continued, and ended in His
   love. There is no other account to be given of it. How this is
   interwoven with the intricate mystery of our probation, we cannot now
   discern. Why should we? If we cannot believe this, where is our faith?
   To what fountain but His changeless love can we trace up the stream of
   mercy, which has borne us onward unto this day? His grace descended
   upon us when we were unconscious. It bare with us through long years of
   sinful ignorance; it restrained us from unknown ways of perdition, on
   which we were resolutely bent; it converted us when we were dead in
   security; it has upheld us through all dangers, declensions, and
   swervings, even to this day. If He had, at any hour, renounced His
   pledges with us, we must have perished. Here is the wonderful token of
   His patient love. He has preserved us not only from the power of sin,
   but from and against ourselves. Not only would sin have destroyed us,
   but we should have destroyed ourselves. He has watched over us as a
   guide and keeper. While we have been struggling to break from Him, His
   love has held us fast. He held us, pitying our ignorance, knowing our
   will, that as yet we had no true will of our own, but a slavish will; a
   will not free, because in bondage to our own sins. It is as if He had
   said, "Thou shalt not perish so. Thou shalt at least first see Me, and
   thyself in My light; and then perish if thou wilt,--if thou canst."

   And that same love is the pledge of blessings yet to come. He that kept
   us from perishing when we were willing to perish, will surely keep us
   from perishing now that we are trembling to be saved. If He kept us
   while we loved the sweetness of sin, He will, beyond all doubt, hold us
   up now that we abhor it. It is from this love of sin that He will save
   us. When we are overcome with shame and fear because sin is still
   alluring to our eyes and pleasant to the taste, we may go to Him with
   this special confidence, that He will either make it to be hideous and
   bitter, or He will give us grace to withstand it to the end. If sin
   were hateful and tormenting, like sharp wounds or searing irons, where
   would be our danger? "No man ever yet hated his own flesh;" no man
   would be in peril of torturing himself into perdition. It is only
   because sin is sweet that it is perilous; and if it be sweet to us, it
   is because we are fallen and in a state of trial. He will not count us
   guilty because sin is alluring, but only because we consent to its
   allurement. To hate it in spite of its sweetness, and to hate it for
   its sweetness, to be humbled with shame and sorrow at the consciousness
   that it has any power over us, and we any susceptibility of its
   attraction,--this is His work in us, and the pledge of our safety.
   Against this life-long peril our strength is His love. We may go to
   Him, and hold fast by Him, and none of these things shall set on to
   hurt us. But perhaps we may say, "Yes, this I would do, if I were sure
   of myself; but here is my chief misgiving and my greatest danger,--the
   instability, changeableness, fickleness of myself: what can I say to
   this?" We may say, "I am not my own; I am His. I cannot help myself. If
   He should give me into my own keeping, I should perish outright. My
   intentions, my resolutions, my strength, my strivings, are faint,
   treacherous, soon wearied out, soon abandoned; but I can give myself
   over into His hands, and ask Him to keep me, for I cannot keep myself."
   This we may answer. And what more would we desire to say? What more can
   we say than this: "I am sinful, prone to fall, ready to slide at every
   step. Every kind of sin is stronger than I. Pride, vainglory, sloth,
   envy, anger, and the like, seize on me, and infuse themselves into my
   heart even against my will. Sometimes, for a moment, I even consent to
   them; or, if I do not consent to them, I feel them with such a fulness
   and vividness as shews my heart to be of their close kindred. And,
   besides this, the wayward, moody, cold, estranged, loveless temper of
   my own mind is always making breaches between Him and me. I am always
   ready to perish, always perishing in my own hands. The root of death is
   in my own soul. It is against myself that I need a helper." Blessed
   hope and trust. We may give ourselves into His hands; we may go to Him,
   and, trembling, say, "I am afraid of myself, and dare not trust myself
   alone. Take me, for I am not my own. I am Thine, by my bond and pledge,
   by Thine own blood and by Thine own love, by Thy promise and by Thy
   betrothal. Take that Thine is, and keep it for me, lest I lose it
   utterly." What more can we say or need? "I know whom I have believed,
   and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed
   unto Him against that day." [234]

   3. And lastly, in this there is our true and only stay in death. If we
   were saints, if we loved Him with all our soul and with all our
   strength, the most blessed day in life would be the last. To go and be
   with Him whom our soul loveth; to be for ever with Him, gazing upon His
   face of love, ourselves sinless and living by love alone,--this is
   heaven. Does it not shame and affright us to read how His true
   servants, not only the greater, but even those who were among the
   least, have panted for that meeting; counting life a banishment, and
   the world desolate, and time laggard and slow? When the forerunners of
   death seemed to appear and greet them, when friends were full of eager
   sorrow, they rejoiced; evil tidings were to them glad tidings of good;
   for the end of their pilgrimage was come, and the vision of peace all
   but revealed. Why was this so with them? why did they not shrink and
   tremble? why did not their hearts beat with the fear of death?

   Why, but because they could say, from the soul of their very being, "My
   Beloved is mine, and I am His." "Perfect love casteth out fear. . . .
   He that feareth is not made perfect in love." [235] We are conscious of
   many sins, of a poor languid repentance, of a weak faith, doubting
   hope, and of a love rather in word and in tongue, in the reason and
   imagination, than in life and heart. A sense of our unfitness to call
   Him "My Beloved," or to stand before Him as His,--this shakes our very
   soul with fear. In such an hour where shall we find a stay? Where but
   in this, "He loves me; He loves me more than I love myself. On His
   side" this is sure. On mine; I love Him. He knows how little, yet He
   knows I do; or at least, that to love Him is my desire. Lord, Thou
   knowest that I love Thee.' Who shall separate me from the love of
   Christ?' He will not, and I dare not. Who, then, can? The powers of
   this world cannot reach into the world unseen. The gates of hell cannot
   prevail against the Rock on which I stand. Satan hath nothing in Him,
   nor through Him in me. It is sin that drives me closer to His Cross. My
   own will I have given into His hand; He will not leave me to myself."

   Let us ask again, "Who, then, shall separate me? There is none that
   can. Though all powers of hell be against me for my unutterable guilt,
   all holy powers are on my side. God the Father loves me, and gave His
   Son for me; God the Son loves me, and gave Himself to me; God the Holy
   Ghost loves me, and has regenerated, prevented, restrained, converted
   me; the ever-blessed Trinity loves me, and desires my salvation; all
   heavenly powers and all holy angels love and rejoice over one penitent
   soul. The whole world unseen is benign and blessed, full of love to
   sinners, of whom I am chief.' I give myself into the hands of a
   boundless love: as an infinite misery, I cast myself upon an infinite
   mercy. This is my only stay, but it is all-sufficing." Let this be your
   answer.

   But that we may be able to cast ourselves on this in death, we must
   make it our perpetual stay in life. We must live in the grace of faith,
   hope, and love; or when our trial comes, we shall find our hearts
   fearful, doubtful, and shrinking. Let us more and more strive to see
   Him by faith, by the vision of our hearts, and to rest ourselves upon a
   full trust of His loving-kindness. Above all, let our labour and our
   prayer be, that we may love Him with an uniting and absorbing love. For
   what end did we come into this world, but that we might be united to
   Him eternally? What is the end for which we were redeemed, yea, by the
   foreknowledge of God created, but that we should be one with Him, as He
   is with the Father? The old creation was but a type of the new; the
   first espousals a shadow of that eternal marriage between the second
   Adam and the Church of the elect. Wonderful, and surpassing all thought
   and heart of man! Our spiritual sight is darkened before so great a
   splendour. What seems to us to be but a restoration is the ascent of a
   perfect work. The first is last, and the last first. "Thou art worthy,
   O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for Thou hast created
   all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created." [236] "And
   I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of
   many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia:
   for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice, and
   give honour to Him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife
   hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be
   arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the
   righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they
   which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith
   unto me, These are the true sayings of God." [237]

SERMON XXIII.

  THE VISION OF BEAUTY.

    ISAIAH xxxiii. 17.

   "Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty: they shall behold the
   land that is very far off."

   THESE words are so plain a prophecy of the beatific vision in the
   kingdom of the resurrection, that we may pass over the earthly and
   typical fulfilment they have already received; and go at once to the
   thought of what shall he hereafter. Who is this King but He on whose
   head St. John saw many crowns; on whose vesture and on whose thigh was
   written the name of power: "King of kings and Lord of lords?"

   And "the land that is very far off;" what is it but that same of which
   Zechariah prophesied? "The Lord their God shall save them in that day
   as the flock of His people; for they shall be as the stones of a crown,
   lifted up as an ensign upon His land." [238] It can be no other than
   the heavenly country, for love of which God's elect have lived as
   strangers in the earth--a land far away, over a long path of many
   years, up weary mountains, and through deep broken ways, full of perils
   and of pitfalls--through sicknesses, and weariness, sorrows, and
   burdens, and the valley of the shadow of death; world-worn and
   foot-sore, they have been faring forth, one by one, since the world
   began, "going and weeping." And there is already gathered a multitude
   which no man can number, in the last passes which ascend into "the land
   which is far off."

   These words, then, plainly promise to every follower of Christ, if he
   shall persevere unto the end, that in the resurrection he shall see the
   Lord Jesus Christ in His beauty, and in the glory of His kingdom.

   Let us now endeavour reverently to meditate on this wonderful promise
   of bliss: and may the light of His Spirit cleanse our hearts to
   understand so much as is good for us to know; and may His pity keep us
   back from vain and rash thoughts of so high a mystery.

   What, then, is this beauty which shall be revealed to all who attain
   that world and the resurrection of the holy dead?

   1. First, it would seem to be the beauty of His heavenly court. Both
   from the elder prophets and from the revelation given to St. John, we
   know that there is a sphere and circuit of which the centre is His
   throne. Whether this be called "the heaven of heavens," [239] or "the
   third heaven," [240] or "eternity," [241] or "the high and holy place,"
   [242] or "the light which no man can approach unto," [243] or "mount
   Zion," [244] or "the new heavens and the new earth," [245] is all one:
   all these titles of majesty point to one and the same place--a sphere
   of light and an orb of glory, of which prophets and apostles have had
   glances and reflections in ecstacy and rapture. "I saw the Lord sitting
   upon His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him." [246]
   "There was under His feet as it were a sapphire stone, and as it were
   the body of heaven in his clearness." [247] "Above it stood the
   seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and
   with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly." [248] "I
   will take My rest," saith the Lord, "and consider in my dwelling-place
   like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of
   harvest." [249]

   What was in this way revealed only through a veil of old, is now, by
   the rending of the veil, made manifest and open. "When the Son of Man
   shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve
   thrones." [250] "Behold, a throne was set in heaven, and One sat on the
   throne. And He that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
   stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like
   unto an emerald. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats:
   and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in
   white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold." [251] "Lo,
   in the midst of the throne stood a Lamb as it had been slain." [252]
   "Lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and
   kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before
   the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands." [253]
   "And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with Him an
   hundred and forty and four thousand, having His Father's Name written
   in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of
   many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice
   of harpers harping with their harps. And they sung as it were a new
   song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and
   no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four
   thousand, which were redeemed from the earth." [254] "Come hither; I
   will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. And he carried me away in
   the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city,
   the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory
   of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a
   jasper stone, clear as crystal; and had a wall great and high, and had
   twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written
   thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
   Israel: on the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south
   three gates; and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had
   twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the
   Lamb. . . . . And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several
   gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it
   were transparent glass. And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God
   Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of
   the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did
   lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof." [255] "And he shewed me
   a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the
   throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on
   either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve
   manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of
   the tree were for the healing of the nations. And there shall be no
   more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and
   His servants shall serve Him: and they shall see His face; and His Name
   shall be in their foreheads." [256]

   It seemed best, in trying to realise the outline and beauty of the
   heavenly court, to gather together as much as we could from the clear
   Scriptures of God. Here we cannot go astray. What the Holy Ghost has
   revealed of the home of saints, and the kingdom of the resurrection, is
   as certain and real as the visible creation of God. If here and there a
   word or two seem to refer these glorious visions to the Church on
   earth, and to prophecies of its unity and sanctity in time, let this
   one great law of revelation be remembered: The prophecies and parables
   of the earthly perfection of the Church are anticipations of its
   perfection in heaven. They are examples of the Divine prerogative of
   calling "things that are not, as though they were;" and of giving to
   germs the honour of maturity; to weak beginnings the investiture and
   glory of their eternal perfection. The visible Church on earth is the
   sphere on which the Divine Spirit casts the image of its future glory.
   Therefore what we here read is a figure, a parable to exalt the Church
   on earth to the eye of faith; but it is also a revelation of the glory
   of the heavenly court, as it shall be hereafter seen by the pure in
   heart.

   Let us, then, sum up, as we can, in our weak words and thoughts, the
   beauty which is here revealed. What is it but the glory of the blessed
   Three, and of the Word made flesh, sitting upon the throne of the
   Eternal? About Him and before Him are the companies of heaven, the
   hosts and hierarchies of the blessed, the nine orders of seraphic and
   angelic ministers, and the saintly multitude of God's new creation.
   Vision of beauty too intense even for thought! What must be the glory
   of one saint made perfect in the likeness of our Lord! what splendour
   of incorruption, where death and sin are not! What, then, shall be the
   beauty of that gathered host, of which the least would overwhelm our
   sight and soul with brightness? Armies of martyrs, companies of
   prophets, the majesty of patriarchs, the glory of apostles, each one in
   the full transfigured beauty of his own perfect spirit, and all
   revealing the warfare of faith, the triumph of the Church, the power of
   the Cross, the election of God; these are the degrees and ascents
   leading upward to the throne of bliss.

   2. But if such be the beauty of the King's court, what is the beauty of
   the King Himself? of His glorious Person as very God and very man? It
   is not for us to let loose our imagination without warrant, or at least
   without adumbrations of truth, without either tokens or shadows which
   reveal the forms from which they fall. And in holy Scripture we have
   some such intimations. Isaiah promises that we shall see "His beauty."
   Zechariah breaks out, even from afar off, and with a faint sight of His
   person dimly revealed: "How great is His beauty!" [257] Solomon in
   spirit and in the person of the Church says, He is "the chiefest among
   ten thousand. His mouth is most sweet, yea, He is altogether lovely.
   This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend." [258] And David, "Thou art
   fairer than the children of men." [259] Do not these things lead us on
   to understand why the child Jesus, as He "increased in wisdom and
   stature," increased also "in favour with God and man:" [260] why His
   very presence should have had a power to awaken love, as it also
   awakened wonder at "His understanding and answers;" [261] "at the
   gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth." [262] Surely it was
   something more than interior beauty which drew to Him the sick, the
   sorrowing, the sinful, the helpless, with such mighty attraction. For
   the interior beauty of the spirit needs a spiritual eye. When Isaiah
   foretells that He should have "no form nor comeliness, and when we
   shall see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him;" [263] he
   seems plainly to speak of the worldly attraction and royal beauty for
   which the Jews were lusting, of that "observation" which was no
   forerunner or herald of the kingdom of God. It does not speak of that
   Presence before which the multitudes gave way, as the waters clave
   before the ark of God; and at the sight of which a host, armed to take
   Him, went backward and fell to the ground. It is surely no light thing
   that the Christian world in its universal tradition of half a hundred
   generations, has piously and intimately believed that the second Adam,
   like the first, bore the outward signatures of God's perfect hand. It
   is not without some deep reason, dwelling in universal belief among
   those countless things which, if written, should have filled the whole
   world with Scriptures; or in the intuitions of the Spirit, or in the
   instincts of love, or in the self-evident harmonies of God's works; it
   is not, I say, without some or all of these reasons, that the world has
   believed that prophets, psalmists, and seers knew what they spake, and
   spake what they beheld. It is a pardonable fault to take them in the
   letter of their words, and a harmless error to go astray with the
   belief of Christendom. We shall not be dangerously out of the way, if
   we lovingly and humbly believe that He who is the brightness of His
   Father's glory, and the express image of His person, did take unto
   Himself our manhood as His revealed presence for ever, in its most
   perfect image and likeness; that where two natures were united, as both
   were perfect, so both were beautiful. I know not what he may be to whom
   such a thought is not blessed. We bear witness to it by the fond, blind
   way in which we invest all we love with beauty. Even the least comely
   and ill-favoured are lovely to those that love them. Our minds are full
   of lights and hues, with which we array the objects of our hearts. Let
   each do as he will. Only let us first love Him, and then weigh these
   thoughts. Till then, it is all too soon.

   But be these things as they may, there is a beauty we know Him to
   possess in fulness, the beauty of perfect love. If the hardest-featured
   of those who love us be lovely to our eyes; if the tenderness,
   sympathy, observance and anxious affection, the soul of love which
   speaks from every line, and from every motion of the eye and of the
   countenance of friends, draw our whole heart into them as if we rather
   lived in them and by them, than by a life in ourselves; if their coming
   and their presence, their speech and their silent gaze, be to us as
   beauty and delight; what shall be His presence and His countenance in
   the kingdom of the resurrection? What shall be the beauty of perfect
   meekness, perfect humility, perfect tenderness, perfect love, of
   perfect delight in our love, and perfect bliss in our sinless peace? "O
   wonder of love, O Friend all gentle, all pure, all wise, in whose
   presence to abide, under whose loving gaze to dwell, is heaven; shall
   we indeed see Thy beauty? Shall we see Thy form all majesty, and Thy
   countenance all love? Shall we look upon that of which we read in
   gospels, muse on before the altar, and picture in the heavens? Is it to
   us, is it to me, let each one ask, that Thou hast pledged Thy troth,
   that I shall see Thee with these very eyes wherewith I now see my own
   form and the face of this fleeting world? Shall I see the wounds, the
   five hallowed wounds, which Thou didst shew to Thy friends when the
   doors were shut, on the night of the resurrection; and the very print
   of the nails, and the radiant circle of Thy crown of thorns? And shall
   I know and feel All this was for me,--consciously, and with clear
   intent, suffered upon earth for me?' O Love greater than love of man;
   Love of God, Love eternal, which created me, suffered for me, died for
   me, bare with me in my long, blind, stubborn rebellions, spared,
   shielded, restrained, converted me by holy inspirations, and the
   pleadings of tender upbraiding,--do I now see Thee face to face? Art
   Thou He that has ever blessed me behind the veil, and spread over me
   day and night Thy pierced hands, on whose palms my name was graven with
   the nails of crucifixion; out of whose depths has issued for me nothing
   but Thy precious blood and Thy cleansing grace all the days of my life?
   Now I behold Thy beauty, whom having not seen,' I desired to love; and
   in whom, though I saw Thee not as yet, I rejoiced, so far as my cold,
   loveless soul, conscious of sin, and shrinking from Thy pure presence,
   could rejoice and love. It was my blindness that hid from me Thy
   beauty. If I had loved, I should have perceived Thy love; and should
   have chosen Thy sweetness before all happiness on earth. But Thou hast
   saved me from my sins and from myself, and hast brought me to this land
   which is very far off;' far off from sorrow and crying, from death and
   sin; and hast revealed to me Thy beauty in the vision of peace. Lord,
   it is enough: I desire no more: be this eternal, and it is enough for
   ever." Surely if we can venture to breathe such things, these will be
   among the thoughts of those who attain that world and the kingdom of
   the resurrection. But who can utter or conceive the beauty of the love
   of our ever-blessed Lord beaming from His Divine countenance, as the
   sun shineth in his strength? In that face will be revealed all the love
   of His holy Incarnation, of His life of sorrow, of His agony and
   passion, of His Cross and death. As if the soul and the accents of our
   manhood were not enough to express His love; as if promises of grace
   and works of mercy were inarticulate, He must speak to us in the
   language of agony, and print upon Himself for ever the characters of a
   "love which passeth knowledge." Therefore, in the midst of the throne
   was seen "a Lamb as if it had been slain." The wounds of His hands and
   feet, and of His pierced side, are eternal seals and countersigns of
   the love which has redeemed us for Himself.

   And what can we more say? If this be His beauty as very man, what must
   be His beauty as very God? What must be that Divine, uncreated beauty,
   ancient but ever new, which, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, is
   also in the Son? It is not a human or finite love which shall be seen
   in the face of the Word made flesh, but the mercy, compassion,
   tenderness, of the Eternal. God, who has revealed Himself to us in
   sundry ways and in divers manners; in the lights of heaven and the
   beauty of the earth, in life-giving seasons and fruitful suns, in
   prophecies and promises, in miracles and visions, by all the accents
   and in all the compass of human speech, as if all tongues had failed,
   and all language were too weak, has for our sake created a new speech
   and a new language for the utterance of His eternal love. He gave the
   Son of His love to be made man, to suffer, and to die, to redeem us
   from sin and death; to gather us, by His Spirit, about His throne, and
   to reveal to us, through human sympathy and the accents and the sorrows
   of our own nature, the perfection of His everlasting love. It is the
   love of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the beauty of the ever-blessed
   Three, the Holy One, that is revealed to us in the person of the King
   of Saints. But here, let us rest and adore, lest we break through the
   fence, and sin against the majesty not yet unveiled.

   We have come, then, to the end of all our thoughts and toils. For what
   else were we born, and for what end came we into the world, but to
   behold the face of God? This is the end for which we were created; to
   this, as to its source and rest, our being tends; unto this all the
   mysteries and movements of His power and love, in nature and in the
   Spirit, invite and draw us. To love God, and to die; this is the end of
   man: or read it in the light of heaven, to love God, and to dwell in
   God for ever,--this is our being and our bliss.

   Now with two plain thoughts, full of soothing hope, we will make an
   end.

   1. The first is, that the King whose beauty is the bliss of heaven is
   ever drawing and preparing us for His presence by all the mysteries of
   His Church. What is our Baptism but the real engrafting of our whole
   being, in body and soul, into this supernatural order, of which His
   heavenly court is the ripe and perfect fruit? What are all they who are
   gathered round Him now, and all who shall be gathered round Him when
   the whole mystical number is fulfilled, but poor sinners fallen and
   dead, born again by His free Spirit, and drawn by a succession of
   graces, each one linked within the other? There is a divine order in
   the scheme of our salvation, "descending from the first effect unto the
   last; that is, from the fruit, which is glory, to the root of this fair
   tree, which is the redemption of the Saviour. For the Divine goodness
   bestows glory upon merits, merits upon love, love upon penitence,
   penitence upon obedience to vocation, obedience to vocation upon
   vocation, and vocation upon the redemption of the Saviour; on which
   rests the whole of that mystical ladder of the great Jacob, as well in
   heaven, forasmuch as it ends in the loving bosom of the everlasting
   Father, in which He receives and glorifies the elect; as also upon
   earth, forasmuch as it is planted on the bosom and in the pierced side
   of the Saviour, who died to redeem us on mount Calvary." [264] By this
   golden chain He draws us to Himself; working in us by the power of His
   grace, unfolding the interior capacities and faculties of our spiritual
   life; in some, from the gift of regeneration, onward through childhood,
   boyhood, youth, unto the ripeness of perfect life, by an ever advancing
   growth of purity and of fellowship with His veiled presence; in others,
   after waywardness and rebellion, by sharp scourges and barbed shafts,
   wounding the soul with appalling fears and pangs of conscious guilt,
   bowing them to the yoke of repentance, and through the grace of penance
   perfecting their conversion. By these two main paths of grace, but with
   infinite varieties of light and shadow, He leads us on, enlarging our
   inward and spiritual sense of desire and sight.

   But He not only works within us; He also proposes to our spiritual
   faculties an object of faith to prepare us for His manifested presence.
   He that is enthroned in "the land that is very far off" is the same
   that said, "Lo, I am with you alway." He is with us in the midst of His
   heavenly court. Even now it is "not far from any one of us." In the
   blessed Sacrament of the altar He reveals Himself in His beauty to the
   sight of the pure in heart. He is there sitting upon His exalted
   throne, and His train fills the temple. There is the Word made flesh,
   the Lamb that was slain, angels and archangels, and all the company of
   heaven. What is not there where He is, in Whom are all things? This is
   the great reality of Truth, by which the regenerate live with Him in
   God. All the whole life of Christ's true servants upon earth is the
   melting of a twilight as it brightens into day. The world in which they
   live, indeed, is hidden, veiled, for a while, with shadows, sacraments,
   and symbols. But through all, the radiance of the Eternal Beauty shines
   upon them; and through all, their sight pierces, with a spiritual
   intuition, even to the land and kingdom of peace. But on earth there is
   no approach beyond the real presence of the Word made flesh. The altar
   is His throne, already seen. After this there remains nothing but "the
   King in His beauty" seen face to face.

   2. And lastly, the other truth for our consolation is this: that by a
   special and particular discipline, varied and measured for the
   necessities of every faithful soul, He is making us ready for the
   vision of His presence. The discipline of His Sacraments and mysteries
   is common to all members of His body: but the discipline of His
   chastising love is particular, and for each. By the gifts of His grace
   we are prepared for His chastisements, and by His chastisements we are
   prepared for fuller measures of His grace. If we resist His Spirit, or
   grieve Him by our rebellions, or hang back and sullenly refuse His
   leading, He has scourges of sharpness and of love to chasten us into
   faith. The experience of every one who has been brought under this
   loving discipline issues in one word: "Before I was afflicted, I went
   wrong." [265] "One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see."
   [266] It is not only the careless and lukewarm, but the wakened and
   devout, who feel under chastisement as if, for the first time, they had
   received their sight. The whole order of the Church, and all its
   sacraments of grace, seem to unfold themselves into a new revelation of
   truth and meaning. Not that any thing without us is altered, but
   because we are changed within. Our Baptism, on which we used to look as
   a font of pure water, we perceive to be "the river of the water of
   life," the grave of Christ, the mystical death, "the beginning of the
   new creation of God," the power of a holy resurrection. The Church
   rises before us on twelve foundations, builded four-square, the
   precincts of the holy city, and the avenue to the paradise of God; its
   order is linked with the hierarchies of heaven; its unity ascends into
   the heavenly court; its altars become one with that which stands upon
   Mount Sion, on which is the very Paschal Lamb. Even when seemingly most
   deprived of all outward channels of grace, these things are most deeply
   realised. In long exile from the sanctuary and the altar, when all
   seems most against them, then is His time of grace. Then He seems to
   reveal Himself with a directer light, and to shew that He is Lord also
   of the Church; that sacraments were ordained for man, not man for
   sacraments. He thus ministers to us by the interior priesthood of His
   mystical Body; and makes to overflow, by spiritual communion, the very
   souls who have in time past drawn but scanty graces from the visible
   sacrament of His love. And where is all this change but in ourselves,
   in the clearer purging of our inward sight, and the awakening of keener
   desires for the vision of peace? Such is the work wrought in us by the
   inward discipline of pain and trial, of sorrow and of passion, whereby
   He makes His own know that they are His. Blessed tokens, though sharp
   and piercing; deep-cutting prints of the nails of the Cross; yet
   marking off those He chooses from the world, consecrating them,
   trembling and shrinking, to Himself. "Blessed are ye that weep" now,
   whether in contradiction, or bereavement, or sickness, or fear. Every
   visitation is a stage of advance in your walk of faith. Every
   chastisement is sent to open a new page in the great Book of Life--to
   shew you things within you which you knew not, and things which
   hereafter shall be your portion. He is cleansing the power of sight in
   you, that it may become intense and strong to bear His presence: and
   that power of sight is love; fervent and purifying love, consuming
   every sin, and purging out every stain. The more fervently you cleave
   to Him by love, the clearer shall be your vision of His beauty. Then
   welcome all He sends, if so be we may see Him at last, where there is
   no more sin, where truth has no shadow, where unity and sanctity have
   no dispute. Welcome sorrow, trial, fear, and the shadow of death, if
   only our sin be blotted out, and our lot secure in the lowest room, in
   the light of His face, before the throne of His beauty, in our home and
   in our rest for ever.
