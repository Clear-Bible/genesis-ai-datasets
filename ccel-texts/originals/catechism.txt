A PURITAN CATECHISM

With Proofs

  Compiled by

C. H. Spurgeon

"Heir of the Puritans"
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am persuaded that the use of a good Catechism in all our families
   will be a great safeguard against the increasing errors of the times,
   and therefore I have compiled this little manual from the Westminster
   Assembly's and Baptist Catechisms, for the use of my own church and
   congregation. Those who use it in their families or classes must labour
   to explain the sense; but the words should be carefully learned by
   heart, for they will be understood better as years pass. May the Lord
   bless my dear friends and their families evermore, is the prayer of
   their loving Pastor.

   C. H. Spurgeon

   Published about Oct 14, 1855, when Spurgeon was 21 years old. On Oct.
   14, Spurgeon preached Sermon No. 46 to several thousand who gathered to
   hear him at New Park Street Chapel. When the sermon was published it
   contained an announcement of this catechism. The text that morning was,
   "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations." Ps. 90:1.
