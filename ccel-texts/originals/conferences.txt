                                    PREFACE



   THE obligation, which was promised to the blessed Pope Castor in the
   preface to those volumes which with God's help I composed in twelve
   books on the Institutes of the Coenobia, and the remedies for the eight
   principal faults, has now been, as far as my feeble ability permitted,
   satisfied. I should certainly like to see what was the opinion fairly
   arrived at on this work both by his judgment and yours, whether, on a
   matter so profound and so lofty, and one which has never yet been made
   the subject of a treatise, we have produced anything worthy of your
   notice, and of the eager desire of all the holy brethren. But now as
   the aforesaid Bishop has left us and departed to Christ, meanwhile
   these ten Conferences of the grandest of the Fathers, viz., the
   Anchorites who dwelt in the desert of Scete, which he, fired with an
   incomparable desire for saintliness, had bidden me write for him in the
   same style (not considering in the greatness of his affection, what a
   burden he placed on shoulders too weak to bear it)--these Conferences I
   have thought good to dedicate to you in particular, O blessed Pope, [1]
   Leontius, [2] and holy brother Helladius. [3] For one of you was united
   to him whom I have mentioned, by the ties of brotherhood, and the rank
   of the priesthood, and (what is more to the point) by fervour in sacred
   study, and so has an hereditary right to demand the debt due to his
   brother: while the other has ventured to follow the sublime customs of
   the Anchorites, not like some others, presumptuously on his own
   account, but seizing, at the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, on the
   right path of doctrine almost before he had been taught and choosing to
   learn not so much from his own ideas as from their traditions. Wherein
   just as I had anchored in the harbour of Silence, a wide sea opens out
   before me, so that I must venture to hand down for posterity some of
   the Institutes and teaching of these great men. For the bark of my
   slender abilities will be exposed to the dangers of a longer voyage on
   the deep, in proportion as the Anchorite's life is grander than that of
   the Coenobium, and the contemplation of God, to which those inestimable
   men ever devoted themselves, more sublime than ordinary practical life.
   It is yours therefore to assist our efforts by your pious prayers for
   fear lest so sacred a subject that is to be treated in an untried but
   faithful manner, should be imperilled by us, or lest by our simplicity
   should lose itself in the depths of the subject matter. Let us
   therefore pass from what is visible to the eye and the external mode of
   life of the monks, of which we treated in the former books, to the life
   of the inner man, which is hidden from view; and from the system of the
   canonical prayers, let our discourse mount to that continuance in
   unceasing prayer, which the Apostle enjoins, that whoever has through
   reading our former work already spiritually gained the name of Jacob by
   ousting his carnal faults, may now by the reception of the Institutes
   which are not mine but the fathers', mount by a pure insight to the
   merits and (so to speak) the dignity of Israel, and in the same way be
   taught what it is that he should observe on these lofty heights of
   perfection. [4] And so may your prayers gain from Him, Who has deemed
   us worthy both to see them and to learn from them and to dwell with
   them, that He will vouchsafe to grant us a perfect recollection of
   their teaching, and a ready tongue to tell it, that we may explain them
   as beautifully and as exactly as we received them from them and may
   succeed in setting before you the men themselves incorporated, as it
   were, in their own Institutes, and what is more to the point, speaking
   in the Latin tongue. Of this however we wish above all to advertise the
   reader of these Conferences as well as of our earlier works, that if
   there chances to be anything herein which by reason of his condition
   and the character of his profession, or owing to custom and the common
   mode of life seems to him either impossible or very difficult, he
   should measure it not by the limits of his own powers but by the worth
   and perfection of the speakers, whose zeal and purpose he should first
   consider, as they were truly dead to this worldly life, and so hampered
   by no feelings for their kinsmen according to the flesh, and by no ties
   of worldly occupations. Next let him bear in mind the character of the
   country in which they dwelt, how they lived in a vast desert, and were
   cut off from intercourse with all their fellow-men, and thus were able
   to have their minds enlightened, and to contemplate, and utter those
   things which perhaps will seem impossibilities to the uninitiated and
   uninstructed, because of their way of life and the commonplace
   character of their habits. But if any one wants to give a true opinion
   on this matter, and is anxious to try whether such perfection can be
   attained, let him first endeavour to make his purpose their own, with
   the same zeal and the same mode of life, and then in the end he will
   find that those things which used to seem beyond the powers of men, are
   not only possible, but really delightful. But now let us proceed at
   once to their Conferences and Institutes.

   [4] The allusion is rather forced and strained. But Cassian means to
   say that those who have got the better of their carnal sins by perusing
   his former work, are already fit to be named Jacob (the supplanter),
   who got the better of his brother: and he hopes that this new work of
   his will give them such a view of God and insight into His dealings
   that they may be worthy to have their name changed, as Jacob's was, to
   Israel, which he takes to mean the man seeing God. Cf. the note on
   Against Nestorius, VII. ix. (intelligibilis here = spiritualis, cf.

                                 CONFERENCE 1.

FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT MOSES.

ON THE GOAL OR THE AIM OF THE MONK.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Of our stay in Scete, and that which we proposed to Abbot Moses.

   WHEN I was in the desert of Scete, where are the most excellent
   monastic fathers and where all perfection flourishes, in company with
   the holy father Germanus (who had since the earliest days and
   commencement of our spiritual service been my closest companion both in
   the coenobium and in the desert, so that to show the harmony of our
   friendship and aims, everybody would say that a single heart and soul
   existed in our two bodies), I sought out Abbot Moses, [5] who was
   eminent amid those splendid flowers, not only in practical but also in
   contemplative excellence, in my anxiety to be grounded by his
   instruction: and together we implored him to give us a discourse for
   our edification; not without tears, for we knew full well his
   determination never to consent to open the gate of perfection, except
   to those who desired it with all faithfulness, and sought it with all
   sorrow of heart; for fear lest if he showed it at random to those who
   cared nothing for it, or only desired it in a half-hearted way, by
   opening what is necessary, and what ought only to be discovered to
   those seeking perfection, to unworthy persons, and such as accepted it
   with scorn, he might appear to lay himself open either to the charge of
   bragging, or to the sin of betraying his trust; and at last being
   overcome by our prayers he thus began.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    Of the question of Abbot Moses, who asked what was the goal and what the end
    of the monk.

   ALL the arts and sciences, said he, have some goal or mark; and end or
   aim of their own, on which the diligent pursuer of each art has his
   eye, and so endures all sorts of toils and dangers and losses,
   cheerfully and with equanimity, e.g., the farmer, shunning neither at
   one time the scorching heat of the sun, nor at another the frost and
   cold, cleaves the earth unweariedly, and again and again subjects the
   clods of his field to his ploughshare, while he keeps before him his
   goal; viz., by diligent labour to break it up small like fine sand, and
   to clear it of all briers, and free it from all weeds, as he believes
   that in no other way can he gain his ultimate end, which is to secure a
   good harvest, and a large crop; on which he can either live himself
   free from care, or can increase his possessions. Again, when his barn
   is well stocked he is quite ready to empty it, and with incessant
   labour to commit the seed to the crumbling furrow, thinking nothing of
   the present lessening of his stores in view of the future harvest.
   Those men too who are engaged in mercantile pursuits, have no dread of
   the uncertainties and chances of the ocean, and fear no risks, while an
   eager hope urges them forward to their aim of gain. Moreover those who
   are inflamed with the ambition of military life, while they look
   forward to their aim of honours and power take no notice of danger and
   destruction in their wanderings, and are not crushed by present losses
   and wars, while they are eager to obtain the end of some honour held
   out to them. And our profession too has its own goal and end, for which
   we undergo all sorts of toils not merely without weariness but actually
   with delight; on account of which the want of food in fasting is no
   trial to us, the weariness of our vigils becomes a delight; reading and
   constant meditation on the Scriptures does not pall upon us; and
   further incessant toil, and self-denial, and the privation of all
   things, and the horrors also of this vast desert have no terrors for
   us. And doubtless for this it was that you yourselves despised the love
   of kinsfolk, and scorned your fatherland, and the delights of this
   world, and passed through so many countries, in order that you might
   come to us, plain and simple folk as we are, living in this wretched
   state in the desert. Wherefore, said he, answer and tell me what is the
   goal and end, which incite you to endure all these things so
   cheerfully.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    Of our reply.

   AND when he insisted on eliciting an opinion from us on this question,
   we replied that we endured all this for the sake of the kingdom of
   heaven.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    Of Abbot Moses' question on the aforesaid statement.

   TO which he replied: Good, you have spoken cleverly of the (ultimate)
   end. But what should be our (immediate) goal or mark, by constantly
   sticking close to which we can gain our end, you ought first to know.
   And when we frankly confessed our ignorance, he proceeded: The first
   thing, as I said, in all the arts and sciences is to have some goal,
   i.e., a mark for the mind, and constant mental purpose, for unless a
   man keeps this before him with all diligence and persistence, he will
   never succeed in arriving at the ultimate aim and the gain which he
   desires. For, as I said, the farmer who has for his aim to live free
   from care and with plenty, while his crops are springing has this as
   his immediate object and goal; viz., to keep his field clear from all
   brambles, and weeds, and does not fancy that he can otherwise ensure
   wealth and a peaceful end, unless he first secures by some plan of work
   and hope that which he is anxious to obtain. The business man too does
   not lay aside the desire of procuring wares, by means of which he may
   more profitably amass riches, because he would desire gain to no
   purpose, unless he chose the road which leads to it: and those men who
   are anxious to be decorated with the honours of this world, first make
   up their minds to what duties and conditions they must devote
   themselves, that in the regular course of hope they may succeed in
   gaining the honours they desire. And so the end of our way of life is
   indeed the kingdom of God. But what is the (immediate) goal you must
   earnestly ask, for if it is not in the same way discovered by us, we
   shall strive and wear ourselves out to no purpose, because a man who is
   travelling in a wrong direction, has all the trouble and gets none of
   the good of his journey. And when we stood gaping at this remark, the
   old man proceeded: The end of our profession indeed, as I said, is the
   kingdom of God or the kingdom of heaven: but the immediate aim or goal,
   is purity of heart, without which no one can gain that end: fixing our
   gaze then steadily on this goal as if on a definite mark, let us direct
   our course as straight towards it as possible, and if our thoughts
   wander somewhat from this, let us revert to our gaze upon it, and check
   them accurately as by a sure standard, which will always bring back all
   our efforts to this one mark, and will show at once if our mind has
   wandered ever so little from the direction marked out for it.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    A comparison with a man who is trying to hit a mark.

   AS those, whose business it is to use weapons of war, whenever they
   want to show their skill in their art before a king of this world, try
   to shoot their arrows or darts into certain small targets which have
   the prizes painted on them; for they know that they cannot in any other
   way than by the line of their aim secure the end and the prize they
   hope for, which they will only then enjoy when they have been able to
   hit the mark set before them; but if it happens to be withdrawn from
   their sight, however much in their want of skill their aim may vainly
   deviate from the straight path, yet they cannot perceive that they have
   strayed from the direction of the intended straight line because they
   have no distinct mark to prove the skilfulness of their aim, or to show
   up its badness: and therefore while they shoot their missiles idly into
   space, they cannot see how they have gone wrong or how utterly at fault
   they are, since no mark is their accuser, showing how far they have
   gone astray from the right direction; nor can an unsteady look help
   them to correct and restore the straight line enjoined on them. So then
   the end indeed which we have set before us is, as the Apostle says,
   eternal life, as he declares, "having indeed your fruit unto holiness,
   and the end eternal life;" [6] but the immediate goal is purity of
   heart, which he not unfairly terms "sanctification," without which the
   afore-mentioned end cannot be gained; as if he had said in other words,
   having your immediate goal in purity of heart, but the end life
   eternal. Of which goal the same blessed Apostle teaches us, and
   significantly uses the very term, i.e., skopos, saying as follows,
   "Forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those
   that are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high
   calling of the Lord:" [7] which is more clearly put in Greek kata
   skopon diwkw, i.e., "I press toward the mark, as if he said, "With this
   aim, with which I forget those things that are behind, i.e., the faults
   of earlier life, I strive to reach as the end the heavenly prize."
   Whatever then can help to guide us to this object; viz., purity of
   heart, we must follow with all our might, but whatever hinders us from
   it, we must shun as a dangerous and hurtful thing. For, for this we do
   and endure all things, for this we make light of our kinsfolk, our
   country, honours, riches, the delights of this world, and all kinds of
   pleasures, namely in order that we may retain a lasting purity of
   heart. And so when this object is set before us, we shall always direct
   our actions and thoughts straight towards the attainment of it; for if
   it be not constantly fixed before our eyes, it will not only make all
   our toils vain and useless, and force them to be endured to no purpose
   and without any reward, but it will also excite all kinds of thoughts
   opposed to one another. For the mind, which has no fixed point to which
   it may return, and on which it may chiefly fasten, is sure to rove
   about from hour to hour and minute to minute in all sorts of wandering
   thoughts, and from those things which come to it from outside, to be
   constantly changed into that state which first offers itself to it.

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of those who in renouncing the world, aim at perfection without love.

   FOR hence it arises that in the case of some who have despised the
   greatest possessions of this world, and not only large sums of gold and
   silver, but also large properties, we have seen them afterwards
   disturbed and excited over a knife, or pencil, or pin, or pen. Whereas
   if they kept their gaze steadily fixed out of a pure heart they would
   certainly never allow such a thing to happen for trifles, while in
   order that they might not suffer it in the case of great and precious
   riches they chose rather to renounce them altogether. For often too
   some guard their books so jealously that they will not allow them to be
   even slightly moved or touched by any one else, and from this fact they
   meet with occasions of impatience and death, which give them warning of
   the need of acquiring the requisite patience and love; and when they
   have given up all their wealth for the love of Christ, yet as they
   preserve their former disposition in the matter of trifles, and are
   sometimes quickly upset about them, they become in all points barren
   and unfruitful, as those who are without the charity of which the
   Apostle speaks: and this the blessed Apostle foresaw in spirit, and
   "though," says he, "I give all my goods to feed the poor, and give my
   body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing." [8]
   And from this it clearly follows that perfection is not arrived at
   simply by self-denial, and the giving up of all our goods, and the
   casting away of honours, unless there is that charity, the details of
   which the Apostle describes, which consists in purity of heart alone.
   For "not to be envious," "not to be puffed up, not to be angry, not to
   do any wrong, not to seek one's own, not to rejoice in iniquity, not to
   think evil" etc., what is all this except ever to offer to God a
   perfect and clean heart, and to keep it free from all disturbances?

  CHAPTER VII.

    How peace of mind should be sought.

   EVERYTHING should be done and sought after by us for the sake of this.
   For this we must seek for solitude, for this we know that we ought to
   submit to fastings, vigils, toils, bodily nakedness, reading, and all
   other virtues that through them we may be enabled to prepare our heart
   and to keep it unharmed by all evil passions, and resting on these
   steps to mount to the perfection of charity, and with regard to these
   observances, if by accident we have been employed in some good and
   useful occupation and have been unable to carry out our customary
   discipline, we should not be overcome by vexation or anger, or passion,
   with the object of overcoming which, we were going to do that which we
   have omitted. For the gain from fasting will not balance the loss from
   anger, nor is the profit from reading so great as the harm which
   results from despising a brother. Those things which are of secondary
   importance, such as fastings, vigils, withdrawal from the world,
   meditation on Scripture, we ought to practise with a view to our main
   object, i.e., purity of heart, which is charity, and we ought not on
   their account to drive away this main virtue, for as long as it is
   still found in us intact and unharmed, we shall not be hurt if any of
   the things which are of secondary importance are necessarily omitted;
   since it will not be of the slightest use to have done everything, if
   this main reason of which we have spoken be removed, for the sake of
   which everything is to be done. For on this account one is anxious to
   secure and provide for one's self the implements for any branch of
   work, not simply to possess them to no purpose, nor as if one made the
   profit and advantage, which is looked for from them, to consist in the
   bare fact of possession but that by using them, one may effectually
   secure practical knowledge and the end of that particular art of which
   they are auxiliaries. Therefore fastings, vigils, meditation on the
   Scriptures, self-denial, and the abnegation of all possessions are not
   perfection, but aids to perfection: because the end of that science
   does not lie in these, but by means of these we arrive at the end. He
   then will practise these exercises to no purpose, who is contented with
   these as if they were the highest good, and has fixed the purpose of
   his heart simply on them, and does not extend his efforts towards
   reaching the end, on account of which these should be sought: for he
   possesses indeed the implements of his art, but is ignorant of the end,
   in which all that is valuable resides. Whatever then can disturb that
   purity and peace of mind--even though it may seem useful and
   valuable--should be shunned as really hurtful, for by this rule we
   shall succeed in escaping harm from mistakes and vagaries, and make
   straight for the desired end and reach it.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of the main effort towards the contemplation of heavenly things and an
    illustration from the case of Martha and Mary.

   THIS then should be our main effort: and this steadfast purpose of
   heart we should constantly aspire after; viz., that the soul may ever
   cleave to God and to heavenly things. Whatever is alien to this,
   however great it may be, should be given the second place, or even
   treated as of no consequence, or perhaps as hurtful. We have an
   excellent illustration of this state of mind and condition in the
   gospel in the case of Martha and Mary: for when Martha was performing a
   service that was certainly a sacred one, since she was ministering to
   the Lord and His disciples, and Mary being intent only on spiritual
   instruction was clinging close to the feet of Jesus which she kissed
   and anointed with the ointment of a good confession, she is shown by
   the Lord to have chosen the better part, and one which should not be
   taken away from her: for when Martha was toiling with pious care, and
   was cumbered about her service, seeing that of herself alone she was
   insufficient for such service she asks for the help of her sister from
   the Lord, saying: "Carest Thou not that my sister has left me to serve
   alone: bid her therefore that she help me"--certainly it was to no
   unworthy work, but to a praiseworthy service that she summoned her: and
   yet what does she hear from the Lord? "Martha, Martha, thou art anxious
   and troubled about many things: but few things are needful, or only
   one. Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from
   her." [9] You see then that the Lord makes the chief good consist in
   meditation, i.e., in divine contemplation: whence we see that all other
   virtues should be put in the second place, even though we admit that
   they are necessary, and useful, and excellent, because they are all
   performed for the sake of this one thing. For when the Lord says: "Thou
   art careful and troubled about many things, but few things are needful
   or only one," He makes the chief good consist not in practical work
   however praiseworthy and rich in fruits it may be, but in contemplation
   of Him, which indeed is simple and "but one"; declaring that "few
   things" are needful for perfect bliss, i.e., that contemplation which
   is first secured by reflecting on a few saints: from the contemplation
   of whom, he who has made some progress rises and attains by God's help
   to that which is termed "one thing," i.e., the consideration of God
   alone, so as to get beyond those actions and services of saints, and
   feed on the beauty and knowledge of God alone. "Mary" therefore "chose
   the good part, which shall not be taken away from her." And this must
   be more carefully considered. For when He says that Mary chose the good
   part, although He says nothing of Martha, and certainly does not appear
   to blame her, yet in praising the one, He implies that the other is
   inferior. Again when He says "which shall not be taken away from her"
   He shows that from the other her portion can be taken away (for a
   bodily ministry cannot last forever with a man), but teaches that this
   one's desire can never have an end.

   [9] S. Luke 10:40-42. The reading which Cassian here follows is found
   in ['aleph = the Sinaiticus]BC,² but has not much Latin authority. It
   is however followed by Jerome Ep: ad Eustochium, xxii. 24, though the
   Vulgate has simply Porro unum est necessarium. For Mary as the type of
   the contemplative life, and Martha of the practical, compare S. Gregory
   the Great. Moralia VI. c. xxviii.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    A question how it is that the practice of virtue cannot remain with a man.

   TO which we, being deeply moved, replied what then? will the effort of
   fasting, diligence in reading, works of mercy, justice, piety, and
   kindness, be taken away from us, and not continue with the doers of
   them, especially since the Lord Himself promises the reward of the
   kingdom of heaven to these works, when He says: "Come, ye blessed of My
   Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the
   world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty and
   ye gave Me to drink:" etc. [10] How then shall these works be taken
   away, which admit the doers of them into the kingdom of heaven?

     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] S. Matt. 25:34, 35.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    The answer that not the reward, but the doing of them will come to an end.

   MOSES. I did not say that the reward for a good work would be taken
   away, as the Lord Himself says: "Whosoever shall give to one of the
   least of these, a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple,
   verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward:" [11] but I
   maintain that the doing of a thing, which either bodily necessity, or
   the onslaught of the flesh, or the inequalities of this world, compel
   to be done, will be taken away. For diligence in reading, and
   self-denial in fasting, are usefully practised for purifying the heart
   and chastening the flesh in this life only, as long as "the flesh
   lusteth against the spirit," [12] and sometimes we see that even in
   this life they are taken away from those men who are worn out with
   excessive toil, or bodily infirmity or old age, and cannot be practised
   by them. How much more then will they come to an end hereafter, when
   "this corruptible shall have put on incorruption," [13] and the body
   which is now "a natural body" shall have risen "a spiritual body" [14]
   and the flesh shall have begun to be such that it no longer lusts
   against the spirit? And of this the blessed Apostle also clearly
   speaks, when he says that "bodily exercise is profitable for a little:
   but godliness" (by which he certainly means love) "is profitable for
   all things, having the promise of the life that now is and of that
   which is to come." [15] This clearly shows that what is said to be
   useful for a little, is not to be practised for all time, and cannot
   possibly by itself alone confer the highest state of perfection on the
   man who slaves at it. For the term "for a little" may mean either of
   the two things, i.e., it may refer to the shortness of the time,
   because bodily exercise cannot possibly last on with man both in this
   life and in the world to come: or it may refer to the smallness of the
   profit which results from exercising the flesh, because bodily
   austerities produce some sort of beginnings of progress, but not the
   actual perfection of love, which has the promise of the life that now
   is and of that which is to come: and therefore we deem that the
   practice of the aforesaid works is needful, because without them we
   cannot climb the heights of love. For what you call works of religion
   and mercy are needful in this life while these inequalities and
   differences of conditions still prevail; but even here we should not
   look for them to be performed, unless such a large proportion of poor,
   needy, and sick folk abounded, which is brought about by the wickedness
   of men; viz., of those who have grasped and kept for their own use
   (without however using them) those things which were granted to all by
   the Creator of all alike. As long then as this inequality lasts in this
   world, this sort of work will be needful and useful to the man that
   practises it, as it brings to a good purpose and pious will the reward
   of an eternal inheritance: but it will come to an end in the life to
   come, where equality will reign, when there will be no longer
   inequality, on account of which these things must be done, but all men
   will pass from these manifold practical works to the love of God, and
   contemplation of heavenly things in continual purity of heart: to which
   those men who are urgent in devoting themselves to knowledge and
   purifying the heart, have chosen to give themselves up with all their
   might and main, betaking themselves, while they are still in the flesh,
   to that duty, in which they are to continue, when they have laid aside
   corruption, and when they come to that promise of the Lord the Saviour,
   which says "Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God." [16]

  CHAPTER XI.

    On the abiding character of love.

   AND why do you wonder that those duties enumerated above will cease,
   when the holy Apostle tells us that even the higher gifts of the Holy
   Spirit will pass away: and points out that charity alone will abide
   without end, saying "whether there be prophecies, they shall fail;
   whether there be tongues, they shall cease: whether there be knowledge,
   it will come to an end," but of this he says "Charity never faileth."
   For all gifts are given for a time as use and need require, but when
   the dispensation is ended they will without doubt presently pass away:
   but love will never be destroyed. For not only does it work usefully in
   us in this world; but also in that to come, when the burden of bodily
   needs is cast off, it will continue in far greater vigour and
   excellence, and will never be weakened by any defect, but by means of
   its perpetual incorruption will cling to God more intently and
   earnestly. [17]

  CHAPTER XII.

    A question on perseverance in spiritual contemplation.

   GERMANUS. Who then, while he is burdened with our frail flesh, can be
   always so intent on this contemplation, as never to think about the
   arrival of a brother, or visiting the sick, or manual labour, or at
   least about showing kindness to strangers and visitors? And lastly, who
   is not interrupted by providing for the body, and looking after it? Or
   how and in what way can the mind cling to the invisible and
   incomprehensible God, this we should like to learn.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    The answer concerning the direction of the heart towards God, and concerning
    the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil.

   MOSES. To cling to God continually, and as you say inseparably to hold
   fast to meditation on Him, is impossible for a man while still in this
   weak flesh of ours. But we ought to be aware on what we should have the
   purpose of our mind fixed, and to what goal we should ever recall the
   gaze of our soul: and when the mind can secure this it may rejoice; and
   grieve and sigh when it is withdrawn from this, and as often as it
   discovers itself to have fallen away from gazing on Him, it should
   admit that it has lapsed from the highest good, considering that even a
   momentary departure from gazing on Christ is fornication. And when our
   gaze has wandered ever so little from Him, let us turn the eyes of the
   soul back to Him, and recall our mental gaze as in a perfectly straight
   direction. For everything depends on the inward frame of mind, and when
   the devil has been expelled from this, and sins no longer reign in it,
   it follows that the kingdom of God is founded in us, as the Evangelist
   says "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say
   Lo here, or lo there: for verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God
   is within you." [18] But nothing else can be "within you," but
   knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in vice or in
   virtue, through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or for Christ
   in our heart: and of this kingdom the Apostle describes the character,
   when he says "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but
   righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." [19] And so if the
   kingdom of God is within us, and the actual kingdom of God is
   righteousness and peace and joy, then the man who abides in these is
   most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on the contrary those who
   live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh
   death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and
   death. For by these tokens the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the
   devil are distinguished: and in truth if lifting up our mental gaze on
   high we would consider that state in which the heavenly powers live on
   high, who are truly in the kingdom of God, what should we imagine it to
   be except perpetual and lasting joy? For what is so specially peculiar
   and appropriate to true blessedness as constant calm and eternal joy?
   And that you may be quite sure that this, which we say, is really so,
   not on my own authority but on that of the Lord, hear how very clearly
   He describes the character and condition of that world: "Behold," says
   He, "I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former things shall
   not be remembered nor come into mind. But ye shall be glad and rejoice
   forever in that which I create." [20] And again "joy and gladness shall
   be found therein: thanksgiving and the voice of praise, and there shall
   be month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath." [21] And again: "they
   shall obtain joy and gladness; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."
   [22] And if you want to know more definitely about that life and the
   city of the saints, hear what the voice of the Lord proclaims to the
   heavenly Jerusalem herself: "I will make," says He, "thine officers
   peace and thine overseers righteousness. Violence shall no more be
   heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders. And
   salvation shall take possession of thy walls, and praise of thy gates.
   The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither shall the brightness
   of the moon give light to thee: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting
   light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither
   shall thy moon withdraw itself: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting
   light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended:" [23] and therefore
   the holy Apostle does not say generally or without qualification that
   every joy is the kingdom of God, but markedly and emphatically that joy
   alone which is "in the Holy Ghost." [24] For he was perfectly aware of
   another detestable joy, of which we hear "the world shall rejoice,"
   [25] and "woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall mourn." [26] In fact
   the kingdom of heaven must be taken in a threefold sense, either that
   the heavens shall reign, i.e., the saints over other things subdued,
   according to this text, "Be thou over five cities, and thou over ten;"
   [27] and this which is said to the disciples: "Ye shall sit upon twelve
   thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel:" [28] or that the heavens
   themselves shall begin to be reigned over by Christ, when "all things
   are subdued unto Him," and God begins to be "all in all:" [29] or else
   that the saints shall reign in heaven with the Lord.

  CHAPTER XIV.

    Of the continuance of the soul.

   WHEREFORE every one while still existing in this body should already be
   aware that he must be committed to that state and office, of which he
   made himself a sharer and an adherent while in this life, nor should he
   doubt that in that eternal world he will be partner of him, whose
   servant and minister he chose to make himself here: according to that
   saying of our Lord which says "If any man serve Me, let him follow Me,
   and where I am, there shall My servant also be." [30] For as the
   kingdom of the devil is gained by consenting to sin, so the kingdom of
   God is attained by the practice of virtue in purity of heart and
   spiritual knowledge. But where the kingdom of God is, there most
   certainly eternal life is enjoyed, and where the kingdom of the devil
   is, there without doubt is death and the grave. And the man who is in
   this condition, cannot praise the Lord, according to the saying of the
   prophet which tells us: "The dead cannot praise Thee, O Lord; neither
   all they that go down into the grave (doubtless of sin). But we," says
   he, "who live (not forsooth to sin nor I to this world but to God) will
   bless the Lord, from this time forth for evermore: for in death no man
   remembereth God: but in the grave (of sin) who will confess to the
   Lord?" [31] i.e., no one will. For no man even though he were to call
   himself a Christian a thousand times over, or a monk, confesses God
   when he is sinning: no man who allows those things which the Lord
   hates, remembereth God, nor calls himself with any truth the servant of
   Him, whose commands he scorns with obstinate rashness: in which death
   the blessed Apostle declares that the widow is involved, who gives
   herself to pleasure, saying "a widow who giveth herself to pleasure is
   dead while she liveth." [32] There are then many who while still living
   in this body are dead, and lying in the grave cannot praise God; and on
   the contrary there are many who though they are dead in the body yet
   bless God in the spirit, and praise Him, according to this: "O ye
   spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord:" [33] and "every
   spirit shall praise the Lord." [34] And in the Apocalypse the souls of
   them that are slain are not only said to praise God but to address Him
   also. [35] In the gospel too the Lord says with still greater clearness
   to the Sadducees: "Have ye not read that which was spoken by God, when
   He said to you: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the
   God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all
   do live unto Him." [36] Of whom also the Apostle says: "wherefore God
   is not ashamed to be called their God: for He hath prepared for them a
   city." [37] For that they are not idle after the separation from this
   body, and are not incapable of feeling, the parable in the gospel
   shows, which tells us of the beggar Lazarus and Dives clothed in
   purple, one of whom obtained a position of bliss, i.e., Abraham's
   bosom, the other is consumed with the dreadful heat of eternal fire.
   [38] But if you care too to understand the words spoken to the thief
   "To-day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise," [39] what do they clearly
   show but that not only does their former intelligence continue with the
   souls, but also that in their changed condition they partake of some
   state which corresponds to their actions and deserts? For the Lord
   would certainly never have promised him this, if He had known that his
   soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been
   deprived of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was
   not his flesh but his soul which was to enter Paradise with Christ. At
   least we must avoid, and shun with the utmost horror, that wicked
   punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not believe that Christ
   could be found in Paradise on the same day on which He descended into
   hell, thus punctuate "Verily, I say unto you to-day," and making a stop
   apply "thou shall be with Me in Paradise," in such a way that they
   imagine that this promise was not fulfilled at once after he departed
   from this life, but that it will be fulfilled after the resurrection,
   [40] as they do not understand what before the time of His resurrection
   He declared to the Jews, who fancied that He was hampered by human
   difficulties and weakness of the flesh as they were: "No man hath
   ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of
   man who is in heaven:" [41] by which He clearly shows that the souls of
   the departed are not only not deprived of their reason, but that they
   are not even without such feelings as hope and sorrow, joy and fear,
   and that they already are beginning to taste beforehand something of
   what is reserved for them at the last judgment, and that they are not
   as some unbelievers hold resolved into nothing after their departure
   from this life: [42] but that they live a more real life, and are still
   more earnest in waiting on the praises of God. And indeed to put aside
   for a little Scripture proofs, and to discuss, as far as our ability
   permits us, a little about the nature of the soul itself, is it not
   beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the madness of all
   stupidity, even to have the slightest suspicion that the nobler part of
   man, in which as the blessed Apostle shows, the image and likeness of
   God consists, [43] will, when the burden of the body with which it is
   oppressed in this world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it
   contains in itself all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and
   senseless material flesh sensible, by participation with it: especially
   when it follows, and the order of reason itself demands that when the
   mind has put off the grossness of the flesh with which it is now
   weighed down, it will restore its intellectual powers better than ever,
   and receive them in a purer and finer condition than it lost them. But
   so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that
   he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from
   it, he might be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying:
   "I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better,
   for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:" and
   therefore "we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the
   body, and present with the Lord. Wherefore also we strive, whether
   absent or present, to be pleasing to Him;" [44] and he declares indeed
   that the continuance of the soul which is in the flesh is distance from
   the Lord, and absence from Christ, and trusts with entire faith that
   its separation and departure from this flesh involves presence with
   Christ. And again still more clearly the same Apostle speaks of this
   state of the souls as one that is very full of life: "But ye are come
   to Mount Sion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
   and to an innumerable company of angels, and the church of the first
   born, who are written in heaven, and the spirits of just men made
   perfect." [45] Of which spirits he speaks in another passage,
   "Furthermore we have had instructors of our flesh, and we reverenced
   them: shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and
   live?" [46]

  CHAPTER XV.

    How we must meditate on God.

   BUT the contemplation of God is gained in a variety of ways. For we not
   only discover God by admiring His incomprehensible essence, a thing
   which still lies hid in the hope of the promise, but we see Him through
   the greatness of His creation, and the consideration of His justice,
   and the aid of His daily providence: when with pure minds we
   contemplate what He has done with His saints in every generation, when
   with trembling heart we admire His power with which He governs,
   directs, and rules all things, or the vastness of His knowledge, and
   that eye of His from which no secrets of the heart can lie hid, when we
   consider the sand of the sea, and the number of the waves measured by
   Him and known to Him, when in our wonder we think that the drops of
   rain, the days and hours of the ages, and all things past and future
   are present to His knowledge; when we gaze in unbounded admiration on
   that ineffable mercy of His, which with unwearied patience endures
   countless sins which are every moment being committed under His very
   eyes, or the call with which from no antecedent merits of ours, but by
   the free grace of His pity He receives us; or again the numberless
   opportunities of salvation which He grants to those whom He is going to
   adopt--that He made us be born in such a way as that from our very
   cradles His grace and the knowledge of His law might be given to us,
   that He Himself, overcoming our enemy in us simply for the pleasure of
   His good will, rewards us with eternal bliss and everlasting rewards,
   when lastly He undertook the dispensation of His Incarnation for our
   salvation, and extended the marvels of His sacraments [47] to all
   nations. But there are numberless other considerations of this sort,
   which arise in our minds according to the character of our life and the
   purity of our heart, by which God is either seen by pure eyes or
   embraced: which considerations certainly no one will preserve
   lastingly, if anything of carnal affections still survives in him,
   because "thou canst not," saith the Lord, "see My face: for no man
   shall see Me and live;" [48] viz., to this world and to earthly
   affections.

  CHAPTER XVI.

    A question on the changing character of the thoughts.

   GERMANUS. How is it then, that even against our will, aye and without
   our knowledge idle thoughts steal upon us so subtilely and secretly
   that it is fearfully hard not merely to drive them away, but even to
   grasp and seize them? Can then a mind sometimes be found free from
   them, and never attacked by illusions of this kind?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

    The answer what the mind can and what it cannot do with regard to the state
    of its thoughts.

   MOSES. It is impossible for the mind not to be approached by thoughts,
   but it is in the power of every earnest man either to admit them or to
   reject them. As then their rising up does not entirely depend on
   ourselves, so the rejection or admission of them lies in our own power.
   But because we said that it is impossible for the mind not to be
   approached by thoughts, you must not lay everything to the charge of
   the assault, or to those spirits who strive to instil them into us,
   else there would not remain any free will in man, nor would efforts for
   our improvement be in our power: but it is, I say, to a great extent in
   our power to improve the character of our thoughts and to let either
   holy and spiritual thoughts or earthly ones grow up in our hearts. For
   for this purpose frequent reading and continual meditation on the
   Scriptures is employed that from thence an opportunity for spiritual
   recollection may be given to us, therefore the frequent singing of
   Psalms is used, that thence constant feelings of compunction may be
   provided, and earnest vigils and fasts and prayers, that the mind may
   be brought low and not mind earthly things, but contemplate things
   celestial, for if these things are dropped and carelessness creeps on
   us, the mind being hardened with the foulness of sin is sure to incline
   in a carnal direction and fall away.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    Comparison of a soul and a millstone.

   AND this movement of the heart is not unsuitably illustrated by the
   comparison of a mill wheel, which the headlong rush of water whirls
   round, with revolving impetus, and which can never stop its work so
   long as it is driven round by the action of the water: but it is in the
   power of the man who directs it, to decide whether he will have wheat
   or barley or darnel ground by it. That certainly must be crushed by it
   which is put into it by the man who has charge of that business. So
   then the mind also through the trials of the present life is driven
   about by the torrents of temptations pouring in upon it from all sides,
   and cannot be free from the flow of thoughts: but the character of the
   thoughts which it should either throw off or admit for itself, it will
   provide by the efforts of its own earnestness and diligence: for if, as
   we said, we constantly recur to meditation on the Holy Scriptures and
   raise our memory towards the recollection of spiritual things and the
   desire of perfection and the hope of future bliss, spiritual thoughts
   are sure to rise from this, and cause the mind to dwell on those things
   on which we have been meditating. But if we are overcome by sloth or
   carelessness and spend our time in idle gossip, or are entangled in the
   cares of this world and unnecessary anxieties, the result will be that
   a sort of species of tares will spring up, and afford an injurious
   occupation for our hearts, and as our Lord and Saviour says, wherever
   the treasure of our works or purpose may be, there also our heart is
   sure to continue. [49]

  CHAPTER XIX.

    Of the three origins of our thoughts.

   ABOVE all we ought at least to know that there are three origins of our
   thoughts, i.e., from God, from the devil, and from ourselves. They come
   from God when He vouchsafes to visit us with the illumination of the
   Holy Ghost, lifting us up to a higher state of progress, and where we
   have made but little progress, or through acting slothfully have been
   overcome, He chastens us with most salutary compunction, or when He
   discloses to us heavenly mysteries, or turns our purpose and will to
   better actions, as in the case where the king Ahasuerus, being
   chastened by the Lord, was prompted to ask for the books of the annals,
   by which he was reminded of the good deeds of Mordecai, and promoted
   him to a position of the highest honour and at once recalled his most
   cruel sentence concerning the slaughter of the Jews. [50] Or when the
   prophet says: "I will hearken what the Lord God will say in me." [51]
   Another too tells us "And an angel spoke, and said in me," [52] or when
   the Son of God promised that He would come with His Father, and make
   His abode in us, [53] and "It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of
   your Father which speaketh in you." [54] And the chosen vessel: "Ye
   seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me." [55] But a whole range of
   thoughts springs from the devil, when he endeavours to destroy us
   either by the pleasures of sin or by secret attacks, in his crafty
   wiles deceitfully showing us evil as good, and transforming himself
   into an angel of light to us: [56] as when the evangelist tells us:
   "And when supper was ended, when the devil had already put it into the
   heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray" [57] the Lord: and
   again also "after the sop," he says, "Satan entered into him." [58]
   Peter also says to Ananias: "Why hath Satan tempted thine heart, to lie
   to the Holy Ghost?" [59] And that which we read in the gospel much
   earlier as predicted by Ecclesiastes: "If the spirit of the ruler rise
   up against thee, leave not thy place." [60] That too which is said to
   God against Ahab in the third book of Kings, in the character of an
   unclean spirit: "I will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the
   mouth of all his prophets." [61] But they arise from ourselves, when in
   the course of nature we recollect what we are doing or have done or
   have heard. Of which the blessed David speaks: "I thought upon the
   ancient days, and had in mind the years from of old, and I meditated,
   by night I exercised myself with my heart, and searched out my spirit."
   [62] And again: "the Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are
   vain:" [63] and "the thoughts of the righteous are judgments." [64] In
   the gospel too the Lord says to the Pharisees: "why do ye think evil in
   your hearts?" [65]

  CHAPTER XX.

    About discerning the thoughts, with an illustration from a good
    money-changer.

   WE ought then carefully to notice this threefold order, and with a wise
   discretion to analyse the thoughts which arise in our hearts, tracking
   out their origin and cause and author in the first instance, that we
   may be able to consider how we ought to yield ourselves to them in
   accordance with the desert of those who suggest them so that we may, as
   the Lord's command bids us, become good money-changers, [66] whose
   highest skill and whose training is to test what is perfectly pure gold
   and what is commonly termed tested, [67] or what is not sufficiently
   purified in the fire; and also with unerring skill not to be taken in
   by a common brass denarius, if by being coloured with bright gold it is
   made like some coin of great value; and not only shrewdly to recognize
   coins stamped with the heads of usurpers, but with a still shrewder
   skill to detect those which have the image of the right king, but are
   not properly made, and lastly to be careful by the test of the balance
   to see that they are not under proper weight. All of which things the
   gospel saying, which uses this figure, shows us that we ought also to
   observe spiritually; first that whatever has found an entrance into our
   hearts, and whatever doctrine has been received by us, should be most
   carefully examined to see whether it has been purified by the divine
   and heavenly fire of the Holy Ghost, or whether it belongs to Jewish
   superstition, or whether it comes from the pride of a worldly
   philosophy and only externally makes a show of religion. And this we
   can do, if we carry out the Apostle's advice, "Believe not every
   spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God." [68] But by
   this kind those men also are deceived, who after having been professed
   as monks are enticed by the grace of style, and certain doctrines of
   philosophers, which at the first blush, owing to some pious meanings
   not out of harmony with religion, deceive as with the glitter of gold
   their hearers, whom they have superficially attracted, but render them
   poor and miserable for ever, like men deceived by false money made of
   copper: either bringing them back to the bustle of this world, or
   enticing them into the errors of heretics, and bombastic conceits: a
   thing which we read of as happening to Achan in the book of Joshua the
   son of Nun, [69] when he coveted a golden weight from the camp of the
   Philistines, and stole it, and was smitten with a curse and condemned
   to eternal death. In the second place we should be careful to see that
   no wrong interpretation fixed on to the pure gold of Scripture deceives
   us as to the value of the metal: by which means the devil in his craft
   tried to impose upon our Lord and Saviour as if He was a mere man, when
   by his malevolent interpretation he perverted what ought to be
   understood generally of all good men, and tried to fasten it specially
   on to Him, who had no need of the care of the angels: saying, "For He
   shall give His angels charge concerning Thee, to keep Thee in all Thy
   ways: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou
   dash Thy foot against a stone" [70] by a skilful assumption on his part
   giving a turn to the precious sayings of Scripture and twisting them
   into a dangerous sense, the very opposite of their true meaning, so as
   to offer to us the image and face of an usurper under cover of the gold
   colour which may deceive us. Or whether he tries to cheat us with
   counterfeits, for instance by urging that some work of piety should be
   taken up which as it does come from the true minds of the fathers,
   leads under the form of virtue to vice; and, deceiving us either by
   immoderate or impossible fasts, or by too long vigils, or inordinate
   prayers, or unsuitable reading, brings us to a bad end. Or, when he
   persuades us to give ourselves up to mixing in the affairs of others,
   and to pious visits, by which he may drive us away from the spiritual
   cloisters of the monastery, and the secrecy of its friendly
   peacefulness, and suggests that we take on our shoulders the anxieties
   and cares of religious women who are in want, that when a monk is
   inextricably entangled in snares of this sort he may distract him with
   most injurious occupations and cares. Or else when he incites a man to
   desire the holy office of the clergy under the pretext of edifying many
   people, and the love of spiritual gain, by which to draw us away from
   the humility and strictness of our life. All of which things, although
   they are opposed to our salvation and to our profession, yet when
   covered with a sort of veil of compassion and religion, easily deceive
   those who are lacking in skill and care. For they imitate the coins of
   the true king, because they seem at first full of piety, but are not
   stamped by those who have the right to coin, i.e., the approved
   Catholic fathers, nor do they proceed from the head public office for
   receiving them, but are made by stealth and by the fraud of the devil,
   and palmed off upon the unskilful and ignorant not without serious
   harm. And even although they seem to be useful and needful at first,
   yet if afterwards they begin to interfere with the soundness of our
   profession, and as it were to weaken in some sense the whole body of
   our purpose, it is well that they should be cut off and cast away from
   us like a member which may be necessary, but yet offends us and which
   seems to perform the office of the right hand or foot. For it is
   better, without one member of a command, i.e., its working or result,
   to continue safe and sound in other parts, and to enter as weak into
   the kingdom of heaven rather than with the whole mass of commands to
   fall into some error which by an evil custom separates us from our
   strict rule and the system purposed and entered upon, and leads to such
   loss, that it will never outweigh the harm that will follow, but will
   cause all our past fruits and the whole body of our work to be burnt in
   hell fire. [71] Of which kind of illusions it is well said in the
   Proverbs: "There are ways which seem to be right to a man, but their
   latter end will come into the depths of hell," [72] and again "An evil
   man is harmful when he attaches himself to a good man," [73] i.e., the
   devil deceives when he is covered with an appearance of sanctity: "but
   he hates the sound of the watchman," [74] i.e., the power of discretion
   which comes from the words and warnings of the fathers.

  CHAPTER XXI.

    Of the illusion of Abbot John.

   IN this manner we have heard that Abbot John who lived at Lycon, [75]
   was recently deceived. For when his body was exhausted and failing as
   he had put off taking food during a fast of two days, on the third day
   while he was on his way to take some refreshment the devil came in the
   shape of a filthy Ethiopian, and falling at his feet, cried "Pardon me
   because I appointed this labour for you." And so that great man, who
   was so perfect in the matter of discretion, understood that under
   pretence of an abstinence practised unsuitably, he was deceived by the
   craft of the devil, and engaged in a fast of such a character as to
   affect his worn out body with a weariness that was unnecessary, indeed
   that was harmful to the spirit; as he was deceived by a counterfeit
   coin, and, while he paid respect to the image of the true king upon it,
   was not sufficiently alive to the question whether it was rightly cut
   and stamped. But the last duty of this "good money-changer," which, as
   we mentioned before, concerns the examination of the weight, will be
   fulfilled, if whenever our thoughts suggest that anything is to be
   done, we scrupulously think it over, and, laying it in the scales of
   our breast, weigh it with the most exact balance, whether it be full of
   good for all, or heavy with the fear of God: or entire and sound in
   meaning; or whether it be light with human display or some conceit of
   novelty, or whether the pride of foolish vain glory has not diminished
   or lessened the weight of its merit. And so straightway weighing them
   in the public balance, i.e., testing them by the acts and proofs of the
   Apostles and Prophets let us hold them as it were entire and perfect
   and of full weight, or else with all care and diligence reject them as
   imperfect and counterfeit, and of insufficient weight.

  CHAPTER XXII.

    Of the fourfold method of discrimination.

   THIS power of discriminating will then be necessary for us in the
   fourfold manner of which we have spoken; viz., first that the material
   does not escape our notice whether it be of true or of painted gold:
   secondly, that those thoughts which falsely promise works of religion
   should be rejected by us as forged and counterfeit coins, as they are
   those which are not rightly stamped, and which bear an untrue image of
   the king; and that we may be able in the same way to detect those which
   in the case of the precious gold of Scripture, by means of a false and
   heretical meaning, show the image not of the true king but of an
   usurper; and that we refuse those whose weight and value the rust of
   vanity has depreciated and not allowed to pass in the scales of the
   fathers, as coins that are too light, and are false and weigh too
   little; so that we may not incur that which we are warned by the Lord's
   command to avoid with all our power, and lose the value and reward of
   all our labour. "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on the earth,
   where rust and moth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal."
   [76] For whenever we do anything with a view to human glory we know
   that we are, as the Lord says, laying up for ourselves treasure on
   earth, and that consequently being as it were hidden in the ground and
   buried in the earth it must be destroyed by sundry demons or consumed
   by the biting rust of vain glory, or devoured by the moths of pride so
   as to contribute nothing to the use and profits of the man who has
   hidden it. We should then constantly search all the inner chambers of
   our hearts, and trace out the footsteps of whatever enters into them
   with the closest investigation lest haply some beast, if I may say so,
   relating to the understanding, either lion or dragon, passing through
   has furtively left the dangerous marks of his track, which will show to
   others the way of access into the secret recesses of the heart, owing
   to a carelessness about our thoughts. And so daily and hourly turning
   up the ground of our heart with the gospel plough, i.e., the constant
   recollection of the Lord's cross, we shall manage to stamp out or
   extirpate from our hearts the lairs of noxious beasts and the lurking
   places of poisonous serpents.

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    Of the discourse of the teacher in regard to the merits of his hearers.

   AT this the old man seeing that we were astonished, and inflamed at the
   words of his discourse with an insatiable desire, stopped his speech
   for a little in consequence of our admiration and earnestness, and
   presently added: Since your zeal, my sons, has led to so long a
   discussion, and a sort of fire supplies keener zest to our conference
   in proportion to your earnestness, as from this very thing I can
   clearly see that you are truly thirsting after teaching about
   perfection, I want still to say something to you on the excellence of
   discrimination and grace which rules and holds the field among all
   virtues, and not merely to prove its value and usefulness by daily
   instances of it, but also from former deliberations and opinions of the
   fathers. For I remember that frequently when men were asking me with
   sighs and tears for a discourse of this kind, and I myself was anxious
   to give them some teaching I could not possibly manage it, and not
   merely my thoughts but even my very power of speech failed me so that I
   could not find how to send them away with even some slight consolation.
   And by these signs we clearly see that the grace of the Lord inspires
   the speakers with words according to the deserts and zeal of the
   hearers. And because the very short night which is before us does not
   allow me to finish the discourse, let us then rather give it up to
   bodily rest, in which the whole of it will have to be spent, if a
   reasonable portion is refused, and let us reserve the complete scheme
   of the discourse for unbroken consideration on a future day or night.
   For it is right for the best counsellors on discretion to show the
   diligence of their minds in the first place in this, and to prove
   whether they are or can be possessors of it by this evidence and
   patience, so that in treating of that virtue which is the mother of
   moderation they may by no means fall into the vice which is opposite to
   it; viz., that of undue length, by their actions and deeds destroying
   the force of the system and nature which they recommend in word. In
   regard then to this most excellent discretion, on which we still
   propose to inquire, so far as the Lord gives us power, it may in the
   first instance be a good thing, when we are disputing about its
   excellence and the moderation which we know exists in it as the first
   of virtues, not to allow ourselves to exceed the due limit of the
   discussion and of our time.

   And so with this the blessed Moses put a stop to our talk, and urged
   us, eager though we were and hanging on his lips, to go off to bed for
   a little, advising us to lie down on the same mats on which we were
   sitting, and to put our bundles [77] under our heads instead of
   pillows, as these being tied evenly to thicker leaves of papyrus
   collected in long and slender bundles, six feet apart, at one time
   provide the brethren when sitting at service with a very low seat
   instead of a footstool, at another time being put under their necks
   when they go to bed furnish a support for their heads, that is not too
   hard, but comfortable and just right. For which uses of the monks these
   things are considered especially fit and suitable not only because they
   are somewhat soft, and prepared at little cost of money and labour, as
   the papyrus grows everywhere along the banks of the Nile, but also
   because they are of a convenient stuff and light enough to be removed
   or fetched as need may require. And so at last at the bidding of the
   old man we settled ourselves down to sleep in deep stillness, both
   excited with delight at the conference we had held, and also buoyed up
   with hope of the promised discussion.

SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT MOSES.

ON DISCRETION.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Abbot Moses' introduction on the grace of discretion.

   AND so when we had enjoyed our morning sleep, when to our delight the
   dawn of light again shone upon us, and we had begun to ask once more
   for his promised talk, the blessed Moses thus began: As I see you
   inflamed with such an eager desire, that I do not believe that that
   very short interval of quiet which I wanted to subtract from our
   spiritual conference and devote to bodily rest, has been of any use for
   the repose of your bodies, on me too a greater anxiety presses when I
   take note of your zeal. For I must give the greater care and devotion
   in paying my debt, in proportion as I see that you ask for it the more
   earnestly, according to that saying: "When thou sittest to eat with a
   ruler consider diligently what is put before thee, and put forth thine
   hand, knowing that thou oughtest to prepare such things." [78]
   Wherefore as we are going to speak of the excellent quality of
   discretion and the virtue of it, on which subject our discourse of last
   night had entered at the termination of our discussion, we think it
   desirable first to establish its excellence by the opinions of the
   fathers, that when it has been shown what our predecessors thought and
   said about it, then we may bring forward some ancient and modern
   shipwrecks and mischances of various people, who were destroyed and
   hopelessly ruined because they paid but little attention to it, and
   then as well as we can we must treat of its advantages and uses: after
   a discussion of which we shall know better how we ought to seek after
   it and practise it, by the consideration of the importance of its value
   and grace. For it is no ordinary virtue nor one which can be freely
   gained by merely human efforts, unless they are aided by the Divine
   blessing, for we read that this is also reckoned among the noblest
   gifts of the Spirit by the Apostle: "To one is given by the Spirit the
   word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, to
   another faith by the same Spirit, to another the gift of healing by the
   same Spirit," and shortly after, "to another the discerning of
   spirits." Then after the complete catalogue of spiritual gifts he
   subjoins: "But all these worketh one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing
   to every man severally as He will." [79] You see then that the gift of
   discretion is no earthly thing and no slight matter, but the greatest
   prize of divine grace. And unless a monk has pursued it with all zeal,
   and secured a power of discerning with unerring judgment the spirits
   that rise up in him, he is sure to go wrong, as if in the darkness of
   night and dense blackness, and not merely to fall down dangerous pits
   and precipices, but also to make frequent mistakes in matters that are
   plain and straightforward.

  CHAPTER II.

    What discretion alone can give a monk; and a discourse of the blessed Antony
    on this subject.

   AND so I remember that while I was still a boy, in the region of
   Thebaid, where the blessed Antony lived, [80] the elders came to him to
   inquire about perfection: and though the conference lasted from evening
   till morning, the greatest part of the night was taken up with this
   question. For it was discussed at great length what virtue or
   observance could preserve a monk always unharmed by the snares and
   deceits of the devil, and carry him forward on a sure and right path,
   and with firm step to the heights of perfection. And when each one gave
   his opinion according to the bent of his own mind, and some made it
   consist in zeal in fasting and vigils, because a soul that has been
   brought low by these, and so obtained purity of heart and body will be
   the more easily united to God, others in despising all things, as, if
   the mind were utterly deprived of them, it would come the more freely
   to God, as if henceforth there were no snares to entangle it: others
   thought that withdrawal from the world was the thing needful, i.e.,
   solitude and the secrecy of the hermit's life; living in which a man
   may more readily commune with God, and cling more especially to Him;
   others laid down that the duties of charity, i.e., of kindness should
   be practised, because the Lord in the gospel promised more especially
   to give the kingdom to these; when He said "Come ye blessed of My
   Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
   world. For I was an hungred and ye gave Me to eat, I was thirsty and ye
   gave Me to drink, etc.:" [81] and when in this fashion they declared
   that by means of different virtues a more certain approach to God could
   be secured, and the greater part of the night had been spent in this
   discussion, then at last the blessed Antony spoke and said: All these
   things which you have mentioned are indeed needful, and helpful to
   those who are thirsting for God, and desirous to approach Him. But
   countless accidents and the experience of many people will not allow us
   to make the most important of gifts consist in them. For often when men
   are most strict in fasting or in vigils, and nobly withdraw into
   solitude, and aim at depriving themselves of all their goods so
   absolutely that they do not suffer even a day's allowance of food or a
   single penny to remain to them, and when they fulfil all the duties of
   kindness with the utmost devotion, yet still we have seen them suddenly
   deceived, so that they could not bring the work they had entered upon
   to a suitable close, but brought their exalted fervour and praiseworthy
   manner of life to a terrible end. Wherefore we shall be able clearly to
   recognize what it is which mainly leads to God, if we trace out with
   greater care the reason of their downfall and deception. For when the
   works of the above mentioned virtues were abounding in them, discretion
   alone was wanting, and allowed them not to continue even to the end.
   Nor can any other reason for their falling off be discovered except
   that as they were not sufficiently instructed by their elders they
   could not obtain judgment and discretion, which passing by excess on
   either side, teaches a monk always to walk along the royal road, and
   does not suffer him to be puffed up on the right hand of virtue, i.e.,
   from excess of zeal to transgress the bounds of due moderation in
   foolish presumption, nor allows him to be enamoured of slackness and
   turn aside to the vices on the left hand, i.e., under pretext of
   controlling the body, to grow slack with the opposite spirit of
   lukewarmness. For this is discretion, which is termed in the gospel the
   "eye," "and light of the body," according to the Saviour's saying: "The
   light of thy body is thine eye: but if thine eye be single, thy whole
   body will be full of light, but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body
   will be full of darkness:" [82] because as it discerns all the thoughts
   and actions of men, it sees and overlooks all things which should be
   done. But if in any man this is "evil," i.e., not fortified by sound
   judgment and knowledge, or deceived by some error and presumption, it
   will make our whole body "full of darkness," i.e., it will darken all
   our mental vision and our actions, as they will be involved in the
   darkness of vices and the gloom of disturbances. For, says He, "if the
   light which is in thee be darkness, how great will that darkness be!"
   [83] For no one can doubt that when the judgment of our heart goes
   wrong, and is overwhelmed by the night of ignorance, our thoughts and
   deeds, which are the result of deliberation and discretion, must be
   involved in the darkness of still greater sins.

  CHAPTER III.

    Of the error of Saul and of Ahab, by which they were deceived through lack
    of discretion.

   LASTLY, the man who in the judgment of God was the first to be worthy
   of the kingdom of His people Israel, because he was lacking in this
   "eye" of discretion, was, as if his whole body were full of darkness,
   actually cast down from the kingdom while, being deceived by the
   darkness of this "light," and in error, he imagined that his own
   offerings were more acceptable to God than obedience to the command of
   Samuel, and met with an occasion of falling in that very matter in
   which he had hoped to propitiate the Divine Majesty. [84] And
   ignorance, I say, of this discretion led Ahab the king of Israel after
   a triumph and splendid victory which had been granted to him by the
   favour of God to fancy that mercy on his part was better than the stern
   execution of the divine command, and, as it seemed to him, a cruel
   rule: and moved by this consideration, while he desired to temper a
   bloody victory with mercy, he was on account of his indiscriminating
   clemency rendered full of darkness in his whole body, and condemned
   irreversibly to death. [85]

  CHAPTER IV.

    What is said of the value of discretion in Holy Scripture.

   SUCH is discretion, which is not only the "light of the body," but also
   called the sun by the Apostle, as it said "Let not the sun go down upon
   your wrath." [86] It is also called the guidance of our life: as it
   said "Those who have no guidance, fall like leaves." [87] It is most
   truly named counsel, without which the authority of Scripture allows us
   to do nothing, so that we are not even permitted to take that spiritual
   "wine which maketh glad the heart of man" [88] with out its regulating
   control: as it is said "Do everything with counsel, drink thy wine with
   counsel," [89] and again "like a city that has its walls destroyed and
   is not fenced in, so is a man who does anything without counsel." [90]
   And how injurious the absence of this is to a monk, the illustration
   and figure in the passage quoted shows, by comparing it to a city that
   is destroyed and without walls. Herein lies wisdom, herein lies
   intelligence and understanding without which our inward house cannot be
   built, nor can spiritual riches be gathered together, as it is said: "A
   house is built with wisdom, and again it is set up with intelligence.
   With understanding the storehouses are filled with all precious riches
   and good things." [91] This I say is "solid food," which can only be
   taken by those who are full grown and strong, as it is said: "But solid
   food is for full grown men, who by reason of use have their senses
   exercised to discern good and evil." [92] And it is shown to be useful
   and necessary for us, only in so far as it is in accordance with the
   word of God and its powers, as is said "For the word of God is quick
   and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and reaching even
   to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow,
   and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:" [93] and by
   this it is clearly shown that no virtue can possibly be perfectly
   acquired or continue without the grace of discretion. And so by the
   judgment of the blessed Antony as well as of all others it has been
   laid down that it is discretion which leads a fearless monk by fixed
   stages to God, and preserves the virtues mentioned above continually
   intact, by means of which one may ascend with less weariness to the
   extreme summit of perfection, and without which even those who toil
   most willingly cannot reach the heights of perfection. For discretion
   is the mother of all virtues, as well as their guardian and regulator.

   AND to support this judgment delivered of old by the blessed Antony and
   the other fathers by a modern instance, as we promised to do, remember
   what you lately saw happen before your very eyes, I mean, how the old
   man Heron, [94] only a very few days ago was cast down by an illusion
   of the devil from the heights to the depths, a man whom we remember to
   have lived for fifty years in this desert and to have preserved a
   strict continence with especial severity, and who aimed at the secrecy
   of solitude with marvellous fervour beyond all those who dwell here. By
   what device then or by what method was he deluded by the deceiver after
   so many labours, and falling by a most grievous downfall struck with
   profound grief all those who live in this desert? Was it not because,
   having too little of the virtue of discretion he preferred to be guided
   by his own judgment rather than to obey the counsels and conference of
   the brethren and the regulations of the elders? Since he ever practised
   incessant abstinence and fasting with such severity, and persisted in
   the secrecy of solitude and a monastic cell so constantly that not even
   the observance of the Easter festival could ever persuade him to join
   in the feast with the brethren: when in accordance with the annual
   observance, all the brethren remained in the church and he alone would
   not join them for fear lest he might seem to relax in some degree from
   his purpose by taking only a little pulse. And deceived by this
   presumption he received with the utmost reverence an angel of Satan as
   an angel of light and with blind slavishness obeyed his commands and
   cast himself down a well, so deep that the eye could not pierce its
   depths, nothing doubting of the promise of the angel who had assured
   him that the merits of his virtues and labours were such that he could
   not possibly run any risk. And that he might prove the truth of this
   most certainly by experimenting on his own safety, in the dead of night
   he was deluded enough to cast himself into the above mentioned well, to
   prove indeed the great merit of his virtue if he should come out thence
   unhurt. And when by great efforts on the part of the brethren he had
   been got out already almost dead, on the third day afterward he
   expired, and what was still worse, persisted in his obstinate delusion
   so that not even the experience of his death could persuade him that he
   had been deceived by the craft of devils. Wherefore in spite of the
   merits of his great labours and the number of years which he had spent
   in the desert those who with compassion and the greatest kindness
   pitied his end, could hardly obtain from Abbot Paphnutius [95] that he
   should not be reckoned among suicides, and be deemed unworthy of the
   memorial and oblation for those at rest. [96]

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of the destruction of two brethren for lack of discretion.

   WHAT shall I say of those two brethren who lived beyond that desert of
   the Thebaid where once the blessed Antony dwelt, and, not being
   sufficiently influenced by careful discrimination, when they were going
   through the vast and extended waste determined not to take any food
   with them, except such as the Lord Himself might provide for them. And
   when as they wandered through the deserts and were already fainting
   from hunger they were spied at a distance by the Mazices [97] (a race
   which is even more savage and ferocious than almost all wild tribes,
   for they are not driven to shed blood, as other tribes are, from desire
   of spoil but from simple ferocity of mind), and when these acting
   contrary to their natural ferocity, met them with bread, one of the two
   as discretion came to his aid, received it with delight and
   thankfulness as if it were offered to him by the Lord, thinking that
   the food had been divinely provided for him, and that it was God's
   doing that those who always delighted in bloodshed had offered the
   staff of life to men who were already fainting and dying; but the other
   refused the food because it was offered to him by men and died of
   starvation. And though this sprang in the first instance from a
   persuasion that was blameworthy yet one of them by the help of
   discretion got the better of the idea which he had rashly and
   carelessly conceived, but the other persisting in his obstinate folly,
   and being utterly lacking in discretion, brought upon himself that
   death which the Lord would have averted, as he would not believe that
   it was owing to a Divine impulse that the fierce barbarians forgot
   their natural ferocity and offered them bread instead of a sword.

  CHAPTER VII.

    Of an illusion into which another fell for lack of discretion.

   WHY also should I speak of one (whose name we had rather not mention as
   he is still alive), who for a long while received a devil in the
   brightness of an angelic form, and was often deceived by countless
   revelations from him and believed that he was a messenger of
   righteousness: for when these were granted, every night he provided a
   light in his cell without the need of any lamp. At last he was ordered
   by the devil to offer up to God his own son who was living with him in
   the monastery, in order that his merits might by this sacrifice be made
   equal to those of the patriarch Abraham. And he was so far seduced by
   his persuasion that he would really have committed the murder unless
   his son had seen him getting ready the knife and sharpening it with
   unusual care, and looking for the chains with which he meant to tie him
   up for the sacrifice when he was going to offer him up; and had fled
   away in terror with a presentiment of the coming crime.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of the fall and deception of a monk of Mesopotamia.

   IT is a long business too to tell the story of the deception of that
   monk of Mesopotamia, who observed an abstinence that could be imitated
   by but few in that country, which he had practised for many years
   concealed in his cell, and at last was so deceived by revelations and
   dreams that came from the devil that after so many labours and good
   deeds, in which he had surpassed all those who dwelt in the same parts,
   he actually relapsed miserably into Judaism and circumcision of the
   flesh. For when the devil by accustoming him to visions through the
   wish to entice him to believe a falsehood in the end, had like a
   messenger of truth revealed to him for a long while what was perfectly
   true, at length he showed him Christian folk together with the leaders
   of our religion and creed; viz., Apostles and Martyrs, in darkness and
   filth, and foul and disfigured with all squalor, and on the other hand
   the Jewish people with Moses, the patriarchs and prophets, dancing with
   all joy and shining with dazzling light; and so persuaded him that if
   he wanted to share their reward and bliss, he must at once submit to
   circumcision. And so none of these would have been so miserably
   deceived, if they had endeavoured to obtain a power of discretion. Thus
   the mischances and trials of many show how dangerous it is to be
   without the grace of discretion.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    A question about the acquirement of true discretion.

   TO this Germanus: It has been fully and completely shown both by recent
   instances and by the decisions of the ancients how discretion is in
   some sense the fountain head and the root of all virtues. We want then
   to learn how it ought to be gained, or how we can tell whether it is
   genuine and from God, or whether it is spurious and from the devil: so
   that (to use the figure of that gospel parable which you discussed on a
   former occasion, in which we are bidden to become good money changers
   [98] ) we may be able to see the figure of the true king stamped on the
   coin and to detect what is not stamped on coin that is current, and
   that, as you said in yesterday's talk using an ordinary expression, we
   may reject it as counterfeit, under the teaching of that skill which
   you treated of with sufficient fulness and detail, and showed ought to
   belong to the man who is spiritually a good money changer of the
   gospel. For of what good will it be to have recognized the value of
   that virtue and grace if we do not know how to seek for it and to gain
   it?

     __________________________________________________________________

   [98] Cf. I. xx.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    The answer how true discretion may be gained.

   THEN MOSES: True discretion, said he, is only secured by true humility.
   And of this humility the first proof is given by reserving everything
   (not only what you do but also what you think), for the scrutiny of the
   elders, so as not to trust at all in your own judgment but to acquiesce
   in their decisions in all points, and to acknowledge what ought to be
   considered good or bad by their traditions. [99] And this habit will
   not only teach a young man to walk in the right path through the true
   way of discretion, but will also keep him unhurt by all the crafts and
   deceits of the enemy. For a man cannot possibly be deceived, who lives
   not by his own judgment but according to the example of the elders, nor
   will our crafty foe be able to abuse the ignorance of one who is not
   accustomed from false modesty to conceal all the thoughts which rise in
   his heart, but either checks them or suffers them to remain, in
   accordance with the ripened judgment of the elders. For a wrong thought
   is enfeebled at the moment that it is discovered: and even before the
   sentence of discretion has been given, the foul serpent is by the power
   of confession dragged out, so to speak, from his dark under-ground
   cavern, and in some sense shown up and sent away in disgrace. For evil
   thoughts will hold sway in us just so long as they are hidden in the
   heart: and that you may gather still more effectually the power of this
   judgment I will tell you what Abbot Serapion did, [100] and what he
   used often to tell to the younger brethren for their edification.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    The words of Abbot Serapion on the decline of thoughts that are exposed to
    others, and also on the danger of self- confidence.

   WHILE, said he, I was still a lad, and stopping with Abbot Theonas,
   [101] this habit was forced upon me by the assaults of the enemy, that
   after I had supped with the old man at the ninth hour, I used every day
   secretly to hide a biscuit in my dress, which I would eat on the sly
   later on without his knowing it. And though I was constantly guilty of
   the theft with the consent of my will, and the want of restraint that
   springs from desire that has grown inveterate, yet when my unlawful
   desire was gratified I would come to myself and torment myself over the
   theft committed in a way that overbalanced the pleasure I had enjoyed
   in the eating. And when I was forced not without grief of heart to
   fulfil day after day this most heavy task required of me, so to speak,
   by Pharaoh's taskmasters, instead of bricks, and could not escape from
   this cruel tyranny, and yet was ashamed to disclose the secret theft to
   the old man, it chanced by the will of God that I was delivered from
   the yoke of this voluntary captivity, when certain brethren had sought
   the old man's cell with the object of being instructed by him. And when
   after supper the spiritual conference had begun to be held, and the old
   man in answer to the questions which they had propounded was speaking
   about the sin of gluttony and the dominion of secret thoughts, and
   showing their nature and the awful power which they have so long as
   they are kept secret, I was overcome by the power of the discourse and
   was conscience stricken and terrified, as I thought that these things
   were mentioned by him because the Lord had revealed to the old man my
   bosom secrets; and first I was moved to secret sighs, and then my
   heart's compunction increased and I openly burst into sobs and tears,
   and produced from the folds of my dress which shared my theft and
   received it, the biscuit which I had carried off in my bad habit to eat
   on the sly; and I laid it in the midst and lying on the ground and
   begging for forgiveness confessed how I used to eat one every day in
   secret, and with copious tears implored them to intreat the Lord to
   free me from this dreadful slavery. Then the old man: "Have faith, my
   child," said he, "Without any words of mine, your confession frees you
   from this slavery. For you have today triumphed over your victorious
   adversary, by laying him low by your confession in a manner which more
   than makes up for the way in which you were overthrown by him through
   your former silence, as when, never confuting him with your own answer
   or that of another, you had allowed him to lord it over you, according
   to that saying of Solomon's: `Because sentence is not speedily
   pronounced against the evil, the heart of the children of men is full
   within them to do evil:' [102] and therefore after this exposure of him
   that evil spirit will no longer be able to vex you, nor will that foul
   serpent henceforth make his lurking place in you, as he has been
   dragged out into light from the darkness by your life-giving
   confession." The old man had not finished speaking when lo! a burning
   lamp proceeding from the folds of my dress filled the cell with a
   sulphureous smell so that the pungency of the odour scarcely allowed us
   to stay there: and the old man resuming his admonition said Lo! the
   Lord has visibly confirmed to you the truth of my words, so that you
   can see with your eyes how he who was the author of His Passion has
   been driven out from your heart by your life-giving confession, and
   know that the enemy who has been exposed will certainly no longer find
   a home in you, as his expulsion is made manifest. And so, as the old
   man declared, said he, the sway of that diabolical tyranny over me has
   been destroyed by the power of this confession and stilled for ever so
   that the enemy has never even tried to force upon me any more the
   recollection of this desire, nor have I ever felt myself seized with
   the passion of that furtive longing. And this meaning we see is neatly
   expressed in a figure in Ecclesiastes. "If" says he "a serpent bite
   without hissing there is no sufficiency for the charmer," [103] showing
   that the bite of a serpent in silence is dangerous, i.e., if a
   suggestion or thought springing from the devil is not by means of
   confession shown to some charmer, I mean some spiritually minded person
   who knows how to heal the wound at once by charms from the Scripture,
   and to extract the deadly poison of the serpent from the heart, it will
   be impossible to help the sufferer who is already in danger and must
   soon die. In this way therefore we shall easily arrive at the knowledge
   of true discretion, so as by following the steps of the Elders never to
   do anything novel nor to decide anything by or on our own
   responsibility, but to walk in all things as we are taught by their
   tradition and upright life. And the man who is strengthened by this
   system will not only arrive at the perfect method of discretion, but
   also will remain perfectly safe from all the wiles of the enemy: for by
   no other fault does the devil drag down a monk so precipitately and
   lead him away to death, as when he persuades him to despise the counsel
   of the Elders and to rely on his own opinion and judgment: for if all
   the arts and contrivances discovered by man's ingenuity and those which
   are only useful for the conveniences of this temporary life, though
   they can be felt with the hand and seen with the eye, can yet not be
   understood by anyone, without lessons from a teacher, how foolish it is
   to fancy that there is no need of an instructor in this one alone which
   is invisible and secret and can only be seen by the purest heart, a
   mistake in which brings about no mere temporary loss or one that can
   easily be repaired, but the destruction of the soul and everlasting
   death: for it is concerned with a daily and nightly conflict against no
   visible foes, but invisible and cruel ones, and a spiritual combat not
   against one or two only, but against countless hosts, failure in which
   is the more dangerous to all, in proportion as the foe is the fiercer
   and the attack the more secret. And therefore we should always follow
   the footsteps of the Elders with the utmost care, and bring to them
   everything which rises in our hearts, by removing the veil of shame.

  CHAPTER XII.

    A confession of the modesty which made us ashamed to reveal our thoughts to
    the elders.

   GERMANUS: The ground of that hurtful modesty, through which we
   endeavour to hide bad thoughts, is especially owing to this reason;
   viz., that we have heard of a superior of the Elders in the region of
   Syria, as it was believed, who, when one of the brethren had laid bare
   his thoughts to him in a genuine confession, was afterwards extremely
   indignant and severely chid him for them. Whence it results that while
   we press them upon ourselves and are ashamed to make them known to the
   Elders, we cannot obtain the remedies that would heal them.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    The answer concerning the trampling down of shame, and the danger of one
    without contrition.

   MOSES: Just as all young men are not alike in fervour of spirit nor
   equally instructed in learning and good morals, so too we cannot find
   that all old men are equally perfect and excellent. For the true riches
   of old men are not to be measured by grey hairs but by their diligence
   in youth and the rewards of their past labours. "For," says one, "the
   things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shall thou find
   them in thy old age?" "For venerable old age is not that of long time,
   nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man is
   grey hairs, and a spotless life is old age." [104] And therefore we are
   not to follow in the steps or embrace the traditions and advice of
   every old man whose head is covered with grey hairs, and whose age is
   his sole claim to respect, but only of those whom we find to have
   distinguished themselves in youth in an approved and praiseworthy
   manner, and to have been trained up not on self-assurance but on the
   traditions of the Elders. For there are some, and unhappily they form
   the majority, who pass their old age in a lukewarmness which they
   contracted in youth, and in sloth, and so obtain authority not from the
   ripeness of their character but simply from the number of their years.
   Against whom that reproof of the Lord is specially aimed by the
   prophet: "Strangers have devoured his strength and he knew it not: yea,
   grey hairs also are spread about upon him, and he is ignorant of it."
   [105] These men, I say, are not pointed out as examples to youth from
   the uprightness of their lives, nor from the strictness of their
   profession, which would be worthy of praise and imitation, but simply
   from the number of their years; and so the subtle enemy uses their grey
   hairs to deceive the younger men, by a wrongful appeal to their
   authority, and endeavours in his cunning craftiness to upset and
   deceive by their example those who might have been urged into the way
   of perfection by their advice or that of others; and drags them down by
   means of their teaching and practice either into a baneful
   indifference, or into deadly despair. And as I want to give you an
   instance of this, I will tell you a fact which may supply us with some
   wholesome teaching, without giving the name of the actor, lest we might
   be guilty of something of the same kind as the man who published abroad
   the sins of the brother which had been disclosed to him. When this one,
   who was not the laziest of young men, had gone to an old man, whom we
   know very well, for the sake of the profit and health of his soul, and
   had candidly confessed that he was troubled by carnal appetites and the
   spirit of fornication, fancying that he would receive from the old
   man's words consolation for his efforts, and a cure for the wounds
   inflicted on him, the old man attacked him with the bitterest
   reproaches, and called him a miserable and disgraceful creature, and
   unworthy of the name of monk, while he could be affected by a sin and
   lust of this character, and instead of helping him so injured him by
   his reproaches that he dismissed him from his cell in a state of
   hopeless despair and deadly despondency. And when he, oppressed with
   such a sorrow, was plunged in deep thought, no longer how to cure his
   passion, but how to gratify his lust, the Abbot Apollos, [106] the most
   skilful of the Elders, met him, and seeing by his looks and gloominess
   his trouble and the violence of the assault which he was secretly
   revolving in his heart, asked him the reason of this upset; and when he
   could not possibly answer the old man's gentle inquiry, the latter
   perceived more and more clearly that it was not without reason that he
   wanted to hide in silence the cause of a gloom so deep that he could
   not conceal it by his looks, and so began to ask him still more
   earnestly the reasons for his hidden grief. And by this he was forced
   to confess that he was on his way to a village to take a wife, and
   leave the monastery and return to the world, since, as the old man had
   told him, he could not be a monk, if he was unable to control the
   desires of the flesh and to cure his passion. And then the old man
   smoothed him down with kindly consolation, and told him that he himself
   was daily tried by the same pricks of desire and lust, and that
   therefore he ought not to give way to despair, nor be surprised at the
   violence of the attack of which he would get the better not so much by
   zealous efforts, as by the mercy and grace of the Lord; and he begged
   him to put off his intention just for one day, and having implored him
   to return to his cell, went as fast as he could to the monastery of the
   above mentioned old man--and when he had drawn near to him he stretched
   forth his hands and prayed with tears, and said "O Lord, who alone art
   the righteous judge and unseen Physician of secret strength and human
   weakness, turn the assault from the young man upon the old one, that he
   may learn to condescend to the weakness of sufferers, and to sympathize
   even in old age with the frailties of youth." And when he had ended his
   prayer with tears, he sees a filthy Ethiopian standing over against his
   cell and aiming fiery darts at him, with which he was straightway
   wounded, and came out of his cell and ran about hither and thither like
   a lunatic or a drunken man, and going in and out could no longer
   restrain himself in it, but began to hurry off in the same direction in
   which the young man had gone. And when Abbot Apollos saw him like a
   madman driven wild by the furies, he knew that the fiery dart of the
   devil which he had seen, had been fixed in his heart, and had by its
   intolerable heat wrought in him this mental aberration and confusion of
   the understanding; and so he came up to him and asked "Whither are you
   hurrying, or what has made you forget the gravity of years and
   disturbed you in this childish way, and made you hurry about so
   rapidly"? And when he owing to his guilty conscience and confused by
   this disgraceful excitement fancied that the lust of his heart was
   discovered, and, as the secrets of his heart were known to the old man,
   did not venture to return any answer to his inquiries, "Return," said
   he, "to your cell, and at last recognize the fact that till now you
   have been ignored or despised by the devil, and not counted in the
   number of those with whom he is daily roused to fight and struggle
   against their efforts and earnestness,--you who could not--I will not
   say ward off, but not even postpone for one day, a single dart of his
   aimed at you after so many years spent in this profession of yours. And
   with this the Lord has suffered you to be wounded that you may at least
   learn in your old age to sympathize with infirmities to which you are a
   stranger, and may know from your own case and experience how to
   condescend to the frailties of the young, though when you received a
   young man troubled by an attack from the devil, you did not encourage
   him with any consolation, but gave him up in dejection and destructive
   despair into the hands of the enemy, to be, as far as you were
   concerned, miserably destroyed by him. But the enemy would certainly
   never have attacked him with so fierce an onslaught, with which he has
   up till now scorned to attack you, unless in his jealousy at the
   progress he was to make, he had endeavoured to get the better of that
   virtue which he saw lay in his disposition, and to destroy it with his
   fiery darts, as he knew without the shadow of a doubt that he was the
   stronger, since he deemed it worth his while to attack him with such
   vehemence. And so learn from your own experience to sympathize with
   those in trouble, and never to terrify with destructive despair those
   who are in danger, nor harden them with severe speeches, but rather
   restore them with gentle and kindly consolations, and as the wise
   Solomon says, "Spare not to deliver those who are led forth to death,
   and to redeem those who are to be slain," [107] and after the example
   of our Saviour, break not the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking
   flax, [108] and ask of the Lord that grace, by means of which you
   yourself may faithfully learn both in deed and power to sing: "the Lord
   hath given me a learned tongue that I should know how to uphold by word
   him that is weary:" [109] for no one could bear the devices of the
   enemy, or extinguish or repress those carnal fires which burn with a
   sort of natural flame, unless God's grace assisted our weakness, or
   protected and supported it. And therefore, as the reason for this
   salutary incident is over, by which the Lord meant to set that young
   man free from dangerous desires and to teach you something of the
   violence of their attack, and of the feeling of compassion, let us
   together implore Him in prayer, that He may be pleased to remove that
   scourge, which the Lord thought good to lay upon you for your good (for
   "He maketh sorry and cureth: he striketh and his hands heal. He
   humbleth and exalteth, he killeth and maketh alive: he bringeth down to
   the grave and bringeth up") [110] , and may extinguish with the
   abundant dew of His Spirit the fiery darts of the devil, which at my
   desire He allowed to wound you. And although the Lord removed this
   temptation at a single prayer of the old man with the same speed with
   which He had suffered it to come upon him, yet He showed by a clear
   proof that a man's faults when laid bare were not merely not to be
   scolded, but that the grief of one in trouble ought not to be lightly
   despised. And therefore never let the clumsiness or shallowness of one
   old man or of a few deter you and keep you back from that life-giving
   way, of which we spoke earlier, or from the tradition of the Elders, if
   our crafty enemy makes a wrongful use of their grey hairs in order to
   deceive younger men: but without any cloak of shame everything should
   be disclosed to the Elders, and remedies for wounds be faithfully
   received from them together with examples of life and conversation:
   from which we shall find like help and the same sort of result, if we
   try to do nothing at all on our own responsibility and judgment.

    Of the call of Samuel.

   LASTLY SO far has this opinion been shown to be pleasing to God that we
   see that this system not without reason finds a place in holy
   Scripture, so that the Lord would not of Himself instruct by the method
   of a Divine colloquy the lad Samuel, when chosen for judgment, but
   suffered him to run once or twice to the old man, and willed that one
   whom He was calling to converse with Him should be taught even by one
   who had offended God, as he was an old man, and preferred that he whom
   He had deemed worthy to be called by Him should be trained by the Elder
   in order to test the humility of him who was called to a Divine office,
   and to set an example to the younger men by the manner of his
   subjection.

  CHAPTER XV.

    Of the call of the Apostle Paul.

   AND when Christ in His own Person called and addressed Paul, although
   He might have opened out to him at once the way of perfection, yet He
   chose rather to direct him to Ananias and commanded him to learn the
   way of truth from him, saying: "Arise and go into the city and there it
   shall be told thee what thou oughtest to do." [111] So He sends him to
   an older man, and thinks good to have him instructed by his teaching
   rather than His own, lest what might have been rightly done in the case
   of Paul might set a bad example of self-sufficiency, if each one were
   to persuade himself that he also ought in like manner to be trained by
   the government and teaching of God alone rather than by the instruction
   of the Elders. And this self-sufficiency the apostle himself teaches,
   not only by his letters but by his acts and deeds, ought to be shunned
   with all possible care, as he says that he went up to Jerusalem solely
   for this reason; viz., to communicate in a private and informal
   conference with his co-apostles and those who were before him that
   Gospel which he preached to the Gentiles, the grace of the Holy Spirit
   accompanying him with powerful signs and wonders: as he says "And I
   communicated with them the Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles
   lest perhaps I had run or should run in vain." [112] Who then is so
   self-sufficient and blind as to dare to trust in his own judgment and
   discretion when the chosen vessel confesses that he had need of
   conference with his fellow apostles. Whence we clearly see that the
   Lord does not Himself show the way of perfection to anyone who having
   the opportunity of learning despises the teaching and training of the
   Elders, paying no heed to that saying which ought most carefully to be
   observed: "Ask thy father and he will show it to thee: thine Elders and
   they will tell thee." [113]

  CHAPTER XVI.

    How to seek for discretion.

   WE ought then with all our might to strive for the virtue of discretion
   by the power of humility, as it will keep us uninjured by either
   extreme, for there is an old saying akrothtes isothtes, i.e., extremes
   meet. For excess of fasting and gluttony come to the same thing, and an
   unlimited continuance of vigils is equally injurious to a monk as the
   torpor of a deep sleep: for when a man is weakened by excessive
   abstinence he is sure to return to that condition in which a man is
   kept through carelessness and negligence, so that we have often seen
   those who could not be deceived by gluttony, destroyed by excessive
   fasting and by reason of weakness liable to that passion which they had
   before overcome. Unreasonable vigils and nightly watchings have also
   been the ruin of some whom sleep could not get the better of: wherefore
   as the apostle says "with the arms of righteousness on the right hand
   and on the left," [114] we pass on with due moderation, and walk
   between the two extremes, under the guidance of discretion, that we may
   not consent to be led away from the path of continence marked out for
   us, nor fall by undue carelessness into the pleasures of the palate and
   belly.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [114] 2 Cor. 6:7.

  CHAPTER XVII.

    On excessive fasts and vigils.

   FOR I remember that I had so often resisted the desire for food, that
   having abstained from taking any for two or three days, my mind was not
   troubled even by the recollection of any eatables and also that sleep
   was by the assaults of the devil so far removed from my eyes, that for
   several days and nights I used to pray the Lord to grant a little sleep
   to my eyes; and then I felt that I was in greater peril from the want
   of food and sleep than from struggling against sloth and gluttony. And
   so as we ought to be careful not to fall into dangerous effeminacy
   through desire for bodily gratification, nor indulge ourselves with
   eating before the right time nor take too much, so also we ought to
   refresh ourselves with food and sleep at the proper time even if we
   dislike it. For the struggle in each case is caused by the devices of
   the enemy; and excessive abstinence is still more injurious to us than
   careless satiety: for from this latter the intervention of a healthy
   compunction will raise us to the right measure of strictness, and not
   from the former.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    A question on the right measure of abstinence and refreshment.

   GERMANUS: What then is the measure of abstinence by keeping which with
   even balance we shall succeed in passing unharmed between the two
   extremes?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

    Of the best plan for our daily food.

   MOSES: On this matter we are aware that there have been frequent
   discussions among our Elders. For in discussing the abstinence of some
   who supported their lives continually on nothing but beans or only on
   vegetables and fruits, they proposed to all of them to partake of bread
   alone, the right measure of which they fixed at two biscuits, so small
   that they assuredly scarcely weighed a pound.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

    An objection on the ease of that abstinence in which a man is sustained by
    two biscuits.

   AND this we gladly embraced, and answered that we should scarcely
   consider this limit as abstinence, as we could not possibly reach it
   entirely.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

    The answer concerning the value and measure of well-proved abstinence.

   MOSES: If you want to test the force of this rule, keep to this limit
   continually, never departing from it by taking any cooked food even on
   Sunday or Saturday, or on the occasions of the arrival of any of the
   brethren; for the flesh, refreshed by these exceptions, is able not
   only to support itself through the rest of the week on a smaller
   quantity, but can also postpone all refreshment without difficulty, as
   it is sustained by the addition of that food which it has taken beyond
   the limit; while the man who has always been satisfied with the full
   amount of the above-mentioned measure will never be able to do this,
   nor to put off breaking his fast till the morrow. For I remember that
   our Elders (and I recollect that we ourselves also often had the same
   experience) found it so hard and difficult to practise this abstinence,
   and observed the rule laid down with such pain and hunger that it was
   almost against their will and with tears and lamentation that they set
   this limit to their meals.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

    What is the usual limit both of abstinence and of partaking food.

   BUT this is the usual limit of abstinence; viz., for everyone to allow
   himself food according to the requirements of his strength or bodily
   frame or age, in such quantity as is required for the support of the
   flesh, and not for the satisfactory feeling of repletion. For on both
   sides a man will suffer the greatest injury, if having no fixed rule at
   one time he pinches his stomach with meagre food and fasts, and at
   another stuffs it by over-eating himself; for as the mind which is
   enfeebled for lack of food loses vigour in praying, while it is worn
   out with excessive weakness of the flesh and forced to doze, so again
   when weighed down with over-eating it cannot pour forth to God pure and
   free prayers: nor will it succeed in preserving uninterruptedly the
   purity of its chastity, while even on those days on which it seems to
   chastise the flesh with severer abstinence, it feeds the fire of carnal
   desire with the fuel of the food that it has already taken.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    Quemadmodum abundantia umorum genitalium castigetur. [115]

   NAM quod semel per escarum abundantian concretus fuerit in medullis,
   necesse est egeri atque ab ipsa naturæ lege propelli, quæ exuberantiam
   cujuslibet umoris superflui velut noxiam sibi atque contrariam in semet
   ipsa residere non patitur ideoque rationabili semper et æquali est
   corpus nostrum parsimonia castigandum, ut si naturali hac necessitate
   commorantes in carne omnimodis carere non possumus, saltim rarius nos
   et non amplius quamtrina vice ista conluvione respersos totius anni
   cursus inveniat, quod tamen sine ullo pruritu quietus egerat sopor, non
   fallax imago index occultæ voluptatis eliciat.

   Wherefore this is the moderate and even allowance and measure of
   abstinence, of which we spoke, which has the approval also of the
   judgment of the fathers; viz., that daily hunger should go hand in hand
   with our daily meals, preserving both body and soul in one and the same
   condition, and not allowing the mind either to faint through weariness
   from fasting, nor to be oppressed by over-eating, for it ends in such a
   sparing diet that sometimes a man neither notices nor remembers in the
   evening that he has broken his fast.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [115] It has been thought best to leave the first part of the following
   chapter untranslated.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    Of the difficulty of uniformity in eating; and of the gluttony of brother
    Benjamin.

   AND so far is this not done without difficulty, that those who know
   nothing of perfect discretion would rather prolong their fasts for two
   days, and reserve for tomorrow what they should have eaten today, so
   that when they come to partake of food they may enjoy as much as they
   can desire. And you know that lastly your fellow citizen Benjamin most
   obstinately stuck to this: as he would not every day partake of his two
   biscuits, nor, continually take his meagre fare with uniform
   self-discipline, but preferred always to continue his fasts for two
   days that when he came to eat he might fill his greedy stomach with a
   double portion, and by eating four biscuits enjoy a comfortable sense
   of repletion, and manage to fill his belly by means of a two days'
   fast. And you doubtless remember what sort of an end there was to the
   life of this man who obstinately and pertinaciously relied on his own
   judgment rather than on the traditions of the Elders, for he forsook
   the desert and returned back to the vain philosophy of this world and
   earthly vanities, and so confirmed the above mentioned opinion of the
   Elders by the example of his downfall, and by his destruction teaches a
   lesson that no one who trusts in his own opinion and judgment can
   possibly climb the heights of perfection, nor fail to be deceived by
   the dangerous wiles of the devil.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

    A question how is it possible always to observe one and the same measure.

   GERMANUS: How then can we observe this measure without ever breaking
   it? for sometimes at the ninth hour when the Station fast [116] is
   over, brethren come to see us and then we must either for their sakes
   add something to our fixed and customary portion, or certainly fail in
   that courtesy which we are told to show to everybody.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [116] On the Statio see the note on the Institutes V. xx.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVI.

    The answer how we should not exceed the proper measure of food.

   MOSES: Both duties must be observed in the same way and with equal
   care: for we ought most scrupulously to preserve the proper allowance
   of food for the sake of our abstinence, and in like manner out of
   charity to show courtesy and encouragement to any of the brethren who
   may arrive; because it is absolutely ridiculous when you offer food to
   a brother, nay, to Christ Himself, not to partake of it with him, but
   to make yourself a stranger to his repast. And so we shall keep clear
   of guilt on either hand if we observe this plan; viz., at the ninth
   hour to partake of one of the two biscuits which form our proper
   canonical allowance, and to keep back the other to the evening, in
   expectation of something like this, that if any of the brethren comes
   to see us we may partake of it with him, and so add nothing to our own
   customary allowance: and by this arrangement the arrival of our brother
   which ought to be a pleasure to us will cause us no inconvenience:
   since we shall show him the civilities which courtesy requires in such
   a way as to relax nothing of the strictness of our abstinence. But if
   no one should come, we may freely take this last biscuit as belonging
   to us according to our canonical rule, and by this frugality of ours as
   a single biscuit was taken at the ninth hour, our stomach will not be
   overloaded at eventide, a thing which is often the case with those who
   under the idea that they are observing a stricter abstinence put off
   all their repast till evening; for the fact that we have but recently
   taken food hinders our intellect from being bright and keen both in our
   evening and in our nocturnal prayers, and so at the ninth hour a
   convenient and suitable time has been allowed for food, in which a monk
   can refresh himself and so find that he is not only fresh and bright
   during his nocturnal vigils, but also perfectly ready for his evening
   prayers, as his food is already digested.

   With such a banquet of two courses, as it were, the holy Moses feasted
   us, showing us not only the grace and power of discretion by his
   present learned speech, but also the method of renunciation and the end
   and aim of the monastic life by the discussion previously held; so as
   to make clearer than daylight what we had hitherto pursued simply with
   fervour of spirit and zeal for God but with closed eyes, and to make us
   feel how far we had up till then wandered from purity of heart and the
   straight line of our course, since the practice of all visible arts
   belonging to this life cannot possibly stand without an understanding
   of their aim, nor can it be taken in hand without a clear view of a
   definite end.

                                 CONFERENCE 3.

CONFERENCE OF ABBOT PAPHNUTIUS.

ON THE THREE SORTS OF RENUNCIATIONS.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Of the life and conduct of Abbot Paphnutius.

   IN that choir of saints who shine like brilliant stars in the night of
   this world, we have seen the holy. Paphnutius, [117] like some great
   luminary, shining with the brightness of knowledge. For he was a
   presbyter of our company, I mean of those whose abode was in the desert
   of Scete, where he lived to extreme old age, without ever moving from
   his cell, of which he had taken possession when still young, and which
   was five miles from the church, even to nearer districts; nor was he
   when worn out with years hindered by the distance from going to Church
   on Saturday or Sunday. But not wanting to return from thence empty
   handed he would lay on his shoulders a bucket of water to last him all
   the week, and carry it back to his cell, and even when he was past
   ninety would not suffer it to be fetched by the labour of younger men.
   He then from his earliest youth threw himself into the monastic
   discipline with such fervour that when he had spent only a short time
   in it, he was endowed with the virtue of submission, as well as the
   knowledge of all good qualities. For by the practice of humility and
   obedience he mortified all his desires, and by this stamped out all his
   faults and acquired every virtue which the monastic system and the
   teaching of the ancient fathers produces, and, inflamed with desire for
   still further advances, he was eager to penetrate into the recesses of
   the desert, so that, with no human companions to disturb him, he might
   be more readily united to the Lord, to whom he longed to be inseparably
   joined, even while he still lived in the society of the brethren. And
   there once more in his excessive fervour he outstripped the virtues of
   the Anchorites, and in his eager desire for continual divine meditation
   avoided the sight of them: and he plunged into solitary places yet
   wilder and more inaccessible, and hid himself for a long while in them,
   so that, as the Anchorites themselves only with great difficulty caught
   a glimpse of him every now and then, the belief was that he enjoyed and
   delighted in the daily society of angels, and because of this
   remarkable characteristic of his [118] he was surnamed by them the
   Buffalo.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [117] Paphnutius. The name is not uncommon in the annals of the fourth
   century: (1) A Deacon who bore it suffered in the persecution of
   Diocletian; and (2) a Bishop of the same name, who had been a
   confessor, was mainly instrumental in preventing the rule of celibacy
   being forced on the clergy by the Council of Nicæa; (3) another was a
   prominent member of the Meletian schism; while (4) a fourth was
   present, as Bishop of Sais in Lower Egypt, at the Council of Alexandria
   in 362; and (5) the life of a fifth is given by Palladius (Hist. Laus.
   lxii.-lxv.) and Rufinus (Hist. Monach. c. xvi.). The one whom Cassian
   here mentions, surnamed the Buffalo, is apparently a different person
   from the last mentioned. Further details of his history are given in
   the Institutes IV. c. xxx. xxxi., and in Conference X. ii., iii.
   Cassian tells the interesting story of his share in the
   Anthropomorphite controversy, and the beneficial influence which he
   then exercised.

   [118] I.e., his solitariness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    Of the discourse of the same old man, and our reply to it.

   AS then we were anxious to learn from his teaching, we came in some
   agitation to his cell towards evening. And after a short silence he
   began to commend our undertaking, because we had left our homes, and
   had visited so many countries out of love for the Lord, and were
   endeavouring with all our might to endure want and the trials of the
   desert, and to imitate their severe life, which even those who had been
   born and bred in the same state of want and penury, could scarcely put
   up with; and we replied that we had come for his teaching and
   instruction in order that we might be to some extent initiated in the
   customs of so great a man, and in that perfection which we had known
   from many evidences to exist in him, not that we might be honoured by
   any commendations to which we had no right, or be puffed up with any
   elation of mind, (with which we were sometimes exercised in our own
   cells at the suggestion of our enemy) in consequence of any words of
   his. Wherefore we begged him rather to lay before us what would make us
   humble and contrite, and not what would flatter us and puff us up.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    The statement of Abbot Paphnutius on the three kinds of vocations, and the
    three sorts of renunciations.

   THEN THE BLESSED PAPHNUTIUS: There are, said he, three kinds of
   vocations. And we know that there are three sorts of renunciations as
   well, which are necessary to a monk, whatever his vocation may be. And
   we ought diligently to examine first the reason for which we said that
   there were three kinds of vocations, that when we are sure that we are
   summoned to God's service in the first stage of our vocation, we may
   take care that our life is in harmony with the exalted height to which
   we are called, for it will be of no use to have made a good beginning
   if we do not show forth an end corresponding to it. But if we feel that
   only in the last resort have we been dragged away from a worldly life,
   then, as it appears that we rest on a less satisfactory beginning as
   regards religion, so must we proportionately make the more earnest
   endeavours to rouse ourselves with spiritual fervour to make a better
   end. It is well too on every ground for us to know secondly the manner
   of the threefold renunciations because we shall never be able to attain
   perfection, if we are ignorant of it or if we know it, but do not
   attempt to carry it out in act.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    An explanation of the three callings.

   TO make clear therefore the main differences between these three kinds
   of calling, the first is from God, the second comes through man, the
   third is from compulsion. And a calling is from God whenever some
   inspiration has taken possession of our heart, and even while we are
   asleep stirs in us at desire for eternal life and salvation, and bids
   us follow God and cleave to His commandments with life-giving
   contrition: as we read in Holy Scripture that Abraham was called by the
   voice of the Lord from his native country, and all his dear relations,
   and his father's house; when the Lord said "Get thee out from thy
   country and from thy kinsfolk and from thy father's house." [119] And
   in this way we have heard that the blessed Antony also was called,
   [120] the occasion of whose conversion was received from God alone. For
   on entering a church he there heard in the Gospel the Lord saying:
   "Whoever hateth not father and mother and children and wife and lands,
   yea and his own soul also, cannot be my disciple;" and "if thou wilt be
   perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
   shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me:" [121] And with
   heartfelt contrition he took this charge of the Lord as if specially
   aimed at him, and at once gave up everything and followed Christ,
   without any incitement thereto from the advice and teaching of men. The
   second kind of calling is that which we said took place through man;
   viz., when we are stirred up by the example of some of the saints, and
   their advice, and thus inflamed with the desire of salvation: and by
   this we never forget that by the grace of the Lord we ourselves were
   summoned, as we were aroused by the advice and good example of the
   above-mentioned saint, to give ourselves up to this aim and calling;
   and in this way also we find in Holy Scripture that it was through
   Moses that the children of Israel were delivered from the Egyptian
   bondage. But the third kind of calling is that which comes from
   compulsion, when we have been involved in the riches and pleasures of
   this life, and temptations suddenly come upon us and either threaten us
   with peril of death, or smite us with the loss and confiscation of our
   goods, or strike us down with the death of those dear to us, and thus
   at length even against our will we are driven to turn to God whom we
   scorned to follow in the days of our wealth. And of this compulsory
   call we often find instances in Scripture, when we read that on account
   of their sins the children of Israel were given up by the Lord to their
   enemies; and that on account of their tyranny and savage cruelty they
   turned again, and cried to the Lord. And it says: "The Lord sent them a
   Saviour, called Ehud, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini, who used the
   left hand as well as the right:" and again we are told, "they cried
   unto the Lord, who raised them up a Saviour and delivered them, to wit,
   Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother." [122] And it is of
   such that the Psalm speaks: "When He slew them, then they sought Him:
   and they returned and came to Him early in the morning: and they
   remembered that God was their helper, and the most High God their
   redeemer." And again: "And they cried unto the Lord when they were
   troubled, and He delivered them out of their distress." [123]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [119] Gen. 12:7.

   [120] The story, to which allusion is here made, is given in the Vita
   Antonii of Athanasius. We are there told that six months after the
   death of his parents Antony, the a young man of eighteen, chanced to
   enter a church just as the gospel for the day was being read: and
   hearing the words, "If thou wilt be perfect," etc., he took them as
   addressed specially to himself, and at once proceeded to act upon them,
   selling all that he had except a small portion which he reserved for
   his sister's maintenance. Shortly after he was struck by the words,
   "Take the thought for the morrow," which he heard in church, and acting
   upon this, made away with the little property which was left, committed
   his sister to the care of certain faithful virgins, and betook himself
   to the ascetic life.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    How the first of these calls is of no use to a sluggard, and the last is no
    hindrance to one who is in earnest.

   OF these three calls then, although the two former may seem to rest on
   better principles, yet sometimes we find that even by the third grade,
   which seems the lowest and the coldest, men have been made perfect and
   most earnest in spirit, and have become like those who made an
   admirable beginning in approaching the Lord's service, and passed the
   rest of their lives also in most laudable fervour of spirit: and again
   we find that from the higher grade very many have grown cold, and often
   have come to a miserable end. And just as it was no hindrance to the
   former class that they seemed to be converted not of their own free
   will, but by force and compulsion, in as much as the loving kindness of
   the Lord secured for them the opportunity for repentance, so too to the
   latter it was of no avail that the early days of their conversion were
   so bright, because they were not careful to bring the remainder of
   their life to a suitable end. For in the case of Abbot Moses, [124] who
   lived in a spot in the wilderness called Calamus, [125] nothing was
   wanting to his merits and perfect bliss, in consequence of the fact
   that he was driven to flee to the monastery through fear of death,
   which was hanging over him because of a murder; for he made such use of
   his compulsory conversion that with ready zeal he turned it into a
   voluntary one and climbed the topmost heights of perfection. As also on
   the other hand; to very many, whose names I ought not to mention, it
   has been of no avail that they entered on the Lord's service with
   better beginning than this, as afterwards sloth and hardness of heart
   crept over them, and they fell into a dangerous state of torpor, and
   the bottomless pit of death, an instance of which we see clearly
   indicated in the call of the Apostles. For of what good was it to Judas
   that he had of his own free will embraced the highest grade of the
   Apostolate in the same way in which Peter and the rest of the Apostles
   had been summoned, as he allowed the splendid beginning of his call to
   terminate in a ruinous end of cupidity and covetousness, and as a cruel
   murderer even rushed into the betrayal of the Lord? Or what hindrance
   was it to Paul that he was suddenly blinded, and seemed to be drawn
   against his will into the way of salvation, as afterwards he followed
   the Lord with complete fervour of soul, and having begun by compulsion
   completed it by a free and voluntary devotion, and terminated with a
   magnificent end a life that was rendered glorious by such great deeds?
   Everything therefore depends upon the end; in which one who was
   consecrated by a noble conversion at the outset may through
   carelessness turn out a failure, and one who was compelled by necessity
   to adopt the monastic life may through fear of God and earnestness be
   made perfect.

  CHAPTER VI.

    An account of the three sorts of renunciations.

   WE must now speak of the renunciations, of which tradition and the
   authority of Holy Scripture show us three, and which every one of us
   ought with the utmost zeal to make complete. The first is that by which
   as far as the body is concerned we make light of all the wealth and
   goods of this world; the second, that by which we reject the fashions
   and vices and former affections of soul and flesh; the third, that by
   which we detach our soul from all present and visible things, and
   contemplate only things to come, and set our heart on what is
   invisible. And we read that the Lord charged Abraham to do all these
   three at once, when He said to him "Get thee out from thy country, and
   thy kinsfolk, and thy father's house." [126] First He said "from thy
   country," i.e., from the goods of this world, and earthly riches:
   secondly, "from thy kinsfolk," i.e., from this former life and habits
   and sins, which cling to us from our very birth and are joined to us as
   it were by ties of affinity and kinship: thirdly, "from thy father's
   house," i.e., from all the recollection of this world, which the sight
   of the eyes can afford. For of the two fathers, i.e., of the one who is
   to be forsaken, and of the one who is to be sought, David thus speaks
   in the person of God: "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline
   thine ear: forget also thine own people and thy father's house:" [127]
   for the person who says "Hearken, O daughter," is certainly a Father;
   and yet he bears witness that the one, whose house and people he urges
   should be forgotten, is none the less father of his daughter. And this
   happens when being dead with Christ to the rudiments of this world, we
   no longer, as the Apostle says, regard "the things which are seen, but
   those which are not seen, for the things which are not seen are
   eternal," [128] and going forth in heart from this temporal and visible
   home, turn our eyes and heart towards that in which we are to remain
   for ever. And this we shall succeed in doing when, while we walk in the
   flesh, we are no longer at war with the Lord according to the flesh,
   proclaiming in deed and actions the truth of that saying of the blessed
   Apostle "Our conversation is in heaven." [129] To these three sorts of
   renunciations the three books of Solomon suitably correspond. For
   Proverbs answers to the first renunciation, as in it the desires for
   carnal things and earthly sins are repressed; to the second
   Ecclesiastes corresponds, as there everything which is done under the
   sun is declared to be vanity; to the third the Song of Songs, in which
   the soul soaring above all things visible, is actually joined to the
   word of God by the contemplation of heavenly things.

  CHAPTER VII.

    How we can attain perfection in each of these sorts of renunciations.

   WHEREFORE it will not be of much advantage to us that we have made our
   first renunciation with the utmost devotion and faith, if we do not
   complete the second with the same zeal and ardour. And so when we have
   succeeded in this, we shall be able to arrive at the third as well, in
   which we go forth from the house of our former parent, (who, as we know
   well, was our father from our very birth, after the old man, when we
   were "by nature children of wrath, as others also," [130] ) and fix our
   whole mental gaze on things celestial. And of this father Scripture
   says to Jerusalem which had despised God the true Father, "Thy father
   was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite;" [131] and in the gospel we
   read "Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye
   love to do." [132] And when we have left him, as we pass from things
   visible to things unseen we shall be able to say with the Apostle: "But
   we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we
   have a habitation from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the
   heavens," [133] and this also, which we quoted a little while ago: "But
   our conversation is in heaven, whence also we look for the Saviour, the
   Lord Jesus, who will reform the body of our low estate made like to the
   body of His glory," [134] and this of the blessed David: "For I am a
   sojourner upon the earth," and "a stranger as all my fathers were;"
   [135] so that we may in accordance with the Lord's word be made like
   those of whom the Lord speaks to His Father in the gospel as follows:
   "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world," [136] and again
   to the Apostles themselves: "If ye were of this world, the world would
   love its own: but because ye are not of this world, therefore the world
   hateth you." [137] Of this third renunciation then we shall succeed in
   reaching the perfection, whenever our soul is sullied by no stain of
   carnal coarseness, but, all such having been carefully eliminated, it
   has been freed from every earthly quality and desire, and by constant
   meditation on things Divine, and spiritual contemplation has so far
   passed on to things unseen, that in its earnest seeking after things
   above and things spiritual it no longer feels that it is prisoned in
   this fragile flesh, and bodily form, but is caught up into such an
   ecstasy as not only to hear no words with the outward ear, or to busy
   itself with gazing on the forms of things present, but not even to see
   things close at hand, or large objects straight before the very eyes.
   And of this no one can understand the truth and force, except one who
   has made trial of what has been said, under the teaching of experience;
   viz., one, the eyes of whose soul the Lord has turned away from all
   things present, so that he no longer considers them as things that will
   soon pass away, but as things that are already done with, and sees them
   vanish into nothing, like misty smoke; and like Enoch, "walking with
   God," and "translated" from human life and fashions, not "be found"
   amid the vanities of this life. And that this actually happened
   corporeally in the case of Enoch the book of Genesis thus tells us.
   "And Enoch walked with God, and was not found, for God translated him."
   And the Apostle also says: "By faith Enoch was translated that he
   should not see death," the death namely of which the Lord says in the
   gospel: "He that liveth and believeth in me shall not die eternally."
   [138] Wherefore, if we are anxious to attain true perfection, we ought
   to look to it that as we have outwardly with the body made light of
   parents, home, the riches and pleasures of the world, we may also
   inwardly with the heart forsake all these things and never be drawn
   back by any desires to those things which we have forsaken, as those
   who were led up by Moses, though they did not literally go back, are
   yet said to have returned in heart to Egypt; viz., by forsaking God who
   had led them forth with such mighty signs, and by worshipping the idols
   of Egypt of which they had thought scorn, as Scripture says: "And in
   their hearts they turned back into Egypt, saying to Aaron: Make us gods
   to go before us," [139] for we should fall into like condemnation with
   those who, while dwelling in the wilderness, after they had tasted
   manna from heaven, lusted after the filthy food of sins, and of mean
   baseness, and should seem together with them to murmur in the same way:
   "It was well with us in Egypt, when we sat over the flesh pots and ate
   the onions, and garlic, and cucumbers, and melons:" [140] A form of
   speech, which, although it referred primarily to that people, we yet
   see fulfilled today in our own case and mode of life: for everyone who
   after renouncing this world turns back to his old desires, and reverts
   to his former likings asserts in heart and act the very same thing that
   they did, and says "It was well with me in Egypt," and I am afraid that
   the number of these will be as large as that of the multitudes of
   backsliders of whom we read under Moses, for though they were reckoned
   as six hundred and three thousand armed men who came out of Egypt, of
   this number not more than two entered the land of promise. Wherefore we
   should be careful to take examples of goodness from those who are few
   and far between, because according to that figure of which we have
   spoken in the gospel "Many are called but few" are said to be "chosen."
   [141] A renunciation then in body alone, and a mere change of place
   from Egypt will not do us any good, if we do not succeed in achieving
   that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable. For
   of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle
   declares as follows: "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,
   and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me
   nothing." [142] And the blessed Apostle would never have said this had
   it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all
   their goods to feed the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical
   perfection and the lofty heights of charity, because while pride or
   impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify
   themselves from their former sins, and unrestrained habits, and on that
   account could never attain to that love of God which never faileth, and
   these, as they fall short in this second stage of renunciation, can
   still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher.
   But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not
   simply say "If I bestow my goods." For it might perhaps be thought that
   he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the command of the gospel, but
   had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted persons do.
   But he says "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor," i.e., even
   if my renunciation of those earthly riches be perfect. And to this
   renunciation he adds something still greater: "And though I give my
   body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:" As if he had
   said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in
   accordance with that command in the gospel, where we are told "If thou
   wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and
   thou shalt have treasure in heaven," [143] renouncing them so as to
   keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution
   (of my goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add martyrdom so as
   to give up my body for Christ, and yet be impatient, or passionate or
   envious or proud, or excited by wrongs done by others, or seek what is
   mine, or indulge in evil thoughts, or not be ready and patient in
   bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the
   burning of the outer man will profit me nothing, while the inner man is
   still involved in the former sins, because, while in the fervour of the
   early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly substance,
   which is said to be not good or evil in itself but indifferent, I took
   no care to cast out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart,
   or to attain to that love of the Lord which is patient, which is "kind,
   which envieth not, is not puffed up, is not soon angry, dealeth not
   perversely, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil," which "beareth all
   things, endureth all things," [144] and which lastly never suffers him
   who follows after it to fall by the deceitfulness of sin.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of our very own possessions in which the beauty of the soul is seen or its
    foulness.

   WE ought then to take the utmost care that our inner man as well may
   cast off and make away with all those possessions of its sins, which it
   acquired in its former life: which as they continually cling to body
   and soul are our very own, and, unless we reject them and cut them off
   while we are still in the flesh, will not cease to accompany us after
   death. For as good qualities, or charity itself which is their source,
   may be gained in this world, and after the close of this life make the
   man who loves it lovely and glorious, so our faults transmit to that
   eternal remembrance a mind darkened and stained with foul colours. For
   the beauty or ugliness of the soul is the product of its virtues or its
   vices, the colour it takes from which either makes it so glorious, that
   it may well hear from the prophet "And the king shall have pleasure in
   thy beauty," [145] or so black, and foul, and ugly, that it must surely
   acknowledge the stench of its shame, and say "My wounds stink and are
   corrupt because of my foolishness," [146] and the Lord Himself says to
   it "Why is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed?" [147]
   And therefore these are our very own possessions, which continually
   remain with the soul, which no king and no enemy can either give or
   take away from us. These are our very own possessions which not even
   death itself can part from the soul, but by renouncing which we can
   attain to perfection, and by clinging to which we shall suffer the
   punishment of eternal death.

  CHAPTER IX.

    Of three sorts of possessions.

   RICHES and possessions are taken in Holy Scripture in three different
   ways, i.e., as good, bad, and indifferent. Those are bad, of which it
   is said: "The rich have wanted and have suffered hunger," [148] and
   "Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation:"
   [149] and to have cast off these riches is the height of perfection;
   and a distinction which belongs to those poor who are commended in the
   gospel by the Lord's saying: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
   theirs is the kingdom of heaven;" [150] and in the Psalm: "This poor
   man cried, and the Lord heard him," [151] and again: "The poor and
   needy shall praise thy name." [152] Those riches are good, to acquire
   which is the work of great virtue and merit, and the righteous
   possessor of which is praised by David who says "The generation of the
   righteous shall be blessed: glory and riches are in his house, and his
   righteousness remaineth for ever:" [153] and again "the ransom of a
   man's life are his riches." [154] And of these riches it is said in the
   Apocalypse to him who has them not and to his shame is poor and naked:
   "I will begin," says he, "to vomit thee out of my mouth. Because thou
   sayest I am rich and wealthy and have need of nothing: and knowest not
   that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked, I
   counsel thee to buy of me gold fire-tried, that thou mayest be made
   rich, and mayest be clothed in white garments, and that the shame of
   thy nakedness may not appear." [155] There are some also which are
   indifferent, i.e., which may be made either good or bad: for they are
   made either one or the other in accordance with the will and character
   of those who use them: of which the blessed, Apostle says "Charge the
   rich of this world not to be high-minded nor to trust in the
   uncertainty of riches, but in God (who giveth us abundantly all things
   to enjoy), to do good, to give easily, to communicate to others, to lay
   up in store for themselves a good foundation that they may lay hold on
   the true life." [156] These are what the rich man in the gospel kept,
   and never distributed to the poor,--while the beggar Lazarus was lying
   at his gate and desiring to be fed with his crumbs; and so he was
   condemned to the unbearable flames and everlasting heat of hell-fire.

  CHAPTER X.

    That none can become perfect merely through the first grade of renunciation.

   IN leaving then these visible goods of the world we forsake not our own
   wealth, but that which is not ours, although we boast of it as either
   gained by our own exertions or inherited by us from our forefathers.
   For as I said nothing is our own, save this only which we possess with
   our heart, and which cleaves to our soul, and therefore cannot be taken
   away from us by any one. But Christ speaks in terms of censure of those
   visible riches, to those who clutch them as if they were their own, and
   refuse to share them with those in want. "If ye have not been faithful
   in what is another's, who will give to you what is your own?" [158]
   Plainly then it is not only daily experience which teaches us that
   these riches are not our own, but this saying of our Lord also, by the
   very title which it gives them. But concerning visible [159] and
   worthless riches Peter says to the Lord: "Lo, we have left all and
   followed thee. What shall we have therefore?" [160] when it is clear
   that they had left nothing but their miserable broken nets. And unless
   this expression "all" is understood to refer to that renunciation of
   sins which is really great and important, we shall not find that the
   Apostles had left anything of any value, or that the Lord had any
   reason for bestowing on them the blessing of so great glory, that they
   were allowed to hear from Him that "in the regeneration, when the Son
   of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon
   twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel." [161] If then
   those, who have completely renounced their earthly and visible goods,
   cannot for sufficient reason attain to Apostolic charity, nor climb
   with readiness and vigour to that third stage of renunciation which is
   still higher and belongs to but few, what should those think of
   themselves, who do not even make that first step (which is very easy) a
   thorough one, but keep together with their old want of faith, their
   former sordid riches, and fancy that they can boast of the mere name of
   monks? The first renunciation then of which we spoke is of what is not
   our own, and therefore is not enough of itself to confer perfection on
   the renunciant, unless he advances to the second, which is really and
   truly a renunciation of what belongs to us. And when we have made sure
   of this by the expulsion of all our faults, we shall mount to the
   heights of the third renunciation also, whereby we rise above not
   merely all those things which are done in this world or specially
   belong to men, but even that whole universe around us which is esteemed
   so glorious, and shall with heart and soul look down upon it as subject
   to vanity and destined soon to pass away; as we look, as the Apostle
   says, "not on those things which are seen, but on those which are not
   seen: for the things that are seen, are temporal, and the things which
   are not seen are eternal;" [162] that so we may be found worthy to hear
   that highest utterance, which was spoken to Abraham: "and come into a
   land which I will show thee," [163] which clearly shows that unless a
   man has made those three former renunciations with all earnestness of
   mind, he cannot attain to this fourth, which is granted as a reward and
   privilege to one whose renunciation is perfect, that he may be found
   worthy to enter the land of promise which no longer bears for him the
   thorns and thistles of sins; which after all the passions have been
   driven out is acquired by purity of heart even in the body, and which
   no good deeds or exertions of man's efforts (can gain), but which the
   Lord Himself promises to show, saying "And come into the land which I
   will show to thee:" which clearly proves that the beginning of our
   salvation results from the call of the Lord, Who says "Get thee out
   from thy country," and that the completion of perfection and purity is
   His gift in the same way, as He says "And come into the land which I
   will show thee," i.e., not one you yourself can know or discover by
   your own efforts, but one which I will show not only to one who is
   ignorant of it, but even to one who is not looking for it. And from
   this we clearly gather that as we hasten to the way of salvation
   through being stirred up by the inspiration of the Lord, so too it is
   under the guidance of His direction and illumination that we attain to
   the perfection of the highest bliss.

  CHAPTER XI.

    A question on the free will of man and the grace of God.

   GERMANUS: Where then is there room for free will, and how is it
   ascribed to our efforts that we are worthy of praise, if God both
   begins and ends everything in us which concerns our salvation?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    The answer on the economy of Divine Grace, with free will still remaining in
    us.

   PAPHNUTIUS: This would fairly influence us, if in every work and
   practice, the beginning and the end were everything, and there were no
   middle in between. And so as we know that God creates opportunities of
   salvation in various ways, it is in our power to make use of the
   opportunities granted to us by heaven more or less earnestly. For just
   as the offer came from God Who called him "get thee out of thy
   country," so the obedience was on the part of Abraham who went forth;
   and as the fact that the saying "Come into the land" was carried into
   action, was the work of him who obeyed, so the addition of the words
   "which I will show thee" came from the grace of God Who commanded or
   promised it. But it is well for us to be sure that although we practise
   every virtue with unceasing efforts, yet with all our exertions and
   zeal we can never arrive at perfection, nor is mere human diligence and
   toil of itself sufficient to deserve to reach the splendid reward of
   bliss, unless we have secured it by means of the co-operation of the
   Lord, and His directing our heart to what is right. And so we ought
   every moment to pray and say with David "Order my steps in thy paths
   that my footsteps slip not:" [164] and "He hath set my feet upon a rock
   and ordered my goings:" [165] that He Who is the unseen ruler of the
   human heart may vouchsafe to turn to the desire of virtue that will of
   ours, which is more readily inclined to vice either through want of
   knowledge of what is good, or through the delights of passion. And we
   read this in a verse in which the prophet sings very plainly: "Being
   pushed I was overturned that I might fall," where the weakness of our
   free will is shown. And "the Lord sustained me:" [166] again this shows
   that the Lord's help is always joined to it, and by this, that we may
   not be altogether destroyed by our free will, when He sees that we have
   stumbled, He sustains and supports us, as it were by stretching out His
   hand. And again: "If I said my foot was moved;" viz., from the slippery
   character of the will, "Thy mercy, O Lord, helped me." [167] Once more
   he joins on the help of God to his own weakness, as he confesses that
   it was not owing to his own efforts but to the mercy of God, that the
   foot of his faith was not moved. And again: "According to the multitude
   of the sorrows which I had in my heart," which sprang most certainly
   from my free will, "Thy comforts have refreshed my soul," [168] i.e.,
   by coming through Thy inspiration into my heart, and laying open the
   view of future blessings which Thou hast prepared for them who labour
   in Thy name, they not only removed all anxiety from my heart, but
   actually conferred upon it he greatest delight. And again: "Had it not
   been that the Lord helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell." [169]
   He certainly shows that through the depravity of this free will he
   would have dwelt in hell, had he not been saved by the assistance and
   protection of the Lord. For "By the Lord," and not by free-will, "are a
   man's steps directed," and "although the righteous fall" at least by
   free will, "he shall not be cast away." And why? because "the Lord
   upholdeth him with His hand:" [170] and this is to say with the utmost
   clearness: None of the righteous are sufficient of themselves to
   acquire righteousness, unless every moment when they stumble and fall
   the Divine mercy supports them with His hands, that they may not
   utterly collapse and perish, when they have been cast down through the
   weakness of free will.

    That the ordering of our way comes from God.

   AND truly the saints have never said that it was by their own efforts
   that they secured the direction of the way in which they walked in
   their course towards advance and perfection of virtue, but rather they
   prayed for it from the Lord, saying "Direct me in Thy truth," and
   "direct my way in thy sight." [171] But someone else declares that he
   discovered this very fact not only by faith, but also by experience,
   and as it were from the very nature of things: "I know, O Lord, that
   the way of man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk and to direct
   his steps." [172] And the Lord Himself says to Israel: "I will direct
   him like a green fir-tree: from Me is thy fruit found." [173]

  CHAPTER XV.

    That the understanding, by means of which we can recognize God's commands,
    and the performance of a good will are both gifts from the Lord.

   FURTHER the blessed David asks of the Lord that he may gain that very
   understanding, by which he can recognize God's commands which, he well
   knew, were written in the book of the law, and he says "I am Thy
   servant: O give me understanding that I may learn Thy commandments."
   [175] Certainly he was in possession of understanding, which had been
   granted to him by nature, and also had at his fingers' ends a knowledge
   of God's commands which were preserved in writing in the law: and still
   he prayed the Lord that he might learn this more thoroughly as he knew
   that what came to him by nature would never be sufficient for him,
   unless his understanding was enlightened by the Lord by a daily
   illumination from Him, to understand the law spiritually and to
   recognize His commands more clearly, as the "chosen vessel" also
   declares very plainly this which we are insisting on. "For it is God
   which worketh in you both to will and to do according to good will."
   [176] What could well be clearer than the assertion that both our good
   will and the completion of our work are fully wrought in us by the
   Lord? And again "For it is granted to you for Christ's sake, not only
   to believe in Him but also to suffer for Him." [177] Here also he
   declares that the beginning of our conversion and faith, and the
   endurance of suffering is a gift to us from the Lord. And David too, as
   he knows this, similarly prays that the same thing may be granted to
   him by God's mercy. "Strengthen, O God, that which Thou hast wrought in
   us:" [178] showing that it is not enough for the beginning of our
   salvation to be granted by the gift and grace of God, unless it has
   been continued and ended by the same pity and continual help from Him.
   For not free will but the Lord "looseth them that are bound." No
   strength of ours, but the Lord "raiseth them that are fallen:" no
   diligence in reading, but "the Lord enlightens the blind:" where the
   Greeks have kurios sofoi tuflous, i.e., "the Lord maketh wise the
   blind:" no care on our part, but "the Lord careth for the stranger:" no
   courage of ours, but "the Lord assists (or supports) all those who are
   down." [179] But this we say, not to slight our zeal and efforts and
   diligence, as if they were applied unnecessarily and foolishly, but
   that we may know that we cannot strive without the help of God, nor can
   our efforts be of any use in securing the great reward of purity,
   unless it has been granted to us by the assistance and mercy of the
   Lord: for "a horse is prepared for the day of battle: but help cometh
   from the Lord," [180] "for no man can prevail by strength." [181] We
   ought then always to sing with the blessed David: "My strength and my
   praise is" not my free will, but "the Lord, and He is become my
   salvation." [182] And the teacher of the Gentiles was not ignorant of
   this when he declared that he was made capable of the ministry of the
   New Testament not by his own merits or efforts but by the mercy of God.
   "Not" says he, "that we are capable of thinking anything of ourselves
   as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God," which can be put in
   less good Latin but more forcibly, "our capability is of God," and then
   there follows: "Who also made us capable ministers of the New
   Testament." [183]

  CHAPTER XVI.

    That faith itself must be given us by the Lord.

   BUT so thoroughly did the Apostles realize that everything which
   concerns salvation was given them by the Lord, that they even asked
   that faith itself should be granted from the Lord, saying: "Add to us
   faith" [184] as they did not imagine that it could be gained by free
   will, but believed that it would be bestowed by the free gift of God.
   Lastly the Author of man's salvation teaches us how feeble and weak and
   insufficient our faith would be unless it were strengthened by the aid
   of the Lord, when He says to Peter "Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath
   desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed to
   my Father that thy faith fail not." [185] And another finding that this
   was happening in his own case, and seeing that his faith was being
   driven by the waves of unbelief on the rocks which would cause a
   fearful shipwreck, asks of the same Lord an aid to his faith, saying
   "Lord, help mine unbelief." [186] So thoroughly then did those Apostles
   and men in the gospel realize that everything which is good is brought
   to perfection by the aid of the Lord, and not imagine that they could
   preserve their faith unharmed by their own strength or free will that
   they prayed that it might be helped or granted to them by the Lord. And
   if in Peter's case there was need of the Lord's help that it might not
   fail, who will be so presumptuous and blind as to fancy that he has no
   need of daily assistance from the Lord in order to preserve it?
   Especially as the Lord Himself has made this clear in the gospel,
   saying: "As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in
   the vine, so no more can ye, except ye abide in me." [187] And again:
   "for without me ye can do nothing." [188] How foolish and wicked then
   it is to attribute any good action to our own diligence and not to
   God's grace and assistance, is clearly shown by the Lord's saying,
   which lays down that no one can show forth the fruits of the Spirit
   without His inspiration and co-operation. For "every good gift and
   every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of
   lights." [189] And Zechariah too says, "For whatever is good is His,
   and what is excellent is from Him." [190] And so the blessed Apostle
   consistently says: "What hast thou which thou didst not receive? But if
   thou didst receive it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received
   it?" [191]

  CHAPTER XVII.

    That temperateness and the endurance of temptations must be given to us by
    the Lord.

   AND that all the endurance, with which we can bear the temptations
   brought upon us, depends not so much on our own strength as on the
   mercy and guidance of God, the blessed Apostle thus declares: "No
   temptation hath come upon you but such as is common to man. But God is
   faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,
   but will with the temptation make also a way of escape, that ye may be
   able to bear it." [192] And that God fits and strengthens our souls for
   every good work, and worketh in us all those things which are pleasing
   to Him, the same Apostle teaches: "May the God of peace who brought out
   of darkness the great Shepherd of the sheep, Jesus Christ, in the blood
   of the everlasting Testament, fit you in all goodness, working in you
   what is well-pleasing in His sight." [193] And that the same thing may
   happen to the Thessalonians he prays as follows, saying: "Now our Lord
   Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father who hath loved us and hath
   given us everlasting consolation and good hope in grace, exhort your
   hearts, and confirm you in every good word and work." [194]

    That the continual fear of God must be bestowed on us by the Lord.

   AND lastly the prophet Jeremiah, speaking in the person of God, clearly

   is shed upon us by the Lord: saying as follows: "And I will give them
   one heart, and one way, that they may fear Me all days: and that it may
   be well with them and with their children after them. And I will make
   an everlasting covenant with them and will not cease to do them good:
   and I will give My fear in their hearts that they may not revolt from
   Me." [195] Ezekiel also says: "And I will give them one heart, and will
   put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart
   out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh: that they may
   walk in My commandments, and keep My judgments and do them: and that
   they may be My people, and I may be their God." [196]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

    That the beginning of our good will and its completion comes from God.

   AND this plainly teaches us that the beginning of our good will is
   given to us by the inspiration of the Lord, when He draws us towards
   the way of salvation either by His own act, or by the exhortations of
   some man, or by compulsion; and that the consummation of our good deeds
   is granted by Him in the same way: but that it is in our own power to
   follow up the encouragement and assistance of God with more or less
   zeal, and that accordingly we are rightly visited either with reward or
   with punishment, because we have been either careless or careful to
   correspond to His design and providential arrangement made for us with
   such kindly regard. And this is clearly and plainly described in
   Deuteronomy. "When," says he, "the Lord thy God shall have brought thee
   into the land which thou art going to possess, and shall have destroyed
   many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Gergeshite, and the
   Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
   Jebusite, seven nations much more numerous than thou art and stronger
   than thou, and the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou
   shalt utterly destroy them. Thou shalt make no league with them.
   Neither shalt thou make marriage with them." [197] So then Scripture
   declares that it is the free gift of God that they are brought into the
   land of promise, that many nations are destroyed before them, that
   nations more numerous and mightier than the people of Israel are given
   up into their hands. But whether Israel utterly destroys them, or
   whether it preserves them alive and spares them, and whether or no it
   makes a league with them, and makes marriages with them or not, it
   declares lies in their own power. And by this testimony we can clearly
   see what we ought to ascribe to free will, and what to the design and
   daily assistance of the Lord, and that it belongs to divine grace to
   give us opportunities of salvation and prosperous undertakings and
   victory: but that it is ours to follow up the blessings which God gives
   us with earnestness or indifference. And this same fact we see is
   plainly taught in the healing of the blind men. For the fact that Jesus
   passed by them, was a free gift of Divine providence and condescension.
   But the fact that they cried out and said "Have mercy on us, Lord, thou
   son of David," [198] was an act of their own faith and belief. That
   they received the sight of their eyes was a gift of Divine pity. But
   that after the reception of any blessing, the grace of God, and the use
   of free will both remain, the case of the ten lepers, who were all
   healed alike, shows us. For when one of them through goodness of will
   returned thanks, the Lord looking for the nine, and praising the one,
   showed that He was ever anxious to help even those who were unmindful
   of His kindness. For even this is a gift of His visitation; viz., that
   he receives and commends the grateful one, and looks for and censures
   those who are thankless.

  CHAPTER XX.

    That nothing can be done in this world without God.

   BUT it is right for us to hold with unswerving faith that nothing
   whatever is done in this world without God. For we must acknowledge
   that everything is done either by His will or by His permission, i.e.,
   we must believe that whatever is good is carried out by the will of God
   and by His aid, and whatever is the reverse is done by His permission,
   when the Divine Protection is withdrawn from us for our sins and the
   hardness of our hearts, and suffers the devil and the shameful passions
   of the body to lord it over us. And the words of the Apostle most
   assuredly teach us this, when he says: "For this cause God delivered
   them up to shameful passions:" and again: "Because they did not like to
   have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate
   sense, to do those things which are not convenient." [199] And the Lord
   Himself says by the prophet: "But My people did not hear My voice and
   Israel did not obey me: Wherefore I gave them up unto their own hearts'
   lusts. They shall walk after their own inventions." [200]

    An objection on the power of free will.

   GERMANUS: This passage very clearly shows the freedom of the will,
   where it is said "If My people would have hearkened unto Me," and
   elsewhere "But My people would not hear My voice." [201] For when He
   says "If they would have heard" He shows that the decision to yield or
   not to yield lay in their own power. How then is it true that our
   salvation does not depend upon ourselves, if God Himself has given us
   the power either to hearken or not to hearken?

     __________________________________________________________________

   [201] Ps. 80 (81):12, 13.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

    The answer; viz., that our free will always has need of the help of the
    Lord.

   PAPHNUTIUS: You have shrewdly enough noticed how it is said "If they
   would have hearkened to Me:" but have not sufficiently considered
   either who it is who speaks to one who does or does not hearken; or
   what follows: "I should soon have put down their enemies, and laid My
   hand on those that trouble them." [202] Let no one then try by a false
   interpretation to twist that which we brought forward to prove that
   nothing can be done without the Lord, nor take it in support of free
   will, in such a way as to try to take away from man the grace of God
   and His daily oversight, through this test: "But My people did not hear
   My voice," and again: "If My people would have hearkened unto Me, and
   if Israel would have walked in My ways, etc.:" but let him consider
   that just as the power of free will is evidenced by the disobedience of
   the people, so the daily oversight of God who declares and admonishes
   him is also shown. For where He says "If My people would have hearkened
   unto Me" He clearly implies that He had spoken to them before. And this
   the Lord was wont to do not only by means of the written law, but also
   by daily exhortations, as this which is given by Isaiah: "All day long
   have I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gain-saying
   people." [203] Both points then can be supported from this passage,
   where it says: "If My people would have hearkened, and if Israel had
   walked in My ways, I should soon have put down their enemies, and laid
   My hand on those that trouble them." For just as free will is shown by
   the disobedience of the people, so the government of God and His
   assistance is made clear by the beginning and end of the verse, where
   He implies that He had spoken to them before, and that afterwards He
   would put down their enemies, if they would have hearkened unto Him.
   For we have no wish to do away with man's free will by what we have
   said, but only to establish the fact that the assistance and grace of
   God are necessary to it every day and hour. When he had instructed us
   with this discourse Abbot Paphnutius dismissed us from his cell before
   midnight in a state of contrition rather than of liveliness; insisting
   on this as the chief lesson in his discourse; viz., that when we
   fancied that by making perfect the first renunciation (which we were
   endeavouring to do with all our powers), we could climb the heights of
   perfection, we should make the discovery that we had not yet even begun
   to dream of the heights to which a monk can rise, since after we had
   learnt some few things about the second renunciation, we should find
   out that we had not before this even heard a word of the third stage,
   in which all perfection is comprised, and which in many ways far
   exceeds these lower ones.

CONFERENCE OF ABBOT DANIEL.

ON THE LUST OF THE FLESH AND OF THE SPIRIT.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Of the life of Abbot Daniel.

   AMONG the other heroes of Christian philosophy we also knew Abbot
   Daniel, who was not only the equal of those who dwelt in the desert of
   Scete in every sort of virtue, but was specially marked by the grace of
   humility. This man on account of his purity and gentleness, though in
   age the junior of most, was preferred to the office of the diaconate by
   the blessed Paphnutius, presbyter in the same desert: for the blessed
   Paphnutius was so delighted with his excellent qualities, that, as he
   knew that he was his equal in virtue and grace of life, he was anxious
   also to make him his equal in the order of the priesthood. And since he
   could not bear that he should remain any longer in an inferior office,
   and was also anxious to provide a worthy successor to himself in his
   lifetime, he promoted him to the dignity of the priesthood. [204] He
   however relinquished nothing of his former customary humility, and when
   the other was present, never took upon himself anything from his
   advance to a higher order, but when Abbot Paphnutius was offering
   spiritual sacrifices, ever continued to act as a deacon in the office
   of his former ministry. However, the blessed Paphnutius though so great
   a saint as to possess the grace of foreknowledge in many matters, yet
   in this case was disappointed of his hope of the succession and the
   choice he had made, for he himself passed to God no long time after him
   whom he had prepared as his successor.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [204] Nothing further appears to be known of Daniel than what is here
   told us by Cassian. There has been some discussion as to the action of
   Paphnutius in having him raised to the priesthood, as Cassian here
   narrates. Was Paphnutius really a bishop, or is it a case of
   presbyterian orders, or do Cassian's expressions merely mean that
   Paphnutius procured his ordination first to the Diaconate and then to
   the Priesthood? Probably the latter, for (1) all the evidence goes to
   show that presbyters had not the power of ordination; and (2) there are
   many instances, in which it is said even of the laity that they
   "ordained" men to the ministry when all that can possibly be meant is
   that they "procured their ordination;" further (3) it will be noticed
   that it is not even said that Paphnutius ordained Daniel, but merely
   that he "promoted" him to the priesthood; an expression which might
   equally well be used of nomination as of actual ordination. See the
   subject discussed in Bingham's Antiquities, Book II. c. iii. § 7, and
   C. Gore's "Church and the Ministry," p. 374.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    An investigation of the origin of a sudden change of feeling from
    inexpressible joy to extreme dejection of mind.

   SO then we asked this blessed Daniel why it was that as we sat in the
   cells we were sometimes filled with the utmost gladness of heart,
   together with inexpressible delight and abundance of the holiest
   feelings, so that I will not say speech, but feeling could not follow
   it, and pure prayers were readily breathed, and the mind being filled
   with spiritual fruits, praying to God even in sleep could feel that its
   petitions rose lightly and powerfully to God: and again, why it was
   that for no reason we were suddenly filled with the utmost grief, and
   weighed down with unreasonable depression, so that we not only felt as
   if we ourselves were, overcome with such feelings, but also our cell
   grew dreadful, reading palled upon us, aye and our very prayers were
   offered up unsteadily and vaguely, and almost as if we were
   intoxicated: so that while we were groaning and endeavouring to restore
   ourselves to our former disposition, our mind was unable to do this,
   and the more earnestly it sought to fix again its gaze upon God, so was
   it the more vehemently carried away to wandering thoughts by shifting
   aberrations and so utterly deprived of all spiritual fruits, as not to
   be capable of being roused from this deadly slumber even by the desire
   of the kingdom of heaven, or by the fear of hell held out to it. To
   this he replied.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    His answer to the question raised.

   A THREEFOLD account of this mental dryness of which you speak has been
   given by the Elders. For it comes either from carelessness on our part,
   or from the assaults of the devil, or from the permission and allowance
   of the Lord. From carelessness on our part, when through our own
   faults, coldness has come upon us, and we have behaved carelessly and
   hastily, and owing to slothful idleness have fed on bad thoughts, and
   so make the ground of our heart bring forth thorns and thistles; which
   spring up in it, and consequently make us sterile, and powerless as
   regards all spiritual fruit and meditation. From the assaults of the
   devil when, sometimes, while we are actually intent on good desires,
   our enemy with crafty subtilty makes his way into our heart, and
   without our knowledge and against our will we are drawn away from the
   best intentions.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    How there is a twofold reason for the permission and allowance of God.

   BUT for God's permission and allowance there is a twofold reason.
   First, that being for a short time forsaken by the Lord, and observing
   with all humility the weakness of our own heart, we may not be puffed
   up on account of the previous purity of heart granted to us by His
   visitation; and that by proving that when we are forsaken by Him we
   cannot possibly recover our former state of purity and delight by any
   groanings and efforts of our own, we may also learn that our previous
   gladness of heart resulted not from our own earnestness but from His
   gift, and that for the present time it must be sought once more from
   His grace and enlightenment. But a second reason for this allowance, is
   to prove our perseverance, and steadfastness of mind, and real desires,
   and to show in us, with what purpose of heart, or earnestness in prayer
   we seek for the return of the Holy Spirit, when He leaves us, and also
   in order that when we discover with what efforts we must seek for that
   spiritual gladness--when once it is lost--and the joy of purity, we may
   learn to preserve it more carefully, when once it is secured, and to
   hold it with firmer grasp. For men are generally more careless about
   keeping whatever they think can be easily replaced.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    How our efforts and exertions are of no use without God's help.

   AND by this it is clearly shown that God's grace and mercy always work
   in us what is good, and that when it forsakes us, the efforts of the
   worker are useless, and that however earnestly a man may strive, he
   cannot regain his former condition without His help, and that this
   saying is constantly fulfilled in our case: that it is "not of him that
   willeth or runneth but of God which hath mercy." [205] And this grace
   on the other hand sometimes does not refuse to visit with that holy
   inspiration of which you spoke, and with an abundance of spiritual
   thoughts, even the careless and indifferent; but inspires the unworthy,
   arouses the slumberers, and enlightens those who are blinded by
   ignorance, and mercifully reproves us and chastens us, shedding itself
   abroad in our hearts, that thus we may be stirred by the compunction
   which He excites, and impelled to rise from the sleep of sloth. Lastly
   we are often filled by His sudden visitation with sweet odours, beyond
   the power of human composition--so that the soul is ravished with these
   delights, and caught up, as it were, into an ecstasy of spirit, and
   becomes oblivious of the fact that it is still in the flesh.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [205] Rom. 9:16.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    How it is sometimes to our advantage to be left by God.

   BUT the blessed David recognizes that sometimes this departure of which
   we have spoken, and (as it were) desertion by God may be to some extent
   to our advantage, so that he was unwilling to pray, not that he might
   not be absolutely forsaken by God in anything (for he was aware that
   this would have been disadvantageous both to himself and to human
   nature in its course towards perfection) but he rather entreated that
   it might be in measure and degree, saying "Forsake me not utterly"
   [206] as if to say in other words: I know that thou dost forsake thy
   saints to their advantage, in order to prove them, for in no other way
   could they be tempted by the devil, unless they were for a little
   forsaken by Thee. And therefore I ask not that Thou shouldest never
   forsake me, for it would not be well for me not to feel my weakness and
   say "It is good for me that Thou hast brought me low" [207] nor to have
   no opportunity of fighting. And this I certainly should not have, if
   the Divine protection shielded me incessantly and unbrokenly. For the
   devil will not dare to attack me while supported by Thy defence, as he
   brings both against me and Thee this objection and complaint, which he
   ever slanderously brings against Thy champions, "Does Job serve God for
   nought? Hast not Thou made a fence for him and his house and all his
   substance round about?" [208] But I rather entreat that Thou forsake me
   not utterly--what the Greeks call `ews sfodra, i.e., too much. For,
   first, as it is advantageous to me for Thee to forsake me a little,
   that the steadfastness of my love may be tried, so it is dangerous if
   Thou suffer me to be forsaken excessively in proportion to my faults
   and what I deserve, since no power of man, if in temptation it is
   forsaken for too long a time by Thine aid, can endure by its own
   steadfastness, and not forthwith give in to the power of the enemy's
   side, unless Thou Thyself, as Thou knowest the strength of man, and
   moderatest his struggles, "Suffer us not to be tempted above that we
   are able, but makest with the temptation a way of escape that we may be
   able to bear it." [209] And something of this sort we read in the book
   of Judges was mystically designed in the matter of the extermination of
   the spiritual nations which were opposed to Israel: "These are the
   nations, which the Lord left that by them He might instruct Israel,
   that they might learn to fight with their enemies," and again shortly
   after: "And the Lord left them that He might try Israel by them,
   whether they would hear the commandments of the Lord, which He had
   commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses, or not." [210] And this
   conflict God reserved for Israel, not from envy of their peace, or from
   a wish to hurt them, but because He knew that it would be good for them
   that while they were always oppressed by the attacks of those nations
   they might not cease to feel themselves in need of the aid of the Lord,
   and for this reason might ever continue to meditate on Him and invoke
   His aid, and not grow careless through lazy ease, and lose the habit of
   resisting, and the practice of virtue. For again and again, men whom
   adversity could not overcome, have been cast down by freedom from care
   and by prosperity.

  CHAPTER VII.

    Of the value of the conflict which the Apostle makes to consist in the
    strife between the flesh and the spirit.

   THIS conflict too we read in the Apostle has for our good been placed
   in our members: "For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the
   spirit against the flesh. But these two are opposed to each other so
   that ye should not do what ye would." [211] You have here too a contest
   as it were implanted in our bodies, by the action and arrangement of
   the Lord. For when a thing exists in everybody universally and without
   the slightest exception, what else can you think about it except that
   it belongs to the substance of human nature, since the fall of the
   first man, as it were naturally: and when a thing is found to be
   congenital with everybody, and to grow with their growth, how can we
   help believing that it was implanted by the will of the Lord, not to
   injure them but to help them? But the reason of this conflict; viz., of
   flesh and spirit, he tells us is this: "that ye should not do what ye
   would." And so, if we fulfil what God arranged that we should not
   fulfil, i.e., that we should not do what we liked, how can we help
   believing that it is bad for us? And this conflict implanted in us by
   the arrangement of the Creator is in a way useful to us, and calls and
   urges us on to a higher state: and if it ceased, most surely there
   would ensue on the other hand a peace that is fraught with danger.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    A question, how it is that in the Apostle's chapter, after he has spoken of
    the lusts of the flesh and spirit opposing one another, he adds a third
    thing; viz., man's will.

   GERMANUS: Although some glimmer of the sense now seems clear to us, yet
   as we cannot thoroughly grasp the Apostle's meaning, we want you to
   explain this more clearly to us. For the existence of three things
   seems to be indicated here: first, the struggle of the flesh against
   the spirit, secondly the desire of the spirit against the flesh, and
   thirdly our own free will, which seems to be placed between the two,
   and of which it is said: "Ye should not do what ye will." And on this
   subject though as I said we can gather some hints, from what you have
   explained of the meaning, yet--since this conference gives the
   opportunity--we are anxious to have it more fully explained to us.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    The answer on the understanding of one who asks rightly.

   DANIEL: It belongs to the understanding to discern the distinctions and
   the drift of questions; and it is a main part of knowledge to
   understand how ignorant you are. Wherefore it is said that "if a fool
   asks questions, it will be accounted wisdom," [212] because, although
   one who asks questions is ignorant of the answer to the question
   raised, yet as he wisely asks, and learns what he does not know, this
   very fact will be counted as wisdom in him, because he wisely discovers
   what he was ignorant of. According then to this division of yours, it
   seems that in this passage the Apostle mentions three things, the lust
   of the flesh against the spirit, and of the spirit against the flesh,
   the mutual struggle of which against each other appears to have this as
   its cause and reason; viz., "that," says he, "we should not do what we
   would." There remains then a fourth case, which you have overlooked;
   viz., that we should do what we would not. Now then, we must first
   discover the meaning of those two desires, i.e., of the flesh and
   spirit, and so next learn to discuss our free will, which is placed
   between the two, and then lastly in the same way we can see what cannot
   belong to our free will.

  CHAPTER X.

    That the word flesh is not used with one single meaning only.

   WE find that the word flesh is used in holy Scripture with many
   different meanings: for sometimes it stands for the whole man, i.e.,
   for that which consists of body and soul, as here "And the Word was
   made flesh," [213] and "All flesh shall see the salvation of our God."
   [214] Sometimes it stands for sinful and carnal men, as here "My spirit
   shall not remain in those men, because they are flesh." [215] Sometimes
   it is used for sins themselves, as here: "But ye are not in the flesh
   but in the spirit," [216] and again "Flesh and blood shall not inherit
   the kingdom of God:" lastly there follows, "Neither shall corruption
   inherit incorruption." [217] Sometimes it stands for consanguinity and
   relationship, as here: "Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh," [218]
   and the Apostle says: "If by any means I may provoke to emulation them
   who are my flesh, and save some of them." [219] We must therefore
   inquire in which of these four meanings we ought to take the word flesh
   in this place, for it is clear that it cannot possibly stand as in the
   passage where it is said "The Word was made flesh," and "All flesh
   shall see the salvation of God." Neither can it have the same meaning
   as where it is said "My Spirit shall not remain in those men because
   they are flesh," because the word flesh is not used here as it is there
   where it stands simply for a sinful man--when he says" The flesh
   lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh." [220] Nor
   is he speaking of things material, but of realities which in one and
   the same man struggle either at the same time or separately, with the
   shifting and changing of time.

  CHAPTER XI.

    What the Apostle means by flesh in this passage, and what the lust of the
    flesh is.

   WHEREFORE in this passage we ought to take "flesh" as meaning not man,
   i.e., his material substance, but the carnal will and evil desires,
   just as "spirit" does not mean anything material, but the good and
   spiritual desires of the soul: a meaning which the blessed Apostle has
   clearly given just before, where he begins: "But I say, walk in the
   spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the desires of the flesh; for the flesh
   lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh: but these
   are contrary the one to the other, that ye may not do what ye would."
   And since these two; viz., the desires of the flesh and of the spirit
   co-exist in one and the same man, there arises an internal warfare
   daily carried on within us, while the lust of the flesh which rushes
   blindly towards sin, revels in those delights which are connected with
   present ease. And on the other hand the desire of the spirit is opposed
   to these, and wishes to be entirely absorbed in spiritual efforts, so
   that it actually wants to be rid of even the necessary uses of the
   flesh, longing to be so constantly taken up with these things as to
   desire to have no share of anxiety about the weakness of the flesh. The
   flesh delights in wantonness and lust: the spirit does not even
   tolerate natural desires. The one wants to have plenty of sleep, and to
   be satiated with food: the other is nourished with vigils and fasting,
   so as to be unwilling even to admit of sleep and food for the needful
   purposes of life. The one longs to be enriched with plenty of
   everything, the other is satisfied even without the possession of a
   daily supply of scanty food. The one seeks to look sleek by means of
   baths, and to be surrounded every day by crowds of flatterers, the
   other delights in dirt and filth, and the solitude of the inaccessible
   desert, and dreads the approach of all mortal men. The one lives on the
   esteem and applause of men, the other glories in injuries offered to
   it, and in persecutions.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    What is our free will, which stands in between the lust of the flesh and the
    spirit.

   BETWEEN these two desires then the free will of the soul stands in an
   intermediate position somewhat worthy of blame, and neither delights in
   the excesses of sin, nor acquiesces in the sorrows of virtue. Seeking
   to restrain itself from carnal passions in such a way as not
   nevertheless to be willing to undergo the requisite suffering, and
   wanting to secure bodily chastity without chastising the flesh, and to
   acquire purity of heart without the exertion of vigils, and to abound
   in spiritual virtues together with carnal ease, and to attain the grace
   of patience without the irritation of contradiction, and to practise
   the humility of Christ without the loss of worldly honour, to aim at
   the simplicity of religion in conjunction with worldly ambition, to
   serve Christ not without the praise and favour of men, to profess the
   strictness which truth demands without giving the slightest offence to
   anybody: in a word, it is anxious to pursue future blessings in such a
   way as not to lose present ones. And this free will would never lead us
   to attain true perfection, but would plunge us into a most miserable
   condition of lukewarmness, and make us like those who are rebuked by
   the Lord's remonstrance in the Apocalypse: "I know thy works, that thou
   art neither hot nor cold. I would that thou wert hot or cold. But now
   thou art lukewarm, and I will forthwith spue thee out of my mouth;"
   [221] were it not that these contentions which rise up on both sides
   disturb and destroy this condition of lukewarmness. For when we give in
   to this free will of ours and want to let ourselves go in the direction
   of this slackness, at once the desires of the flesh start up, and
   injure us with their sinful passions, and do not suffer us to continue
   in that state of purity in which we delight, and allure us to that cold
   and thorny path of pleasure which we have to dread. Again, if inflamed
   with fervour of spirit, we want to root out the works of the flesh, and
   without any regard to human weakness try to raise ourselves altogether
   to excessive efforts after virtue, the frailty of the flesh comes in,
   and recalls us and restrains us from that over excess of spirit which
   is bad for us: and so the result is that as these two desires are
   contradicting each other in a struggle of this kind, the soul's free
   will, which does not like either to give itself up entirely to carnal
   desires, nor to throw itself into the exertions which virtue calls for,
   is tempered as it were by a fair balance, while this struggle between
   the two hinders that more dangerous free will of the soul, and makes a
   sort of equitable balance in the scales of our body, which marks out
   the limits of flesh and spirit most accurately, and does not allow the
   mind inflamed with fervour of spirit to sway to the right hand, nor the
   flesh to incline through the pricks of sin, to the left. And while this
   struggle goes on day after day in us to our profit, we are driven most
   beneficially to come to that fourth stage which we do not like, so as
   to gain purity of heart not by ease and carelessness, but by constant
   efforts and contrition of spirit; to retain our chastity, of the flesh
   by prolonged fastings, hunger, thirst, and watchfulness; to acquire
   purpose of heart by reading, vigils, constant prayer and the
   wretchedness of solitude; to preserve patience by the endurance of
   tribulation; to serve our Maker in the midst of blasphemies and
   abounding insults; to follow after truth if need be amid the hatred of
   the world and its enmity; and while, with such a struggle going on in
   our body, we are secured from slothful carelessness, and incited to
   that effort which is against the gain, and to the desire for virtue,
   our proper balance is admirably secured, and on one side the languid
   choice of our free will is tempered by fervour of spirit, and on the
   other the frigid coldness of the flesh is moderated by a gentle warmth,
   and while the desire of the spirit does not allow the mind to be
   dragged into unbridled licence, neither does the weakness of the flesh
   allow the spirit to be drawn on to unreasonable aspirations after
   holiness, lest in the one case incentives to all kinds of sins might
   arise, or in the other the earliest of all sins might lift its head and
   wound us with a yet more fatal dart of pride: but a due equilibrium
   will result from this struggle, and open to us a safe and secure path
   of virtue between the two, and teach the soldier of Christ ever to walk
   on the King's highway. And thus the result will be that when, in
   consequence of the lukewarmness arising from this sluggish will of
   which we have spoken, the mind has been more easily entangled in carnal
   desires, it is checked by the desire of the spirit, which by no means
   acquiesces in earthly sins; and again, if through over much feeling our
   spirit has been carried in unbounded fervour and towards ill-considered
   and impossible heights, it is recalled by the weakness of the flesh to
   sounder considerations and rising above the lukewarm condition of our
   free will with due proportion and even course proceeds along the way of
   perfection. Something of this sort we hear that the Lord ordained in
   the case of the building of that tower in the book of Genesis, where a
   confusion of tongues suddenly sprang up, and put a stop to the
   blasphemous and wicked attempts of men. For there would have remained
   there in opposition to God, aye and against the interest of those who
   had begun to assail His Divine Majesty, an agreement boding no good,
   unless by God's providence the difference of languages, raising
   disturbances among them, had forced them because of the variations of
   their words to go on to a better condition, and a happy and valuable
   discord had recalled to salvation those whom a ruinous union had driven
   to destruction, as when divisions arose they began to experience human
   weakness of which when puffed up by their wicked plots they had
   hitherto known nothing.

  CHAPTER XIII.

    Of the advantage of the delay which results from the struggle between flesh
    and spirit.

   BUT from the differences which this conflict causes, there arises a
   delay that is so far advantageous to us, and from this struggle an
   adjournment that is for our good, so that while through the resistance
   of the material body we are hindered from carrying out those things
   which we have wickedly conceived with our minds, we are sometimes
   recalled to a better mind either by penitence springing up, or by some
   better thoughts which usually come to us when delay in carrying out
   things, and time for reflection intervene. Lastly, those who, as we
   know, are not prevented from carrying out the desires of their free
   will by any hindrances of the flesh, I mean devils and spiritual
   wickednesses, these, since they have fallen from a higher and angelical
   state, we see are in a worse plight than men, in as much as (owing to
   the fact that opportunity is always present to gratify their desires)
   they are not delayed from irrevocably performing whatever evil they
   have imagined because as their mind is quick to conceive it, so their
   substance is ready and free to carry it out; and while a short and easy
   method is given them of doing what they wish, no salutary second
   thoughts come in to amend their wicked intention.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

    Of the incurable depravity of spiritual wickednesses.

   FOR a spiritual substance and one that is not tied to any material
   flesh has no excuse for an evil thought which arises within, and also
   shuts out forgiveness for its sin, because it is not harassed as we are
   by incentives of the flesh without, to sin, but is simply inflamed by
   the fault of a perverse will. And therefore its sin is without
   forgiveness and its weakness without remedy. For as it falls through
   the allurements of no earthly matter, so it can find no pardon or place
   for repentance. And from this we can clearly gather that this struggle
   which arises in us of the flesh and spirit against each other is not
   merely harmless, but actually extremely useful to us.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

    Of the value of the lust of the flesh against the spirit in our case.

   TO begin with, because it is an immediate reproof of our sloth and
   carelessness, and like some energetic schoolmaster who never allows us
   to deviate from the line of strict discipline, and if our carelessness
   has ever so little exceeded the limits of due gravity which become it,
   it immediately excites us by the stimulus of desire, and chides us and
   recalls us to due moderation. Secondly, because, in the matter of
   chastity and perfect purity, when by God's grace we see that we have
   been for some time kept from carnal pollution, in order that we may not
   imagine that we can no longer be disturbed by the motions of the flesh
   and thereby be elated and puffed up in our secret hearts as if we no
   longer bore about the corruption of the flesh, it humbles and checks
   us, and reminds us by its pricks that we are but men. [222] For as we
   ordinarily fall without much thought into other kinds of sins and those
   worse and more harmful, and are not so easily ashamed of committing
   them, so in this particular one the conscience is especially humbled,
   and by means of this illusion it is stung by the recollection of
   passions that have been neglected, as it sees clearly that it is
   rendered unclean by natural emotions, of which it knew nothing while it
   was still more unclean through spiritual sins; and so coming back at
   once to the cure of its former sluggishness, it is warned both that it
   ought not to trust in the attainments of purity in the past, which it
   sees to be lost by ever so small a falling away from the Lord, and also
   that it cannot attain the gift of this purity except by God's grace
   alone, since actual experience somehow or other teaches us that if we
   are anxious to reach abiding perfection of heart we must constantly
   endeavour to obtain the virtue of humility.

  CHAPTER XVI.

    Of the excitements of the flesh, without the humiliation of which we should
    fall more grievously.

   TO the fact then that the pride which results from this purity would be
   more dangerous than all sins and wickednesses, and that we should on
   that account gain no reward for any height of perfect chastity, we may
   call as witnesses those powers of which we spoke before, which since it
   is believed that they experience no such fleshly lusts, were cast down
   from their high and heavenly estate in everlasting destruction simply
   from pride of heart. And so we should be altogether hopelessly
   lukewarm, since we should have no warning of carelessness on our part
   implanted either in our body or in our mind, nor should we ever strive
   to reach the glow of perfection, or even keep to strict frugality and
   abstinence, were it not that this excitement of the flesh springs up
   and humbles us and baffles us and makes us keen and anxious about
   purifying ourselves from spiritual sins.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

    Of the lukewarmness of eunuchs.

   LASTLY, on this account in those who are Eunuchs, we often detect the
   existence of this lukewarmness of mind, because, as they are so to
   speak free from the needs of the flesh, they fancy that they have no
   need either of the trouble of bodily abstinence, or of contrition of
   heart; and being rendered slack by this freedom from anxiety, they make
   no efforts either truly to seek or to acquire perfection of heart or
   even purity from spiritual faults. And this condition which is the
   result of their state in the flesh, becomes natural, which is
   altogether a worse state. For he who passes from the state of coldness
   to that of lukewarmness is branded by the Lord's words as still more
   hateful.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    The question what is the difference between the carnal and natural man.

   GERMANUS: You have, it seems to us, very clearly shown the value of the
   struggle which is raised between the flesh and spirit, so that we can
   believe that it can in a sort of way be grasped by us; and therefore we
   want to have this also explained to us in the same way; viz., what is
   the difference between the carnal and the natural man, or how the
   natural man can be worse than the carnal.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

    The answer concerning the threefold condition of souls.

   DANIEL: There are, according to the statements of Scripture, three
   kinds of souls; the first is the carnal, the second the natural, and
   the third the spiritual: which we find are thus described by the
   Apostle. For of the carnal he says: "I gave you milk to drink, not
   meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now
   able; for you are yet carnal." And again: "For whereas there is among
   you envying and contention, are you not carnal?" [223] Concerning the
   natural he also speaks as follows: "But the natural man perceiveth not
   the things that are of the spirit of God; for it is foolishness to
   him." But concerning the spiritual: "But the spiritual man judgeth all
   things: and he himself is judged by no man." [224] And again "You who
   are spiritual instruct such ones in the spirit of meekness." [225] And
   so, though at our renunciation we ceased to be carnal, i.e., we began
   to separate ourselves from intercourse with those in the world, and to
   have nothing to do with open pollution of the flesh, we must still be
   careful to strive with all our might to attain forthwith a spiritual
   condition, lest haply we flatter ourselves because we seem as far as
   the outer man is concerned to have renounced this world and got rid of
   the defilement of carnal fornication, as if by this we had reached the
   heights of perfection; and thence become careless and indifferent about
   purifying ourselves from other affections, and so being kept back
   between these two, become unable to reach the stage of spiritual
   advancement; either because we think that it is amply sufficient for
   our perfection if we seem to separate ourselves, as regards the outward
   man, from intercourse with this world and from its pleasure, or because
   we are free from corruption and carnal intercourse, and thus we find
   ourselves in that lukewarm condition which is considered the worst of
   all, and discover that we are spued out of the mouth of the Lord, in
   accordance with these words of His: "I would that thou wert hot or
   cold. But now thou art lukewarm and I will begin to spue thee out of My
   mouth." [226] And not without good reason does the Lord declare that
   those whom he has previously received in the bowels of His love, and
   who have become shamefully lukewarm, shall be spued out and rejected
   from His bosom: in as much as, though they might have yielded Him some
   health-giving subsistence, they preferred to be torn away from His
   heart: thus becoming far worse than those who had never found their way
   into the Lord's mouth as food, just as we turn away with loathing from
   that which nausea compels us to bring up. For whatever is cold is
   warmed when received into the mouth and is received with satisfaction
   and good results. But whatever has been once rejected owing to its
   miserable lukewarmness, we cannot--I will not say touch with the
   lips--but even look on from a distance without the greatest disgust.
   Rightly then is he said to be worse, because the carnal man, i.e., the
   worldly man and the heathen, is more readily brought to saving
   conversion and to the heights of perfection than one who has been
   professed as a monk, but has not, as his rule directs, laid hold on the
   way of perfection, and so has once for all drawn back from that fire of
   spiritual fervour. For the former is at last broken down by the sins of
   the flesh, and acknowledges his uncleanness, and in his compunction
   hastens from carnal pollution to the fountain of true cleansing, and
   the heights of perfection, and in his horror at that cold state of
   infidelity in which he finds himself, he is kindled with the fire of
   the spirit and flies the more readily to perfection. For one who has,
   as we said, once started with a lukewarm beginning, and has begun to
   abuse the name of monk, and who has not laid hold on the way of this
   profession with the humility and fervour that he ought, when once he is
   infected by this miserable plague, and is as it were unstrung by it,
   can no longer of himself discern what is perfect nor learn from the
   admonitions of another. For he says in his heart that which the Lord
   tells us: "Because I am rich and wealthy and want nothing;" and so this
   which follows is at once applied to him: "But thou art wretched, and
   miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:" [227] and he is so far in a
   worse condition than a worldly man, because he has no idea that he is
   wretched or blind or naked or requires cleansing, or needs to be
   directed and taught by any one; and on this account he receives no
   sound advice as he does not realise that he is weighted with the name
   of monk, and is lowered in the judgment of all, whereas, though
   everybody believes him to be a saint and regards him as a servant of
   God, he must hereafter be subjected to a stricter judgment and
   punishment. Lastly, why should we any longer linger over those things
   which we have sufficiently discovered and proved by experience? We have
   often seen those who were cold and carnal, i.e., worldly men and
   heathen, attain spiritual warmth: but lukewarm and "natural" men never.
   And these too we read in the prophet are hated of the Lord, so that a
   charge is given to spiritual and learned men to desist from warning and
   teaching them, and not to sow the seed of the life-giving word in
   ground that is barren and unfruitful and choked by noxious thorns; but
   that they should scorn this, and rather cultivate fallow ground, i.e.,
   that they should transfer all their care and teaching, and their zeal
   in the life-giving word to pagans and worldly men: as we thus read:
   "Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem:
   break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns." [228]

  CHAPTER XX.

    Of those who renounce the world but ill.

   IN the last place I am ashamed to say how we find that a large number
   have made their renunciation in such a way that we find that they have
   altered nothing of their former sins and habits, but only their state
   of life and worldly garb. For they are eager in amassing wealth which
   they never had before, or else do not give up that which they had, or
   which is still sadder, they actually strive to augment it under this
   excuse; viz., that they assert that it is right that they should always
   support with it their relations or the brethren, or they hoard it under
   pretence of starting congregations which they imagine that they can
   preside over as Abbots. But if only they would sincerely seek after the
   way of perfection, they would rather endeavour with all their might and
   main to attain to this: viz., that they might strip themselves not only
   of their wealth but of all their former likings and occupations, and
   place themselves unreservedly and entirely under the guidance of the
   Elders so as to have no anxiety not merely about others, but even about
   themselves. But on the contrary we find that while they are eager to be
   set over their brethren, they are never subject to their Elders
   themselves, and, with pride for their starting point, while they are
   quite ready to teach others they take no trouble to learn themselves or
   to practise what they are to teach: and so it is sure to end in their
   becoming, as the Saviour said, "blind leaders of the blind" so that
   "both fall into the ditch." [229] And this pride though there is only
   one kind of it, yet takes a twofold form. One form continually puts on
   the appearance of seriousness and gravity, the other breaks out with
   unbridled freedom into silly giggling and laughing. The former delights
   in not talking: the latter thinks it hard to be kept to the restraint
   of silence, and has no scruples about talking freely on matters that
   are unsuitable and foolish, while it is ashamed to be thought inferior
   to or less well informed than others. The one on account of pride seeks
   clerical office, the other looks down upon it, since it fancies that it
   is unsuitable or beneath its former dignity and life and the deserts of
   its birth. And which of these two should be accounted the worse each
   man must consider and decide for himself. At any rate the kind of
   disobedience is one and the same, if a man breaks the Elder's commands
   whether it be owing to zeal in work, or to love of ease: and it is as
   hurtful to upset the rules of the monastery for the sake of sleep, as
   it is for the sake of vigilance, and it is just the same to transgress
   the Abbot's orders in order to read, as it is to slight them in order
   to sleep: nor is there any difference in the incentive to pride if you
   neglect a brother, whether it is because of your fast or because of
   your breakfast: except that those faults which seem to show themselves
   under the guise of virtues and in the form of spirituality are worse
   and less likely to be cured than those which arise openly and from
   carnal pleasures. For these latter, like sicknesses which are perfectly
   plain and visible, are grappled with and cured, while the former, since
   they are covered under the cloak of virtue, remain uncured, and cause
   their victims to fall into a more dangerous and deadly state of ill
   health.

  CHAPTER XXI.

    Of those who having made light of great things busy themselves about
    trifles.

   FOR how can we show how absurd it is that we see that some men after
   their first enthusiasm of renunciation in which they forsook their
   estates and vast wealth and the service of the world, and betook
   themselves to the monasteries, are still earnestly devoted to those
   things which cannot altogether be cut off, and which we cannot do
   without in this state of life, even though they are small and trifling
   things; so that in their case the anxiety about these trifles is
   greater than their love of all their property. And it certainly will
   not profit them much that they have disregarded greater riches and
   property, if they have only transferred their affections (on account of
   which they were to make light of them) to small and trifling things.
   For the sin of covetousness and avarice of which they cannot be guilty
   in the matter of really valuable things, they retain with regard to
   commoner matters, and so show that they have not got rid of their
   former greed but only changed its object. For if they are too careful
   about their mats, baskets, blankets, books, and other trifles such as
   these, the same passion holds them captive as before. And they actually
   guard and defend their rights over them so jealously as to get angry
   with their brethren about them, and, what is worse, they are not
   ashamed to quarrel over them. And being still troubled by the bad
   effects of their former covetousness, they are not content to possess
   those things which the needs and requirements of the body compel a monk
   to have, according to the common number and measure, but here too they
   show the greediness of their heart, as they try to have those things
   which they are obliged to use, better got up than the others; or,
   exceeding all due bounds, keep as their special and peculiar property
   and guard from the touch of others that which ought to belong to all
   the brethren alike. As if the difference of metals, and not the passion
   of covetousness was what mattered; and as if it was wrong to be angry
   about big things, while one might innocently be about trifling matters:
   and as if we had not given up all our precious things just in order
   that we might learn more readily to think nothing about trifles! For
   what difference does it make whether one gives way to covetousness in
   the matter of large and splendid things, or in the matter of the merest
   trifles, except that we ought to think a man so far worse if he has
   made light of great things and then is a slave to little things? And so
   that sort of renunciation of the world does not attain perfection of
   heart, because though it ranks as poverty it still keeps the mind of
   wealth.

                                 CONFERENCE 5.

CONFERENCE OF ABBOT SERAPION.

ON THE EIGHT PRINCIPAL FAULTS.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Our arrival at Abbot Serapion's cell, and inquiry on the different kinds of
    faults and the way to overcome them.

   IN that assembly of Ancients and Elders was a man named Serapion, [230]
   especially endowed with the grace of discretion, whose Conference I
   think it is worth while to set down in writing. For when we entreated
   him to discourse of the way to overcome our faults, so that their
   origin and cause might be made clearer to us, he thus began.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [230] Serapion when young was a pupil of Theonas, and an anecdote of
   his youthful indulgence in good things in secret has already been told
   in Conference II. c. xi. Another story of him is given in XVIII. xi.
   One of this name is mentioned by Palladius in the Lausiac History, c.
   lxxvi., and by Rufinus in the History of the Monks, c. xviii., where we
   are told that he lived at Arsinöe, and that he had ten thousand monks
   subject to his rule; a number which Sozomen also gives (H. E. VI.
   xxviii.). It is, however, doubtful whether this Serapion of Arsinöe is
   the person whose Conference Cassian here gives. Gazet identifies,
   Tillemont distinguishes the two. Jerome, it should be noticed, speaks
   in Ep. cviii. (Epistaphium Paulae) as if there was not only one of this
   name famous among the monks of Egypt at that time.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    Abbot Serapion's enumeration of eight principal faults.

   THERE are eight principal faults which attack mankind; viz., first
   gastrimargia, which means gluttony, secondly fornication, thirdly
   philargyria, i.e., avarice or the love of money, fourthly anger,
   fifthly dejection, sixthly acedia, i.e., listlessness or low spirits,
   seventhly cenodoxia, i.e., boasting or vain glory; and eighthly pride.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    Of the two classes of faults and their fourfold manner of acting on us.

   OF these faults then there are two classes. For they are either natural
   to us as gluttony, or arise outside of nature as covetousness. But
   their manner of acting on us is fourfold. For some cannot be
   consummated without an act on the part of the flesh, as gluttony and
   fornication, while some can be completed without any bodily act, as
   pride and vainglory. Some find the reasons for their being excited
   outside us, as covetousness and anger; others are aroused by internal
   feelings, as accidie [231] and dejection.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [231] For this word see the note on the Institutes V. i.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    A review of the passions of gluttony and fornication and their remedies.

   AND to make this clearer not only by a short discussion to the best of
   my ability, but by Scripture proof as well, gluttony and fornication,
   though they exist in us naturally (for sometimes they spring up without
   any incitement from the mind, and simply at the motion and allurement
   of the flesh) yet if they are to be consummated, must find an external
   object, and thus take effect only through bodily acts. For "every man
   is tempted of his own lust. Then lust when it has conceived beareth
   sin, and sin when it is consummated begets death." [232] For the first
   Adam could not have fallen a victim to gluttony unless he had had
   material food at hand, and had used it wrongly, nor could the second
   Adam be tempted without the enticement of some object, when it was said
   to Him: "If Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made
   bread." [233] And it is clear to everybody that fornication also is
   only completed by a bodily act, as God says of this spirit to the
   blessed Job: "And his force is in his loins, and his strength in the
   navel of his belly." [234] And so these two faults in particular, which
   are carried into effect by the aid of the flesh, especially require
   bodily abstinence as well as spiritual care of the soul; since the
   determination of the mind is not in itself enough to resist their
   attacks (as is sometimes the case with anger or gloominess or the other
   passions, which an effort of the mind alone can overcome without any
   mortification of the flesh); but bodily chastisement must be used as
   well, and be carried out by means of fasting and vigils and acts of
   contrition; and to this must be added change of scene, because since
   these sins are the results of faults of both mind and body, so they can
   only be overcome by the united efforts of both. And although the
   blessed Apostle says generally that all faults are carnal, since he
   enumerates enmities and anger and heresies among other works of the
   flesh, [235] yet in order to cure them and to discover their nature
   more exactly we make a twofold division of them: for we call some of
   them carnal, and some spiritual. And those we call carnal, which
   specially have to do with pampering the appetites of the flesh, and
   with which it is so charmed and satisfied, that sometimes it excites
   the mind when at rest and even drags it against its will to consent to
   its desire. Of which the blessed Apostle says: "In which also we all
   walked in time past in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of
   the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath
   even as the rest." [236] But we call those spiritual which spring only
   from the impulse of the mind and not merely contribute no pleasure to
   the flesh, but actually bring on it a weakness that is harmful to it,
   and only feed a diseased mind with the food of a most miserable
   pleasure. And therefore these need a single medicine for the heart: but
   those which are carnal can only be cured, as we said, by a double
   remedy. Whence it is extremely useful for those who aspire to purity,
   to begin by withdrawing from themselves the material which feeds these
   carnal passions, through which opportunity for or recollection of these
   same desires can arise in a soul that is still affected by the evil.
   For a complicated disease needs a complicated remedy. For from the body
   the object and material which would allure it must be withdrawn, for
   fear lest the lust should endeavour to break out into act; and before
   the mind we should no less carefully place diligent meditation on
   Scripture and watchful anxiety and the withdrawal into solitude, lest
   it should give birth to desire even in thought. But as regards other
   faults intercourse with our fellows is no obstacle, or rather it is of
   the greatest possible use, to those who truly desire to get rid of
   them, because in mixing with others they more often meet with rebuke,
   and while they are more frequently provoked the existence of the faults
   is made evident, and so they are cured with speedy remedies.

  CHAPTER V.

    How our Lord alone was tempted without sin.

   AND so our Lord Jesus Christ, though declared by the Apostle's word to
   have been tempted in all points like as we are, is yet said to have
   been "without sin," [237] i.e., without the infection of this appetite,
   as He knew nothing of incitements of carnal lust, with which we are
   sure to be troubled even against our will and without our knowledge;
   [238] for the archangel thus describes the manner of His conception:
   "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High
   shall overshadow thee: therefore that which shall be born of thee shall
   be called holy, the Son of God." [239]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [237] Heb. 4:15.

   [238] The following from D. Mozley's profound work on the Augustinian
   Theory of Predestination may serve to illustrate the remarks in the
   text: "Scripture says that our Lord was in all points tempted like as
   we are. But the Church has not considered it consistent with piety to
   interpret this text to mean that our Lord had the same direct
   propension to sin that we have, or that which is called by divines
   concupiscence. Such direct appetite for what is sinful is the
   characteristic of our fallen and corrupt nature; and our Lord did not
   assume a corrupt, but a sound humanity. Indeed, concupiscence, even
   prior to and independent of its gratification, has of itself the nature
   of sin; and therefore could not belong to a perfect Being. Our Lord had
   all the passions and affections that legitimately belong to man; which
   passions and affections, tending as they do in their own natures to
   become inordinate, constituted of themselves a state of trial; but the
   Church has regarded our Lord's trial as consisting in preserving
   ordinate affections from becoming inordinate, rather than in
   restraining desire proximate to sin from gratification" (p. 97).

   [239] S. Luke 1:35.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of the manner of the temptation in which our Lord was attacked by the devil.

   FOR it was right that He who was in possession of the perfect image and
   likeness of God should be Himself tempted through those passions,
   through which Adam also was tempted while he still retained the image
   of God unbroken, that is, through gluttony, vainglory, pride; and not
   through those in which he was by his own fault entangled and involved
   after the transgression of the commandment, when the image and likeness
   of God was marred. For it was gluttony through which he took the fruit
   of the forbidden tree, vainglory through which it was said "Your eyes
   shall be opened," and pride through which it was said "Ye shall be as
   gods, knowing good and evil." [240] With these three sins then we read
   that the Lord our Saviour was also tempted; with gluttony when the
   devil said to Him: "Command these stones that they be made bread:" with
   vainglory: "If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down:" with pride,
   when he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
   and said: "All this will I give to Thee if Thou wilt fall down and
   worship me:" [241] in order that He might by His example teach us how
   we ought to vanquish the tempter when we are attacked on the same lines
   of temptation as He was. And so both the former and the latter are
   spoken of as Adam; the one being the first for destruction and death,
   and the other the first for resurrection and life. Through the one the
   whole race of mankind is brought into condemnation, through the other
   the whole race of mankind is set free. The one was fashioned out of raw
   and unformed earth, the other was born of the Virgin Mary. In His case
   then though it was fitting that He should undergo temptation, yet it
   was not necessary that He should fail under it. Nor could He who had
   vanquished gluttony be tempted by fornication, which springs from
   superfluity and gluttony as its root, with which even the first Adam
   would not have been destroyed unless before its birth he had been
   deceived by the wiles of the devil and fallen a victim to passion. And
   therefore the Son of God is not said absolutely to have come "in the
   flesh of sin," but "in the likeness of the flesh of sin," because
   though His was true flesh and He ate and drank and slept, and truly
   received the prints of the nails, there was in Him no true sin
   inherited from the fall, but only what was something like it. For He
   had no experience of the fiery darts of carnal lust, which in our case
   arise even against our will, from the constitution of our natures, but
   He took upon Him something like this, by sharing in our nature. For as
   He truly fulfilled every function which belongs to us, and bore all
   human infirmities, He has consequently been considered to have been
   subject to this feeling also, that He might appear through these
   infirmities to bear in His own flesh the state even of this fault and
   sin. Lastly the devil only tempted Him to those sins, by which he had
   deceived the first Adam, inferring that He as man would similarly be
   deceived in other matters if he found that He was overcome by those
   temptations by which he had overthrown His predecessor. But as he was
   overthrown in the first encounter he was not able to bring upon Him the
   second infirmity which had shot up as from the root of the first fault.
   For he saw that He had not even admitted anything from which this
   infirmity might take its rise, and it was idle to hope for the fruit of
   sin from Him, as he saw that He in no sort of way received into Himself
   seeds or roots of it. Yet according to Luke, who places last that
   temptation in which he uses the words "If Thou art the Son of God, cast
   Thyself down," [242] we can understand this of the feeling of pride, so
   that that earlier one, which Matthew places third, in which, as Luke
   the evangelist says, the devil showed Him all the kingdoms of the world
   in a moment of time and promised them to Him, may be taken of the
   feeling of covetousness, because after His victory over gluttony, he
   did not venture to tempt Him to fornication, but passed on to
   covetousness, which he knew to be the root of all evils, [243] and when
   again vanquished in this, he did not dare attack Him with any of those
   sins which follow, which, as he knew full well, spring from this as a
   root and source; and so he passed on to the last passion; viz., pride,
   by which he knew that those who are perfect and have overcome all other
   sins, can be affected, and owing to which he remembered that he himself
   in his character of Lucifer, and many others too, had fallen from their
   heavenly estate, without temptation from any of the preceding passions.
   In this order then which we have mentioned, which is the one given by
   the evangelist Luke, there is an exact agreement between the
   allurements and forms of the temptations by which that most crafty foe
   attacked both the first and the second Adam. For to the one he said
   "Your eyes shall be opened;" to the other "he showed all the kingdoms
   of the world and the glory of them." In the one case he said "Ye shall
   be as gods;" in the other, "If Thou art the Son of God." [244]

  CHAPTER VII.

    How vainglory and pride can be consummated without any assistance from the
    body.

   AND to go on in the order which we proposed, with our account of the
   way in which the other passions act (our analysis of which was obliged
   to be interrupted by this account of gluttony and of the Lord's
   temptation) vainglory and pride can be consummated even without the
   slightest assistance from the body. For in what way do those passions
   need any action of the flesh, which bring ample destruction on the soul
   they take captive simply by its assent and wish to gain praise and
   glory from men? Or what act on the part of the body was there in that
   pride of old in the case of the above mentioned Lucifer; as he only
   conceived it in his heart and mind, as the prophet tells us: "Who
   saidst in thine heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will set my throne
   above the stars of God. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
   I will be like the most High." [245] And just as he had no one to stir
   him up to this pride, so his thoughts alone were the authors of the sin
   when complete and of his eternal fall; especially as no exercise of the
   dominion at which he aimed followed.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of covetousness, which is something outside our nature, and of the
    difference between it and those faults which are natural to us.

   COVETOUSNESS and anger, although they are not of the same character
   (for the former is something outside our nature, while the latter seems
   to have as it were its seed plot within us) yet they spring up in the
   same way, as in most instances they find the reasons for their being
   stirred in something outside of us. For often men who are still rather
   weak complain that they have fallen into these sins through irritation
   and the instigation of others, and are plunged headlong into the
   passions of anger and covetousness by the provocation of other people.
   But that covetousness is something outside our nature, we can clearly
   see from this; viz., that it is proved not to have its first starting
   point inside us, nor does it originate in what contributes to keeping
   body and soul together, and to the existence of life. For it is plain
   that nothing belongs to the actual needs and necessities of our common
   life except our daily meat and drink: but everything else, with
   whatever zeal and care we preserve it, is shown to be something
   distinct from the wants of man by the needs of life itself. And so this
   temptation, as being something outside our nature, only attacks those
   monks who are but lukewarm and built on a bad foundation, whereas those
   which are natural to us do not cease from troubling even the best of
   monks and those who dwell in solitude. And so far is this shown to be
   true, that we find that there are some nations who are altogether free
   from this passion of covetousness, because they have never by use and
   custom received into themselves this fault and infirmity. And we
   believe that the old world before the flood was for long ages ignorant
   of the madness of this desire. And in the case of each one of us who
   makes his renunciation of the world a thorough one, we know that it is
   extirpated without any difficulty, if, that is, a man gives up all his
   property, and seeks the monastic discipline in such a way as not to
   allow himself to keep a single farthing. And we can find thousands of
   men to bear witness to this, who in a single moment have given up all
   their property, and have so thoroughly eradicated this passion as not
   to be in the slightest degree troubled by it afterwards, though all
   their life long they have to fight against gluttony, and cannot be safe
   from it without striving with the utmost watchfulness of heart and
   bodily abstinence.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    How dejection and accidie generally arise without any external provocation,
    as in the case of other faults. [246]

   DEJECTION and accidie generally arise without any external provocation,
   like those others of which we have been speaking: for we are well aware
   that they often harass solitaries, and those who have settled
   themselves in the desert without any intercourse with other men, and
   this in the most distressing way. And the truth of this any one who has
   lived in the desert and made trial of the conflicts of the inner man,
   can easily prove by experience.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [246] Such is the heading which Gazet gives. Petschenig edits "De ira
   atque tristitia, quod inter accedentia vitia plerumque [non]
   inveniantur;" where "non" is his own insertion, and as he frankly tells
   us, the heading does not suit the chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    How six of these faults are related, and the two which differ from them are
    akin to one another.

   OF these eight faults then, although they are different in their origin
   and in their way of affecting us, yet the six former; viz., gluttony,
   fornication, covetousness, anger, dejection, accidie, have a sort of
   connexion with each other, and are, so to speak, linked together in a
   chain, so that any excess of the one forms a starting point for the
   next. For from superfluity of gluttony fornication is sure to spring,
   and from fornication covetousness, from covetousness anger, from anger,
   dejection, and from dejection, accidie. And so we must fight against
   them in the same way, and with the same methods: and having overcome
   one, we ought always to enter the lists against the next. For a tall
   and spreading tree of a noxious kind will the more easily be made to
   wither if the roots on which it depends have first been laid bare or
   cut; and a pond of water which is dangerous will be dried up at once if
   the spring and flowing channel which produce it are carefully stopped
   up. Wherefore in order to overcome accidie, you must first get the
   better of dejection: in order to get rid of dejection, anger must first
   be expelled: in order to quell anger, covetousness must be trampled
   under foot: in order to root out covetousness, fornication must be
   checked: and in order to destroy fornication, you must chastise the sin
   of gluttony. But the two remaining faults; viz., vainglory and pride,
   are connected together in a somewhat similar way as the others of which
   we have spoken, so that the growth of the one makes a starting point
   for the other (for superfluity of vainglory produces an incentive to
   pride); but they are altogether different from the six former faults,
   and are not joined in the same category with them, since not only is
   there no opportunity given for them to spring up from these, but they
   are actually aroused in an entirely different way and manner. For when
   these others have been eradicated these latter flourish the more
   vigorously, and from the death of the others they shoot forth and grow
   up all the stronger: and therefore we are attacked by these two faults
   in quite a different way. For we fall into each one of those six faults
   at the moment when we have been overcome by the ones that went before
   them; but into these two we are in danger of falling when we have
   proved victorious, and above all after some splendid triumph. In the
   cases then of all faults just as they spring up from the growth of
   those that go before them, so are they eradicated by getting rid of the
   earlier ones. And in this way in order that pride may be driven out
   vainglory must be stifled, and so if we always overcome the earlier
   ones, the later ones will be checked; and through the extermination of
   those that lead the way, the rest of our passions will die down without
   difficulty. And though these eight faults of which we have spoken are
   connected and joined together in the way which we have shown, yet they
   may be more exactly divided into four groups and sub-divisions. For to
   gluttony fornication is linked by a special tie: to covetousness anger,
   to dejection accidie, and to vainglory pride is closely allied.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    Of the origin and character of each of these faults.

   AND now, to speak about each kind of fault separately: of gluttony
   there are three sorts: (1) that which drives a monk to eat before the
   proper and stated times; (2) that which cares about filling the belly
   and gorging it with all kinds of food, and (3) that which is on the
   lookout for dainties and delicacies. And these three sorts give a monk
   no little trouble, unless he tries to free himself from all of them
   with the same care and scrupulousness. For just as one should never
   venture to break one's fast before the right time so we must utterly
   avoid all greediness in eating, and the choice and dainty preparation
   of our food: for from these three causes different but extremely
   dangerous conditions of the soul arise. For from the first there
   springs up dislike of the monastery, and thence there grows up disgust
   and intolerance of the life there, and this is sure to be soon followed
   by withdrawal and speedy departure from it. By the second there are
   kindled the fiery darts of luxury and lasciviousness. The third also
   weaves the entangling meshes of covetousness for the nets of its
   prisoners, and ever hinders monks from following the perfect
   self-abnegation of Christ. And when there are traces of this passion in
   us we can recognize them by this; viz., if we are kept to dine by one
   of the brethren we are not content to eat our food with the relish
   which he has prepared and offers to us, but take the unpardonable
   liberty of asking to have something else poured over it or added to it,
   a thing which we should never do for three reasons: (1) because the
   monastic mind ought always to be accustomed to practise endurance and
   abstinence, and like the Apostle, to learn to be content in whatever
   state he is. [247] For one who is upset by taking an unsavoury morsel
   once and in a way, and who cannot even for a short time overcome the
   delicacy of his appetite will never succeed in curbing the secret and
   more important desires of the body; (2) because it sometimes happens
   that at the time our host is out of that particular thing which we ask
   for, and we make him feel ashamed of the wants and bareness of his
   table, by exposing his poverty which he would rather was only known to
   God; (3) because sometimes other people do not care about the relish
   which we ask for, and so it turns out that we are annoying most of them
   while intent on satisfying the desires of our own palate. And on this
   account we must by all means avoid such a liberty. Of fornication there
   are three sorts: (1) that which is accomplished by sexual intercourse;
   (2) that which takes place without touching a woman, for which we read
   that Onan the son of the patriarch Judah was smitten by the Lord; and
   which is termed by Scripture uncleanness: of which the Apostle says:
   "But I say to the unmarried and to widows, that it is good for them if
   they abide even as I. But if they do not contain let them marry: for it
   is better to marry than to burn;" [248] (3) that which is conceived in
   heart and mind, of which the Lord says in the gospel: "Whosoever
   looketh on a woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery
   with her in his heart." [249] And these three kinds the blessed Apostle
   tells us must be stamped out in one and the same way. "Mortify," says
   he, "your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness,
   lust, etc." [250] And again of two of them he says to the Ephesians:
   "Let fornication and uncleanness be not so much as named among you:"
   and once more: "But know this that no fornicator or unclean person, or
   covetous person who is an idolater hath inheritance in the kingdom of
   Christ and of God." [251] And just as these three must be avoided by us
   with equal care, so they one and all shut us out and exclude us equally
   from the kingdom of Christ. Of covetousness there are three kinds: (1)
   That which hinders renunciants from allowing themselves of be stripped
   of their goods and property; (2) that which draws us to resume with
   excessive eagerness the possession of those things which we have given
   away and distributed to the poor; (3) that which leads a man to covet
   and procure what he never previously possessed. Of anger there are
   three kinds: one which rages within, which is called in Greek qumos;
   another which breaks out in word and deed and action, which they term
   orgh: of which the Apostle speaks, saying "But now do ye lay aside all
   anger and indignation;" [252] the third, which is not like those in
   boiling over and being done with in an hour, but which lasts for days
   and long periods, which is called mhnis. And all these three must be
   condemned by us with equal horror. Of dejection there are two kinds:
   one, that which springs up when anger has died down, or is the result
   of some loss we have incurred or of some purpose which has been
   hindered and interfered with; the other, that which comes from
   unreasonable anxiety of mind or from despair. Of accidie there are two
   kinds: one of which sends those affected by it to sleep; while the
   other makes them forsake their cell and flee away. Of vainglory,
   although it takes various forms and shapes, and is divided into
   different classes, yet there are two main kinds: (1) when we are puffed
   up about carnal things and things visible, and (2) when we are inflamed
   with the desire of vain praise for things spiritual and unseen.

  CHAPTER XII.

    How vainglory may be useful to us.

   BUT in one matter vainglory is found to be a useful thing for
   beginners. I mean by those who are still troubled by carnal sins, as
   for instance, if, when they are troubled by the spirit of fornication,
   they formed an idea of the dignity of the priesthood, or of reputation
   among all men, by which they may be thought saints and immaculate: and
   so with these considerations they repell the unclean suggestions of
   lust, as deeming them base and at least unworthy of their rank and
   reputation; and so by means of a smaller evil they overcome a greater
   one. For it is better for a man to be troubled by the sin of vainglory
   than for him to fall into the desire for fornication, from which he
   either cannot recover at all or only with great difficulty after he has
   fallen. And this thought is admirably expressed by one of the prophets
   speaking in the person of God, and saying: "For My name's sake I will
   remove My wrath afar off: and with My praise I will bridle thee lest
   thou shouldest perish," [253] i.e., while you are enchained by the
   praises of vainglory, you cannot possibly rush on into the depths of
   hell, or plunge irrevocably into the commission of deadly sins. Nor
   need we wonder that this passion has the power of checking anyone from
   rushing into the sin of fornication, since it has been again and again
   proved by many examples that when once a man has been affected by its
   poison and plague, it makes him utterly indefatigable, so that he
   scarcely feels a fast of even two or three days. And we have often
   known some who are living in this desert, confessing that when their
   home was in the monasteries of Syria they could without difficulty go
   for five days without food, while now they are so overcome with hunger
   even by the third hour, that they can scarcely keep on their daily fast
   to the ninth hour. And on this subject there is a very neat answer of
   Abbot Macarius [254] to one who asked him why he was troubled with
   hunger as early as the third hour in the desert, when in the monastery
   he had often scorned food for a whole week, without feeling hungry.
   "Because," said he, "here there is nobody to see your fast, and feed
   and support you with his praise of you: but there you grew fat on the
   notice of others and the food of vainglory." And of the way in which,
   as we said, the sin of fornication is prevented by an attack of
   vainglory, there is an excellent and significant figure in the book of
   Kings, where, when the children of Israel had been taken captive by
   Necho, King of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Assyria, came up and
   brought them back from the borders of Egypt to their own country, not
   indeed meaning to restore them to their former liberty and their native
   land, but meaning to carry them off to his own land and to transport
   them to a still more distant country than the land of Egypt in which
   they had been prisoners. And this illustration exactly applies to the
   case before us. For though there is less harm in yielding to the sin of
   vainglory than to fornication, yet it is more difficult to escape from
   the dominion of vainglory. For somehow or other the prisoner who is
   carried off to a greater distance, will have more difficulty in
   returning to his native land and the freedom of his fathers, and the
   prophet's rebuke will be deservedly aimed at him: "Wherefore art thou
   grown old in a strange country? [255] since a man is rightly said to
   have grown old in a strange country, if he has not broken up the ground
   of his faults. Of pride there are two kinds: (1) carnal, and (2)
   spiritual, which is the worse. For it especially attacks those who are
   seen to have made progress in some good qualities.

  CHAPTER XIII.

    Of the different ways in which all these faults assault us.

   ALTHOUGH then these eight faults trouble all sorts of men, yet they do
   not attack them all in the same way. For in one man the spirit of
   fornication holds the chief place: wrath rides rough shod over another:
   over another vainglory claims dominion: in an other pride holds the
   field: and though it is clear that we are all attacked by all of them,
   yet the difficulties come to each of us in very different ways and
   manners.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

    Of the struggle into which we must enter against our faults, when they
    attack us.

   WHEREFORE we must enter the lists against these faults in such a way
   that every one should discover his besetting sin, and direct his main
   attack against it, directing all his care and watchfulness of mind to
   guard against its assault, directing against it daily the weapons of
   fasting, and at all times hurling against it the constant darts of
   sighs and groanings from the heart, and employing against it the
   labours of vigils and the meditation of the heart, and further pouring
   forth to God constant tears and prayers and continually and expressly
   praying to be delivered from its attack. For it is impossible for a man
   to win a triumph over any kind of passion, unless he has first clearly
   understood that he cannot possibly gain the victory in the struggle
   with it by his own strength and efforts, although in order that he may
   be rendered pure he must night and day persist in the utmost care and
   watchfulness. And even when he feels that he has got rid of this fault,
   he should still search the inmost recesses of his heart with the same
   purpose, and single out the worst fault which he can see among those
   still there, and bring all the forces of the Spirit to bear against it
   in particular, and so by always overcoming the stronger passions, he
   will gain a quick and easy victory over the rest, because by a course
   of triumphs the soul is made more vigorous, and the fact that the next
   conflict is with weaker passion insures him a readier success in the
   struggle: as is generally the case with those who are wont to face all
   kinds of wild beasts in the presence of the kings of this world, out of
   consideration for the rewards--a kind of spectacle which is generally
   called "pancarpus." [256] Such men, I say, direct their first assault
   against whatever beasts they see to be the strongest and fiercest, and
   when they have despatched these, then they can more easily lay low the
   remaining ones, which are not so terrible and powerful. So too, by
   always overcoming the stronger passions, as weaker ones take their
   place, a perfect victory will be secured for us without any risk. Nor
   need we imagine that if any one grapples with one fault in particular,
   and seems too careless about guarding against the attacks of others, he
   will be easily wounded by a sudden assault, for this cannot possibly
   happen. For where a man is anxious to cleanse his heart, and has
   steeled his heart's purpose against the attack of any one fault, it is
   impossible for him not to have a general dread of all other faults as
   well, and take similar care of them. For if a man renders himself
   unworthy of the prize of purity by contaminating himself with other
   faults, how can he possibly succeed in gaining the victory over that
   one passion from which he is longing to be freed? But when the main
   purpose of our heart has singled out one passion as the special object
   of its attack, we shall pray about it more earnestly, and with special
   anxiety and fervour shall entreat that we may be more especially on our
   guard against it and so succeed in gaining a speedy victory. For the
   giver of the law himself teaches us that we ought to follow this plan
   in our conflicts and not to trust in our own power; as he says: "Thou
   shalt not fear them because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a
   God mighty and terrible: He will consume these nations in thy sight by
   little and little and by degrees. Thou wilt not be able to destroy them
   altogether: lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon
   thee. But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight; and shall
   slay them until they be utterly destroyed." [257]

   [256] Pancarpus (pagkarpos). The word was originally applied to an
   offering of all kinds of fruit. Cf. Tertullian ad Valent. xii. It is
   also used in the general sense "of all sorts" by Augustine, Adv.
   Secund. xxiii. Cassian here speaks as if it had become the popular name
   for the conflicts of gladiators with all kinds of beasts, though there
   is apparently no other authority for this.

  CHAPTER XV.

    How we can do nothing against our faults without the help of God, and how we
    should not be puffed up by victories over them.

   AND that we ought not to be puffed up by victories over them he
   likewise charges us; saying, "Lest after thou hast eaten and art
   filled, hast built goodly houses and dwelt in them, and shalt have
   herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of gold and of silver,
   and of all things, thy heart be lifted up and thou remember not the
   Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the
   house of bondage; and was thy leader in the great and terrible
   wilderness." [258] Solomon also says in Proverbs: "When thine enemy
   shall fall be not glad, and in his ruin be not lifted up, lest the Lord
   see and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him," [259]
   i.e., lest He see thy pride of heart, and cease from attacking him, and
   thou begin to be forsaken by Him and so once more to be troubled by
   that passion which by God's grace thou hadst previously overcome. For
   the prophet would not have prayed in these words, "Deliver not up to
   beasts, O Lord, the soul that confesseth to Thee," [260] unless he had
   known that because of their pride of heart some were given over again
   to those faults which they had overcome, in order that they might be
   humbled. Wherefore it is well for us both to be certified by actual
   experience, and also to be instructed by countless passages of
   Scripture, that we cannot possibly overcome such mighty foes in our own
   strength, and unless supported by the aid of God alone; and that we
   ought always to refer the whole of our victory each day to God Himself,
   as the Lord Himself also gives us instruction by Moses on this very
   point: "Say not in thine heart when the Lord thy God shall have
   destroyed them in thy sight: For my righteousness hath the Lord brought
   me in to possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for
   their wickedness. For it is not for thy righteousness, and the
   uprightness of thine heart, that thou shalt go in to possess their
   lands: but because they have done wickedly they are destroyed at thy
   coming in." [261] I ask what could be said clearer in opposition to
   that impious notion and impertinence of ours, in which we want to
   ascribe everything that we do to our own free will and our own
   exertions? "Say not," he tells us, "in thine heart, when the Lord thy
   God shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my righteousness the
   Lord hath brought me in to possess this land." To those who have their
   eyes opened and their ears ready to hearken does not this plainly say:
   When your struggle with carnal faults has gone well for you, and you
   see that you are free from the filth of them, and from the fashions of
   this world, do not be puffed up by the success of the conflict and
   victory and ascribe it to your own power and wisdom, nor fancy that you
   have gained the victory over spiritual wickedness and carnal sins
   through your own exertions and energy, and free will? For there is no
   doubt that in all this you could not possibly have succeeded, unless
   you had been fortified and protected by the help of the Lord.

  CHAPTER XVI.

    Of the meaning of the seven nations of whose lands Israel took possession,
    and the reason why they are sometimes spoken of as "seven," and sometimes as
    "many."

   THESE are the seven nations whose lands the Lord promised to give to
   the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt. And everything
   which, as the Apostle says, happened to them "in a figure" [262] we
   ought to take as written for our correction. For so we read: "When the
   Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which thou art
   going in to possess, and shall have destroyed many nations before thee,
   the Hittite, and the Girgashites, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and
   the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations much
   more numerous than thou art and much stronger than thou: and the Lord
   thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy
   them." [263] And the reason that they are said to be much more
   numerous, is that faults are many more in number than virtues and so in
   the list of them the nations are reckoned as seven in number, but when
   the attack upon them is spoken of they are set down without their
   number being given, for thus we read "And shall have destroyed many
   nations before thee." For the race of carnal passions which springs
   from this sevenfold incentive and root of sin, is more numerous than
   that of Israel. For thence spring up murders, strifes, heresies,
   thefts, false witness, blasphemy, surfeiting, drunkenness, back-biting,
   buffoonery, filthy conversation, lies, perjury, foolish talking,
   scurrility, restlessness, greediness, bitterness, clamour, wrath,
   contempt, murmuring, temptation, despair, and many other faults, which
   it would take too long to describe. And if we are inclined to think
   these small matters, let us hear what the Apostle thought about them,
   and what was his opinion of them: "Neither murmur ye," says he, "as
   some of them murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer:" and of
   temptation: "Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and
   perished by the serpents." [264] Of backbiting: "Love not backbiting
   lest thou be rooted out." [265] And of despair: "Who despairing have
   given themselves up to lasciviousness unto the working of all error, in
   uncleanness." [266] And that clamour is condemned as well as anger and
   indignation and blasphemy, the words of the same Apostle teach us as
   clearly as possible when he thus charges us: "Let all bitterness, and
   anger, and indignation, and clamour, and blasphemy be put away from you
   with all malice," [267] and many more things like these. And though
   these are far more numerous than the virtues are, yet if those eight
   principal sins, from which we know that these naturally proceed, are
   first overcome, all these at once sink down, and are destroyed together
   with them with a lasting destruction. For from gluttony proceed
   surfeiting and drunkenness. From fornication filthy conversation,
   scurrility, buffoonery and foolish talking. From covetousness, lying,
   deceit, theft, perjury, the desire of filthy lucre, false witness,
   violence, inhumanity, and greed. From anger, murders, clamour and
   indignation. From dejection, rancor, cowardice, bitterness, despair.
   From accidie, laziness, sleepiness, rudeness, restlessness, wandering
   about, instability both of mind and body, chattering, inquisitiveness.
   From vainglory, contention, heresies, boasting and confidence in
   novelties. From pride, contempt, envy, disobedience, blasphemy,
   murmuring, backbiting. And that all these plagues are stronger than we,
   we can tell very plainly from the way in which they attack us. For the
   delight in carnal passions wars more powerfully in our members than
   does the desire for virtue, which is only gained with the greatest
   contrition of heart and body. But if you will only gaze with the eyes
   of the spirit on those countless hosts of our foes, which the Apostle
   enumerates where he says: "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
   but against principalities, against powers, against the world-rulers of
   this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places," [268]
   and this which we find of the righteous man in the ninetieth Psalm: "A
   thousand shall fall beside thee and ten thousand at thy right hand,"
   [269] then you will clearly see that they are far more numerous and
   more powerful than are we, carnal and earthly creatures as we are,
   while to them is given a substance which is spiritual and incorporeal.

  CHAPTER XVII.

    A question with regard to the comparison of seven nations with eight faults.

   GERMANUS: How then is it that there are eight faults which assault us,
   when Moses reckons the nations opposed to the people of Israel as
   seven, and how is it well for us to take possession of the territory of
   our faults?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    The answer how the number of eight nations is made up in accordance with the
    eight faults.

   SERAPION: Everybody is perfectly agreed that there are eight principal
   faults which affect a monk. And all of them are not included in the
   figure of the nations for this reason, because in Deuteronomy Moses, or
   rather the Lord through him, was speaking to those who had already gone
   forth from Egypt and been set free from one most powerful nation, I
   mean that of the Egyptians. And we find that this figure holds good
   also in our case, as when we have got clear of the snares of this world
   we are found to be free from gluttony, i.e., the sin of the belly and
   palate; and like them we have a conflict against these seven remaining
   nations, without taking account at all of the one which has been
   already overcome. And the land of this nation was not given to Israel
   for a possession, but the command of the Lord ordained that they should
   at once forsake it and go forth from it. And for this cause our fasts
   ought to be made moderate, that there may be no need for us through
   excessive abstinence, which results from weakness of the flesh and
   infirmity, to return again to the land of Egypt, i.e., to our former
   greed and carnal lust which we forsook when we made our renunciation of
   this world. And this has happened in a figure, in those who after
   having gone forth into the desert of virtue again hanker after the
   flesh pots over which they sat in Egypt.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

    The reason why one nation is to be forsaken, while seven are commanded to be
    destroyed.

   BUT the reason why that nation in which the children of Israel were
   born, was bidden not to be utterly destroyed but only to have its land
   forsaken, while it was commanded that these seven nations were to be
   completely destroyed, is this: because however great may be the ardour
   of spirit, inspired by which we have entered on the desert of virtues,
   yet we cannot possibly free ourselves entirely from the neighbourhood
   of gluttony or from its service and, so to speak, from daily
   intercourse with it. For the liking for delicacies and dainties will
   live on as something natural and innate in us, even though we take
   pains to cut off all superfluous appetites and desires, which, as they
   cannot be altogether destroyed, ought to be shunned and avoided. For of
   these we read "Take no care for the flesh with its desires." [270]
   While then we still retain the feeling for this care, which we are
   bidden not altogether to cut off, but to keep without its desires, it
   is clear that we do not destroy the Egyptian nation but separate
   ourselves in a sort of way from it, not thinking anything about
   luxuries and delicate feasts, but, as the Apostle says, being "content
   with our daily food and clothing." [271] And this is commanded in a
   figure in the law, in this way: "Thou shalt not abhor the Egyptian,
   because thou wast a stranger in his land." [272] For necessary food is
   not refused to the body without danger to it and sinfulness in the
   soul. But of those seven troublesome faults we must in every possible
   way root out the affections from the inmost recesses of our souls. For
   of them we read: "Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and
   clamour and blasphemy be put away from you with all malice:" and again:
   "But fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness let it not so
   much as be named among you, or obscenity or foolish talking or
   scurrility." [273] We can then cut out the roots of these faults which
   are grafted into our nature from without while we cannot possibly cut
   off occasions of gluttony. For however far we have advanced, we cannot
   help being what we were born. And that this is so we can show not only
   from the lives of little people like ourselves but from the lives and
   customs of all who have attained perfection, who even when they have
   got rid of incentives to all other passions, and are retiring to the
   desert with perfect fervour of spirit and bodily abnegation, yet still
   cannot do without thought for their daily meal and the preparation of
   their food from year to year.

  CHAPTER XX.

    Of the nature of gluttony, which may be illustrated by the simile of the
    eagle.

   AN admirable illustration of this passion, with which a monk, however
   spiritual and excellent, is sure to be hampered, is found in the simile
   of the eagle. For this bird when in its flight on high it has soared
   above the highest clouds, and has withdrawn itself from the eyes of all
   mortals and from the face of the whole earth, is yet compelled by the
   needs of the belly to drop down and descend to the earth and feed upon
   carrion and dead bodies. And this clearly shows that the spirit of
   gluttony cannot be altogether extirpated like all other faults, nor be
   entirely destroyed like them, but that we can only hold down and check
   by the power of the mind all incentives to it and all superfluous
   appetites.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

    Of the lasting character of gluttony as described to some philosophers.

   FOR the nature of this fault was admirably expressed under cover of the
   following puzzle by one of the Elders in a discussion with some
   philosophers, who thought that they might chaff him like a country
   bumpkin because of his Christian simplicity. "My father," said he,
   "left me in the clutches of a great many creditors. All the others I
   have paid in full, and have freed myself from all their pressing
   claims; but one I cannot satisfy even by a daily payment." And when
   they could not see the meaning of the puzzle, and urgently begged him
   to explain it: "I was," said he, "in my natural condition, encompassed
   by a great many faults. But when God inspired me with the longing to be
   free, I renounced this world, and at the same time gave up all my
   property which I had inherited from my father, and so I satisfied them
   all like pressing creditors, and freed myself entirely from them. But I
   was never able altogether to get rid of the incentives to gluttony. For
   though I reduce the quantity of food which I take to the smallest
   possible amount, yet I cannot avoid the force of its daily
   solicitations, but must be perpetually `dunned' by it, and be making as
   it were interminable payments by continually satisfying it, and pay
   never ending toll at its demand." Then they declared that this man,
   whom they had till now despised as a booby and a country bumpkin, had
   thoroughly grasped the first principles of philosophy, i.e., training
   in ethics, and they marvelled that he could by the light of nature have
   learnt that which no schooling in this world could have taught him,
   while they themselves with all their efforts and long course of
   training had not learnt this. This is enough on gluttony in particular.
   Now let us return to the discourse in which we had begun to consider
   the general relation of our faults to each other.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

    How it was that God foretold to Abraham that Israel would have to drive out
    ten nations.

   WHEN the Lord was speaking with Abraham about the future (a point which
   you did not ask about) we find that He did not enumerate seven nations,
   but ten, whose land He promised to give to his seed. [274] And this
   number is plainly made up by adding idolatry, and blasphemy, to whose
   dominion, before the knowledge of God and the grace of Baptism, both
   the irreligious hosts of the Gentiles and blasphemous ones of the Jews
   were subject, while they dwelt in a spiritual Egypt. But when a man has
   made his renunciation and come forth from thence, and having by God's
   grace conquered gluttony, has come into the spiritual wilderness, then
   he is free from the attacks of these three, and will only have to wage
   war against those seven which Moses enumerates.

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    How it is useful for us to take possession of their lands.

   BUT the fact that we are bidden for our good to take possession of the
   countries of those most wicked nations, may be understood in this way.
   Each fault has its own especial corner in the heart, which it claims
   for itself in the recesses of the soul, and drives out Israel, i.e.,
   the contemplation of holy and heavenly things, and never ceases to
   oppose them. For virtues cannot possibly live side by side with faults.
   "For what participation hath righteousness with unrighteousness? Or
   what fellowship hath light with darkness?" [275] But as soon as these
   faults have been overcome by the people of Israel, i.e., by those
   virtues which war against them, then at once the place in our heart
   which the spirit of concupiscence and fornication had occupied, will be
   filled by chastity. That which wrath had held, will be claimed by
   patience. That which had been occupied by a sorrow that worketh death,
   will be taken by a godly sorrow and one full of joy. That which had
   been wasted by accidie, will at once be tilled by courage. That which
   pride had trodden down will be ennobled by humility: and so when each
   of these faults has been expelled, their places (that is the tendency
   towards them) will be filled by the opposite virtues which are aptly
   termed the children of Israel, that is, of the soul that seeth God:
   [276] and when these have expelled all passions from the heart we may
   believe that they have recovered their own possessions rather than
   invaded those of others.

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    How the lands from which the Canaanites were expelled, had been assigned to
    the seed of Shem.

   FOR, as an ancient tradition tells us, [277] these same lands of the
   Canaanites into which the children of Israel were brought, had been
   formerly allotted to the children of Shem at the division of the world,
   and afterward the descendants of Ham wickedly invading them with force
   and violence took possession of them. And in this the righteous
   judgment of God is shown, as He expelled from the land of others these
   who had wrongfully taken possession of them, and restored to those
   others the ancient property of their fathers which had been assigned to
   their ancestors at the division of the world. And we can perfectly well
   see that this figure holds good in our own case. For by nature God's
   will assigned the possession of our heart not to vices but to virtues,
   which, after the fall of Adam were driven out from their own country by
   the sins which grew up, i.e., by the Canaanites; and so when by God's
   grace they are by our efforts and labour restored again to it, we may
   hold that they have not occupied the territory of another, but rather
   have recovered their own country.

   Manichæan objection against the cruelty and injustice of the
   extermination of the Canaanites by the Israelites.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

    Different passages of Scripture on the meaning of the eight faults.

   AND in reference to these eight faults we also have the following in
   the gospel: "But when the unclean spirit is gone out from a man, he
   walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none. Then he
   saith, I will return to my house from whence I came out: and coming he
   findeth it empty, swept, and garnished: then he goeth and taketh seven
   other spirits worse than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:
   and the last state of that man is made worse than the first." [278] Lo,
   just as in the former passages we read of seven nations besides that of
   the Egyptians from which the children of Israel had gone forth, so here
   too seven unclean spirits are said to return beside that one which we
   first hear of as going forth from the man. And of this sevenfold
   incentive of sins Solomon gives the following account in Proverbs: "If
   thine enemy speak loud to thee, do not agree to him because there are
   seven mischiefs in his heart;" [279] i.e., if the spirit of gluttony is
   overcome and begins to flatter you with having humiliated it, asking in
   a sort of way that you would relax something of the fervour with which
   you began, and yield to it something beyond what the due limits of
   abstinence, and measure of strict severity would allow, do not you be
   overcome by its submission, nor return in fancied security from its
   assaults, as you seem to have become for a time freed from carnal
   desires, to your previous state of carelessness or former liking for
   good things. For through this the spirit whom you have vanquished is
   saying "I will return to my house from whence I came out," and
   forthwith the seven spirits of sins which proceed from it will prove to
   you more injurious than that passion which in the first instance you
   overcame, and will presently drag you down to worse kinds of sins.

  CHAPTER XXVI.

    How when we have got the better of the passion of gluttony we must take
    pains to gain all the other virtues.

   WHEREFORE while we are practising fasting and abstinence, we must be
   careful when we have got the better of the passion of gluttony never to
   allow our mind to remain empty of the virtues of which we stand in
   need; but we should the more earnestly fill the inmost recesses of our
   heart with them for fear lest the spirit of concupiscence should return
   and find us empty and void of them, and should not be content to secure
   an entrance there for himself alone, but should bring in with him into
   our heart this sevenfold incentive of sins and make our last state
   worse than the first. For the soul which boasts that it has renounced
   this world with the eight faults that hold sway over it, will
   afterwards be fouler and more unclean and visited with severer
   punishments, than it was when formerly it was at home in the world,
   when it had taken upon itself neither the rules nor the name of monk.
   For these seven spirits are said to be worse than the first which went
   forth, for this reason; because the love of good things, i.e., gluttony
   would not be in itself harmful, were it not that it opened the door to
   other passions; viz, to fornication, covetousness, anger, dejection,
   and pride, which are clearly hurtful in themselves to the soul, and
   domineering over it. And therefore a man will never be able to gain
   perfect purity, if he hopes to secure it by means of abstinence alone,
   i.e., bodily fasting, unless he knows that he ought to practise it for
   this reason that when the flesh is brought low by means of fasting, he
   may with greater ease enter the lists against other faults, as the
   flesh has not been habituated to gluttony and surfeiting.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVII.

    That our battles are not fought with our faults in the same order as that in
    which they stand in the list.

   BUT you must know that our battles are not all fought in the same
   order, because, as we mentioned that the attacks are not always made on
   us in the same way, each one of us ought also to begin the battle with
   due regard to the character of the attack which is especially made on
   him so that one man will have to fight his first battle against the
   fault which stands third on the list, another against that which is
   fourth or fifth. And in proportion as faults hold sway over us, and the
   character of their attack may demand, so we too ought to regulate the
   order of our conflict, in such a way that the happy result of a victory
   and triumph succeeding may insure our attainment of purity of heart and
   complete perfection.

   Thus far did Abbot Serapion discourse to us of the nature of the eight
   principal faults, and so clearly did he expound the different sorts of
   passions which are latent within us--the origin and connexion of which,
   though we were daily tormented by them, we could never before
   thoroughly understand and perceive--that we seemed almost to see them
   spread out before our eyes as in a mirror.

                                 CONFERENCE 6.

CONFERENCE OF ABBOT THEODORE. [280]

ON THE DEATH OF THE SAINTS.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Description of the wilderness, and the question about the death of the
    saints.

   IN the district of Palestine near the village of Tekoa which had the
   honour of producing the prophet Amos, [281] there is a vast desert
   which stretches far and wide as far as Arabia and the dead sea, into
   which the streams of Jordan enter and are lost, and where are the ashes
   of Sodom. In this district there lived for a long while monks of the
   most perfect life and holiness, who were suddenly destroyed by an
   incursion of Saracen robbers: [282] whose bodies we knew were seized
   upon with the greatest veneration [283] both by the Bishops of the
   neighbourhood and by the whole populace of Arabia, and deposited among
   the relics of the martyrs, so that swarms of people from two towns met,
   and made terrible war upon each other, and in their struggle actually
   came to blows for the possession of the holy spoil, while they strove
   among themselves with pious zeal as to which of them had the better
   claim to bury them and keep their relics--the one party boasting of
   their vicinity to the place of their abode, the other of the fact that
   they were near the place of their birth. But we were upset by this and
   being disturbed either on our own account or on account of some of the
   brethren who were in no small degree scandalized at it, inquired why
   men of such illustrious merits and of so great virtues should be thus
   slain by robbers, and why the Lord permitted such a crime to be
   committed against his servants, so as to give up into the hands of
   wicked men those who were the admiration of everybody: and so in our
   grief we came to the holy Theodore, a man who excelled in practical
   common sense. For he was living in Cellæ, [284] a place that lies
   between Nitria and Scete, and is five miles distant from the
   monasteries of Nitria, and cut off by eighty intervening miles of
   desert from the wilderness of Scete where we were living. And when we
   had made our complaint to him about the death of the men mentioned
   above, and expressed our surprise at the great patience of God, because
   He suffered men of such worth to be killed in this way, so that those
   who ought to be able by the weight of their sanctity to deliver others
   from trials of this kind, could not save themselves from the hands of
   wicked men (and asked) why it was that God allowed so great a crime to
   be committed against his servants, then the blessed Theodore replied.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [281] Cf. Amos 1:1.

   [282] Saraceni (Sarakhnoi): a name given by the classical geographers
   to a tribe of Arabia Felix, famous for its predatory propensities.
   Jerome speaks of the "mons et desertum Saracenorum quod vocatur Pharan"
   (Liber de situ nominibus sub voce Choreb) and elsewhere describes their
   predatory habits (Liber Heb.Quaest. in Genesim) "Saracenos
   vagos . . . qui universas gentes . . . incursant." By the seventh
   century the name had become a merely general name equivalent to Arab,
   and was accordingly adopted and applied indifferently to all the
   followers of Mohammed by the writers of the middle ages (cf. the
   Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, sub voce).

   [283] There is no mention of these martyrs in the so-called
   Martyrologium Hieronymianum, but they are commemorated on May 28, in
   the Roman Martyrology.

   [284] Cellæ, which was, according to the passage before us, between the
   deserts of Scete and Nitria, apparently derived its name from the cells
   of the monks who congregated there. This at least is the explanation of
   the name given by Sozomen (H. E. VI. xxxi.) who speaks of a region
   called Kellia, throughout which numerous little dwellings (oikhmata)
   are dispersed, whence it obtains its name. Sozomen also speaks (c.
   xxix.) of Macarius as priest of Cellæ, a fact which gives some ground
   for conjecturing that Cellæ may be identified with Dair Abu Makâr, one
   of the four monasteries still existing in the deserts of Nitria and
   Scete, probably founded by the saint whose name it bears (Macarius).
   See A. J. Butler's "Coptic Churches of Egypt," vol. i. c. vii.

  CHAPTER II.

    Abbot Theodore's answer to the question proposed to him.

   THIS question often exercises the minds of those who have not much
   faith or knowledge, and imagine that the prizes and rewards of the
   saints (which are not given in this world, but laid up for the future)
   are bestowed in the short space of this mortal life. But we whose hope
   in Christ is not only in this life, for fear lest, as the Apostle says,
   we should be "of all men most miserable" [285] (because as we receive
   none of the promises in this world we should for our unbelief lose them
   also in that to come) ought not wrongly to follow their ideas, lest
   through ignorance of the true real explanation, we should hesitate and
   tremble and fail in temptation, if we find ourselves given up to such
   men; and should ascribe to God injustice or carelessness about the
   affairs of mankind--a thing which it is almost a sin to
   mention--because He does not protect in their temptations men who are
   living an upright and holy life, nor requite good men with good things
   and evil men with evil things in this world; and so we should deserve
   to fall under the condemnation of those whom the prophet Zephaniah
   rebukes, saying "who say in their hearts the Lord will not do good, nor
   will He do evil:" [286] or at least be found among those of whom we are
   told that they blaspheme God with such complaints as this: "Every one
   that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such please Him:
   for surely where is the God of judgment?" [287] Adding further that
   blasphemy which is described in the same way in what follows: "He
   laboureth in vain that serveth God, and what profit is it that we have
   kept His ordinances, and walked sorrowful before the Lord? Wherefore
   now we call the proud happy, for they that work wickedness are
   enriched, and they have tempted God, and are preserved." [288]
   Wherefore that we may avoid this ignorance which is the root and cause
   of this most deadly error, we ought in the first place to know what is
   really good, and what is bad, and so finally if we grasp the true
   scriptural meaning of these words, and not the false popular one, we
   shall escape being deceived by the errors of unbelievers.

  CHAPTER III.

    Of the three kinds of things there are in the world; viz., good, bad, and
    indifferent.

   ALTOGETHER there are three kinds of things in the world; viz., good,
   bad, and indifferent. And so we ought to know what is properly good,
   and what is bad, and what is indifferent, that our faith may be
   supported by true knowledge and stand firm in all temptations. We must
   then believe that in things which are merely human there is no real
   good except virtue of soul alone, which leads us with unfeigned faith
   to things divine, and makes us constantly adhere to that unchanging
   good. And on the other hand we ought not to call anything bad, except
   sin alone, which separates us from the good God, and unites us to the
   evil devil. But those things are indifferent which can be appropriated
   to either side according to the fancy or wish of their owner, as for
   instance riches, power, honour, bodily strength, good health, beauty,
   life itself, and death, poverty, bodily infirmities, injuries, and
   other things of the same sort, which can contribute either to good or
   to evil as the character and fancy of their owner directs. For riches
   are often serviceable for our good, as the Apostle says, who charges
   "the rich of this world to be ready to give, to distribute to the
   needy, to lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the
   time to come, that" by this means "they may lay hold on the true life."
   [289] And according to the gospel they are a good thing for those who
   "make to themselves friends of the unrighteous mammon." [290] And
   again, they can be drawn in the direction of what is bad when they are
   amassed only for the sake of hoarding them or for a life of luxury, and
   are not employed to meet the wants of the poor. And that power also and
   honour and bodily strength and good health are indifferent and
   available for either (good or bad) can easily be shown from the fact
   that many of the Old Testament saints enjoyed all these things and were
   in positions of great wealth and the highest honour, and blessed with
   bodily strength, and yet are known to have been most acceptable to God.
   And on the contrary those who have wrongfully abused these things and
   perverted them for their own purposes are not without good reason
   punished or destroyed, as the Book of Kings shows us has often
   happened. And that even life and death are in themselves indifferent
   the birth of S. John and of Judas proves. For in the case of the one
   his life was so profitable to himself that we are told that his birth
   brought joy to others also, as we read "And many shall rejoice at his
   birth;" [291] but of the life of the other it is said: "It were good
   for that man if he had never been born." [292] Further it is said of
   the death of John and of all saints "Right dear in the sight of the
   Lord is the death of His saints:" [293] but of that of Judas and men
   like him "The death of the wicked is very evil." [294] And how useful
   bodily sickness sometimes may be the blessing on Lazarus, the beggar
   who was full of sores, shows us. For Scripture makes mention of no
   other good qualities or deserts of his, but it was for this fact alone;
   viz., that he endured want and bodily sickness with the utmost
   patience, that he was deemed worthy of the blessed lot of a place in
   Abraham's bosom. [295] And with regard to want and persecution and
   injuries which everybody thinks to be bad, how useful and necessary
   they are is clearly proved by this fact; viz., that the saints not only
   never tried to avoid them, but actually either sought them with all
   their powers or bravely endured them, and thus became the friends of
   God, and obtained the reward of eternal life, as the blessed Apostle
   chants: "For which cause I delight myself in my infirmities, in
   reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ.
   For when I am weak, then I am strong, for power is made perfect in
   infirmity." [296] And therefore those who are exalted with the greatest
   riches and honours and powers of this world, should not be deemed to
   have secured their chief good out of them (for this is shown to consist
   only in virtue) but only something indifferent, because just as to good
   men who use them well and properly they will be found to be useful and
   convenient (for they afford them opportunities for good works and
   fruits which shall endure to eternal life), so to those who wrongfully
   abuse their wealth, they are useless and out of place, and furnish
   occasions of sin and death.

  CHAPTER IV.

    How evil cannot be forced on any one by another against his will.

   PRESERVING then these distinctions clear and fixed, and knowing that
   there is nothing good except virtue alone, and nothing bad except sin
   alone and separation from God, let us now carefully consider whether
   God ever allows evil to be forced on his saints either by Himself or by
   some one else. And you will certainly find that this never happens. For
   another can never possibly force the evil of sin upon anyone, who does
   not consent and who resists, but only on one who admits it into himself
   through sloth and the corrupt desire of his heart. Finally, when the
   devil having exhausted all his wicked devices had tried to force upon
   the blessed Job this evil of sin, and had not only stripped him of all
   his worldly goods, but also after that terrible and utterly unlooked
   for calamity of bereavement through the death of his seven children,
   had heaped upon him dreadful wounds and intolerable tortures from the
   crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he tried in vain to fasten
   on him the stain of sin, because he remained steadfast through it all,
   never brought himself to consent to blasphemy.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    An objection, how God Himself can be said to create evil.

   GERMANUS: We often read in holy Scripture that God has created evil or
   brought it upon men, as is this passage: "There is none beside Me. I am
   the Lord, and there is none else: I form the light and create darkness,
   I make peace, and create evil." [297] And again: "Shall there be evil
   in a city which the Lord hath not done?" [298]

   [298] Amos 3:6.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    The answer to the question proposed.

   THEODORE: Sometimes holy Scripture is wont by an improper use of terms
   to use "evils" for "affliction;" not that these are properly and in
   their nature evils, but because they are imagined to be evils by those
   on whom they are brought for their good. For when divine judgment is
   reasoning with men it must speak with the language and feelings of men.
   For when a doctor for the sake of health with good reason either cuts
   or cauterizes those who are suffering from the inflammation of ulcers,
   it is considered an evil by those who have to bear it. Nor are the spur
   and the whip pleasant to a restive horse. Moreover all chastisement
   seems at the moment to be a bitter thing to those who are chastised, as
   the Apostle says: "Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth
   not to bring with it joy but sorrow; but afterwards it will yield to
   them that are exercised by it most peaceable fruits of righteousness,"
   and "whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom
   He receiveth: for what son is there whom the father doth not correct?"
   [299] And so evils are sometimes wont to stand for afflictions, as
   where we read: "And God repented of the evil which He had said that He
   would do to them and He did it not." [300] And again: "For Thou, Lord,
   are gracious and merciful, patient and very merciful and ready to
   repent of the evil," [301] i.e., of the sufferings and losses which
   Thou art forced to bring upon us as the reward of our sins. And another
   prophet, knowing that these are profitable to some men, and certainly
   not through any jealousy of their safety, but with an eye to their
   good, prays thus: "Add evils to them, O Lord, add evils to the haughty
   ones of the earth;" [302] and the Lord Himself says "Lo, I will bring
   evils upon them," [303] i.e., sorrows, and losses, with which they
   shall for the present be chastened for their soul's health, and so
   shall be at length driven to return and hasten back to Me whom in their
   prosperity they scorned. And so that these are originally evil we
   cannot possibly assert: for to many they conduce to their good and
   offer the occasions of eternal bliss, and therefore (to return to the
   question raised) all those things, which are thought to be brought upon
   us as evils by our enemies or by any other people, should not be
   counted as evils, but as things indifferent. For in the end they will
   not be what he thinks, who brought them upon us in his rage and fury,
   but what he makes them who endures them. And so when death has been
   brought upon a saint, we ought not to think that an evil has happened
   to him but a thing indifferent; which is an evil to a wicked man, while
   to the good it is rest and freedom from evils. "For death is rest to a
   man whose way is hidden." [304] And so a good man does not suffer any
   loss from it, because he suffers nothing strange, but by the crime of
   an enemy he only receives (and not without the reward of eternal life)
   that which would have happened to him in the course of nature, and pays
   the debt of man's death, which must be paid by an inevitable law, with
   the interest of a most fruitful passion, and the recompense of a great
   reward.

  CHAPTER VII.

    A question whether the man who causes the death of a good man is guilty, if
    the good man is the gainer by his death.

   GERMANUS: Well then, if a good man does not only suffer no evil by
   being killed, but actually gains a reward from his suffering, how can
   we accuse the man who has done him no harm but good by killing him?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    The answer to the foregoing question.

   THEODORE: We are talking about the actual qualities of things good and
   bad, and what we call indifferent; and not about the characters of the
   men who do these things. Nor ought any bad or wicked man to go
   unpunished because his evil deed was not able to do harm to a good man.
   For the endurance and goodness of a righteous man are of no profit to
   the man who is the cause of his death or suffering, but only to him who
   patiently endures what is inflicted on him. And so the one is justly
   punished for savage cruelty, because he meant to injure him, while the
   other nevertheless suffers no evil, because in the goodness of his
   heart he patiently endures his temptation and sufferings, and so causes
   all those things, which were inflicted upon him with evil intent, to
   turn out to his advantage, and to conduce to the bliss of eternal life.

  CHAPTER IX.

    The case of Job who was tempted by the devil; and of the Lord who was
    betrayed by Judas: and how prosperity as well as adversity is advantageous
    to a good man.

   FOR the patience of Job did not bring any gain to the devil, through
   making him a better man by his temptations, but only to Job himself who
   endured them bravely; nor was Judas granted freedom from eternal
   punishment, because his act of betrayal contributed to the salvation of
   mankind. For we must not regard the result of the deed, but the purpose
   of the doer. Wherefore we should always cling to this assertion; viz.,
   that evil cannot be brought upon a man by another, unless a man has
   admitted it by his sloth or feebleness of heart: as the blessed Apostle
   confirms this opinion of ours in a verse of Scripture: "But we know
   that all things work together for good to them that love God." [305]
   But by saying "All things work together for good," he includes
   everything alike, not only things fortunate, but also those which seem
   to be misfortunes: through which the Apostle tells us in another place
   that he himself has passed, when he says: "By the armour of
   righteousness on the right hand and on the left," i.e., "Through honour
   and dishonour, through evil report and good report, as deceivers and
   yet true, as sorrowful but always rejoicing, as needy and yet enriching
   many:" [306] All those things then which are considered fortunate, and
   are called those "on the right hand," which the holy Apostle designates
   by the terms honour and good report; and those too which are counted
   misfortunes, which he clearly means by dishonour and evil report, and
   which he describes as "on the left hand," become to the perfect man
   "the armour of righteousness," if when they are brought upon him, he
   bears them bravely: because, as he fights with these, and uses those
   very weapons with which he seems to be attacked, and is protected by
   them as by bow and sword and stout shield against those who bring these
   things upon him, he secures the advantage of his patience and goodness,
   and obtains a grand triumph of steadfastness by means of those very
   weapons of his enemies which are hurled against him to kill him; and if
   only he is not elated by success or cast down by failure, but ever
   marches straightforward on the king's highway, and does not swerve from
   that state of tranquillity as it were to the right hand, when joy
   overcomes him, nor let himself be driven so to speak to the left hand,
   when misfortunes overwhelm him, and sorrow holds sway. For "Much peace
   have they that love Thy law, and to them there is no stumbling block."
   [307] But of those who shift about according to the character and
   changes of the several chances which happen to them, we read: "But a
   fool will change like the moon." [308] For just as it is said of men
   who are perfect and wise: "To them that love God all things work
   together for good," [309] so of those who are weak and foolish it is
   declared that "everything is against a foolish man," [310] for he gets
   no profit out of prosperity, nor does adversity make him any better.
   For it requires as much goodness to bear sorrows bravely, as to be
   moderate in prosperity: and it is quite certain that one who fails in
   one of these, will not bear up under the other. But a man can be more
   easily overcome by prosperity than by misfortunes: for these sometimes
   restrain men against their will and make them humble and through most
   salutary sorrow cause them to sin less, and make them better: while
   prosperity puffs up the mind with soothing but most pernicious
   flatteries and when men are secure in the prospect of their happiness
   dashes them to the ground with a still greater destruction.

  CHAPTER X.

    Of the excellence of the perfect man who is figuratively spoken of as
    ambidextrous.

   THOSE are they then who are figurately spoken of in holy Scripture as
   amfoterodexion, i.e., ambidextrous, as Ehud is described in the book of
   Judges "who used either hand as the right [311] hand." And this power
   we also can spiritually acquire, if by making a right and proper use of
   those things which are fortunate, and which seem to be "on the right
   hand," as well as of those which are unfortunate and as we call it "on
   the left hand," we make them both belong to the right side, so that
   whatever turns up proves in our case, to use the words of the Apostle,
   "the armour of righteousness." For we see that the inner man consists
   of two parts, and if I may be allowed the expression, two hands, nor
   can any of the saints do without that which we call the left hand: but
   by means of it the perfection of virtue is shown, where a man by
   skilful use can turn both hands into right hands. And in order to make
   our meaning clearer, the saint has for his right hand his spiritual
   achievements, in which he is found when with fervent spirit he gets the
   better of his desires and passions, when he is free from all attacks of
   the devil, and without any effort or difficulty rejects and cuts off
   all carnal sins, when he is exalted above the earth and regards all
   things present and earthly as light smoke or vain shadows, and scorns
   them as what is about to vanish away, when with an overflowing heart he
   not only longs most intensely for the future but actually sees it the
   more clearly, when he is more effectually fed on spiritual
   contemplations, when he sees heavenly mysteries more brightly laid open
   to him, when he pours forth his prayers to God with greater purity and
   readiness, when he is so inflamed with fervent of spirit as to pass
   with the utmost readiness of soul to things invisible and eternal, so
   as scarcely to believe that he any longer remains in the flesh. He has
   also a left hand, when he is entangled in the toils of temptation, when
   he is inflamed with the heat of desire for carnal lusts, when he is set
   on fire by emotion towards rage and anger, when he is overcome by being
   puffed up with pride or vainglory, when he is oppressed by a sorrow
   that worketh death, when he is shaken to pieces by the contrivances and
   attacks of accidie, and when he has lost all spiritual warmth, and
   grows indifferent with a sort of lukewarmness and unreasonable grief so
   that not only is he forsaken by good and kindling thoughts, but
   actually Psalms, prayer, reading, and retirement in his cell all pall
   upon him, and all virtuous exercises seem by an intolerable and
   horrible loathing to have lost their savour. And when a monk is
   troubled in this way, then he knows that he is attacked "on the left
   hand." Anyone therefore who is not at all puffed up through the aid of
   vainglory by any of those things on the right hand which we have
   mentioned, and who struggles manfully against those on the left hand,
   and does not yield to despair and give in, but rather on the other hand
   seizes the armour of patience to practise himself in virtue--this man
   can use both hands as right hands, and in each action he proves
   triumphant and carries off the prize of victory from that condition on
   the left hand as well as that on the right. Such, we read, was the
   reward which the blessed Job obtained who was certainly crowned (for a
   victory) on the right hand, when he was the father of seven sons and
   walked as a rich and wealthy man, and yet offered daily sacrifices to
   the Lord for their purification, in his anxiety that they might prove
   acceptable and dear to God rather than to himself, when his gates stood
   open to every stranger, when he was "feet to lame and eyes to blind,"
   [312] when the shoulders of the suffering were kept warm by the wool of
   his sheep, when he was a father to orphans and a husband to widows,
   when he did not even in his heart rejoice at the fall of his enemy. And
   again it was the same man who with still greater virtue triumphed over
   adversity on the left hand, when deprived in one moment of his seven
   sons he was not as a father overcome with bitter grief but as a true
   servant of God rejoiced in the will of his Creator. When instead of
   being a wealthy man he became poor, naked instead of rich, pining away
   instead of strong, despised and contemptible instead of famous and
   honourable, and yet preserved his fortitude of mind unshaken, when,
   lastly, bereft of all his wealth and substance he took up his abode on
   the dunghill, and like some stern executioner of his own body scraped
   with a potsherd the matter that broke out, and plunging his fingers
   deep into his wounds dragged out on every side masses of worms from his
   limbs. And in all this he never fell into despair and blasphemy, nor
   murmured at all against his Creator. Moreover also so little was he
   overcome by such a weight of bitter temptations that the cloak which
   out of all his former property remained to cover his body, and which
   alone could be saved from destruction by the devil because he was
   clothed with it, he rent and cast off, and covered with it his
   nakedness which he voluntarily endured, which the terrible robber had
   brought upon him. The hair of his head too, which was the only thing
   left untouched out of all the remains of his former glory, he shaved
   and cast to his tormentor, and cutting off even that which his savage
   foe had left to him he exulted over him and mocked him with that
   celestial cry of his: "If we have received good at the hand of the
   Lord, should we not also receive evil? Naked came I out of my mother's
   womb, and naked shall I return thither. The Lord gave and the Lord hath
   taken away; as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done; blessed be the
   name of the Lord." [313] I should also with good reason call Joseph
   ambidextrous, as in prosperity he was very dear to his father,
   affectionate to his brethren, acceptable to God; and in adversity was
   chaste, and faithful to the Lord, in prison most kind to the prisoners,
   forgetful of wrongs, generous to his enemies; and to his brethren who
   were envious of him and as far as lay in their powers, his murderers,
   he proved not only affectionate but actually munificent. These men then
   and those who are like them are rightly termed amfoterodexion, i.e.,
   ambidextrous. For they can use either hand as the right hand, and
   passing through those things which the Apostle enumerates can fairly
   say: "Through the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the
   left, through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report
   etc." And of this right and left hand Solomon speaks as follows in the
   Song of songs, in the person of the bride: "His left hand is under my
   head, and his right hand shall embrace me." [314] And while this
   passage shows that both are useful, yet it puts one under the head,
   because misfortunes ought to be subject to the control of the heart,
   since they are only useful for this; viz., to train us for a time and
   discipline us for our salvation and make us perfect in te matter of
   patience. But the right hand she hopes will ever cling to her to
   cherish her and hold her fast in the blessed embrace of the Bridegroom,
   and unite her to him indissolubly. We shall then be ambidextrous, when
   neither abundance nor want affects us, and when the former does not
   entice us to the luxury of a dangerous carelessness, while the latter
   does not draw us to despair, and complaining; but when, giving thanks
   to God in either case alike, we gain one and the same advantage out of
   good and bad fortune. And such that truly ambidextrous man, the teacher
   of the Gentiles, testifies that he himself was, when he says: "For I
   have learnt in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith. I know
   both how to be brought low and I know how to abound: everywhere and in
   all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to
   abound and to suffer need. I can do all things in Him which
   strengtheneth me." [315]

  CHAPTER XI.

    Of the two kinds of trials, which come upon us in a threefold way.

   WELL then, though we say that trial is twofold, i.e., in prosperity and
   in adversity, yet you must know that all men are tried in three
   different ways. Often for their probation, sometimes for their
   improvement, and m some cases because their sins deserve it. For their
   probation indeed, as we read that the blessed Abraham and Job and many
   of the saints endured countless tribulations; or this which is said to
   the people in Deuteronomy by Moses: "And thou shalt remember all the
   way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years
   through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the
   things that were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst
   keep His Commandments or no:" [316] and this which we find in the
   Psalms: "I proved thee at the waters of strife." [317] To Job also:
   "Thinkest thou that I have spoken for any other cause than that thou
   mightest be seen to be righteous?" [318] But for improvement, when God
   chastens his righteous ones for some small and venial sins, or to raise
   them to a higher state of purity, and delivers them over to various
   trials, that He may purge away all their unclean thoughts, and, to use
   the prophet's word, the "dross," which he sees to have collected in
   their secret parts, and may thus transmit them like pure gold, to the
   judgment to come, as He allows nothing to remain in them for the fire
   of judgment to discover when hereafter it searches them with penal
   torments according to this saying: "Many are the tribulations of the
   righteous." [319] And: "My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord,
   neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by Him. For whom the
   Lord loveth He chastiseth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.
   For what son is there whom the father doth not correct? But if ye are
   without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards,
   and not sons." [320] And in the Apocalypse: "Those whom I love, I
   reprove and chasten." [321] To whom under the figure of Jerusalem the
   following words are spoken by Jeremiah, in the person of God: "For I
   will utterly consume all the nations among which I scattered thee: but
   I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment,
   that thou mayest not seem to thyself innocent." [322] And for this
   life-giving cleansing David prays when he says: "Prove me, O Lord, and
   try me; turn my reins and my heart." [323] Isaiah also, well knowing
   the value of this trial, says "O Lord, correct us but with judgment:
   not in Thine anger." [324] And again: "I will give thanks to thee, O
   Lord, for thou wast angry with me: Thy wrath is turned away, and Thou
   hast comforted me." [325] But as a punishment for sins, the blows of
   trial are inflicted, as where the Lord threatens that He will send
   plagues upon the people of Israel: "I will send the teeth of beasts
   upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground:"
   [326] and "In vain have I struck your children: they have not received
   correction." [327] In the Psalms also: "Many are the scourges of the
   sinners:" [328] and in the gospel: "Behold thou art made whole: now sin
   no more, lest a worse thing happen unto thee." [329] We find, it is
   true, a fourth way also in which we know on the authority of Scripture
   that some sufferings are brought upon us simply for the manifestation
   of the glory of God and His works, according to these words of the
   gospel: "Neither did this man sin nor his parents, but that the works
   of God might be manifested in him:" [330] and again: "This sickness is
   not unto death, but for the glory of God that the Son of God may be
   glorified by it." [331] There are also other sorts of vengeance, with
   which some who have overpassed the bounds of wickedness are smitten in
   this life, as we read that Dathan and Abiram or Korah were punished, or
   above all, those of whom the Apostle speaks: "Wherefore God gave them
   up to vile passions and a reprobate mind:" [332] and this must be
   counted worse than all other punishments. For of these the Psalmist
   says: "They are not in the labours of men; neither shall they be
   scourged like other men." [333] For they are not worthy of being healed
   by the visitation of the Lord which gives life, and by plagues in this
   world, as "in despair they have given themselves over to
   lasciviousness, unto the working of all error unto uncleanness," [334]
   and as by hardening their hearts, and by growing accustomed and used to
   sin they have got beyond cleansing in this brief life and punishment in
   the present world: men, who are thus reproved by the holy word of the
   prophet: "I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
   and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you
   returned not to Me, saith the Lord," [335] and Jeremiah: "I have killed
   and destroyed thy people, and yet they are not returned from their
   ways." [336] And again: "Thou hast smitten them and they have not
   grieved: Thou hast bruised them and they refused to receive correction:
   they have made their faces harder than the rock, they have refused to
   return." [337] And the prophet seeing that all the remedies of this
   life will have been applied in vain for their healing, and already as
   it were despairing of their life, declares: "The bellows have failed in
   the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are
   not consumed. Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected
   them." [338] And the Lord thus laments that to no purpose has He
   applied this salutary cleansing by fire to those who are hardened in
   their sins, in the person of Jerusalem crusted all over with the rust
   of her sins, when He says: "set it empty upon burning coals, that it
   may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted; and let the filth of
   it be melted in the midst thereof. Great pains have been taken, and the
   great rust thereof is not gone out, no not even by fire. Thy
   uncleanness is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou
   art not cleansed from thy filthiness." [339] Wherefore like a skilful
   physician, who has tried all saving cures, and sees there is no remedy
   left which can be applied to their disease, the Lord is in a manner
   overcome by their iniquities and is obliged to desist from that kindly
   chastisement of His, and so denounces them saying: "I will no longer be
   angry with thee, and thy jealousy has departed from thee." [340] But of
   others, whose heart has not grown hard by continuance in sin, and who
   do not stand in need of that most severe and (if I may so call it)
   caustic remedy, but for whose salvation the instruction of the
   life-giving word is sufficient--of them it is said: "I will improve
   them by hearing of their suffering." [341] We are well aware that there
   are other reasons also of the punishment and vengeance which is
   inflicted on those who have sinned grievously--not to expiate their
   crimes, nor wipe out the deserts of their sins, but that the living may
   be put in fear and amend their lives. And these we plainly see were
   inflicted on Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and Baasha the son of Ahiah,
   and Ahab and Jezebel, when the Divine reproof thus declares: "Behold, I
   will bring evil upon thee, and will cut down thy posterity, and will
   kill of Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and the last in
   Israel. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of
   Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahiah: for that which
   thou hast done to provoke Me to anger, and for making Israel to sin.
   The dogs also shall eat Jezebel in the field of Jezreel. If Ahab die in
   the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field the birds
   of the air shall eat him," [342] and this which is threatened as the
   greatest threat of all: "Thy dead body shall not be brought to the
   sepulchre of thy fathers." [343] It was not that this short and
   momentary punishment would suffice to purge away the blasphemous
   inventions of him who first made the golden calves and led to the
   lasting sin of the people, and their wicked separation from the
   Lord,--or the countless and disgraceful profanities of those others,
   but it was that by their example the fear of those punishments which
   they dreaded might fall on others also, who, as they thought little of
   the future or even disbelieved in it altogether, would only be moved by
   consideration of things present; and that owing to this proof of His
   severity they might acknowledge that there is no lack of care for the
   affairs of men, and for their daily doings, in the majesty of God on
   high, and so through that which they greatly feared might the more
   clearly see in God the rewarder of all their deeds. We find, it is
   true, that even for lighter faults some men have received the same
   sentence of death in this world, as that with which those men were
   punished who, as we said before, were the authors of a blasphemous
   falling away: as happened in the case of the man who gathered sticks on
   the Sabbath, [344] and in that of Ananias and Sapphira, who through the
   sin of unbelief kept back some portion of their goods: not that the
   guilt of their sins was equal, but because they were the first found
   out in a new kind of transgression, and so it was right that as they
   had given to others an example of sin, so also they should give them an
   example of punishment and of fear, that anyone, who should attempt to
   copy them, might know that (even if his punishment were postponed in
   this life) he would be punished in the same way that they were at the
   trial of the judgment hereafter. And, since in our desire to run
   through the different kinds of trials and punishments we seem to have
   wandered somewhat from our subject, on which we were saying that the
   perfect man will always remain steadfast in either kind of trial, now
   let us return to it once more.

  CHAPTER XII.

    How the upright man ought to be like a stamp not of wax but of hard steel.

   AND so the mind of the upright man ought not to be like wax or any
   other soft material which always yields to the shape of what presses on
   it, and is stamped with its form and impress and keeps it until it
   takes another shape by having another seal stamped upon it; and so it
   results that it never retains its own form but is turned and twisted
   about to correspond to whatever is pressed upon it. But he should
   rather be like some stamp of hard steel, that the mind may always keep
   its proper form and shape inviolate, and may stamp and imprint on
   everything which occurs to it the marks of its own condition, while
   upon it itself nothing that happens can leave any mark.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    A question whether the mind can constantly continue in one and the same
    condition.

   GERMANUS: But can our mind constantly preserve its condition unaltered,
   and always continue in the same state?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

    The answer to the point raised by the questioner.

   THEODORE: It is needful that one must either, as the Apostle says, "be
   renewed in the spirit of the mind," [345] and daily advance by
   "pressing forward to those things which are before," [346] or, if one
   neglects to do this, the sure result will be to go back, and become
   worse and worse. And therefore the mind cannot possibly remain in one
   and the same state. Just as when a man, by pulling hard, is trying to
   force a boat against the stream of a strong current he must either stem
   the rush of the torrent by the force of his arms, and so mount to what
   is higher up, or letting his hands slacken be whirled headlong down
   stream. Wherefore it will be a clear proof of our failure if we find
   that we have gained nothing more, nor should we doubt but that we have
   altogether gone back, whenever we find that we have not advanced
   upwards, because, as I said, the mind of man cannot possibly continue
   in the same condition, nor so long as he is in the flesh will any of
   the saints ever reach the height of all virtues, so that they continue
   unalterable. For something must either be added to them or taken away
   from them, and in no creature can there be such perfection, as not to
   be subject to the feeling of change; as we read in the book of Job:
   "What is man that he should be without spot, and he that is born of a
   woman that he should appear just? Behold among His saints none is
   unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in His sight." [347] For we
   confess that God only is unchangeable, who alone is thus addressed by
   the prayer of the holy prophet "But Thou art the same," [348] and who
   says of Himself "I am God, and I change not," [349] because He alone is
   by nature always good, always full and perfect, and one to whom nothing
   can ever be added, or from whom nothing can be taken away. And so we
   ought always with incessant care and anxiety to give ourselves up to
   the acquirement of virtue, and constantly to occupy ourselves with the
   practice of it, lest, if we cease to go forward, the result should
   immediately be a going back. For, as we said, the mind cannot continue
   in one and the same condition, I mean without receiving addition to or
   diminution of its good qualities. For to fail to gain new ones, is to
   lose them, because when the desire of making progress ceases, there the
   danger of going back is present.

  CHAPTER XV.

    How one loses by going away from one's cell.

   AND so we ought always to remain shut up in our cell. For whenever a
   man has strayed from it and returns fresh to it and begins again to
   live there he will be upset and disturbed. For if he has let it go he
   cannot without difficulty and pains recover that fixed purpose of mind,
   which he had gained when he remained in his cell; and as through this
   he has gone back, he will not think anything of the advance which he
   has missed, and which he would have secured if he had not allowed
   himself to leave his cell, but he will rather congratulate himself if
   he finds that he has regained that condition from which he fell away.
   For just as time once lost and gone cannot any more be recovered, so
   neither can those advantages which have been missed be restored: for
   whatever earnest purpose of the mind there may be afterwards, it will
   be the profit of the day then present, and the gain that belongs to the
   time that then is, and will not make up for the gain that has been once
   for all lost.

  CHAPTER XVI.

    How even celestial powers above are capable of change.

   BUT that even the powers above are, as we said, subject to change is
   shown by those who fell from their ranks through the fault of a corrupt
   will. Wherefore we ought not to think that the nature of those is
   unchangeable, who remain in the blessed condition in which they were
   created, simply because they were not in like manner led astray to
   choose the worse part. For it is one thing to have a nature incapable
   of change, and another thing for a man through the efforts of his
   virtue, and by guarding what is good through the grace of the
   unchangeable God, to be kept from change. For everything that is
   secured or preserved by care, can also be lost by carelessness. And so
   we read: "Call no man blessed before his death," [350] because so long
   as a man is still engaged in the struggle, and if I may use the
   expression, still wrestling--even though he generally conquers and
   carries off many prizes of victory,--yet he can never be free from
   fear, and from the suspicion of an uncertain issue. And therefore God
   alone is called unchangeable and good, as His goodness is not the
   result of effort, but a natural possession, and so He cannot be
   anything but good. No virtue then can be acquired by man without the
   possibility of change, but in order that when it once exists it may be
   continually preserved, it must be watched over with the same care and
   diligence with which it was acquired.

  CHAPTER XVII.

    That no one is dashed to the ground by a sudden fall.

   BUT we must not imagine that anyone slips and comes to grief by a
   sudden fall, but that he falls by a hopeless collapse either from being
   deceived by beginning his training badly, or from the good qualities of
   his soul failing through a long course of carelessness of mind, and so
   his faults gaining ground upon him little by little. For "loss goeth
   before destruction, and an evil thought before a fall," [351] just as
   no house ever fails to the ground by a sudden collapse, but only when
   there is some flaw of long standing in the foundation, or when by long
   continued neglect of its inmates, what was at first only a little drip
   finds its way through, and so the protecting walls are by degrees
   ruined, and in consequence of long standing neglect the gap becomes
   larger, and break away, and in time the drenching storm and rain pours
   in like a river: for "by slothfulness a building is cast down, and
   through the weakness of hands the house shall drop through." [352] And
   that the same thing happens spiritually to the soul the same Solomon
   thus tells us in other words, when he says: "water dripping drives a
   man out of the house on a stormy day." [353] Elegantly then does he
   compare carelessness of mind to a roof, and to tiles that have not been
   looked after, through which in the first instance only very slight
   drippings (so to speak) of the passions make their way to the soul: but
   if these are not heeded, as being but small and trifling, then the
   beams of virtues will decay and be carried away by a great tempest of
   sins, through which "on a stormy day," i.e., in the time of temptation,
   the devil's attack will assail us, and the soul will be driven forth
   from the abode of virtue, in which, as long as it preserved all
   watchful diligence, it had remained as in a house that belonged to it.

   And so when we had heard this, we were so immensely delighted with our
   spiritual repast, that the mental pleasure with which we were filled by
   this conference outweighed the sorrow which we had experienced before
   from the death of the saints. For not only were we instructed in things
   about which we had been puzzled, but we also learnt from the raising of
   that question some things, which our understanding had been too small
   for us to ask about.

FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT SERENUS.

ON INCONSTANCY OF MIND, AND SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    On the chastity of Abbot Serenus. [354]

   AS we desire to introduce to earnest minds the Abbot Serenus, a man of
   the greatest holiness and continence, and one who answers like a mirror
   to his name, whom we admired above all others with peculiar veneration,
   we think that we only carry out our desire by the attempt to insert his
   conferences in our book. To this man beyond all other virtues, which
   shone forth not merely in his actions and manners, but by God's grace
   in his very look as well, there was granted by a special blessing the
   gift of continence, so that he never felt himself disturbed even by
   natural incitements even in sleep. And how it was that by the
   assistance of God's grace he attained such wondrous purity of the
   flesh, as it seems beyond the conditions of human nature, I think that
   I ought first of all to explain.

  CHAPTER II.

    The question of the aforesaid old man on the state of our thoughts.

   THIS man then in his prayers by day and night, and in fasts and vigils
   unweariedly entreated for inward chastity of heart and soul, and seeing
   that he had obtained what he wished and prayed for, and that all the
   passions of carnal concupiscence in his heart were dead, was roused as
   it were by the sweetest taste of purity, and inflamed by his zeal for
   chastity towards a yet more ardent desire, and began to apply himself
   to stricter fasts and prayers that the mortification of this passion
   which by God's grace had been granted to his inner man, might be
   extended also so as to include external purity, to such an extent that
   he might no longer be affected by any simple and natural movement, such
   as is excited even in children and infants. And by the experience of
   the gift he had obtained, which he knew he had secured by no merit of
   his labours, but by the grace of God, he was the more ardently
   stimulated to obtain this also in like manner, as he believed that God
   could much more easily tear up by the roots this incitement of the
   flesh, (which even by man's art and skill is sometimes destroyed by
   potions and remedies or by the use of the knife) since He had of His
   own free gift conferred that purity of spirit which is a still greater
   thing, and which cannot be acquired by human efforts and exertions. And
   when with unceasing supplications and tears he was applying himself
   unweariedly to the petition he had commenced, there came to him an
   angel in a vision by night, and seemed to open his belly, and to remove
   from his bowels a sort of fiery fleshly humour, and to cast it away,
   and restore everything to its place as before; and "lo" he said, "the
   incitements of your flesh are removed, and you may be sure that you
   have this day obtained that lasting purity of body for which you have
   faithfully asked." It will be enough thus briefly to have told this of
   the grace of God which was granted to this famous man in a special way.
   But I deem it unnecessary to say anything of those virtues which he
   possessed in common with other good men, for fear lest that particular
   narrative on this man's name might seem to deprive others of that which
   is specially mentioned of him. Him therefore, as we were inflamed with
   the greatest eagerness for conference with and instruction from him, we
   arranged to visit in Lent; and when he had very quietly inquired of us
   of the character of our thoughts and the state of our inner man, and
   what help we had got towards its purity from our long stay in the
   desert, we approached him with these complaints:

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    Our answer on the fickle character of our thoughts.

   THE time spent here, and the dwelling in solitude, and meditation,
   through which you think that we ought to have attained perfection of
   the inner man, has only done this for us; viz., teach us that which we
   are unable to be, without making us what we are trying to be. Nor do we
   feel that by this knowledge we have acquired any fixed steadfastness of
   the purity which we long for, or any strength and firmness; but only an
   increase of confusion and shame: for though our meditation in all our
   discipline aims at this in our daily studies, and endeavours from
   trembling beginnings to reach a sure and unwavering skill, and to begin
   to know something of what originally it knew but vaguely or was
   altogether ignorant of, and by advancing by sure steps (so to speak)
   towards the condition of that discipline, to habituate itself perfectly
   to it without any difficulty, I find on the contrary that while I am
   struggling in this desire for purity, I have only got far enough to
   know what I cannot be. And hence I feel that nothing but trouble
   results to me from all this contrition of heart, so that matter for
   tears is never wanting, and yet I do not cease to be what I ought not
   to be. And so what is the good of having learnt what is best, if it
   cannot be attained even when known? for when we have been feeling that
   the aim of our heart was directed towards what we purposed, insensibly
   the mind returns to its previous wandering thoughts and slips back with
   a more violent rush, and is taken up with daily distractions and
   incessantly drawn away by numberless things that take it captive, so
   that we almost despair of the improvement which we long for, and all
   these observances seem useless. Since the mind which every moment
   wanders off vaguely, when it is brought back to the fear of God or
   spiritual contemplation, before it is established in it, darts off and
   strays; and when we have been roused and have discovered that it has
   wandered from the purpose set before it, and want to recall it to the
   meditation from which it has strayed, and to bind it fast with the
   firmest purpose of heart, as if with chains, while we are making the
   attempt it slips away from the inmost recesses of the heart swifter
   than a snake. Wherefore we being inflamed by daily exercises of this
   kind, and yet not seeing that we gain from them any strength and
   stability in heart are overcome and in despair driven to this opinion;
   viz., to believe that it is from no fault of our own but from a fault
   of our nature that these wanderings of mind are found in mankind.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    The discourse of the old man on the state of the soul and its excellence.

   SERENUS: It is dangerous to jump to a conclusion and lay down the law
   hastily on the nature of anything before you have properly discussed
   the subject and considered its true character. Nor should you, looking
   only at your own weakness, hazard a conjecture instead of pronouncing a
   judgment based on the character and value of the practice itself, and
   others' experience of it. For if anyone, who was ignorant of swimming
   but knew that the weight of his body could not be supported by water,
   wished from the proof which his inexperience afforded, to lay down that
   no one composed of solid flesh could possibly be supported on the
   liquid element, we ought not therefore to think his opinion a true one,
   which he seemed to bring forward in accordance with his own experience,
   since this can be shown to be not merely not impossible but actually
   extremely easily done by others, by the clearest proofs and ocular
   demonstration. And so the nous, i.e., the mind, is defined as
   aeikinhtos kai polukinhtos, i.e., ever shifting and very shifting: as
   it is thus described in the so called wisdom of Solomon in other words:
   kai gewdes skhnos briqei noun polufrontida, i.e., "And the earthly
   tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth on many things." [355]
   This then in accordance with its nature can never remain idle, but
   unless provision is made where it may exercise its motions and have
   what will continually occupy it, it must by its own fickleness wander
   about and stray over all kinds of things until, accustomed by long
   practice and daily use--in which you say that you have toiled without
   result--it tries and learns what food for the memory it ought to
   prepare, toward which it may bring back its unwearied flight and
   acquire strength for remaining, and thus may succeed in driving away
   the hostile suggestion of the enemy by which it is distracted, and in
   persisting in that state and condition which it yearns for. We ought
   not then to ascribe this wandering inclination of our heart either to
   human nature or to God its Creator. For it is a true statement of
   Scripture, that "God made man upright; but they themselves found out
   many thoughts." [356] The character of these then depends on us
   ourselves, for it says "a good thought comes near to those that know
   it, but a prudent man will find it." [357] For where anything is
   subject to our prudence and industry so that it can be found out, there
   if it is not found out, we ought certainly to set it down to our own
   laziness or carelessness and not to the fault of our nature. And with
   this meaning the Psalmist also is in agreement, when he says: "Blessed
   is the man whose help is from Thee: in his heart he hath disposed his
   ascents." [358] You see then that it lies in our power to dispose in
   our hearts either ascents, i.e., thoughts that belong to God, or
   descents; viz., those that sink down to carnal and earthly things. And
   if this was not in our power the Lord would not have rebuked the
   Pharisees, saying "Why do ye think evil in your hearts?" [359] nor
   would He have given this charge by the prophet, saying: "Take away the
   evil of your thoughts from mine eyes;" and "How long shall wicked
   thoughts remain in you?" [360] Nor would the character of them as of
   our works be taken into consideration in the day of judgment in our
   case as the Lord threatens by Isaiah: "Lo, I come to gather together
   their works and thoughts together with all nations and tongues;" [361]
   nor would it be right that we should be condemned or defended by their
   evidence in that terrible and dreadful examination, as the blessed
   Apostle says: "Their thoughts between themselves accusing or also
   defending one another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of
   men according to my gospel." [362]

  CHAPTER V.

    On the perfection of the soul, as drawn from the comparison of the Centurion
    in the gospel.

   OF this perfect mind then there is an excellent figure drawn in the
   case of the centurion in the gospel; whose virtue and consistency,
   owing to which he was not led away by the rush of thoughts, but in
   accordance with his own judgment either admitted such as were good, or
   easily drove away those of the opposite character, are described in
   this tropical form: "For I also am a man under authority, having
   soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to
   another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth
   it." [363] If then we too strive manfully against disturbances and sins
   and can bring them under our own control and discretion, and fight and
   destroy the passions in our flesh, and bring under the sway of reason
   the swarm of our thoughts, and drive back from our breast the terrible
   hosts of the powers opposed to us by the life-giving standard of the
   Lord's cross, we shall in reward for such triumphs be promoted to the
   rank of that centurion spiritually understood, who, as we read in
   Exodus, was mystically pointed to by Moses: "Appoint for thee rulers of
   thousands, and of hundreds, and of fifties and of tens." [364] And so
   we too when raised to the height of this dignity shall have the same
   right and power to command, so that we shall not be carried away by
   thoughts against our will, but shall be able to continue in and cling
   to those which spiritually delight us, commanding the evil suggestions
   to depart, and they will depart, while to good ones we shall say
   "Come," and they will come: and to our servant also, i.e., the body we
   shall in like manner enjoin what belongs to chastity and continence,
   and it will serve us without any gainsaying, no longer arousing in us
   the hostile incitements of concupiscence, but showing all subservience
   to the spirit. And what is the character of the arms of this centurion,
   and for what use in battle they are, hear the blessed Apostle
   declaring: "The arms," he says "of our warfare are not carnal, but
   mighty to God." He tells us their character; viz., that they are not
   carnal or weak, but spiritual and mighty to God. Then he next suggests
   in what struggles they are to be used: "Unto the pulling down of
   fortifications, purging the thoughts, and every height that exalteth
   itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every
   understanding unto the obedience of Christ, and having in readiness to
   avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be first fulfilled."
   [365] And since though useful, it yet belongs to another time to run
   through these one by one, I only want you to see the different sorts of
   these arms and their characteristics, as we also ought always to walk
   with them girt upon us if we mean to fight the Lord's battles and to
   serve among the centurions of the gospel. "Take," he says "the shield
   of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
   evil one." [366] Faith then is that which intercepts the flaming darts
   of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future judgment, and belief
   in the heavenly kingdom. "And the breastplate," he says, "of charity."
   [367] This indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the
   breast and protecting what is exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling
   thoughts, keeps off the blows opposed to it, and does not allow the
   darts of the devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it "endureth all
   things, suffereth all things, beareth all things." [368] "And for an
   helmet the hope of salvation." [369] The helmet is what protects the
   head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always in all temptations
   and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future good things to
   come, and especially to keep faith in Him whole and undefiled. For it
   is possible for one who has lost other parts of the body, weak as he
   may be, still to survive: but even a short time of living is extended
   to no one without a head. "And the sword of the Spirit which is the
   word of God." [370] For it is "sharper than any two-edged sword, and
   piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
   marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:"
   [371] as it divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it
   may find in us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be
   defended from the weapons and ravages of his foes, and will not be led
   away bound in the chains of his spoilers, a captive and a prisoner, to
   the hostile land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet:
   "Why art thou grown old in a strange country?" [372] But he will stand
   like a triumphant conqueror in the land of thoughts which he has
   chosen. Would you understand too the strength and courage of this
   centurion, by which he bears these arms of which we spoke before as not
   carnal but mighty to God? Hear of the selection by which the King
   himself marks and approves brave men when he summons them to the
   spiritual combat. "Let," says He, "the weak say that I am strong;" and:
   "Let him who is the sufferer become a warrior." [373] You see then that
   none but sufferers and weak people can fight the Lord's battles, weak
   indeed with that weakness, founded on which that centurion of ours in
   the gospel said with confidence: "For when I am weak, then am I
   strong," and again, "for strength is made perfect in weakness." [374]
   Of which weakness one of the prophets says: "And he that is weak among
   them shall be as the house of David." [375] For the patient sufferer
   shall fight these wars, with that patience of which it is said
   "patience is necessary for you that doing the will of God you may
   receive the reward." [376]

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of perseverance as regards care of the thoughts.

   BUT we shall find out by our own experience that we can and ought to
   cling to the Lord if we have our wills mortified and the desires of
   this world cut off, and we shall be taught by the authority of those
   who in converse with the Lord say in all confidence: "My soul hath
   stuck close to Thee;" and: "I have stuck unto Thy testimonies, O Lord;"
   and: "It is good for me to stick fast to God;" and: "He who cleaveth to
   the Lord, is one spirit." [377] We ought not then to be wearied out by
   these wanderings of mind and relax from our fervour: for "he that
   tilleth his ground shall be filled with bread: but he that followeth
   idleness shall be filled with poverty." [378] Nor should we be drawn
   away from being intent on this watchfulness through a dangerous
   despair, for "in every one who is anxious there is abundance, for he
   who is pleasant and free from grief will be in want;" and again: "a man
   in grief labours for himself, and forcibly brings about his own
   destruction." [379] Moreover also: "the kingdom of heaven suffereth
   violence and the violent take it by force," [380] for no virtue is
   acquired without effort, nor can anyone attain to that mental stability
   which he desires without great sorrow of heart, for "man is born to
   trouble," [381] and in order that he may be able to attain to "the
   perfect man, the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" [382]
   he must ever be on the watch with still greater intentness, and toil
   with ceaseless carefulness. But to the fulness of this measure no one
   will ever attain, but one who has considered it beforehand and been
   trained to it now and has had some foretaste of it while still in this
   world, and being marked a most precious member of Christ, has possessed
   in the flesh an earnest of that "joint" [383] by which he can be united
   to His body: desiring one thing alone, thirsting for but one thing,
   ever bringing not only his acts but even his thoughts to bear on one
   thing alone; viz., that he may even now keep as an earnest that which
   is said of the blessed life of the saints hereafter; viz., that "God
   may be" to him "all in all." [384]

  CHAPTER VII.

    A question on the roving tendency of the mind and the attacks of spiritual
    wickedness.

   GERMANUS: Perhaps this tendency of the mind to rove might to some
   extent be checked were it not that so great a swarm of enemies
   surrounded it, and ceaselessly urged it toward what it has no wish for,
   or rather whither the roving character of its own nature drives it. And
   since such numberless foes, and those so powerful and terrible,
   surround it, we should not fancy that it was possible for them to be
   withstood especially by this weak flesh of ours, were we not encouraged
   to this view by your words as if by oracles from heaven.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    The answer on the help of God and the power of free will.

   SERENUS: No one who has experienced the conflicts of the inner man, can
   doubt that our foes are continually lying in wait for us. But we mean
   that they oppose our progress in such a way that we can think of them
   as only inciting to evil things and not forcing. But no one could
   altogether avoid whatever sin they were inclined to imprint upon our
   hearts, if a strong impulse was present to force (evil) upon us, just
   as it is to suggest it. Wherefore as there is in them ample power of
   inciting, so in us there is a supply of power of rejection, and of
   liberty of acquiescing. But if we are afraid of their power and
   assaults, we may also claim the protection and assistance of God
   against them, of which we read: "For greater is He who is in us than he
   who is in this world:" [385] and His aid fights on our side with much
   greater power than their hosts fight against us; for God is not only
   the suggester of what is good, but the maintainer and insister of it,
   so that sometimes He draws us towards salvation even against our will
   and without our knowing it. It follows then that no one can be deceived
   by the devil but one who has chosen to yield to him the consent of his
   own will: as Ecclesiastes clearly puts it in these words: "For since
   there is no gainsaying by those who do evil speedily, therefore the
   heart of the children of men is filled within them to do evil." [386]
   It is therefore clear that each man goes wrong from this; viz., that
   when evil thoughts assault him he does not immediately meet them with
   refusal and contradiction, for it says: "resist him, and he will flee
   from you." [387]

  CHAPTER IX.

    A question on the union of the soul with devils.

   GERMANUS: What, I pray you, is that indiscriminate and common union of
   the soul with those evil spirits, by which it is possible for them to
   be (I will not say joined with but) united to it in such a way that
   they can imperceptibly talk with it, and find their way into it and
   suggest to it whatever they want, and incite it to whatever they like,
   and look into and see its thoughts and movements; and the result is so
   close a union between them and the soul that it is almost impossible
   without God's grace to distinguish between what results from their
   instigation, and what from our free will.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    The answer how unclean spirits are united with human souls.

   SERENUS: It is no wonder that spirit can be imperceptibly joined with
   spirit, and exercise an unseen power of persuasion toward what is
   allowed to it. For there is between them (just as between men) some
   sort of similarity and kinship of substance, since the description
   which is given of the nature of the soul, applies equally well to their
   substance. But it is impossible for spirits to be implanted in spirits
   inwardly or united with them in such a way that one can hold the other;
   for this is the true prerogative of Deity alone, which is the only
   simple and incorporeal nature.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    An objection whether unclean spirits can be present in or united with the
    souls of those whom they have filled.

   GERMANUS: To this idea we think that what we see happen in the case of
   those possessed is sufficiently opposed, when they say and do what they
   know not under the influence of the spirits. How then are we to refuse
   to believe that their souls are not united to those spirits, when we
   see them made their instruments, and (forsaking their natural
   condition) yielding to their movements and moods, in such a way that
   they give expression no longer to their own words and actions and
   wishes, but to those of the demons?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    The answer how it is that unclean spirits can lord it over those possessed.

   SERENUS: What you speak of as taking place in the case of demoniacs is
   not opposed to our assertion; viz., that those possessed by unclean
   spirits say and do what they do not want to, and are forced to utter
   what they know not; for it is perfectly clear that they are not subject
   to the entrance of the spirits all in the same way: for some are
   affected by them in such a way as to have not the slightest conception
   of what they do and say, while others know and afterwards recollect it.
   But we must not imagine that this is done by the infusion of the spirit
   in such a way that it penetrates into the actual substance of the soul
   and, being as it were united to it and somehow clothed with it, utters
   words and sayings through the mouth of the sufferer. For we ought not
   to believe that this can possibly be done by them. For we can clearly
   see that this results from no loss of the soul but from weakness of the
   body, when the unclean spirit seizes on those members in which the
   vigour of the soul resides, and laying on them an enormous and
   intolerable weight overwhelms it with foulest darkness, and interferes
   with its intellectual powers: as we see sometimes happen also from the
   fault of wine and fever or excessive cold, and other indispositions
   affecting men from without; and it was this which the devil was
   forbidden to attempt to inflict on the blessed Job, though he had
   received power over his flesh, when the Lord commanded him saying: "Lo,
   I give him into thine hands: only preserve his soul," [388] i.e., do
   not weaken the seat of his soul and make him mad, and overpower the
   understanding and wisdom of what remains, by smothering the ruling
   power in his heart with your weight.

  CHAPTER XIII.

    How spirit cannot be penetrated by spirit, and how God alone is incorporeal.

   FOR even if spirit is mingled with this crass and solid matter; viz.,
   flesh (as very easily happens), should we therefore believe that it can
   be united to the soul, which is in like manner spirit, in such a way as
   to make it also receptive in the same way of its own nature: a thing
   which is possible to the Trinity alone, which is so capable of
   pervading every intellectual nature, that it cannot only embrace and
   surround it but even insert itself into it and, incorporeal though it
   is, be infused into a body? For though we maintain that some spiritual
   natures exist, such as angels, archangels and the other powers, and
   indeed our own souls and the thin air, yet we ought certainly not to
   consider them incorporeal. For they have in their own fashion a body in
   which they exist, though it is much finer than our bodies are, in
   accordance with the Apostle's words when he says: "And there are bodies
   celestial, and bodies terrestrial:" and again: "It is sown a natural
   body, it is raised a spiritual body;" [389] from which it is clearly
   gathered that there is nothing incorporeal but God alone, and therefore
   it is only by Him that all spiritual and intellectual substances can be
   pervaded, because He alone is whole and everywhere and in all things,
   in such a way as to behold and see the thoughts of men and their inner
   movements and all the recesses of the soul; since it was of Him alone
   that the blessed Apostle spoke when he said: "For the word of God is
   quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing
   even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow;
   and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; and there
   is no creature invisible in His sight, but all things are naked and
   open to His eyes." [390] And the blessed David says: "Who fashioneth
   their hearts one by one;" and again: "For He knoweth the secrets of the
   heart;" [391] and Job too: "Thou who alone knowest the hearts of men."

  CHAPTER XIV.

    An objection, as to how we ought to believe that devils see into the
    thoughts of men.

   GERMANUS: In this way, which you describe, those spirits cannot
   possibly see into our thoughts. But we think it utterly absurd to hold
   such an opinion, when Scripture says: "If the spirit of him that hath
   power ascend upon thee;" [393] and again: "When the devil had put it
   into the heart of Simon Iscariot to betray the Lord." [394] How then
   can we believe that our thoughts are not open to them, when we feel
   that for the most part they spring up and are nursed by their
   suggestions and instigation?

  CHAPTER XV.

    The answer what devils can and what they cannot do in regard to the thoughts
    of men.

   SERENUS: Nobody doubts that unclean spirits can influence the character
   of our thoughts, but this is by affecting them from without by sensible
   influences, i.e., either from our inclinations or from our words, and
   those likings to which they see that we are especially disposed. But
   they cannot possibly come near to those which have not yet come forth
   from the inmost recesses of the soul. And the thoughts too, which they
   suggest, whether they are actually or in a kind of way embraced, are
   discovered by them not from the nature of the soul itself, i.e., that
   inner inclination which lies concealed so to speak in the very marrow,
   but from motions and signs given by the outward man, as for example,
   when they suggest gluttony, if they have seen a monk raising his eyes
   anxiously to the window or to the sun, or inquiring eagerly what
   o'clock it is, they know that he has admitted the feeling of
   greediness. If when they suggest fornication they find him calmly
   submitting to the attack of lust, or see him perturbed in body, or at
   any rate not groaning as he ought under the wantonness of an impure
   suggestion, they know that the dart of lust is already fixed in his
   very soul. If they stir up incitements to grief, or anger, or rage,
   they can tell whether they have taken root in the heart by the
   movements of the body, and visible disturbances, when, for instance,
   they have noticed him either groaning silently, or panting with
   indignation or changing colour; and so they cunningly discover the
   fault to which he is given over. For they know that every one of us is
   enticed in a regular way by that one, to the incitement of which they
   see, by a sort of assenting motion of the body, that he has yielded his
   consent and agreement. And it is no wonder that this is discovered by
   those powers of the air, when we see that even clever men can often
   discover the state of the inner man from his mien and look and external
   bearing. How much more surely then can this be discovered by those who
   as being of a spiritual nature are certainly much more subtle and
   cleverer than men.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    An illustration showing how we are taught that unclean spirits know the
    thoughts of men.

   FOR just as some thieves are in the habit of examining the concealed
   treasures of the men in those houses which they mean to rob, and in the
   dark shades of night sprinkle with careful hands little grains of sand
   and discover the hidden treasures which they cannot see by the tinkling
   sound with which they answer to the fall of the sand, and so arrive at
   certain knowledge of each thing and metal, which betrays itself in a
   way by the voice elicited from it; so these too, in order to explore
   the treasures of our heart, scatter over us the sand of certain evil
   suggestions, and when they see some bodily affection arise
   corresponding to their character, they recognize as if by a sort of
   tinkling sound proceeding from the inmost recesses, what it is that is
   stored up in the secret chamber of the inner man.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

    On the fact that not every devil has the power of suggesting every passion
    to men.

   BUT we ought to know this, that not all devils can implant all the
   passions in men, but that certain spirits brood over each sin, and that
   some gloat over uncleanness and filthy lusts, others over blasphemy,
   others are more particularly devoted to anger and wrath, others thrive
   on gloominess, others are pacified with vainglory and pride; and each
   one implants in the hearts of men that sin, in which he himself revels,
   and they cannot implant their special vices all at one time, but in
   turn, according as the opportunity of time or place, or a man, who is
   open to their suggestions, excites them.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    A question whether among the devils there is any order observed in the
    attack, or system in its changes.

   GERMANUS: Must we then believe that wickedness is arranged and so to
   speak systematized among them in such a way that there is some order in
   the changes observed by them, and a regular plan of attack carried out,
   though it is clear that method and system can only exist among good and
   upright men, as Scripture says: "Thou shalt seek wisdom among the
   ungodly and shalt not find it; and: "our enemies are senseless;" and
   this: "There is neither wisdom, nor courage, nor counsel among the
   ungodly." [395]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [395] Prov. 14:6; Deut. 32:31; Prov. 21:30 (LXX).
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

    The answer how far an agreement exists among devils about the attack and its
    changes.

   SERENUS: It is a true assertion that there is no lasting concord among
   bad men, and that perfect harmony cannot exist even in regard to those
   particular faults which have attractions for them all in common. For,
   as you have said, it can never be that system and discipline are
   preserved among undisciplined things. But in some matters, where
   community of interests, and necessity enforces it, or participation in
   some gain recommends it, they must arrange for some agreement for the
   time being. And we see very clearly that this is so in the case of this
   war of spiritual wickedness; so that not only do they observe times and
   changes among themselves, but actually are known specially to occupy
   some particular spots and to haunt them persistently: for since they
   must make their attacks through certain fixed temptations and well
   defined sins, and at particular times, we clearly infer from this that
   no one can at one and at the same time be deluded by the emptiness of
   vainglory and inflamed by the lust of fornication, nor at one and the
   same time be puffed up by the outrageous haughtiness of spiritual
   pride, and subject to the humiliation of carnal gluttony. Nor can
   anyone be overcome by silly giggling and laughter and at the same time
   be excited by the stings of anger, or at any rate filled with the pains
   of gnawing grief: but all the spirits must one by one advance to attack
   the soul, in such a way that when one has been vanquished and
   retreated, he must make way for another spirit to attack it still more
   vehemently, or if he has come forth victorious, he will none the less
   hand it over to be deceived by another.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

    Of the fact that opposite powers are not of the same boldness, and that the
    occasions of temptation are not under their control.

   WE ought also not to be ignorant of this, that they have not all the
   same fierceness and energy, nor indeed the same boldness and malice,
   and that with beginners and feeble folk only the weaker spirits join
   battle, and when these spiritual wickednesses are beaten, then
   gradually the assaults of stronger ones are made against the athlete of
   Christ. For in proportion to a man's strength and progress, is the
   difficulty of the struggle made greater: for none of the saints could
   possibly be equal to the endurance of the malice of so many and so
   great foes, or meet their attacks, or even bear their cruelty and
   savagery, were it not that the merciful judge of our contest, and
   president of the games, Christ Himself, equalized the strength of the
   combatants, and repelled and checked their excessive attacks, and made
   with the temptation a way of escape as well that we might be able to
   bear it. [396]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [396] 1 Cor. 10:13.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

    Of the fact that devils struggle with men not without effort on their part.

   BUT our belief is that they undertake this struggle not without effort
   on their part. For in their conflict they themselves have some sort of
   anxiety and depression, and especially when they are matched with
   stronger rivals, i.e., saints and perfect men. Otherwise no contest or
   struggle, but only a simple deception of men, and one free from anxiety
   on their part would be assigned to them. And how then would the
   Apostle's words stand, where he says: "We wrestle not against flesh and
   blood, but against principalities, against powers, against world-rulers
   of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places;" and
   this too: "So fight I, not as one that beateth the air;" and again: "I
   have fought a good fight"? [397] For where it is spoken of as a fight,
   and conflict, and battle, there must be effort and exertion and anxiety
   on both sides, and equally there must either be in store for them
   chagrin and confusion for their failure, or delight consequent upon
   their victory. But where one fights with ease and security against
   another who struggles with great effort, and in order to overthrow his
   rival makes use of his will alone as his strength, there it ought not
   to be called a battle, struggle, or strife, but a sort of unfair and
   unreasonable assault and attack. But they certainly have to labour, and
   when they attack men, exert themselves in no lesser degree in order to
   secure from each one that victory which they want to obtain, and there
   is hurled back upon them the same confusion which was awaiting us had
   we been worsted by them; as it is said: "The head of their compassing
   me about, the labour of their own lips shall overwhelm them;" and: "His
   sorrow shall be turned on his own head;" and again: "Let the snare
   which he knoweth not come upon him, and let the net which he hath
   hidden catch him, and into that very snare let him fall;" [398] viz.,
   that which he contrived for the deception of men. They then themselves
   also come to grief, and as they damage us so are they also in like
   manner damaged by us, nor when they are worsted do they depart without
   confusion, and seeing these defeats of theirs and their struggles, one
   who had good eyes in his inner man, seeing also that they gloated over
   the downfall and mischances of individuals, and fearing lest his own
   case might furnish them with this kind of delight, prayed to the Lord
   saying: "Lighten mine eyes that I sleep not in death: lest mine enemy
   say, I have prevailed against him. They that trouble me will rejoice if
   I be moved;" and: "O My God, let them not rejoice over me; let them not
   say in their hearts, Aha, Aha, our very wish; neither let them say; we
   have devoured him." and: "They gnashed their teeth upon me. Lord, how
   long wilt Thou look on this?" for: "he lieth in wait secretly as a lion
   in his den: he lieth in wait to ravish the poor;" and: "He seeketh from
   God his meat." [399] And again when all their efforts are exhausted,
   and they have failed to secure our deception, they must "be confounded
   and blush" at the failure of their efforts, "who seek our souls to
   destroy them: and let them be covered with shame and confusion who
   imagine evil against us." [400] Jeremiah also says: "Let them be
   confounded, and let not me be confounded: let them be afraid, and let
   not me be afraid: bring upon them the fury of Thy wrath, and with a
   double destruction destroy them." [401] For no one can doubt that when
   they are vanquished by us they will be destroyed with a double
   destruction: first, because while men are seeking after holiness, they,
   though they possessed it, lost it, and became the cause of man's ruin;
   secondly, because being spiritual existences, they have been vanquished
   by carnal and earthly ones. Each one then of the saints when he looks
   on the destruction of his foes and his own triumphs, exclaims with
   delight: "I will follow after mine enemies and overtake them: and I
   will not turn until they are destroyed. I will break them and they
   shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet," [402] and
   in his prayers against them the same prophet says: "Judge thou, O Lord,
   them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me. Take hold of
   arms and shield: and rise up to help me. Bring out the sword and shut
   up the way against them that persecute me: say to my soul, I am thy
   salvation." [403] And when by subduing and destroying all our passions
   we have vanquished these, we shall then be permitted to hear those
   words of blessing: "Thy hand shall be exalted over thine enemies, and
   all thine enemies shall perish." [404] And so when we read or chant all
   these and such like passages found in holy writ, unless we take them as
   written against those spiritual wickednesses which lie in wait for us
   night and day, we shall not only fail to draw from them any edification
   to make us gentle and patient, but shall actually meet with some
   dreadful consequence and one that is quite contrary to evangelical
   perfection. For we shall not only not be taught to pray for or to love
   our enemies, but actually shall be stirred up to hate them with an
   implacable hatred, and to curse them and incessantly to pour forth
   prayers against them. And it is terribly wrong and blasphemous to think
   that these words were uttered in such a spirit by holy men and friends
   of God, on whom before the coming of Christ the law was not imposed for
   the very reason that they went beyond its commands, and chose rather to
   obey the precepts of the gospel and to aim at apostolical perfection,
   though they lived before the dispensation of the time.

  CHAPTER XXII.

    On the fact that the power to hurt does not depend upon the will of the
    devils.

   BUT that they have not the power of hurting any man is shown in a very
   clear way by the instance of the blessed Job, where the enemy did not
   venture to try him beyond what was allowed to him by the Divine
   permission; and it is evidenced by the confession of the same spirits
   contained in the records of the gospel, where they say: "If Thou cast
   us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine." [405] And far more
   must we hold that they cannot of their own free will enter into any one
   of men who are created in the image of God, if they have not power to
   enter into dumb and unclean animals without the permission of God. But
   no one--I will not say of the younger men, whom we see living most
   steadfastly in this desert, but even of those who are perfect--could
   live alone in the desert, surrounded by such swarms of foes of this
   kind, if they had unlimited power and freedom to hurt and tempt us: and
   still more clearly is this supported by the words of our Lord and
   Saviour, which in the lowliness of the manhood He had assumed, He
   uttered to Pilate, when He said: "Thou couldest have no power against
   Me at all, unless it were given thee from above." [406]

  CHAPTER XXIII.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Of the diminished power of the devils.

   BUT we have thoroughly discovered both by our own experience and by the
   testimony of the Elders that the devils have not now the same power as
   they had formerly during the early days of the anchorites, when yet
   there were only a few monks living in the desert. For such was their
   fierceness that it was with difficulty that a few very steadfast men,
   and those advanced in years were able to endure a life of solitude.
   Since in the actual monasteries where eight or ten men used to live,
   their violence attacked them so and their assaults were experienced so
   frequently, and so visibly, that they did not dare all to go to bed at
   once by night, but took turns and while some snatched a little sleep,
   others kept watch and devoted themselves to Psalms and prayer and
   reading. And when the wants of nature compelled them to sleep, they
   awoke the others, and committed to them in like manner the duty of
   keeping watch over those who were going to bed. Whence we cannot doubt
   that one of two things has brought about this result not only in the
   case of us who seem to be fairly strong from the experience which our
   age gives us, but also in the case of younger men as well. For either
   the malice of the devils has been beaten back by the power of the cross
   penetrating even to the desert, and by its grace which shines
   everywhere; or else our carelessness makes them relax something of
   their first onslaught, as they scorn to attack us with the same energy
   with which they formerly raged against those most admirable soldiers of
   Christ; and by this deceit and ceasing from open attacks they do us
   still more damage. For we see that some have fallen into so sluggish a
   condition that they have to be coaxed by too gentle exhortations for
   fear lest they should forsake their cells and fall into more dangerous
   troubles, and wander and stray about and be entangled in what I would
   call grosser sins; and it is thought that a great thing is got from
   them if they can even with some listlessness remain in the desert, and
   the Elders often say to them as a great relief: Stop in your cells, and
   eat and drink and sleep as much as you like, [407] if only you will
   stay in them always.

   wanted to relax the strictness of his fast, he replied, "Eat an ox, but
   be a Christian."
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    Of the way in which the devils prepare for themselves an entrance into the
    bodies of those whom they are going to possess.

   IT is clear then that unclean spirits cannot make their way into those
   whose bodies they are going to seize upon, in any other way than by
   first taking possession of their minds and thoughts. And when they have
   robbed them of fear and the recollection of God and spiritual
   meditation, they boldly advance upon them, as if they were dispossessed
   of all protection and Divine safeguard, and could easily be bound, and
   then take up their dwelling in them as if in a possession given over to
   them.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

    On the fact that those men are more wretched who are possessed by sins than
    those who are possessed by devils.

   ALTHOUGH it is a fact that those men are more grievously and severely
   troubled, who, while they seem to be very little affected by them in
   the body, are yet possessed in spirit in a far worse way, as they are
   entangled in their sins and lusts. For as the Apostle says: "Of whom a
   man is overcome, of him he is also the servant." Only that in this
   respect they are more dangerously ill, because though they are their
   slaves, yet they do not know that they are assaulted by them, and under
   their dominion. But we know that even saintly men have been given over
   in the flesh to Satan and to great afflictions for some very slight
   faults, since the Divine mercy will not suffer the very least spot or
   stain to be found in them on the day of judgment, and purges away in
   this world every spot of their filth, as the prophet, or rather God
   Himself says, in order that He may commit them to eternity as gold or
   silver refined and needing no penal purification. "And," says He, "I
   will clean purge away thy dross, and I will take away all thy tin; and
   after this thou shall be called the city of the just, a faithful city."
   And again: "Like as silver and gold are tried in the furnace, so the
   Lord chooseth the hearts;" And again: "The fire tries gold and silver;
   but man is tried in the furnace of humiliation;" and this also: "For
   whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He
   receiveth." [408]

  CHAPTER XXVI.

    Of the death of the prophet who was led astray, and of the infirmity of the
    Abbot Paul, with which he was visited for the sake of his cleansing.

   AND we see clear instance of this in the case of that prophet and man
   of God in the third book of Kings, who was straightway destroyed by a
   lion for a single fault of disobedience, in which he was implicated not
   of set purpose nor by the fault of his own will but by the enticement
   of another, as the Scripture speaks thus of him: "It is the man of God,
   who was disobedient to the mouth of the Lord, and the Lord delivered
   him to the lion, and it tare him according to the word of the Lord,
   which He spake." [409] In which case the punishment of the present
   offence and carelessness together with the reward of his righteousness,
   for which the Lord gave over his prophet in this world to the
   destroyer, are shown by the moderation and abstinence of the beast of
   prey, as that most savage creature did not dare even to taste the
   carcass that was given over to him. And of the same thing a very clear
   and plain proof has been given in our own days in the case of the
   Abbots Paul and Moses who lived in a spot in this desert called
   Calamus, [410] for the former had formerly dwelt in the wilderness
   which is hard by the city of Panephysis, [411] which we know had only
   recently been made a wilderness by an inundation of salt water; which
   whenever the north wind blew, was driven from the marshes and spreading
   over the adjacent fields covered the face of the whole district, so as
   to make the ancient villages, which on this very account had been
   deserted by all their inhabitants, look like islands. Here, then, the
   Abbot Paul had made such progress in purity of heart in the stillness
   and silence of the desert, that he did not suffer, I will not say a
   woman's face, but even the clothes of one of that sex to appear in his
   sight. For when as he was going to the cell of one of the Elders
   together with Abbot Archebius [412] who lived in the same desert, by
   accident a woman met him, he was so disgusted at meeting her that he
   dropped the business of his friendly visit which he had taken in hand
   and dashed back again to his own monastery with greater speed than a
   man would flee from the face of a lion or terrible dragon; so that he
   was not moved even by the shouts and prayers of the aforesaid Abbot
   Archebius who called him back to go on with the journey they had
   undertaken to ask the old man what they had proposed to do. But though
   this was done in his eagerness for chastity and desire for purity, yet
   because it was done not according to knowledge, and because the
   observance of discipline, and the methods of proper strictness were
   overstrained, for he imagined that not merely familiarity with a woman
   (which is the real harm,) but even the very form of that sex was to be
   execrated, he was forthwith overtaken by such a punishment that his
   whole body was struck with paralysis, and none of his limbs were able
   to perform their proper functions, since not merely his hands and feet,
   but even the movements of the tongue, which enables us to frame our
   words, (were affected) and his very ears lost the sense of hearing, so
   that there was left in him nothing more of his manhood than an
   immovable and insensible figure. But he was reduced to such a condition
   that the utmost care of men was unable to minister to his infirmity,
   but only the tender service of women could attend to his wants: for
   when he was taken to a convent of holy virgins, food and drink, which
   he could not ask for even by signs, were brought to him by female
   attendants, and for the performance of all that nature required he was
   ministered to by the same service for nearly four years, i.e., to the
   end of his life. And though he was affected by such weakness of all his
   members that none of his limbs retained their keen power of motion and
   feeling, nevertheless such grace of goodness proceeded from him that
   when sick persons were anointed with the oil which had touched what
   should be called his corpse rather than his body, they were instantly
   healed of all diseases, so that as regards his own malady it was made
   clearly and plainly evident even to unbelievers that the infirmity of
   all his limbs was caused by the providence and love of the Lord, and
   that the grace of these healings was granted by the power of the Holy
   Ghost as a witness of his purity and a manifestation of his merits.

    On the temptation of Abbot Moses.

   BUT the second person whom we mentioned as living in this desert,
   although he was also a remarkable and striking man, yet, in order to
   punish a single word, to which in a dispute with Abbot Macarius, [413]
   he had given utterance somewhat too sharply, as he was anticipated in
   some opinion, he was instantly delivered to so dreadful a demon that he
   filled his mouth with filth [414] which he supplied, and the Lord
   showed by the quickness of his cure, and the author of his healing,
   that He had brought this scourge upon him to purify him, that there
   might not remain in him any stain from his momentary error: for as soon
   as Abbot Macarius committed himself to prayer, quicker than a word the
   evil spirit fled away from him and departed.

  CHAPTER XXVIII.

    How we ought not to despise those who are delivered up to unclean spirits.

   FROM which it plainly results that we ought not to hate or despise
   those whom we see to be delivered up to various temptations or to those
   spirits of evil, because we ought firmly to hold these two points:
   first, that none of them can be tempted at all by them without God's
   permission, and secondly that all things which are brought upon us by
   God, whether they seem to us at the present time to be sad or joyful,
   are inflicted for our advantage as by a most kind father and most
   compassionate physician, and that therefore men are, as it were, given
   into the charge of schoolmasters, and humbled in order that when they
   depart out of this world they may be removed in a state of greater
   purity to the other life, or have a lighter punishment inflicted on
   them, as they have been, as the Apostle says, delivered over at the
   present time "to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit
   may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." [415]

  CHAPTER XXIX.

    An objection, asking why those who are tormented by unclean spirits are
    separated from the Lord's communion.

   GERMANUS: And how is it that we see them not only scorned and shunned
   by everybody, but actually always kept away from the Lord's communion
   in our provinces, in accordance with these words of the gospel: "Give
   not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before
   swine;" [416] while you tell us that somehow we ought to hold that the
   humiliation of this temptation is brought upon them with a view to
   their purification and profit?

   [416] S. Matt. 7:6.

  CHAPTER XXX.

    The answer to the question raised.

   SERENUS: If we had this knowledge. or rather faith, of which I treated
   above; viz., to believe that all things were brought about by God, and
   ordered for the good of our souls, we should not only never despise
   them, but rather pray without ceasing for them as our own members, and
   sympathize with them with all our hearts and the fullest affection (for
   "when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it" [417] ), as
   we know that we cannot possibly be perfected without them inasmuch as
   they are members of us, just as we read that our predecessors could not
   attain the fulness of promise without us, as the Apostle speaks of them
   as follows: "And these all being approved by the testimony of faith,
   received not the promise, God providing some better thing for us that
   they should not be perfected without us." [418] But we never remember
   that holy communion was forbidden them; nay rather if it were possible,
   they thought that it ought to be given to them daily; nor indeed
   according to the words of the gospel which you incongruously apply in
   this sense "Give not that which is holy to dogs," [419] ought we to
   believe that holy communion becomes food for the demon, and not a
   purification and safeguard of body and soul; for when it is received by
   a man it, so to speak, burns out and puts to flight the spirit which
   has its seat in his members or is trying to lurk in them. For in this
   way we have lately seen Abbot Andronicus and many others cured. For the
   enemy will more and more abuse the man who is possessed, if he sees him
   cut off from the heavenly medicine, and will tempt him more often and
   more fearfully, as he sees him removed the further from this spiritual
   remedy. [420]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXI.

    On the fact that those men are more to be pitied to whom it is not given to
    be subjected to those temporal temptations.

   BUT we ought to consider those men truly wretched and miserable in
   whose case, although they defile themselves with all kinds of sins and
   wickedness, yet not only is there no visible sign of the devil's
   possession shown in them, nor is any temptation proportionate to their
   actions, nor any scourge of punishment brought to bear upon them. For
   they are vouchsafed no swift and immediate remedy in this world, whose
   "hardness and impenitent heart," being too much for punishment in this
   life, "heapeth up for itself wrath and indignation in the day of wrath
   and revelation of the righteous judgment of God," "where their worm
   dieth not, and their fire is not quenched." [421] Against whom the
   prophet as if perplexed at the affliction of the saints, when he sees
   them subject to various losses and temptations, and on the other hand
   sees sinners not only passing through the course of this world without
   any scourge of humiliation, but even rejoicing in great riches, and the
   utmost prosperity in everything, inflamed with uncontrollable
   indignation and fervour of spirit, exclaims: "But as for me, my feet
   had almost gone, my treadings had well nigh slipped. For I was grieved
   at the wicked, when I saw the peace of sinners. For there is no regard
   to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes. They are not in
   the labour of men, neither shall they be scourged like other men,"
   [422] since hereafter they shall be punished with the devils, to whom
   in this world it was not vouchsafed to be scourged in the lot and
   discipline of sons, together with men. Jeremiah also, when conversing
   with God on this prosperity of sinners, although he never professes to
   doubt about the justice of God, as he says "for Thou art just, O Lord,
   if I dispute with Thee," yet in his inquiry as to the reasons of this
   inequality, proceeds to say: "But yet I will speak what is just to
   Thee. Why doth the way of the wicked prosper? Why is it well with all
   them that transgress and do wickedly? Thou hast planted them and they
   have taken root: they prosper and bring forth fruit. Thou art near in
   their mouth and far from their reins." [423] And when the Lord mourns
   for their destruction by the prophet, and anxiously directs doctors and
   physicians to heal them, and in a manner urges them on to a similar
   lamentation and says: "Babylon is suddenly fallen: she is destroyed.
   Howl for her: take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed;" then,
   in their despair, the angels, to whom is entrusted the care of man's
   salvation, make reply; or at any rate the prophet in the person of the
   Apostles and spiritual men and doctors who see the hardness of their
   soul, and their impenitent heart: "We have healed Babylon: but she is
   not cured. Let us forsake her, and let us go every man to his own land
   because her judgment hath reached even to the heavens, and is lifted up
   to the clouds." [424] Of their desperate feebleness then Isaiah speaks
   in the Person of God to Jerusalem: "From the sole of the foot unto the
   top of the head there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and
   swelling sores: they are not bound up nor dressed nor fermented with
   oil." [425]

  CHAPTER XXXII.

    Of the different desires and wishes which exist in the powers of the air.

   BUT it is clearly proved that there exist in unclean spirits as many
   desires as there are in men. For some of them, which are commonly
   called Plani, [426] are shown to be so seductive and sportive that,
   when they have taken continual possession of certain places or roads,
   they delight themselves not indeed with tormenting the passers by whom
   they can deceive, but, contenting themselves merely with laughing at
   them and mocking them, try to tire them out rather than to injure them:
   while some spend the night merely by harmlessly taking possession of
   men, though others are such slaves to fury and ferocity that they are
   not simply content with hurting the bodies of those, of whom they have
   taken possession, by tearing them in a dreadful manner, but actually
   are eager to rush upon those who are passing by at a distance, and to
   attack them with most savage slaughter: like those described in the
   gospel, for fear of whom no man dared to pass by that way. And there is
   no doubt that these and such as these in their insatiable fury delight
   in wars and bloodshed. Others we find affect the hearts of those whom
   they have seized with empty pride, (and these are commonly called
   Bacucei [427] ) so that they stretch themselves up beyond their proper
   height and at one time puff themselves up with arrogance and pomposity,
   and at another time condescend in an ordinary and bland manner, to a
   state of calmness and affability: and as they fancy that they are great
   people and the wonder of everybody, at one time show by bowing their
   body that they are worshipping higher powers, while at another time
   they think that they are worshipped by others, and so go through all
   those movements which express true service either proudly or humbly.
   Others we find are not only keen for lies, but also inspire men with
   blasphemies. And of this we ourselves can testify as we have heard a
   demon openly confessing that he had proclaimed a wicked and impious
   doctrine by the mouths of Arius and Eunomius. And the same thing we
   read that one of them openly proclaimed in the fourth book of Kings: "I
   will go forth," he said, "and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of
   all his prophets." [428] On which the Apostle, when reproving those who
   are deceived by them, adds as follows: "giving heed to seducing spirits
   and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy." [429] And that
   there are other kinds of devils which are deaf and dumb the gospels
   testify. And that some spirits incite to lust and wantonness the
   prophet maintains saying: "The spirit of fornication deceived them and
   they went astray from their God." [430] In the same way the authority
   of Scripture teaches us that there are demons of the night and of the
   day and of the noonday: [431] But it would take too long to search
   through the whole of Scripture and run through the different kinds of
   them, as they are termed by the prophets onocentaurs, satyrs, sirens,
   witches, howlers, ostriches, urchins; and asps and basilisks in the
   Psalms; and are called lions, dragons, scorpions in the gospel, and are
   named by the Apostle the prince of this world, rulers of this darkness,
   and spirits of wickedness. [432] And all these names we ought not to
   take as given at random or hap-hazard, but as alluding to their
   fierceness and madness under the sign of those wild beasts which are
   more or less harmful and dangerous among us, and by comparing them to
   the poisonous wickedness or power which among other beasts or serpents,
   some pre-eminence in evil confers on them, they are called by their
   names, in such a way that to one is assigned the name of lion because
   of the fury of his rage and the madness of his anger, to another that
   of basilisk because of his deadly poison, which kills a person before
   it is perceived, and to another that of onocentaur or urchin or ostrich
   because of his sluggish malice.

    A question as to the origin of such differences in powers of evil in the

   but against principalities, against powers, against the world-rulers of
   this darkness, against spirits of wickedness in heavenly places:" [433]
   but we want to know whence comes such a difference between them, or how
   such grades of wickedness exist? Were they created for this, to meet
   with these orders of evil, and in some way to serve this wickedness?

    The postponement of the answer to the question raised.

   SERENUS: Although your proposals would rob us of our whole night's
   rest, so that we should not notice the approach of the rising dawn, and
   should be tempted greedily to prolong our conference till sunrise, yet
   since the solving of the question raised, if we began to trace it out,
   would launch us on a wide and deep sea of questions, which the
   shortness of the time at our disposal would not permit us to traverse,
   I think it will be more convenient to reserve it for consideration
   another night, when by the raising of this question I shall receive
   from your very ready converse some spiritual joy and richer fruit, and
   we shall be able if the Holy Spirit grants us a prosperous breeze to
   penetrate more freely into the intricacies of the questions raised.
   Wherefore let us enjoy a little sleep, and so shake off the drowsiness
   that steals over our eyes, as the dawn approaches, and then we will go
   together to church, for the observance of Sunday bids us do this, and
   after service will come back, and as you wish, discuss with redoubled
   delight what the Lord may have given to us for our common improvement.

THE SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT SERENUS.

ON PRINCIPALITIES.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Of the hospitality of Abbot Serenus.

   WHEN we had finished the duties of the day, and the congregation had
   been dismissed from Church we returned to the old man's cell, and
   enjoyed a most sumptuous repast. For instead of the sauce which with a
   few drops of oil spread over it was usually set on the table for his
   daily meal, he mixed a little decoction and poured over it a somewhat
   more liberal allowance of oil than usual; for each of them when he is
   going to partake of his daily repast, pours those drops of oil on, not
   that he may receive any enjoyment from the taste of it (for so limited
   is the supply that it is hardly enough I will not say to line the
   passage of his throat and jaws, but even to pass down it) but that
   using it, he may keep down the pride of his heart (which is certain to
   creep in stealthily and surely if his abstinence is any stricter) and
   the incitements to vainglory, for as his abstinence is practised with
   the greater secrecy, and is carried on without anyone to see it, so
   much the more subtly does it never cease to tempt the man who conceals
   it. Then he set before us table salt, and three olives each: after
   which he produced a basket containing parched vetches which they call
   trogalia, [434] from which we each took five grains, two prunes and a
   fig apiece. For it is considered wrong for anyone to exceed that amount
   in that desert. And when we had finished this repast and had begun to
   ask him again for his promised solution of the question, "Let us hear,"
   said the old man, "your question, the consideration of which we
   postponed till the present time."

  CHAPTER II.

    Statements on the different kinds of spiritual wickednesses.

   THEN GERMANUS: We want to know what is the origin of the great variety
   of hostile powers opposed to men, and the difference between them,
   which the blessed Apostle sums up as follows: "We wrestle not against
   flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
   the world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in
   heavenly places:" [435] and again: "Neither angels nor principalities
   nor powers nor any other creature, can separate us from the love of God
   which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." [436] Whence then arises the enmity
   of all this malice jealous of us? Are we to believe that those powers
   were created by the Lord for this; viz., to fight against men in these
   grades and orders?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    The answer on the many kinds of food provided in holy Scripture.

   SERENUS: The authority of holy Scripture says on those points on which
   it would inform us some things so plainly and clearly even to those who
   are utterly void of understanding, that not only are they not veiled in
   the obscurity of any hidden meaning, but do not even require the help
   of any explanation, but carry their meaning and sense on the surface of
   the words and letters: but some things are so concealed and involved in
   mysteries as to offer us an immense field for skill and care in the
   discussion and explanation of them. And it is clear that God has so
   ordered it for many reasons: first for fear lest the holy mysteries, if
   they were covered by no veil of spiritual meaning, should be exposed
   equally to the knowledge and understanding of everybody, i.e., the
   profane as well as the faithful and thus there might be no difference
   in the matter of goodness and prudence between the lazy and the
   earnest: next that among those who are indeed of the household of
   faith, while immense differences of intellectual power open out before
   them, there might be the opportunity of reproving the slothfulness of
   the idle, and of proving the keenness and diligence of the earnest. And
   so holy Scripture is fitly compared to a rich and fertile field, which,
   while bearing and producing much which is good for man's food without
   being cooked by fire, produces some things which are found to be
   unsuitable for man's use or even harmful unless they have lost all the
   roughness of their raw condition by being tempered and softened down by
   the heat of fire. But some are naturally fit for use in both states, so
   that even when uncooked they are not unpleasant from their raw
   condition, but still are rendered more palatable by being cooked and
   heated by fire. Many more things too are produced only fit for the food
   of irrational creatures, and cattle, and wild animals and birds, but
   utterly useless as food for men, which while still in their rough state
   without being in any way touched by fire, conduce to the health and
   life of cattle. And we can clearly see that the same system holds good
   in that most fruitful garden of the Scriptures of the Spirit, in which
   some things shine forth clear and bright in their literal sense, in
   such a way that while they have no need of any higher interpretation,
   they furnish abundant food and nourishment in the simple sound of the
   words, to the hearers: as in this passage: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord
   thy God is one Lord;" and: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
   thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength." [437] But
   there are some which, unless they are weakened down by an allegorical
   interpretation, and softened by the trial of the fire of the spirit
   cannot become wholesome food for the inner man without injury and loss
   to him; and damage rather than profit will accrue to him from receiving
   them: as with this passage: "But let your loins be girded up and your
   lights burning;" and: "whosoever has no sword, let him sell his coat
   and buy himself a sword;" and: "whosoever taketh not up his cross and
   followeth after Me is not worthy of Me;" [438] a passage which some
   most earnest monks, having "indeed a zeal for God, but not according to
   knowledge" [439] understood literally, and so made themselves wooden
   crosses, and carried them about constantly on their shoulders, and so
   were the cause not of edification but of ridicule on the part of all
   who saw them. But some are capable of being taken suitable and properly
   in both ways, i.e., the historical and allegorical, so that either
   explanation furnishes a healing draught to the soul; as this passage:
   "If any one shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other
   also;" and: "when they persecute you in one city, flee to another;"
   and: "if thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast and give to
   the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me."
   [440] It produces indeed "grass for the cattle" also, (and of this food
   all the fields of Scripture are full); viz., plain and simple
   narratives of history, by which simple folk, and those who are
   incapable of perfect and sound understanding (of whom it is said "Thou,
   Lord, wilt save both man and beast") [441] may be made stronger and
   more vigorous for their hard work and the labour of actual life, in
   accordance with the state and measure of their capacity.

  CHAPTER IV.

    Of the double sense in which Holy Scripture may be taken.

   WHEREFORE on those passages which are brought forward with a clear
   explanation we also can constantly lay down the meaning and boldly
   state our own opinions. But those which the Holy Spirit, reserving for
   our meditation and exercise, has inserted in holy Scripture with veiled
   meaning, wishing some of them to be gathered from various proofs and
   conjectures, ought to be step by step and carefully brought together,
   so that their assertions and proofs may be arranged by the discretion
   of the man who is arguing or supporting them. For sometimes when a
   difference of opinion is expressed on one and the same subject, either
   view may be considered reasonable and be held without injury to the
   faith either firmly, or doubtfully, i.e., in such a way that neither is
   full belief nor absolute rejection accorded to it, and the second view
   need not interfere with the former, if neither of them is found to be
   opposed to the faith: as in this case: where Elias came in the person
   of John, [442] and is again to be the precursor of the Lord's Advent:
   and in the matter of the "Abomination of desolation" which "stood in
   the holy place," by means of that idol of Jupiter which, as we read,
   was placed in the temple in Jerusalem, and which is again to stand in
   the Church through the coming of Antichrist, [443] and all those things
   which follow in the gospel, which we take as having been fulfilled
   before the captivity of Jerusalem and still to be fulfilled at the end
   of this world. In which matters neither view is opposed to the other,
   nor does the first interpretation interfere with the second.

    Of the fact that the question suggested ought to be included among those

   AND therefore since the question raised by us, does not seem to have
   been sufficiently or often ventilated among men, and is clear to most
   people, and from this fact what we bring forward may perhaps appear to
   some to be doubtful, we ought to regulate our own view (since it does
   not interfere with faith in the Trinity) so that it may be included
   among those things which are to be held doubtfully; although they rest
   not on mere opinions such as are usually given to guesses and
   conjectures, but on clear Scripture proof.

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of the fact that nothing is created evil by God.

   GOD forbid that we should admit that God has created anything which is
   substantially evil, as Scripture says "everything that God had made was
   very good." [444] For if they were created by God such as they are now,
   or made for this purpose; viz., to occupy these positions of malice,
   and ever to be ready for the deception and ruin of men, we should in
   opposition to the view of the above quoted Scripture slander God as the
   Creator and author of evil, as having Himself formed utterly evil wills
   and natures, creating them for this very purpose; viz., that they might
   ever persist in their wickedness and never pass over to the feeling of
   a good will. The following reason then of this diversity is what we
   received from the tradition of the fathers, being drawn from the fount
   of Holy Scripture.

  CHAPTER VII.

    Of the origin of principalities or powers.

   NONE of the faithful question the fact that before the formation of
   this visible creation God made spiritual and celestial powers, in order
   that owing to the very fact that they knew that they had been formed
   out of nothing by the goodness of the Creator for such glory and bliss,
   they might render to Him continual thanks and ceaselessly continue to
   praise Him. For neither should we imagine that God for the first time
   began to originate His creation and work with the formation of this
   world, as if in those countless ages beforehand He had taken no thought
   of Providence and the divine ordering of things, and as if we could
   believe that having none towards whom to show the blessings of His
   goodness, He had been solitary, and a stranger to all bountifulness; a
   thing which is too poor and unsuitable to fancy of that boundless and
   eternal and incomprehensible Majesty; as the Lord Himself says of these
   powers: "When the stars were made together, all my angels praised Me
   with a loud voice." [445] Those then who were present at the creation
   of the stars, are most clearly proved to have been created before that
   "beginning" in which it is said that heaven and earth were made,
   inasmuch as they are said with loud voices and admiration to have
   praised the Creator because of all those visible creatures which, as
   they saw, proceeded forth from nothing. Before then that beginning in
   time which is spoken of by Moses, and which according to the historic
   and Jewish interpretation denotes the age of this world (without
   prejudice to our interpretation, according to which we explain that the
   "beginning," of all things is Christ, in whom the Father created all
   things, as it is said "All things were made by him, and without Him was
   not anything made,") [446] before, I say, that beginning of Genesis in
   time there is no question that God had already created all those powers
   and heavenly virtues; which the Apostle enumerates in order and thus
   describes: "For in Christ were created all things both in heaven and on
   earth, visible and invisible, whether they be angels or archangels,
   whether they be thrones or dominions, whether they be principalities or
   powers. All things were made by Him and in Him." [447]

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of the fall of the devil and the angels.

   AND so we are clearly shown that out of that number of them some of the
   leaders fell, by the lamentations of Ezekiel and Isaiah, in which we
   know that the prince of Tyre or that Lucifer who rose in the morning is
   lamented with a doleful plaint: and of him the Lord speaks as follows
   to Ezekiel: "Son of man, take up a lamentation over the prince of Tyre,
   and say to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Thou wast the seal of
   resemblance, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty. Thou wast in the
   pleasures of the paradise of God: every precious stone was thy
   covering: the sardius, the topaz and the jasper, the chrysolyte and the
   onyx and the beryl, the sapphire and the carbuncle and the emerald:
   gold the work of thy beauty, and thy pipes were prepared in the day
   that thou wast created. Thou wast a cherub stretched out and
   protecting, and I set thee in the holy mountain of God, thou hast
   walked in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy
   ways from the day of thy creation, until iniquity was found in thee. By
   the multitude of thy merchandise thy inner parts were filled with
   iniquity and thou hast sinned; and I cast thee out from the mountain of
   God, and destroyed thee, O covering cherub, out of the midst of the
   stones of fire. And thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty: thou hast
   lost thy wisdom in thy beauty, I have cast thee to the ground: I have
   set thee before the face of kings, that they might behold thee. Thou
   hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities and by
   the iniquity of thy traffic." [448] Isaiah also says of another: "How
   art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning?
   how art thou fallen to the ground, that didst wound the nations? and
   thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my
   throne above the stars of God, I will sit in the mountain of the
   covenant, in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of
   the clouds. I will be like the Most High." [449] But Holy Scripture
   relates that these fell not alone from that summit of their station in
   bliss, as it tells us that the dragon dragged down together with
   himself the third part of the stars. [450] One of the Apostles too says
   still more plainly: "But the angels who kept not their first estate,
   but left their own dwelling, He hath reserved in everlasting chains
   under darkness to the judgment of the great day." [451] This too which
   is said to us: "But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the
   princes," [452] what does it imply but that many princes have fallen?
   And by these testimonies we can gather the reason for this diversity;
   viz., either that they still retain those differences of rank (which
   adverse powers are said to possess, after the manner of holy and
   heavenly virtues) from the station of their former rank in which they
   were severally created, or else that, though themselves cast down from
   heavenly places, yet, as a reward for that wickedness of theirs in
   which they have graduated in evil, they claim in perversity these
   grades and titles of rank among themselves, by way of copying those
   virtues which have stood firm there.

  CHAPTER IX.

    An objection stating that the fall of the devil took its origin from the
    deception of Eve.

   GERMANUS: Up till now we used to believe that the reason and
   commencement of the ruin and fall of the devil, in which he was cast
   out from his heavenly estate, was more particularly envy, when in his
   spiteful subtlety he deceived Adam and Eve.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    The answer about the beginning of the devil's fall.

   SERENUS: The passage in Genesis shows that that was not the beginning
   of his fall and ruin, as before their deception it takes the view that
   he had already been branded with the ignominy of the name of the
   serpent, where it says: "But the serpent was wiser" or as the Hebrew
   copies express it, "more subtle than all the beasts of the earth, which
   the Lord God had made." [453] You see then that he had fallen away from
   his angelic holiness even before he deceived the first man, so that he
   not only deserved to be stamped with the ignominy of this title, but
   actually excelled all other beasts of the earth in the subterfuges of
   wickedness. For Holy Scripture would not have designated a good angel
   by such a term, nor would it say of those who were still continuing in
   that state of bliss: "But the serpent was wiser than all the beasts of
   the earth." For this title could not possibly be applied I say not to
   Gabriel or Michael, but it would not even be suitable to any good man.
   And so the title of serpent and the comparison to beasts most clearly
   suggests not the dignity of an angel but the infamy of an apostate.
   Finally the occasion of the envy and seduction, which led him to
   deceive man, arose from the ground of his previous fall, in that he saw
   that man, who had but recently been formed out of the dust of the
   ground, was to be called to that glory, from which he remembered that
   he himself, while still one of the princes, had fallen. And so that
   first fall of his, which was due to pride, and which obtained for him
   the name of the serpent, was followed by a second owing to envy: and as
   this one found him still in the possession of something upright so that
   he could enjoy some interchange of conference and counsel with man, by
   the Lord's sentence he was very properly cast down to the lowest depth,
   that he might no longer walk as before erect, and looking up on high,
   but should cleave to the ground and creep along, and be brought low
   upon his belly and feed upon the earthly food and works of sins, and
   henceforward proclaim his secret hostility, and put between himself and
   man an enmity that is to our advantage, and a discord that is to our
   profit, so that while men are on their guard against him as a dangerous
   enemy, he can no longer injure them by a deceptive show of friendship.

  CHAPTER XI.

    The punishment of the deceiver and the deceived.

   BUT we ought in this matter, in order that we may shun evil counsels,
   to learn a special lesson from the fact that though the author of the
   deception was visited with a fitting punishment and condemnation, yet
   still the one who was led astray did not go scot free from punishment,
   although it was somewhat lighter than that of him who was the author of
   the deception. And this we see was very plainly expressed. For Adam who
   was deceived, or rather (to use the Apostle's words) "was not deceived"
   but, acquiescing in the wishes of her who was deceived, seems to have
   come to yield a consent that was deadly, is only condemned to labour
   and the sweat of his brow, which is assigned to him not by means of a
   curse upon himself, but by means of a curse upon the ground, and its
   barrenness. But the woman, who persuaded him to this, is visited with
   an increase of anguish, and pains and sorrow, and also given over to
   the yoke of perpetual subjection. But the serpent who was the first to
   incite them to this offence, is punished by a lasting curse. Wherefore
   we should with the utmost care and circumspection be on our guard
   against evil counsels, for as they bring punishment upon their authors,
   so too they do not suffer those who are deceived by them to go free
   from guilt and punishment.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    Of the crowd of the devils, and the disturbance which they always raise in
    our atmosphere.

   BUT the atmosphere which extends between heaven and earth is ever
   filled with a thick crowd of spirits, which do not fly about in it
   quietly or idly, so that most fortunately the divine providence has
   withdrawn them from human sight. For through fear of their attacks, or
   horror at the forms, into which they transform and turn themselves at
   will, men would either be driven out of their wits by an insufferable
   dread, and faint away, from inability to look on such things with
   bodily eyes, or else would daily grow worse and worse, and be corrupted
   by their constant example and by imitating them, and thus there would
   arise a sort of dangerous familiarity and deadly intercourse between
   men and the unclean powers of the air, whereas those crimes which are
   now committed among men, are concealed either by walls and enclosures
   or by distance and space, or by some shame and confusion: but if they
   could always look on them with open face, they would be stimulated to a
   greater pitch of insanity, as there would not be a single moment in
   which they would see them desist from their wickedness, since no bodily
   weariness, or occupation in business or care for their daily food (as
   in our case) forces them sometimes even against their will to desist
   from the purposes they have begun to carry out.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    Of the fact that opposing powers turn the attack, which they aim at men,
    even against each other.

   FOR it is quite clear that they aim these attacks, with which they
   assault men, even against each other, for in like manner they do not
   cease to promote with unwearied strife the discords and struggles which
   they have undertaken for some peoples because of a sort of innate love
   of wickedness which they have: and this we read of as being very
   clearly set forth in the vision of Daniel the prophet, where the angel
   Gabriel speaks as follows: "Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
   that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the
   sight of thy God, thy words have been heard: and I am come for thy
   words. But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one
   and twenty days: and behold Michael one of the chief princes came to
   help me, and I remained there by the king of the Persians. But I am
   come to teach thee what things shall befall thy people in the latter
   days." [454] And we can not possibly doubt that this prince of the
   kingdom of the Persians was a hostile power, which favoured the nation
   of the Persians an enemy of God's people; for in order to hinder the
   good which it saw would result from the solution of the question for
   which the prophet prayed the Lord, by the archangel, in its jealousy it
   opposed itself to prevent the saving comfort of the angel from reaching
   Daniel too speedily, and from strengthening the people of God, over
   which the archangel Gabriel was: and the latter said that even then,
   owing to the fierceness of his assaults, he would not have been able to
   come to him, had not Michael the archangel come to help him, and met
   the prince of the kingdom of the Persians, and joined battle with him,
   and intervened, and defended him from his attack, and so enabled him to
   come to instruct the prophet after twenty-one days. And a little later
   on it says: "And the angel said: Dost thou know wherefore I am come to
   thee? And now I will return to fight against the prince of the
   Persians. For when I went forth, there appeared the prince of the
   Greeks coming. But I will tell thee what is written down in the
   Scriptures of truth: and none is my helper in all these things but
   Michael your prince." [455] And again: "At that time shall Michael rise
   up, the great prince, who standeth for the children of thy people."
   [456] So then we read that in the same way another was called the
   prince of the Greeks, who since he was patron of that nation which was
   subject to him seems to have been opposed to the nation of the Persians
   as well as to the people of Israel. From which we clearly see that
   antagonistic powers raise against each other those quarrels of nations,
   and conflicts and dissensions, which they show among themselves at
   their instigation, and that they either exult at their victories or are
   cast down at their defeats, and thus cannot live in harmony among
   themselves, while each of them is always striving with restless
   jealousy on behalf of those whom he presides over, against the patron
   of some other nation.

  CHAPTER XIV.

    How it is that spiritual wickednesses obtained the names of powers or
    principalities.

   WE can then see clear reasons, in addition to those ideas which we
   expounded above, why they are called principalities or powers; viz.,
   because they rule and preside over different nations, and at least hold
   sway over inferior spirits and demons, of which the gospels give us
   evidence by their own confession that there exist legions. For they
   could not be called lords unless they had some over whom to exercise
   the sway of lordship; nor could they be called powers or
   principalities, unless there were some over whom they could claim
   power: and this we find pointed out very clearly in the gospel by the
   Pharisees in their blasphemy: "He casteth out devils by Beelzebub the
   prince of the devils," [457] for we find that they are also called
   "rulers of darkness," [458] and that one of them is styled "the prince
   of this world." [459] But the blessed Apostle declares that hereafter,
   when all things shall be subdued to Christ, these orders shall be
   destroyed, saying: "When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God
   even the Father, when He shall have destroyed all principalities and
   powers and dominions." [460] And this certainly can only take place if
   they are removed from the sway of those over whom we know that powers
   and dominions and principalities take charge in this world.

  CHAPTER XV.

    Of the fact that it is not without reason that the names of angels and
    archangels are given to holy and heavenly powers.

   FOR no one doubts that not without cause or reason are the same titles
   of rank assigned to the better sort, and that they are names of office
   and of worth or dignity, for it is plain that they are termed angels,
   i.e., messengers from their office of bearing messages, and the
   appropriateness of the name teaches that they are "archangels" because
   the preside over angels, "dominions" because they hold dominion over
   certain persons, and "principalities" because they have some to be
   princes over, and "thrones" because they are so near to God and so
   privy and close to Him that the Divine Majesty specially rests in them
   as in a Divine throne, and in a way reclines surely on them.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    Of the subjection of the devils, which they show to their own princes, as
    seen in a brother's vision.

   BUT that unclean spirits are ruled over by worse powers and are subject
   to them we not only find from those passages of Scripture, recorded in
   the gospels when the Pharisees maligned the Lord, and He answered "If I
   by Beelzebub the prince of the devils cast out devils," [461] but we
   are also taught this by clear visions and many experiences of the
   saints, for when one of our brethren was making a journey in this
   desert, as day was now declining he found a cave and stopped there
   meaning to say his evening office in it, and there midnight passed
   while he was still singing the Psalms. And when after he had finished
   his office he sat down a little before refreshing his wearied body, on
   a sudden he began to see innumerable troops of demons gathering
   together on all sides, who came forward in an immense crowd, and a long
   line, some preceding and others following their prince; who at length
   arrived, being taller and more dreadful to look at than all the others;
   and, a throne having been placed, he sat down as on some lofty
   tribunal, and began to investigate by a searching examination the
   actions of each one of them; and those who said that they had not yet
   been able to circumvent their rivals, he commanded to be driven out of
   his sight with shame and ignominy as idle and slothful, rebuking them
   with angry wrath for the waste of so much time, and for their labour
   thrown away: but those who reported that they had deceived those
   assigned to them, he dismissed before all with the highest praise
   amidst the exultation and applause of all, as most brave warriors, and
   most renowned as an example to all the rest: and when in this number
   some most evil spirit had presented himself, in delight at having to
   relate some magnificent triumph, he mentioned the name of a very well
   known monk, and declared that after having incessantly attacked him for
   fifteen years, he had at last got the better of him, so as to destroy
   him that very same night by the sin of fornication, for that he had not
   only impelled him to commit adultery with some consecrated maid, but
   had actually persuaded him to keep her and marry her. And when there
   arose shouts of joy at this narrative, he was extolled with the highest
   praise by the prince of darkness, and departed crowned with great
   honours. And so when at break of day the whole swarm of demons had
   vanished from his eyes, the brother being doubtful about the assertion
   of the unclean spirit, and rather thinking that he had desired to
   entice him by an ancient customary deceit, and to brand an innocent
   brother with the crime of incest, being mindful of those words of the
   gospel; viz., that "he abode not in the truth because there is no truth
   in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a
   liar, and its father," [462] he made his way to Pelusium, where he knew
   that the man lived, whom the evil spirit declared to be destroyed: for
   the brother was very well known to him, and when he had asked him, he
   found that on the same night on which that foul demon had announced his
   downfall to his company and prince, he had left his former monastery,
   and sought the town, and had gone astray by a wretched fall with the
   girl mentioned.

  CHAPTER XVII.

    Of the fact that two angels always cling to every man.

   FOR Holy Scripture bears witness that two angels, a good and a bad one,
   cling to each one of us. And of the good ones the Saviour says: "Do not
   despise one of these little ones; for I say unto you that their angels
   in heaven do always behold the face of thy Father which is in heaven:"
   [463] and this also: "the angel of the Lord shall encamp round about
   them that fear Him, and deliver them." [464] Moreover this also which
   is said in the Acts of the Apostles, of Peter, that "it is his angel."
   [465] But of both sorts the book of the Shepherd teaches us very fully.
   [466] But if we consider about him who attacked the blessed Job we
   shall clearly learn that it was he who always plotted against him but
   never could entice him to sin, and that therefore he asked for power
   from the Lord, as he was worsted not by his (Job's) virtue but by the
   Lord's protection which ever shielded him. Of Judas also it is said:
   "And let the devil stand at his right hand." [467]

   the suggestions of the one from those of the other. The passage is also

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    Of the degrees of wickedness which exist in hostile spirits, as shown in the
    case of two philosophers.

   BUT of the difference that there is between demons we have learnt a
   great deal by means of those two philosophers who formerly by acts of
   magic had oftentimes great experience both of their laziness and of
   their courage and savage wickedness. For these looking down on the
   blessed Antony as a boor and rustic, and wanting, if they could not
   injure him any further, at least to drive him from his cell by
   illusions of magic and the devices of demons, despatched against him
   most foul spirits, for they were impelled to this attack upon him by
   the sting of jealousy because enormous crowds came daily to him as the
   servant of God. And when these most savage demons did not even venture
   to approach him as he was now signing his breast and forehead with the
   sign of the cross, and, now devoting himself to prayer and
   supplication, they returned without any result to those who had
   directed them; and these again sent against him others more desperate
   in wickedness, and when these too had spent their strength in vain, and
   returned without having accomplished anything, and others still more
   powerful were nevertheless told off against the victorious soldier of
   Christ, and could prevail nothing against him, all these great plots of
   theirs devised with all the arts of magic were only useful in proving
   the great value that there is in the profession of Christians, so that
   those fierce and powerful shadows, which they thought would veil the
   sun and moon if they were directed towards them, could not only not
   injure him, but not even draw him forth from his monastery for a single
   instant.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

    Of the fact that devils cannot prevail at all against men unless they have
    first secured possession of their minds.

   AND when in their astonishment at this they came straight to Abbot
   Antony and disclosed the extent of their attacks and the reason of them
   and their plots, they dissembled their jealousy and asked that they
   might forthwith be made Christians. But when he had asked of them the
   day when the assault was made, he declared that at that time he had
   been afflicted with the most bitter pangs of thought. And by this
   experience the blessed Antony proved and established the opinion which
   we expressed yesterday in our Conference, that demons cannot possibly
   find an entrance into the mind or body of anyone, nor have they the
   power of overwhelming the soul of anyone, unless they have first
   deprived it of all holy thoughts, and made it empty and free from
   spiritual meditation. But you must know that unclean spirits are
   obedient to men in two ways. For either they are by divine grace and
   power subject to the holiness of the faithful, or they are captivated
   by the sacrifices of sinners, and certain charms, and are flattered by
   them as their worshippers. And the Pharisees too were led astray by
   this notion and fancied that by this device even the Lord the Saviour
   gave commands to devils, and said "By Beelzebub the prince of the
   devils He casteth out devils," in accordance with that plan by which
   they knew that their own magicians and enchanters--by invoking his name
   and offering sacrifices, with which they know he is pleased and
   delighted--have as his servants power even over the devils who are
   subject to him.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

    A question about the fallen angels who are said in Genesis to have had
    intercourse with the daughters of men.

   GERMANUS: Since a passage of Genesis was a little while ago by the
   providence of God brought forward in our midst, and happily reminded us
   that we can now conveniently ask about a point which we have always
   longed to learn, we want to know what view we ought to take about those
   fallen angels who are said to have had intercourse with the daughters
   of men, and whether such a thing can literally take place with a
   spiritual nature. And also with regard to this passage of the gospel
   which you quoted of the devil a little while back, "for he is a liar
   and his father," [468] we should like in the same way to hear who is to
   be understood by "his father."

     __________________________________________________________________

   [468] S. John 8:44. We find from Augustine (Tract. xxiv. in Johan.)
   that the Manichees interpreted this text as implying that the devil had
   a father, translating it "For he is a liar, and so is his father."
   Augustine himself explains it as Abbot Serenus does below in c. xxv.;
   viz., that the devil is not only a liar himself but the parent of lies.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

    The answer to the question raised.

   SERENUS: You have propounded two not unimportant questions, to which I
   will reply, to the best of my ability, in the order in which you have
   raised them. We cannot possibly believe that spiritual existences can
   have carnal intercourse with women. But if this could ever have
   literally happened how is it that it does not now also sometimes take
   place, and that we do not see some in the same way born of women by the
   agency of demons without intercourse with men? especially when it is
   clear that they delight in the pollution of lust, which they would
   certainly prefer to bring about through their own agency rather than
   through that of men, if they could possibly manage it, as Ecclesiastes
   declares: "What is it that hath been? The same that is. And what is it
   that hath been done? The same that is done. And there is nothing new
   that can be said under the sun, so that a man can say: Behold this is
   new; for it hath already been in the ages which were before us." [469]
   But the question raised may be resolved in this way. After the death of
   righteous Abel, in order that the whole human race might not spring
   from a wicked fratricide, Seth was born in the place of his brother who
   was slain, to take the place of his brother not only as regards
   posterity, but also as regards justice and goodness. And his offspring,
   following the example of their father's goodness, always remained
   separate from intercourse with and the society of their kindred
   descended from the wicked Cain, as the difference of the genealogy very
   clearly tells us, where it says: "Adam begat Seth, Seth begat Enos,
   Enos begat Cainan, but Cainan begat Mahalaleel, but Mahalaleel begat
   Jared, Jared begat Enoch, Enoch begat Methuselah, Methuselah begat
   Lamech, Lamech begat Noah." [470] And the genealogy of Cain is given
   separately as follows: "Cain begat Enoch, Enoch begat Cainan, Cainan
   begat Mahalaleel, Mahalaleel begat Methuselah, Methuselah begat Lamech,
   Lamech begat Jabal and Jubal." [471] And so the line which sprang from
   the seed of righteous Seth always mixed with its own kith and kin, and
   continued for a long while in the holiness of its fathers and
   ancestors, untouched by the blasphemies and the wickedness of an evil
   offspring, which had implanted in it a seed of sin as it were
   transmitted by its ancestors. As long then as there continued that
   separation of the lines between them, the seed of Seth, as it sprang
   from an excellent root, was by reason of its sanctity termed "angels of
   God," or as some copies have it "sons of God;" [472] and on the
   contrary the others by reason of their own and their fathers'
   wickedness and their earthly deeds were termed "children of men."
   Though then there was up to this time that holy and salutary separation
   between them, yet after this the sons of Seth who were the sons of God
   saw the daughters of those who were born of the line of Cain, and
   inflamed with the desire for their beauty took to themselves from them
   wives who taught their husbands the wickedness of their fathers, and at
   once led them astray from their innate holiness and the
   single-mindedness of their forefathers. To whom this saying applies
   with sufficient accuracy: "I have said: Ye are Gods, and ye are all the
   children of the Most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one
   of the princes;" [473] who fell away from that true study of natural
   philosophy, handed down to them by their ancestors, which the first man
   who forthwith traced out the study of all nature, could clearly attain
   to, and transmit to his descendants on sure grounds, inasmuch as he had
   seen the infancy of this world, while still as it were tender and
   throbbing and unorganized; and as there was in him not only such
   fulness of wisdom, but also the grace of prophecy given by the Divine
   inspiration, so that while he was still an untaught inhabitant of this
   world he gave names to all living creatures, and not only knew about
   the fury and poison of all kinds of beasts and serpents, but also
   distinguished between the virtues of plants and trees and the natures
   of stones, and the changes of seasons of which he had as yet no
   experience, so that he could well say: "The Lord hath given me the true
   knowledge of the things that are, to know the disposition of the whole
   world, and the virtues of the elements, the beginning and the ending
   and the midst of times, the alterations of their courses and the
   changes of their seasons, the revolutions of the year and the
   disposition of the stars, the natures of living creatures and the rage
   of wild beasts, the force of winds, and the reasonings of men, the
   diversities of plants and the virtues of roots, and all such things as
   are hid and open I have learnt." [474] This knowledge then of all
   nature the seed of Seth received through successive generations, handed
   down from the fathers, so long as it remained separate from the wicked
   line, and as it had received it in holiness, so it made use of it to
   promote the glory of God and the needs of everyday life. But when it
   had been mingled with the evil generation, it drew aside at the
   suggestion of devils to profane and harmful uses what it had innocently
   learnt, and audaciously taught by it the curious arts of wizards and
   enchantments and magical superstitions, teaching its posterity to
   forsake the holy worship of the Divinity and to honour and worship
   either the elements or fire or the demons of the air. How it was then
   that this knowledge of curious arts of which we have spoken, did not
   perish in the deluge, but became known to the ages that followed,
   should, I think, be briefly explained, as the occasion of this
   discussion suggests, although the answer to the question raised
   scarcely requires it. And so, as ancient traditions tell us, Ham the
   son of Noah, who had been taught these superstitions and wicked and
   profane arts, as he knew that he could not possibly bring any handbook
   on these subjects into the ark, into which he was to enter with his
   good father and holy brothers, inscribed these nefarious arts and
   profane devices on plates of various metals which could not be
   destroyed by the flood of waters, and on hard rocks, and when the flood
   was over he hunted for them with the same inquisitiveness with which he
   had concealed them, and so transmitted to his descendants a seed-bed of
   profanity and perpetual sin. In this way then that common notion,
   according to which men believe that angels delivered to men
   enchantments and diverse arts, is in truth fulfilled. From these sons
   of Seth then and daughters of Cain, as we have said, there were I born
   still worse children who became mighty hunters, violent and most fierce
   men who were termed giants by reason of the size of their bodies and
   their cruelty and wickedness. For these first began to harass their
   neighbours and to practise pillaging among men, getting their living
   rather by rapine than by being contented with the sweat and labour of
   toil, and their wickedness increased to such a pitch that the world
   could only be purified by the flood and deluge. So then when the sons
   of Seth at the instigation of their lust had transgressed that command
   which had been for a long while kept by a natural instinct from the
   beginning of the world, it was needful that it should afterwards be
   restored by the letter of the law: "Thou shalt not give thy daughter to
   his son to wife, nor shalt thou take a wife of his daughters to thy
   son; for they shall seduce your hearts to depart from your God, and to
   follow their gods and serve them." [475]

  CHAPTER XXII.

    An objection, as to how an unlawful intermingling with the daughters of Cain
    could be charged against the line of Seth before the prohibition of the law.

   GERMANUS: If that command had been given to them, then the sin of
   breaking it might fairly have been brought against them for their
   audacity in so marrying. But since the observance of that separation
   had not yet been established by any rule, how could that intermingling
   of races be counted wrong in them, as it had not been forbidden by any
   command? For a law does not ordinarily forbid crimes that are past, but
   those that are future.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    The answer, that by the law of nature men were from the beginning liable to
    judgment and punishment.

   SERENUS: God at man's creation implanted in him naturally complete
   knowledge of the law, and if this had been kept by man, as at the
   beginning, according to the Lord's purposes, there would not have been
   any need for another law to be given, which He afterwards proclaimed in
   writing: for it were superfluous for an external remedy to be offered,
   where an internal one was still implanted and vigorous. But since this
   had been, as we have said, utterly corrupted by freedom and the
   opportunity of sinning, the severe restrictions of the law of Moses
   were added as the executor and vindicator of this (earlier law) and to
   use the expressions of Scripture, as its helper, that through fear of
   immediate punishment men might be kept from altogether losing the good
   of natural knowledge, according to the word of the prophet who says "He
   gave the law to help them:" [476] and it is also described by the
   Apostle as having been given as a schoolmaster [477] to little
   children, as it instructs and guards them to prevent them from
   departing through sheer forgetfulness from the teaching in which they
   had been instructed by the light of nature: for that the complete
   knowledge of the law was implanted in man at his first creation, is
   clearly proved from this; viz., that we know that before the law, aye,
   and even before the flood, all holy men observed the commands of the
   law without having the letter to read. For how could Abel, without the
   command of the law, have known that he ought to offer to God a
   sacrifice of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof, [478]
   unless he had been taught by the law which was naturally implanted in
   him? How could Noah have distinguished what animals were clean and what
   were unclean, [479] when the commandment of the law had not yet made a
   distinction, unless he had been taught by a natural knowledge? Whence
   did Enoch learn how to "walk with God," [480] having never acquired any
   light of the law from another? Where had Shem and Japheth read "Thou
   shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father," so that they went
   backwards and covered the shame of their father? [481] How was Abraham
   taught to abstain from the spoils of the enemy which were offered to
   him, that he might not receive any recompense for his toil, or to pay
   to the priest Melchizedec the tithes which are ordered by the law of
   Moses? [482] How was it too that the same Abraham and Lot also humbly
   offered to passers by and strangers offices of kindness and the washing
   of their feet, while yet the Evangelic command had not shone forth?
   [483] Whence did Job obtain such earnestness of faith, such purity of
   chastity, such knowledge of humility, gentleness, pity and kindness, as
   we now see shown not even by those who know the gospels by heart? Which
   of the saints do we read of as not having observed some commandment of
   the law before the giving of the law? Which of them failed to keep
   this: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord?" [484] Which of
   them did not fulfil this: "Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven
   image, nor the likeness of anything which is in heaven or in the earth
   or under the earth?" Which of them did not observe this: "Honour thy
   father and thy mother," or what follows in the Decalogue: "Thou shalt
   do no murder; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal;
   Thou shalt not bear false witness; Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's
   wife," [485] and many other things besides, in which they anticipated
   the commands not only of the law but even of the gospel?

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    Of the fact that they were justly punished, who sinned before the flood.

   AND so then we see that from the beginning God created everything
   perfect, nor would there have been need for anything to have been added
   to His original arrangement--as if it were shortsighted and
   imperfect--if everything had continued in that state and condition in
   which it had been created by Him. And therefore in the case of those
   who sinned before the law and even before the flood we see that God
   visited them with a righteous judgment, because they deserved to be
   punished without any excuse, for having transgressed the law of nature;
   nor should we fall into the blasphemous slanders of those who are
   ignorant of this reason, and so depreciate the God of the Old
   Testament, and run down our faith, and say with a sneer: Why then did
   it please your God to will to promulgate the law after so many thousand
   years, while He suffered such long ages to pass without any law? But if
   He afterwards discovered something better, then it appears that at the
   beginning of the world His wisdom was inferior and poorer, and that
   afterwards as if taught by experience He began to provide for something
   better, and to amend and improve His original arrangements. A thing
   which certainly cannot happen to the infinite foreknowledge of God, nor
   can these assertions be made about Him by the mad folly of heretics
   without grievous blasphemy, as Ecclesiastes says: "I have learnt that
   all the words which God hath made from the beginning shall continue
   forever: nothing can be added to them, and nothing can be taken away
   from them," [486] and therefore "the law is not made for the righteous,
   but for the unrighteous, and insubordinate, for the ungodly and
   sinners, for the wicked and profane." [487] For as they had the sound
   and complete system of natural laws implanted in them they had no need
   of this external law in addition, and one committed to writing, and
   what was given as an aid to that natural law. From which we infer by
   the clearest of reasonings that that law committed to writing need not
   have been given at the beginning (for it was unnecessary for this to be
   done while the natural law still remained, and was not utterly
   violated) nor could evangelical perfection have been granted before the
   law had been kept. For they could not have listened to this saying: "If
   a man strikes thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also,"
   [488] who were not content to avenge wrongs done to them with the even
   justice of the lex talionis, but repaid a very slight touch with deadly
   kicks and wounds with weapons, and for a single truth sought to take
   the life of those who had struck them. Nor could it be said to them,
   "love your enemies," [489] among whom it was considered a great thing
   and most important if they loved their friends, but avoided their
   enemies and dissented from them only in hatred without being eager to
   oppress and kill them.

  CHAPTER XXV.

    How this that is said of the devil in the gospel is to be understood; viz.,
    that "he is a liar, and his father."

   BUT as for this which disturbed you about the devil, that "he is a liar
   and his father," [490] as if it seemed that he and his father were
   pronounced by the Lord to be liars, it is sufficiently ridiculous to
   imagine this even cursorily. For as we said a little while ago spirit
   does not beget spirit just as soul cannot procreate soul, though we do
   not doubt that the compacting of flesh is formed from man's seed, as
   the Apostle clearly distinguishes in the case of both substances; viz.,
   flesh and spirit, what should be ascribed to whom as its author, and
   says: "Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and
   we reverenced them: shall we not much more be in subjection to the
   Father of spirits and live?" [491] What could show more clearly than
   this distinction, that he laid down that men were the fathers of our
   flesh, but always taught that God alone was the Father of souls.
   Although even in the actual compacting of this body a ministerial
   office alone must be attributed to men, but the chief part of its
   formation to God the Creator of all, as David says: "Thy hands have
   made me and fashioned me:" [492] And the blessed Job: "Hast thou not
   milked me as milk, and curdled me as cheese? Thou hast put me together
   with bones and sinews;" [493] and the Lord to Jeremiah: "Before I
   formed thee in the womb, I knew thee." [494] But Ecclesiastes very
   clearly and accurately gathers the nature of either substance, and its
   beginning, by an examination of the rise and commencement, from which
   each originated, and by a consideration of the end to which each is
   tending, and decides also of the division of this body and soul, and
   discourses as follows: "Before the dust returns to the earth as it was,
   and the spirit returns unto God who gave it." [495] But what could be
   said with greater plainness than that he declares that the matter of
   the flesh which he styled dust, because it springs from the seed of
   man, and seems to be sown by his ministration, must, as it was taken
   from the earth, again return to the earth, while he points out that the
   spirit which is not begotten by intercourse between the sexes, but
   belongs to God alone in a special way, returns to its creator? And this
   also is clearly implied in that breathing by God, through which Adam in
   the first instance received his life. And so from these passages we
   clearly infer that no one can be called the Father of spirits but God
   alone, who makes them out of nothing whenever He pleases, while men can
   only be termed the fathers of our flesh. So then the devil also in as
   much as he was created a spirit or an angel and good, had no one as his
   Father but God his Maker. But when he had become puffed up by pride and
   had said in his heart: "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
   I will be like the Most High," [496] he became a liar, and "abode not
   in the truth;" [497] but brought forth a lie from his own storehouse of
   wickedness and so became not only a liar, but also the father of the
   actual lie, by which when he promised Divinity to man and said "Ye
   shall be as gods," [498] he abode not in the truth, but from the
   beginning became a murderer, both by bringing Adam into a state of
   mortality, and by slaying Abel by the hand of his brother at his
   suggestion. But already the approach of dawn is bringing to a close our
   discussion, which has occupied nearly two whole nights, and our brief
   and simple words have drawn our bark of this Conference from the deep
   sea of questions to a safe harbour of silence, in which deep indeed, as
   the breath of the Divine Spirit drives us further in, so is there ever
   opened out a wider and boundless space reaching beyond the sight of our
   eye, and, as Solomon says, "It will become much further from us than it
   was, and a great depth; who shall find it out?" [499] Wherefore let us
   pray the Lord that both His fear and His love, which cannot fail, may
   continue steadfast in us, and make us wise in all things, and ever
   shield us unharmed, from the darts of the devil. For with these guards
   it is impossible for anyone to fall into the snares of death. But there
   is this difference between the perfect and imperfect, that in the case
   of the former love is steadfast, and so to speak riper and lasts more
   abidingly and so makes them persevere in holiness more steadfastly and
   more easily, while in the case of the latter its position is weaker and
   it more easily grows cold, and so quickly and more frequently allows
   them to be entangled in the snares of sin. And when we heard this, the
   words of this Conference so fired us that when we went away from the
   old man's cell we longed with a keener ardour of soul than when we
   first came, for the fulfilment of his teaching.

THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT ISAAC.

ON PRAYER.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Introduction to the Conference.

   WHAT was promised in the second book of the Institutes [500] on
   continual and unceasing perseverance in prayer, shall be by the Lord's
   help fulfilled by the Conferences of this Elder, whom we will now bring
   forward; viz., Abbot Isaac: [501] and when these have been propounded I
   think that I shall have satisfied the commands of Pope Castor of
   blessed memory, and your wishes, O blessed Pope Leontius and holy
   brother Helladius, and the length of the book in its earlier part may
   be excused, though, in spite of our endeavour not only to compress what
   had to be told into a brief discourse, but also to pass over very many
   points in silence, it has been extended to a greater length than we
   intended. For having commenced with a full discourse on various
   regulations which we have thought it well to curtail for the sake of
   brevity, at the close the blessed Isaac spoke these words.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [500] See the Institutes Book II. c. ix.

   [501] Isaac was, as we gather from c. xxxi., a disciple of St. Antony,
   and is mentioned by Palladius Dial. de vita Chrysost. There are also a
   few stories of him in the Apophthegmata Patrum (Migne, Vol. lxv. p.
   223); and see the Dictionary of Christian Biography, Vol. iii. p. 294.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    The words of Abbot Isaac on the nature of prayer.

   THE aim of every monk and the perfection of his heart tends to
   continual and unbroken perseverance in prayer, and, as far as it is
   allowed to human frailty, strives to acquire an immovable tranquillity
   of mind and a perpetual purity, for the sake of which we seek
   unweariedly and constantly to practise all bodily labours as well as
   contrition of spirit. And there is between these two a sort of
   reciprocal and inseparable union. For just as the crown of the building
   of all virtues is the perfection of prayer, so unless everything has
   been united and compacted by this as its crown, it cannot possibly
   continue strong and stable. For lasting and continual calmness in
   prayer, of which we are speaking, cannot be secured or consummated
   without them, so neither can those virtues which lay its foundations be
   fully gained without persistence in it. And so we shall not be able
   either to treat properly of the effect of prayer, or in a rapid
   discourse to penetrate to its main end, which is acquired by labouring
   at all virtues, unless first all those things which for its sake must
   be either rejected or secured, are singly enumerated and discussed,
   and, as the Parable in the gospel teaches, [502] whatever concerns the
   building of that spiritual and most lofty tower, is reckoned up and
   carefully considered beforehand. But yet these things when prepared
   will be of no use nor allow the lofty height of perfection to be
   properly placed upon them unless a clearance of all faults be first
   undertaken, and the decayed and dead rubbish of the passions be dug up,
   and the strong foundations of simplicity and humility be laid on the
   solid and (so to speak) living soil of our breast, or rather on that
   rock of the gospel, [503] and by being built in this way this tower of
   spiritual virtues will rise, and be able to stand unmoved, and be
   raised to the utmost heights of heaven in full assurance of its,
   stability. For if it rests on such foundations, then though heavy
   storms of passions break over it, though mighty torrents of
   persecutions beat against it like a battering ram, though a furious
   tempest of spiritual foes dash against it and attack it, yet not only
   will no ruin overtake it, but the onslaught will not injure it even in
   the slightest degree.

  CHAPTER III.

    How pure and sincere prayer can be gained.

   And therefore in order that prayer may be offered up with that
   earnestness and purity with which it ought to be, we must by all means
   observe these rules. First all anxiety about carnal things must be
   entirely got rid of; next we must leave no room for not merely the care
   but even the recollection of any business affairs, and in like manner
   also must lay aside all backbitings, vain and incessant chattering, and
   buffoonery; anger above all and disturbing moroseness must be entirely
   destroyed, and the deadly taint of carnal lust and covetousness be torn
   up by the roots. And so when these and such like faults which are also
   visible to the eyes of men, are entirely removed and cut off, and when
   such a purification and cleansing, as we spoke of, has first taken
   place, which is brought about by pure simplicity and innocence, then
   first there must be laid the secure foundations of a deep humility,
   which may be able to support a tower that shall reach the sky; and next
   the spiritual structure of the virtues must be built up upon them, and
   the soul kept free from all conversation and from roving thoughts that
   thus it may by little and little begin to rise to the contemplation of
   God and to spiritual insight. For whatever our mind has been thinking
   of before the hour of prayer, is sure to occur to us while we are
   praying through the activity of the memory. Wherefore what we want to
   find ourselves like while we are praying, that we ought to prepare
   ourselves to be before the time for prayer. For the mind in prayer is
   formed by its previous condition, and when we are applying ourselves to
   prayer the images of the same actions and words and thoughts will dance
   before our eyes, and make us either angry, as in our previous
   condition, or gloomy, or recall our former lust and business, or make
   us shake with foolish laughter (which I am ashamed to speak of) at some
   silly joke, or smile at some action, or fly back to our previous
   conversation. And therefore if we do not want anything to haunt us
   while we are praying, we should be careful before our prayer, to
   exclude it from the shrine of our heart, that we may thus fulfill the
   Apostle's injunction: "Pray without ceasing;" and: "In every place
   lifting up holy hands without wrath or disputing." [504] For otherwise
   we shall not be able to carry out that charge unless our mind, purified
   from all stains of sin, and given over to virtue as to its natural
   good, feed on the continual contemplation of Almighty God.

  CHAPTER IV.

    Of the lightness of the soul which may be compared to a wing or feather.

   FOR the nature of the soul is not inaptly compared to a very fine
   feather or very light wing, which, if it has not been damaged or
   affected by being spoilt by any moisture falling on it from without, is
   borne aloft almost naturally to the heights of heaven by the lightness
   of its nature, and the aid of the slightest breath: but if it is
   weighted by any moisture falling upon it and penetrating into it, it
   will not only not be carried away by its natural lightness into any
   aerial flights but will actually be borne down to the depths of earth
   by the weight of the moisture it has received. So also our soul, if it
   is not weighted with faults that touch it, and the cares of this world,
   or damaged by the moisture of injurious lusts, will be raised as it
   were by the natural blessing of its own purity and borne aloft to the
   heights by the light breath of spiritual meditation; and leaving things
   low and earthly will be transported to those that are heavenly and
   invisible. Wherefore we are well warned by the Lord's command: "Take
   heed that your hearts be not weighed down by surfeiting and drunkenness
   and the cares of this world." [505] And therefore if we want our
   prayers to reach not only the sky, but what is beyond the sky, let us
   be careful to reduce our soul, purged from all earthly faults and
   purified from every stain, to its natural lightness, that so our prayer
   may rise to God unchecked by the weight of any sin.

  CHAPTER V.

    Of the ways in which our soul is weighed down.

   BUT we should notice the ways in which the Lord points out that the
   soul is weighed down: for He did not mention adultery, or fornication,
   or murder, or blasphemy, or rapine, which everybody knows to be deadly
   and damnable, but surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares or
   anxieties of this world: which men of this world are so far from
   avoiding or considering damnable that actually some who (I am ashamed
   to say) call themselves monks entangle themselves in these very
   occupations as if they were harmless or useful. And though these three
   things, when literally given way to weigh down the soul, and separate
   it from God, and bear it down to things earthly, yet it is very easy to
   avoid them, especially for us who are separated by so great a distance
   from all converse with this world, and who do not on any occasion have
   anything to do with those visible cares and drunkenness and surfeiting.
   But there is another surfeiting which is no less dangerous, and a
   spiritual drunkenness which it is harder to avoid, and a care and
   anxiety of this world, which often ensnares us even after the perfect
   renunciation of all our goods, and abstinence from wine and all
   feastings and even when we are living in solitude--and of such the
   prophet says: "Awake, ye that are drunk but not with wine;" [506] and
   another: "Be astonished and wonder and stagger: be drunk and not with
   wine: be moved, but not with drunkenness." [507] And of this
   drunkenness the wine must consequently be what the prophet calls "the
   fury of dragons": and from what root the wine comes you may hear: "From
   the vineyard of Sodom," he says, "is their vine, and their branches
   from Gomorrha." Would you also know about the fruit of that vine and
   the seed of that branch? "Their grape is a grape of gall, theirs is a
   cluster of bitterness" [508] for unless we are altogether cleansed from
   all faults and abstaining from the surfeit of all passions, our heart
   will without drunkenness from wine and excess of any feasting be
   weighed down by a drunkenness and surfeiting that is still more
   dangerous. For that worldly cares can sometimes fall on us who mix with
   no actions of this world, is clearly shown according to the rule of the
   Elders, who have laid down that anything which goes beyond the
   necessities of daily food, and the unavoidable needs of the flesh,
   belongs to worldly cares and anxieties, as for example if, when a job
   bringing in a penny would satisfy the needs of our body, we try to
   extend it by a longer toil and work in order to get twopence or
   threepence; and when a covering of two tunics would be enough for our
   use both by night and day, we manage to become the owners of three or
   four, or when a hut containing one or two cells would be sufficient, in
   the pride of worldly ambition and greatness we build four or five
   cells, and these splendidly decorated, and larger than our needs
   required, thus showing the passion of worldly lusts whenever we can.

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of the vision which a certain Elder saw concerning the restless work of a
    brother.

   AND that this is not done without the prompting of devils we are taught
   by the surest proofs, for when one very highly esteemed Elder was
   passing by the cell of a certain brother who was suffering from this
   mental disease of which we have spoken, as he was restlessly toiling in
   his daily occupations in building and repairing what was unnecessary,
   he watched him from a distance breaking a very hard stone with a heavy
   hammer, and saw a certain Ethiopian standing over him and together with
   him striking the blows of the hammer with joined and clasped hands, and
   urging him on with fiery incitements to diligence in the work: and so
   he stood still for a long while in astonishment at the force of the
   fierce demon and the deceitfulness of such an illusion. For when the
   brother was worn out and tired and wanted to rest and put an end to his
   toil, he was stimulated by the spirit's prompting and urged on to
   resume his hammer again and not to cease from devoting himself to the
   work which he had begun, so that being unweariedly supported by his
   incitements he did not feel the harm that so great labour was doing
   him. At last then the old man, disgusted at such a horrid mystification
   by a demon, turned aside to the brother's cell and saluted him, and
   asked "what work is it, brother, that you are doing?" and he replied:
   "We are working at this awfully hard stone, and we can hardly break it
   at all." Whereupon the Elder replied: "You were right in saying `we
   can,' for you were not alone, when you were striking it, but there was
   another with you whom you did not see, who was standing over you not so
   much to help you as urge you on with all his force." And thus the fact
   that the disease of worldly vanity has not got hold of our hearts, will
   be proved by no mere abstinence from those affairs which even if we
   want to engage in, we cannot carry out, nor by the despising of those
   matters which if we pursued them would make us remarkable in the front
   rank among spiritual persons as well as among worldly men, but only
   when we reject with inflexible firmness of mind whatever ministers to
   our power and seems to be veiled in a show of right. And in reality
   these things which seem trivial and of no consequence, and which we see
   to be permitted indifferently by those who belong to our calling, none
   the less by their character affect the soul than those more important
   things, which according to their condition usually intoxicate the
   senses of worldly people and which do not allow [509] a monk to lay
   aside earthly impurities and aspire to God, on whom his attention
   should ever be fixed; for in his case even a slight separation from
   that highest good must be regarded as present death and most dangerous
   destruction. And when the soul has been established in such a peaceful
   condition, and has been freed from the meshes of all carnal desires,
   and the purpose of the heart has been steadily fixed on that which is
   the only highest good, he will then fulfil this Apostolic precept:
   "Pray without ceasing;" and: "in every place lifting up holy hands
   without wrath and disputing:" [510] for when by this purity (if we can
   say so) the thoughts of the soul are engrossed, and are re-fashioned
   out of their earthly condition to bear a spiritual and angelic
   likeness, whatever it receives, whatever it takes in hand, whatever it
   does, the prayer will be perfectly pure and sincere.

  CHAPTER VII.

    A question how it is that it is harder work to preserve than to originate
    good thoughts.

   GERMANUS: If only we could keep as a lasting possession those spiritual
   thoughts in the same way and with the same ease with which we generally
   conceive their germs! for when they have been conceived in our hearts
   either through the recollection of the Scriptures or by the memory of
   some spiritual actions, or by gazing upon heavenly mysteries, they
   vanish all too soon and disappear by a sort of unnoticed flight. And
   when our soul has discovered some other occasions for spiritual
   emotions, different ones again crowd in upon us, and those which we had
   grasped are scattered, and lightly fly away so that the mind retaining
   no persistency, and keeping of its own power no firm hand over holy
   thoughts, must be thought, even when it does seem to retain them for a
   while, to have conceived them at random and not of set purpose. For how
   can we think that their rise should be ascribed to our own will, if
   they do not last and remain with us? But that we may not owing to the
   consideration of this question wander any further from the plan of the
   discourse we had commenced, or delay any longer the explanation
   promised of the nature of prayer, we will keep this for its own time,
   and ask to be informed at once of the character of prayer, especially
   as the blessed Apostle exhorts us at no time to cease from it, saying
   "Pray without ceasing." And so we want to be taught first of its
   character, i.e., how prayer ought always to be offered up, and then how
   we can secure this, whatever it is, and practise it without ceasing.
   For that it cannot be done by any light purpose of heart both daily
   experience and the explanation of your holiness show us, as you have
   laid it down that the aim of a monk, and the height of all perfection
   consist in the consummation of prayer.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of the different characters of prayer.

   ISAAC: I imagine that all kinds of prayers cannot be grasped without
   great purity of heart and soul and the illumination of the Holy Spirit.
   For there are as many of them as there can be conditions and characters
   produced in one soul or rather in all souls. And so although we know
   that owing to our dulness of heart we cannot see all kinds of prayers,
   yet we will try to relate them in some order, as far as our slender
   experience enables us to succeed. For according to the degree of the
   purity to which each soul attains, and the character of the state in
   which it is sunk owing to what happens to it, or is by its own efforts
   renewing itself, its very prayers will each moment be altered: and
   therefore it is quite clear that no one can always offer up uniform
   prayers. For every one prays in one way when he is brisk, in another
   when he is oppressed with a weight of sadness or despair, in another
   when he is invigorated by spiritual achievements, in another when cast
   down by the burden of attacks, in another when he is asking pardon for
   his sins, in another when he asks to obtain grace or some virtue or
   else prays for the destruction of some sin, in another when he is
   pricked to the heart by the thought of hell and the fear of future
   judgment, in another when he is aglow with the hope and desire of good
   things to come, in another when he is taken up with affairs and
   dangers, in another when he is in peace and security, in another when
   he is enlightened by the revelation of heavenly mysteries, and in
   another when he is depressed by a sense of barrenness in virtues and
   dryness in feeling.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    Of the fourfold nature of prayer.

   AND therefore, when we have laid this down with regard to the character
   of prayer, although not so fully as the importance of the subject
   requires, but as fully as the exigencies of time permit, and at any
   rate as our slender abilities admit, and our dulness of heart enables
   us,--a still greater difficulty now awaits us; viz., to expound one by
   one the different kinds of prayer, which the Apostle divides in a
   fourfold manner, when he says as follows: "I exhort therefore first of
   all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made."
   [511] And we cannot possibly doubt that this division was not idly made
   by the Apostle. And to begin with we must investigate what is meant by
   supplication, by prayer, by intercession, and by thanksgiving. Next we
   must inquire whether these four kinds are to be taken in hand by him
   who prays all at once, i.e., are they all to be joined together in
   every prayer,--or whether they are to be offered up in turns and one by
   one, as, for instance, ought at one time supplications, at another
   prayers, at another intercessions, and at another thanksgivings to be
   offered, or should one man present to God supplications, another
   prayers, another intercessions, another thanksgivings, in accordance
   with that measure of age, to which each soul is advancing by
   earnestness of purpose?

  CHAPTER X.

    Of the order of the different kinds laid down with regard to the character
    of prayer.

   AND so to begin with we must consider the actual force of the names and
   words, and discuss what is the difference between prayer and
   supplication and intercession; then in like manner we must investigate
   whether they are to be offered separately or all together; and in the
   third place must examine whether the particular order which is thus
   arranged by the Apostle's authority has anything further to teach the
   hearer, or whether the distinction simply is to be taken, and it should
   be considered that they were arranged by him indifferently in such a
   way: a thing which seems to me utterly absurd. For one must not believe
   that the Holy Spirit uttered anything casually or without reason
   through the Apostle. And so we will, as the Lord grants us, consider
   them in the same order in which we began.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    Of Supplications.

   "I EXHORT therefore first of all that supplications be made."
   Supplication is an imploring or petition concerning sins, in which one
   who is sorry for his present or past deeds asks for pardon.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    Of Prayer.

   PRAYERS are those by which we offer or vow something to God, what the
   Greeks call euch, i.e., a vow. For where we read in Greek `ias eucas
   mou tw Kuriw apodwsw, in Latin we read: "I will pay my vows unto the
   Lord;" [512] where according to the exact force of the words it may be
   thus represented: "I will pay my prayers unto the Lord." And this which
   we find in Ecclesiastes: "If thou vowest a vow unto the Lord do not
   delay to pay it," is written in Greek likewise: ean euxe euchn tw
   Kuriw, i.e., "If thou prayest a prayer unto the Lord, do not delay to
   pay it," [513] which will be fulfilled in this way by each one of us.
   We pray, when we renounce this world and promise that being dead to all
   worldly actions and the life of this world we will serve the Lord with
   full purpose of heart. We pray when we promise that despising secular
   honours and scorning earthly riches we will cleave to the Lord in all
   sorrow of heart and humility of spirit. We pray when we promise that we
   will ever maintain the most perfect purity of body and steadfast
   patience, or when we vow that we will utterly root out of our heart the
   roots of anger or of sorrow that worketh death. And if, enervated by
   sloth and returning to our former sins we fail to do this we shall be
   guilty as regards our prayers and vows, and these words will apply to
   us: "It is better not to vow, than to vow and not to pay," which can be
   rendered in accordance with the Greek: "It is better for thee not to
   pray than to pray and not to pay." [514]


  CHAPTER XIII.

    Of Intercession.

   IN the third place stand intercessions, which we are wont to offer up
   for others also, while we are filled with fervour of spirit, making
   request either for those dear to us or for the peace of the whole
   world, and to use the Apostle's own phrase, we pray "for all men, for
   kings and all that are in authority." [515]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

    Of Thanksgiving.

   THEN in the fourth place there stand thanksgivings which the mind in
   ineffable transports offers up to God, either when it recalls God's
   past benefits or when it contemplates His present ones, or when it
   looks forward to those great ones in the future which God has prepared
   for them that love Him. And with this purpose too sometimes we are wont
   to pour forth richer prayers, while, as we gaze with pure eyes on those
   rewards of the saints which are laid up in store hereafter, our spirit
   is stimulated to offer up unspeakable thanks to God with boundless joy.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

    Whether these four kinds of prayers are necessary for everyone to offer all
    at once or separately and in turns.

   AND of these four kinds, although sometimes occasions arise for richer
   and fuller prayers (for from the class of supplications which arises
   from sorrow for sin, and from the kind of prayer which flows from
   confidence in our offerings and the performance of our vows in
   accordance with a pure conscience, and from the intercession which
   proceeds from fervour of love, and from the thanksgiving which is born
   of the consideration of God's blessings and His greatness and goodness,
   we know that oftentimes there proceed most fervent and ardent prayers
   so that it is clear that all these kinds of prayer of which we have
   spoken are found to be useful and needful for all men, so that in one
   and the same man his changing feelings will give utterance to pure and
   fervent petitions now of supplications, now of prayers, now of
   intercessions) yet the first seems to belong more especially to
   beginners, who are still troubled by the stings and recollection of
   their sins; the second to those who have already attained some
   loftiness of mind in their spiritual progress and the quest of virtue;
   the third to those who fulfil the completion of their vows by their
   works, and are so stimulated to intercede for others also through the
   consideration of their weakness, and the earnestness of their love; the
   fourth to those who have already torn from their hearts the guilty
   thorns of conscience, and thus being now free from care can contemplate
   with a pure mind the beneficence of God and His compassions, which He
   has either granted in the past, or is giving in the present, or
   preparing for the future, and thus are borne onward with fervent hearts
   to that ardent prayer which cannot be embraced or expressed by the
   mouth of men. Sometimes however the mind which is advancing to that
   perfect state of purity and which is already beginning to be
   established in it, will take in all these at one and the same time, and
   like some incomprehensible and all-devouring flame, dart through them
   all and offer up to God inexpressible prayers of the purest force,
   which the Spirit Itself, intervening with groanings that cannot be
   uttered, while we ourselves understand not, pours forth to God,
   grasping at that hour and ineffably pouring forth in its supplications
   things so great that they cannot be uttered with the mouth nor even at
   any other time be recollected by the mind. And thence it comes that in
   whatever degree any one stands, he is found sometimes to offer up pure
   and devout prayers; as even in that first and lowly station which has
   to do with the recollection of future judgment, he who still remains
   under the punishment of terror and the fear of judgment is so smitten
   with sorrow for the time being that he is filled with no less keenness
   of spirit from the richness of his supplications than he who through
   the purity of his heart gazes on and considers the blessings of God and
   is overcome with ineffable joy and delight. For, as the Lord Himself
   says, he begins to love the more, who knows that he has been forgiven
   the more. [516]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [516] Cf. S. Luke 7:47.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    Of the kinds of prayer to which we ought to direct ourselves.

   YET we ought by advancing in life and attaining to virtue to aim rather
   at those kinds of prayer which are poured forth either from the
   contemplation of the good things to come or from fervour of love, or
   which at least, to speak more humbly and in accordance with the measure
   of beginners, arise for the acquirement of some virtue or the
   extinction of some fault. For otherwise we shall not possibly attain to
   those sublimer kinds of supplication of which we spoke, unless our mind
   has been little by little and by degrees raised through the regular
   course of those intercessions.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

    How the four kinds of supplication were originated by the Lord.

   THESE four kinds of supplication the Lord Himself by His own example
   vouchsafed to originate for us, so that in this too He might fulfil
   that which was said of Him: "which Jesus began both to do and to
   teach." [517] For He made use of the class of supplication when He
   said: "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;" or this
   which is chanted in His Person in the Psalm: "My God, My God, look upon
   Me, why hast Thou forsaken me," [518] and others like it. It is prayer
   where He says: "I have magnified Thee upon the earth, I have finished
   the work which Thou gavest Me to do," and this: "And for their sakes I
   sanctify Myself that they also may be sanctified in the truth." [519]
   It is intercession when He says: "Father, those Whom Thou hast given
   me, I will that they also may be with Me that they may see My glory
   which Thou hast given Me;" or at any rate when He says: "Father,
   forgive them for they know not what they do." [520] It is thanksgiving
   when He says: "I confess to Thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
   that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
   revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy
   sight:" or at least when He says: "Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast
   heard Me. But I knew that Thou hearest Me always." [521] But though our
   Lord made a distinction between these four kinds of prayers as to be
   offered separately and one by one according to the scheme which we know
   of, yet that they can all be embraced in a perfect prayer at one and
   the same time He showed by His own example in that prayer which at the
   close of S. John's gospel we read that He offered up with such fulness.
   From the words of which (as it is too long to repeat it all) the
   careful inquirer can discover by the order of the passage that this is
   so. And the Apostle also in his Epistle to the Philippians has
   expressed the same meaning, by putting these four kinds of prayers in a
   slightly different order, and has shown that they ought sometimes to be
   offered together in the fervour of a single prayer, saying as follows:
   "But in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let
   your requests be made known unto God." [522] And by this he wanted us
   especially to understand that in prayer and supplication thanksgiving
   ought to be mingled with our requests.

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    Of the Lord's Prayer.

   AND so there follows after these different kinds of supplication a
   still more sublime and exalted condition which is brought about by the
   contemplation of God alone and by fervent love, by which the mind,
   transporting and flinging itself into love for Him, addresses God most
   familiarly as its own Father with a piety of its own. And that we ought
   earnestly to seek after this condition the formula of the Lord's prayer
   teaches us, saying "Our Father." When then we confess with our own
   mouths that the God and Lord of the universe is our Father, we profess
   forthwith that we have been called from our condition as slaves to the
   adoption of sons, adding next "Which art in heaven," that, by shunning
   with the utmost horror all lingering in this present life, which we
   pass upon this earth as a pilgrimage, and what separates us by a great
   distance from our Father, we may the rather hasten with all eagerness
   to that country where we confess that our Father dwells, and may not
   allow anything of this kind, which would make us unworthy of this our
   profession and the dignity of an adoption of this kind, and so deprive
   us as a disgrace to our Father's inheritance, and make us incur the
   wrath of His justice and severity. To which state and condition of
   sonship when we have advanced, we shall forthwith be inflamed with the
   piety which belongs to good sons, so that we shall bend all our
   energies to the advance not of our own profit, but of our Father's
   glory, saying to Him: "Hallowed be Thy name," testifying that our
   desire and our joy is His glory, becoming imitators of Him who said:
   "He who speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory. But He who seeks
   the glory of Him who sent Him, the same is true and there is no
   unrighteousness in Him." [523] Finally the chosen vessel being filled
   with this feeling wished that he could be anathema from Christ [524] if
   only the people belonging to Him might be increased and multiplied, and
   the salvation of the whole nation of Israel accrue to the glory of His
   Father; for with all assurance could he wish to die for Christ as he
   knew that no one perished for life. And again he says: "We rejoice when
   we are weak but ye are strong." [525] And what wonder if the chosen
   vessel wished to be anathema from Christ for the sake of Christ's glory
   and the conversion of His own brethren and the privilege of the nation,
   when the prophet Micah wished that he might be a liar and a stranger to
   the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, if only the people of the Jews might
   escape those plagues and the going forth into captivity which he had
   announced in his prophecy, saying: "Would that I were not a man that
   hath the Spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie;" [526] --to pass over
   that wish of the Lawgiver, who did not refuse to die together with his
   brethren who were doomed to death, saying: "I beseech Thee, O Lord;
   this people hath sinned a heinous sin; either forgive them this
   trespass, or if Thou do not, blot me out of Thy book which Thou hast
   written." [527] But where it is said "Hallowed be Thy name," it may
   also be very fairly taken in this way: "The hallowing of God is our
   perfection." And so when we say to Him" Hallowed be Thy name" we say in
   other words, make us, O Father, such that we maybe able both to
   understand and take in what the hallowing of Thee is, or at any rate
   that Thou mayest be seen to be hallowed in our spiritual converse. And
   this is effectually fulfilled in our case when "men see our good works,
   and glorify our Father Which is in heaven." [528]

  CHAPTER XIX.

    Of the clause "Thy kingdom come."

   THE second petition of the pure heart desires that the kingdom of its
   Father may come at once; viz., either that whereby Christ reigns day by
   day in the saints (which comes to pass when the devil's rule is cast
   out of our hearts by the destruction of foul sins, and God begins to
   hold sway over us by the sweet odour of virtues, and, fornication being
   overcome, charity reigns in our hearts together with tranquillity, when
   rage is conquered; and humility, when pride is trampled under foot) or
   else that which is promised in due time to all who are perfect, and to
   all the sons of God, when it will be said to them by Christ: "Come ye
   blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
   foundation of the world;" [529] (as the heart) with fixed and steadfast
   gaze, so to speak, yearns and longs for it and says to Him "Thy kingdom
   come." For it knows by the witness of its own conscience that when He
   shall appear, it will presently share His lot. For no guilty person
   would dare either to say or to wish for this, for no one would want to
   face the tribunal of the Judge, who knew that at His coming he would
   forthwith receive not the prize or reward of his merits but only
   punishment.

  CHAPTER XX.

    Of the clause "Thy will be done."

   THE third petition is that of sons: "Thy will be done as in heaven so
   on earth." There can now be no grander prayer than to wish that earthly
   things may be made equal with things heavenly: for what else is it to
   say "Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth," than to ask that men
   may be like angels and that as God's will is ever fulfilled by them in
   heaven, so also all those who are on earth may do not their own but His
   will? This too no one could say from the heart but only one who
   believed that God disposes for our good all things which are seen,
   whether fortunate or unfortunate, and that He is more careful and
   provident for our good and salvation than we ourselves are for
   ourselves. Or at any rate it may be taken in this way: The will of God
   is the salvation of all men, according to these words of the blessed
   Paul: "Who willeth all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of
   the truth." [530] Of which will also the prophet Isaiah says in the
   Person of God the Father: "And all Thy will shall be done." [531] When
   we say then "Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth," we pray in
   other words for this; viz., that as those who are in heaven, so also
   may all those who dwell on earth be saved, O Father, by the knowledge
   of Thee.

  CHAPTER XXI.

    Of our supersubstantial or daily bread.

   NEXT: "Give us this day our bread which is epiousion," i.e.,
   "supersubstantial," which another Evangelist calls "daily." [532] The
   former indicates the quality of its nobility and substance, in virtue
   of which it is above all substances and the loftiness of its grandeur
   and holiness exceeds all creatures, while the latter intimates the
   purpose of its use and value. For where it says "daily" it shows that
   without it we cannot live a spiritual life for a single day. Where it
   says "today" it shows that it must be received daily and that
   yesterday's supply of it is not enough, but at it must be given to us
   today also in like manner. And our daily need of it suggests to us that
   we ought at all times to offer up this prayer, because there is no day
   on which we have no need to strengthen the heart of our inner man, by
   eating and receiving it, although the expression used, "today" may be
   taken to apply to his present life, i.e., while we are living in this
   world supply us with this bread. For we know that it will be given to
   those who deserve it by Thee hereafter, but we ask that Thou wouldest
   grant it to us today, because unless it has been vouchsafed to a man to
   receive it in this life he will never be partaker of it in that.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [532] Here Cassian is relying entirely on Jerome's revised text of the
   Latin, which has supersubstantialis in S. Matt. 6:11, as the rendering
   of epiousios but translates the same word by quotidianum in the
   parallel passage in S. Luke 11:3. It is curious that Cassian should
   have been thus misled, with his knowledge of Greek, as well as his
   acquaintance with the old Latin version which has quotidianum in both
   gospels. Cf. Bishop Lightfoot "On a Fresh Revision of the New
   Testament," p. 219.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

    Of the clause: "Forgive us our debts, etc."

   "AND forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors." O
   unspeakable mercy of God, which has not only given us a form of prayer
   and taught us a system of life acceptable to Him, and by the
   requirements of the form given, in which He charged us always to pray,
   has torn up the roots of both anger and sorrow, but also gives to those
   who pray an opportunity and reveals to them a way by which they may
   move a merciful and kindly judgment of God to be pronounced over them
   and which somehow gives us a power by which we can moderate the
   sentence of our Judge, drawing Him to forgive our offences by the
   example of our forgiveness: when we say to Him: "Forgive us as we also
   forgive." And so without anxiety and in confidence from this prayer a
   man may ask for pardon of his own offences, if he has been forgiving
   towards his own debtors, and not towards those of his Lord. For some of
   us, which is very bad, are inclined to show ourselves calm and most
   merciful in regard to those things which are done to God's detriment,
   however great the crimes may be, but to be found most hard and
   inexorable exactors of debts to ourselves even in the case of the most
   trifling wrongs. Whoever then does not from his heart forgive his
   brother who has offended him, by this prayer calls down upon himself
   not forgiveness but condemnation, and by his own profession asks that
   he himself may be judged more severely, saying: Forgive me as I also
   have forgiven. And if he is repaid according to his own request, what
   else will follow but that he will be punished after his own example
   with implacable wrath and a sentence that cannot be remitted? And so if
   we want to be judged mercifully, we ought also to be merciful towards
   those who have sinned against us. For only so much will be remitted to
   us, as we have remitted to those who have injured us however
   spitefully. And some dreading this, when this prayer is chanted by all
   the people in church, silently omit this clause, for fear lest they may
   seem by their own utterance to bind themselves rather than to excuse
   themselves, as they do not understand that it is in vain that they try
   to offer these quibbles to the Judge of all men, who has willed to show
   us beforehand how He will judge His suppliants. For as He does not wish
   to be found harsh and inexorable towards them, He has marked out the
   manner of His judgment, that just as we desire to be judged by Him, so
   we should also judge our brethren, if they have wronged us in anything,
   for "he shall have judgment without mercy who hath shown no mercy."

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    Of the clause: "Lead us not into temptation."

   NEXT there follows: "And lead us not into temptation," on which there
   arises no unimportant question, for if we pray that we may not be
   suffered to be tempted, how then will our power of endurance be proved,
   according to this text: "Every one who is not tempted is not proved;"
   [534] and again: "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation"? [535]
   The clause then, "Lead us not into temptation," does not mean this;
   viz., do not permit us ever to be tempted, but do not permit us when we
   fall into temptation to be overcome. For Job was tempted, but was not
   led into temptation. For he did not ascribe folly to God nor blasphemy,
   nor with impious mouth did he yield to that wish of the tempter toward
   which he was drawn. Abraham was tempted, Joseph was tempted, but
   neither of them was led into temptation for neither of them yielded his
   consent to the tempter. Next there follows: "But deliver us from evil,"
   i.e., do not suffer us to be tempted by the devil above that we are
   able, but "make with the temptation a way also of escape that we may be
   able to bear it." [536]

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    How we ought not to ask for other things, except only those which are
    contained in the limits of the Lord's Prayer.

   YOU see then what is the method and form of prayer proposed to us by
   the Judge Himself, who is to be prayed to by it, a form in which there
   is contained no petition for riches, no thought of honours, no request
   for power and might, no mention of bodily health and of temporal life.
   For He who is the Author of Eternity would have men ask of Him nothing
   uncertain, nothing paltry, and nothing temporal. And so a man will
   offer the greatest insult to His Majesty and Bounty, if he leaves on
   one side these eternal petitions and chooses rather to ask of Him
   something transitory and uncertain; and will also incur the indignation
   rather than the propitiation of the Judge by the pettiness of his
   prayer.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

    Of the character of the sublimer prayer.

   THIS prayer then though it seems to contain all the fulness of
   perfection, as being what was originated and appointed by the Lord's
   own authority, yet lifts those to whom it belongs to that still higher
   condition of which we spoke above, and carries them on by a loftier
   stage to that ardent prayer which is known and tried by but very few,
   and which to speak more truly is ineffable; which transcends all human
   thoughts, and is distinguished, I will not say by any sound of the
   voice, but by no movement of the tongue, or utterance of words, but
   which the mind enlightened by the infusion of that heavenly light
   describes in no human and confined language, but pours forth richly as
   from copious fountain in an accumulation of thoughts, and ineffably
   utters to God, expressing in the shortest possible space of time such
   great things that the mind when it returns to its usual condition
   cannot easily utter or relate. And this condition our Lord also
   similarly prefigured by the form of those supplications which, when he
   retired alone in the mountain He is said to have poured forth in
   silence, and when being in an agony of prayer He shed forth even drops
   of blood, as an example of a purpose which it is hard to imitate.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVI.

    Of the different causes of conviction.

   BUT who is able, with whatever experience he may be endowed, to give a
   sufficient account of the varieties and reasons and grounds of
   conviction, by which the mind is inflamed and set on fire and incited
   to pure and most fervent prayers? And of these we will now by way of
   specimen set forth a few, as far as we can by God's enlightenment
   recollect them. For sometimes a verse of any one of the Psalms gives us
   an occasion of ardent prayer while we are singing. Sometimes the
   harmonious modulation of a brother's voice stirs up the minds of
   dullards to intense supplication. We know also that the enunciation and
   the reverence of the chanter adds greatly to the fervour of those who
   stand by. Moreover the exhortation of a perfect man, and a spiritual
   conference has often raised the affections of those present to the
   richest prayer. We know too that by the death of a brother or some one
   dear to us, we are no less carried away to full conviction. The
   recollection also of our coldness and carelessness has sometimes
   aroused in us a healthful fervour of spirit. And in this way no one can
   doubt that numberless opportunities are not wanting, by which through
   God's grace the coldness and sleepiness of our minds can be shaken off.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVII.

    Of the different sorts of conviction.

   BUT how and in what way those very convictions are produced from the
   inmost recesses of the soul it is no less difficult to trace out. For
   often through some inexpressible delight and keenness of spirit the
   fruit of a most salutary conviction arises so that it actually breaks
   forth into shouts owing to the greatness of its incontrollable joy; and
   the delight of the heart and greatness of exultation makes itself heard
   even in the cell of a neighbour. But sometimes the mind hides itself in
   complete silence within the secrets of a profound quiet, so that the
   amazement of a sudden illumination chokes all sounds of words and the
   overawed spirit either keeps all its feelings to itself or loses [537]
   them and pours forth its desires to God with groanings that cannot be
   uttered. But sometimes it is filled with such overwhelming conviction
   and grief that it cannot express it except by floods of tears.

  CHAPTER XXVIII.

    A question about the fact that a plentiful supply of tears is not in our own
    power.

   GERMANUS: My own poor self indeed is not altogether ignorant of this
   feeling of conviction. For often when tears arise at the recollection
   of my faults, I have been by the Lord's visitation so refreshed by this
   ineffable joy which you describe that the greatness of the joy has
   assured me that I ought not to despair of their forgiveness. Than which
   state of mind I think there is nothing more sublime if only it could be
   recalled at our own will. For sometimes when I am desirous to stir
   myself up with all my power to the same conviction and tears, and place
   before my eyes all my faults and sins, I am unable to bring back that
   copiousness of tears, and so my eyes are dry and hard like some hardest
   flint, so that not a single tear trickles from them. And so in
   proportion as I congratulate myself on that copiousness of tears, just
   so do I mourn that I cannot bring it back again whenever I wish.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIX.

    The answer on the varieties of conviction which spring from tears.

   ISAAC: Not every kind of shedding of tears is produced by one feeling
   or one virtue. For in one way does that weeping originate which is
   caused by the pricks of our sins smiting our heart, of which we read:
   "I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed; I
   will water my couch with my tears." [538] And again: "Let tears run
   down like a torrent day and night: give thyself no rest, and let not
   the apple of thine eye cease." [539] In another, that which arises from
   the contemplation of eternal good things and the desire of that future
   glory, owing to which even richer well-springs of tears burst forth
   from uncontrollable delights and boundless exultation, while our soul
   is athirst for the mighty Living God, saying, "When shall I come and
   appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my meat day and
   night," [540] declaring with daily crying and lamentation: "Woe is me
   that my sojourning is prolonged;" and: "Too long hath my soul been a
   sojourner." [541] In another way do the tears flow forth, which without
   any conscience of deadly sin, yet still proceed from the fear of hell
   and the recollection of that terrible judgment, with the terror of
   which the prophet was smitten and prayed to God, saying: "Enter not
   into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be
   justified." [542] There is too another kind of tears, which are caused
   not by knowledge of one's self but by the hardness and sins of others;
   whereby Samuel is described as having wept for Saul, and both the Lord
   in the gospel and Jeremiah in former days for the city of Jerusalem,
   the latter thus saying: "Oh, that my head were water and mine eyes a
   fountain of tears! And I will weep day and night for the slain of the
   daughter of my people." [543] Or also such as were those tears of which
   we hear in the hundred and first Psalm: "For I have eaten ashes for my
   bread, and mingled my cup with weeping." [544] And these were certainty
   not caused by the same feeling as those which arise in the sixth Psalm
   from the person of the penitent, but were due to the anxieties of this
   life and its distresses and losses, by which the righteous who are
   living in this world are oppressed. And this is clearly shown not only
   by the words of the Psalm itself, but also by its title, which runs as
   follows in the character of that poor person of whom it is said in the
   gospel that "blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
   of heaven:" [545] "A prayer of the poor when he was in distress and
   poured forth his prayer to God." [546]

  CHAPTER XXX.

    How tears ought not to be squeezed out, when they do not flow spontaneously.

   FROM these tears those are vastly different which are squeezed out from
   dry eyes while the heart is hard: and although we cannot believe that
   these are altogether fruitless (for the attempt to shed them is made
   with a good intention, especially by those who have not yet been able
   to attain to perfect knowledge or to be thoroughly cleansed from the
   stains of past or present sins), yet certainly the flow of tears ought
   not to be thus forced out by those who have already advanced to the
   love of virtue, nor should the weeping of the outward man be with great
   labour attempted, as even if it is produced it will never attain the
   rich copiousness of spontaneous tears. For it will rather cast down the
   soul of the suppliant by his endeavours, and humiliate him, and plunge
   him in human affairs and draw him away from the celestial heights,
   wherein the awed mind of one who prays should be steadfastly fixed, and
   will force it to relax its hold on its prayers and grow sick from
   barren and forced tears.

  CHAPTER XXXI.

    The opinion of Abbot Antony on the condition of prayer.

   AND that you may see the character of true prayer I will give you not
   my own opinion but that of the blessed Antony: whom we have known
   sometimes to have been so persistent in prayer that often as he was
   praying in a transport of mind, when the sunrise began to appear, we
   have heard him in the fervour of his spirit declaiming: Why do you
   hinder me, O sun, who art arising for this very purpose; viz., to
   withdraw me from the brightness of this true light? And his also is
   this heavenly and more than human utterance on the end of prayer: That
   is not, said he, a perfect prayer, wherein a monk understands himself
   and the words which he prays. And if we too, as far as our slender
   ability allows, may venture to add anything to this splendid utterance,
   we will bring forward the marks of prayer which are heard from the
   Lord, as far as we have tried them.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXII.

    Of the proof of prayer being heard.

   WHEN, while we are praying, no hesitation intervenes and breaks down
   the confidence of our petition by a sort of despair, but we feel that
   by pouring forth our prayer we have obtained what we are asking for, we
   have no doubt that our prayers have effectually reached God. For so far
   will one be heard and obtain an answer, as he believes that he is
   regarded by God, and that God can grant it. For this saying of our Lord
   cannot be retracted: "Whatsoever ye ask when ye pray, believe that you
   shall receive, and they shall come to you." [547]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [547] S. Mark 11:24.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIII.

    An objection that the confidence of being thus heard as described belongs
    only to saints.

   GERMANUS: We certainly believe that this confidence of being heard
   flows from purity of conscience, but for us, whose heart is still
   smitten by the pricks of sins, how can we have it, as we have no merits
   to plead for us, whereby we might confidently presume that our prayers
   would be heard?

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIV.

    Answer on the different reasons for prayer being heard.

   ISAAC: That there are different reasons for prayer being heard in
   accordance with the varied and changing condition of souls the words of
   the gospels and of the prophets teach us. For you have the fruits of an
   answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of
   two persons; as it is said: "If two of you shall agree upon earth
   touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them
   of my Father which is in heaven." [548] You have another in the fulness
   of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. "For," He says,
   "if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
   mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall
   be impossible to you." [549] You have it in continuance in prayer,
   which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in
   petitioning, importunity: "For, verily, I say unto you that if not
   because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise
   and give him as much as he needs." [550] You have it in the fruits of
   almsgiving: "Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray
   for thee in the time of tribulation." [551] You have it in the
   purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: "Loose the
   bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;" and after a few
   words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, "then,"
   he says, "thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry,
   and He shall say, Here am I." [552] Sometimes also excess of trouble
   causes it to be heard, as it is said: "When I was in trouble I called
   unto the Lord, and He heard me;" [553] and again: "Afflict not the
   stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful."
   [554] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be
   obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his
   conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal.
   For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly
   destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we
   have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith
   which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety
   which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that
   importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which
   alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed
   to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to
   persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them
   we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the
   mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and
   eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He
   not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually
   welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant
   whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, "Ask and ye shall
   receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you.
   For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and
   to him that knocketh it shall be opened;" [555] and again: "All things
   whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and
   nothing shall be impossible to you." [556] And therefore even if all
   the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether
   wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as
   this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the
   difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt
   that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is
   heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we
   are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was
   heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained
   the result of his petition after one and twenty days. [557] Wherefore
   we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we
   have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest
   perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the
   angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes
   forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance
   of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us
   the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of
   the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above
   mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness
   prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let
   us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this
   faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained
   what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's
   promise where He says: "All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
   believing, ye shall receive." [558] For it is well for us to consider
   this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of
   this question is clearly solved: "This is," he says, "the confidence
   which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He
   heareth us." [559] He bids us then have a full and undoubting
   confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own
   advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's
   will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's
   Prayer, where we say "Thy will be done,"--Thine not ours. For if we
   also remember these words of the Apostle that "we know not what to pray
   for as we ought" [560] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things
   opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused
   our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and
   truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the
   teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who
   had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might
   be removed, saying: "For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might
   depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee,
   for strength is made perfect in weakness." [561] And this feeling even
   our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character [562] of man which
   He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things
   also by His example; saying thus: "Father, if it be possible, let this
   cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt," [563]
   though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will,
   "For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom
   for many;" [564] as He Himself says: "No man taketh my life from Me,
   but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have
   power to take it again." [565] In which character there is in the
   thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the
   Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: "To do Thy
   will: O My God, I am willing." [566] For even if we read of the Father:
   "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son," [567]
   we find none the less of the Son: "Who gave Himself for our sins."
   [568] And as it is said of the One: "Who spared not His own Son, but
   gave Him for all of us," [569] so it is written of the other: "He was
   offered because He Himself willed it." [570] And it is shown that the
   will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in
   the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there
   was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares
   that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying:
   "And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead," [571] so also the
   Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body,
   saying: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up
   again." [572] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples
   of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications
   also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our
   petitions: "Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt." [573] But it
   is clear enough that one who does not [574] pray with attention of mind
   cannot observe that threefold reverence [575] which is usually
   practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.

  CHAPTER XXXV.

    Of prayer to be offered within the chamber and with the door shut.

   BEFORE all things however we ought most carefully to observe the
   Evangelic precept, which tells us to enter into our chamber and shut
   the door and pray to our Father, which may be fulfilled by us as
   follows: We pray within our chamber, when removing our hearts inwardly
   from the din of all thoughts and anxieties, we disclose our prayers in
   secret and in closest intercourse to the Lord. We pray with closed
   doors when with closed lips and complete silence we pray to the
   searcher not of words but of hearts. We pray in secret when from the
   heart and fervent mind we disclose our petitions to God alone, so that
   no hostile powers are even able to discover the character of our
   petition. Wherefore we should pray in complete silence, not only to
   avoid distracting the brethren standing near by our whispers or louder
   utterances, and disturbing the thoughts of those who are praying, but
   also that the purport of our petition may be concealed from our enemies
   who are especially on the watch against us while we are praying. For so
   we shall fulfil this injunction: "Keep the doors of thy mouth from her
   who sleepeth in thy bosom." [576]

  CHAPTER XXXVI.

    Of the value of short and silent prayer.

   WHEREFORE we ought to pray often but briefly, lest if we are long about
   it our crafty foe may succeed in implanting something in our heart. For
   that is the true sacrifice, as "the sacrifice of God is a broken
   spirit." This is the salutary offering, these are pure drink offerings,
   that is the "sacrifice of righteousness," the "sacrifice of praise,"
   these are true and fat victims, "holocausts full of marrow," which are
   offered by contrite and humble hearts, and which those who practise
   this control and fervour of spirit, of which we have spoken, with
   effectual power can sing: "Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as
   the incense: let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice."
   [577] But the approach of the right hour and of night warns us that we
   ought with fitting devotion to do this very thing, of which, as our
   slender ability allowed, we seem to have propounded a great deal, and
   to have prolonged our conference considerably, though we believe that
   we have discoursed very little when the magnificence and difficulty of
   the subject are taken into account.

   With these words of the holy Isaac we were dazzled rather than
   satisfied, and after evening service had been held, rested our limbs
   for a short time, and intending at the first dawn again to return under
   promise of a fuller discussion departed, rejoicing over the acquisition
   of these precepts as well as over the assurance of his promises. Since
   we felt that though the excellence of prayer had been shown to us,
   still we had not yet understood from his discourse its nature, and the
   power by which continuance in it might be gained and kept.

THE SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT ISAAC.

ON PRAYER.

  CHAPTER I.

    Introduction.

   AMONG the sublime customs of the anchorites which by God's help have
   been set forth although in plain and unadorned style, the course of our
   narration compels us to insert and find a place for something, which
   may seem so to speak to cause a blemish on a fair body: although I have
   no doubt that by it no small instruction on the image of Almighty God
   of which we read in Genesis will be conferred on some of the simpler
   sort, especially when the grounds are considered of a doctrine so
   important that men cannot be ignorant of it without terrible blasphemy
   and serious harm to the Catholic faith.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    Of the custom which is kept up in the Province of Egypt for signifying the
    time of Easter.

   IN the country of Egypt this custom is by ancient tradition observed
   that--when Epiphany is past, which the priests of that province regard
   as the time, both of our Lord's baptism and also of His birth in the
   flesh, and so celebrate the commemoration of either mystery not
   separately as in the Western provinces but on the single festival of
   this day, [578] --letters are sent from the Bishop of Alexandria
   through all the Churches of Egypt, by which the beginning of Lent, and
   the day of Easter are pointed out not only in all the cities but also
   in all the monasteries. [579] In accordance then with this custom, a
   very few days after the previous conference had been held with Abbot
   Isaac, there arrived the festal letters of Theophilus [580] the Bishop
   of the aforesaid city, in which together with the announcement of
   Easter he considered as well the foolish heresy of the
   Anthropomorphites [581] at great length, and abundantly refuted it. And
   this was received by almost all the body of monks residing in the whole
   province of Egypt with such bitterness owing to their simplicity and
   error, that the greater part of the Elders decreed that on the contrary
   the aforesaid Bishop ought to be abhorred by the whole body of the
   brethren as tainted with heresy of the worst kind, because he seemed to
   impugn the teaching of holy Scripture by the denial that Almighty God
   was formed in the fashion of a human figure, though Scripture teaches
   with perfect clearness that Adam was created in His image. Lastly this
   letter was rejected also by those who were living in the desert of
   Scete and who excelled all who were in the monasteries of Egypt, in
   perfection and in knowledge, so that except Abbot Paphnutius the
   presbyter of our congregation, not one of the other presbyters, who
   presided over the other three churches in the same desert, would suffer
   it to be even read or repeated at all in their meetings.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [578] The observance of Epiphany can be traced back in the Christian
   Church to the second century, and, as Cassian tells us here, in the
   East (in which its observance apparently originated) it was in the
   first instance a double festival, commemorating both the Nativity and
   the Baptism of our Lord. From the East its observance passed over to
   the West, where however the Nativity was already observed as a separate
   festival, and hence the special reference of Epiphany was somewhat
   altered, and the manifestation to the Magi was coupled with that at the
   Baptism: hence the plural Epiphaniorum dies. Meanwhile, as the West
   adopted the observance of this festival from the East, so the East
   followed the West in observing a separate feast of the Nativity.
   Cassian's words show us that when he wrote the two festivals were both
   observed separately in the West, though apparently not yet (to the best
   of his belief) in the East, but the language of a homily by S.
   Chrysostom (Vol. ii. p. 354 Ed. Montfaucon) delivered in A.D. 386 shows
   that the separation of the two festivals had already begun at Antioch,
   and all the evidence goes to show that "the Western plan was being
   gradually adopted in the period which we may roughly define as the last
   quarter of the 4th and the first quarter of the 5th century."
   Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, Vol. i. p. 361. See further
   Origines de Culte Chrétien, par L'Abbé Duchesne, p. 247 sq.

   [579] The "Festal letters" (`eortastikai epistolai, Euseb. VII. xx.,
   xxi.) were delivered by the Bishop of Alexandria as Homilies, and then
   put into the form of an Epistle and sent round to all the churches of
   Egypt; and, according to some late writers, to the Bishops of all the
   principal sees, in accordance with a decision of the Council of Nicæa,
   in order to inform them of the right day on which Easter should be
   celebrated. Cassian here speaks of them as sent immediately after
   Epiphany, and this was certainly the time at which the announcement of
   the date of Easter was made in the West shortly after his day (so the
   Council of Orleans, Canon i., A.D. 541; that of Braga A.D. 572, Canon
   ix.; and that of Auxerre A.D. 572, Canon ii.), but there is ample
   evidence in the Festal letters both of S. Athanasius and of S. Cyril
   that at Alexandria the homilies were preached on the previous Easter,
   and it is difficult to resist the inference that Cassian's memory is
   here at fault as to the exact time at which the incident related really
   occurred, and that he is transferring to Egypt the custom with which he
   was familiar in the West, assigning to the festival of Epiphany what
   really must have taken place at Easter.

   [580] Theophilus succeeded Timothy as Bishop of Alexandria in the
   summer of 385. The festal letters of which Cassian here speaks were
   issued by him in the year 399.

   [581] The Anthropomorphite heresy, into which the monks of Egypt had
   fallen, "supposed that God possesses eyes, a face, and hands and other
   members of a bodily organization." It arose from taking too literally
   those passages of the Old Testament in which God is spoken of in human
   terms, out of condescension to man's limited powers of grasping the
   Divine nature and appears historically to have been a recoil from the
   allegorism of Origen and others of the Alexandrian school. The Festal
   letter of Theophilus in which he condemned these views, and maintained
   the incorporeal nature of God is no longer extant, but is alluded to
   also by Sozomen, H. E. VIII. xi., where an account is given of the
   Origenistic controversy, of which it was the occasion, and out of which
   Theophilus came so badly. On the heresy see also Epiphanius, Haer.
   lxx.; Augustine, Haer. l. and lxxvi.; and Theodoret, H. E. IV. x.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    Of Abbot Sarapion and the heresy of the Anthropomorphites into which he fell
    in the error of simplicity.

   AMONG those then who were caught by this mistaken notion was one named
   Sarapion, a man of long-standing strictness of life, and one who was
   altogether perfect in actual discipline, whose ignorance with regard to
   the view of the doctrine first mentioned was so far a stumbling block
   to all who held the true faith, as he himself outstripped almost all
   the monks both in the merits of his life and in the length of time (he
   had been there). And when this man could not be brought back to the way
   of the right faith by many exhortations of the holy presbyter
   Paphnutius, because this view seemed to him a novelty, and one that was
   not ever known to or handed down by his predecessors, it chanced that a
   certain deacon, a man of very great learning, named Photinus, arrived
   from the region of Cappadocia with the desire of visiting the brethren
   living in the same desert: whom the blessed Paphnutius received with
   the warmest welcome, and in order to confirm the faith which had been
   stated in the letters of the aforesaid Bishop, placed him in the midst
   and asked him before all the brethren how the Catholic Churches
   throughout the East interpreted the passage in Genesis where it says
   "Let us make man after our image and likeness." [582] And when he
   explained that the image and likeness of God was taken by all the
   leaders of the churches not according to the base sound of the letters,
   but spiritually, and supported this very fully and by many passages of
   Scripture, and showed that nothing of this sort could happen to that
   infinite and incomprehensible and invisible glory, so that it could be
   comprised in a human form and likeness, since its nature is incorporeal
   and uncompounded and simple, and what can neither be apprehended by the
   eyes nor conceived by the mind, at length the old man was shaken by the
   numerous and very weighty assertions of this most learned man, and was
   drawn to the faith of the Catholic tradition. And when both Abbot
   Paphnutius and all of us were filled with intense delight at his
   adhesion, for this reason; viz, that the Lord had not permitted a man
   of such age and crowned with such virtues, and one who erred only from
   ignorance and rustic simplicity, to wander from the path of the right
   faith up to the very last, and when we arose to give thanks, and were
   all together offering up our prayers to the Lord, the old man was so
   bewildered in mind during his prayer because he felt that the
   Anthropomorphic image of the Godhead which he used to set before
   himself in prayer, was banished from his heart, that on a sudden he
   burst into a flood of bitter tears and continual sobs, and cast himself
   down on the ground and exclaimed with strong groanings: "Alas! wretched
   man that I am! they have taken away my God from me, and I have now none
   to lay hold of; and whom to worship and address I know not." By which
   scene we were terribly disturbed, and moreover with the effect of the
   former Conference still remaining in our hearts, we returned to Abbot
   Isaac, whom when we saw close at hand, we addressed with these words.

  CHAPTER IV.

    Of our return to Abbot Isaac and question concerning the error into which
    the aforesaid old man had fallen.

   ALTHOUGH even besides the fresh matter which has lately arisen, our
   delight in the former conference which was held on the character of
   prayer would summon us to postpone everything else and return to your
   holiness, yet this grievous error of Abbot Sarapion, conceived, as we
   fancy, by the craft of most vile demons, adds somewhat to this desire
   of ours. For it is no small despair by which we are cast down when we
   consider that through the fault of this ignorance he has not only
   utterly lost all those labours which he has performed in so
   praiseworthy a manner for fifty years in this desert, but has also
   incurred the risk of eternal death. And so we want first to know why
   and wherefore so grievous an error has crept into him. And next we
   should like to be taught how we can arrive at that condition in prayer,
   of which you discoursed some time back not only fully but splendidly.
   For that admirable Conference has had this effect upon us, that it has
   only dazzled our minds and has not shown us how to perform or secure
   it.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    The answer on the heresy described above.

   ISAAC: We need not be surprised that a really simple man who had never
   received any instruction on the substance and nature of the Godhead
   could still be entangled and deceived by an error of simplicity and the
   habit of a longstanding mistake, and (to speak more truly) continue in
   the original error which is brought about, not as you suppose by a new
   illusion of the demons, but by the ignorance of the ancient heathen
   world, while in accordance with the custom of that erroneous notion, by
   which they used to worship devils formed in the figure of men, they
   even now think that the incomprehensible and ineffable glory of the
   true Deity should be worshipped under the limitations of some figure,
   as they believe that they can grasp and hold nothing if they have not
   some image set before them, which they can continually address while
   they are at their devotions, and which they can carry about in their
   mind and have always fixed before their eyes. And against this mistake
   of theirs this text may be used: "And they changed the glory of the
   incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of corruptible man."
   [583] Jeremiah also says: "My people have changed their glory for an
   idol." [584] Which error although by this its origin, of which we have
   spoken, it is engrained in the notions of some, yet none the less is it
   contracted in the hearts also of those who have never been stained with
   the superstition of the heathen world, under the colour of this passage
   where it is said "Let us make man after our image and our likeness,"
   [585] ignorance and simplicity being its authors, so that actually
   there has arisen owing to this hateful interpretation a heresy called
   that of the Anthropomorphites, which maintains with obstinate
   perverseness that the infinite and simple substance of the Godhead is
   fashioned in our lineaments and human configuration. Which however any
   one who has been taught the Catholic doctrine will abhor as heathenish
   blasphemy, and so will arrive at that perfectly pure condition in
   prayer which will not only not connect with its prayers any figure of
   the Godhead or bodily lineaments (which it is a sin even to speak of),
   but will not even allow in itself even the memory of a name, or the
   appearance of an action, or an outline of any character.

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of the reasons why Jesus Christ appears to each one of us either in His
    humility or in His glorified condition.

   FOR according to the measure of its purity, as I said in the former
   Conference, each mind is both raised and moulded in its prayers if it
   forsakes the consideration of earthly and material things so far as the
   condition of its purity may carry it forward, and enable it with the
   inner eyes of the soul to see Jesus either still in His humility and in
   the flesh, or glorified and coming in the glory of His Majesty: for
   those cannot see Jesus coming in His Kingdom who are still kept back in
   a sort of state of Jewish weakness, and cannot say with the Apostle:
   "And if we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know Him so no
   more;" [586] but only those can look with purest eyes on His Godhead,
   who rise with Him from low and earthly works and thoughts and go apart
   in the lofty mountain of solitude which is free from the disturbance of
   all earthly thoughts and troubles, and secure from the interference of
   all sins, and being exalted by pure faith and the heights of virtue
   reveals the glory of His Face and the image of His splendour to those
   who are able to look on Him with pure eyes of the soul. But Jesus is
   seen as well by those who live in towns and villages and hamlets, i.e.,
   who are occupied in practical affairs and works, but not with the same
   brightness with which He appeared to those who can go up with Him into
   the aforesaid mount of virtues, i.e., Peter, James, and John. For so in
   solitude He appeared to Moses and spoke with Elias. And as our Lord
   wished to establish this and to leave us examples of perfect purity,
   although He Himself, the very fount of inviolable sanctity, had no need
   of external help and the assistance of solitude in order to secure it
   (for the fulness of purity could not be soiled by any stain from
   crowds, nor could He be contaminated by intercourse with men, who
   cleanses and sanctifies all things that are polluted) yet still He
   retired into the mountain alone to pray, thus teaching us by the
   example of His retirement that if we too wish to approach God with a
   pure and spotless affection of heart, we should also retire from all
   the disturbance and confusion of crowds, so that while still living in
   the body we may manage in some degree to adapt ourselves to some
   likeness of that bliss which is promised hereafter to the saints, and
   that "God may be" to us "all in all." [587]

  CHAPTER VII.

    What constitutes our end and perfect bliss.

   FOR then will be perfectly fulfilled in our case that prayer of our
   Saviour in which He prayed for His disciples to the Father saying "that
   the love wherewith Thou lovedst Me may be in them and they in us;" and
   again: "that they all may be one as Thou, Father, in Me and I in Thee,
   that they also may be one in us," [588] when that perfect love of God,
   wherewith "He first loved us" [589] has passed into the feelings of our
   heart as well, by the fulfilment of this prayer of the Lord which we
   believe cannot possibly be ineffectual. And this will come to pass when
   God shall be all our love, and every desire and wish and effort, every
   thought of ours, and all our life and words and breath, and that unity
   which already exists between the Father and the Son, and the Son and
   the Father, has been shed abroad in our hearts and minds, so that as He
   loves us with a pure and unfeigned and indissoluble love, so we also
   may be joined to Him by a lasting and inseparable affection, since we
   are so united to Him that whatever we breathe or think, or speak is
   God, since, as I say, we attain to that end of which we spoke before,
   which the same Lord in His prayer hopes may be fulfilled in us: "that
   they all may be one as we are one, I in them and Thou in Me, that they
   also may be made perfect in one;" and again: "Father, those whom Thou
   hast given Me, I will that where I am, they may also be with Me." [590]
   This then ought to be the destination of the solitary, this should be
   all his aim that it may be vouchsafed to him to possess even in the
   body an image of future bliss, and that he may begin in this world to
   have a foretaste of a sort of earnest of that celestial life and glory.
   This, I say, is the end of all perfection, that the mind purged from
   all carnal desires may daily be lifted towards spiritual things, until
   the whole life and all the thoughts of the heart become one continuous
   prayer.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    A question on the training in perfection by which we can arrive at perpetual
    recollection of God.

   GERMANUS: The extent of our bewilderment at our wondering awe at the
   former Conference, because of which we came back again, increases still
   more. For in proportion as by the incitements of this teaching we are
   fired with the desire of perfect bliss, so do we fall back into greater
   despair, as we know not how to seek or obtain training for such lofty
   heights. Wherefore we entreat that you will patiently allow us (for it
   must perhaps be set forth and unfolded with a good deal of talk) to
   explain what while sitting in the cell we had begun to revolve in a
   lengthy meditation, although we know that your holiness is not at all
   troubled by the infirmities of the weak, which even for this reason
   should be openly set forth, that what is out of place in them may
   receive correction. Our notion then is that the perfection of any art
   or system of training must begin with some simple rudiments, and grow
   accustomed first to somewhat easy and tender beginnings, so that being
   nourished and trained little by little by a sort of reasonable milk, it
   may grow up and so by degrees and step by step mount up from the lowest
   depths to the heights: and when by these means it has entered on the
   plainer principles and so to speak passed the gates of the entrance of
   the profession, it will consequently arrive without difficulty at the
   inmost shrine and lofty heights of perfection. For how could any boy
   manage to pronounce the simplest union of syllables unless he had first
   carefully learnt the letters of the alphabet? Or how can any one learn
   to read quickly, who is still unfit to connect together short and
   simple sentences? But by what means will one who is ill instructed in
   the science of grammar attain eloquence in rhetoric or the knowledge of
   philosophy? Wherefore for this highest learning also, by which we are
   taught even to cleave to God, I have no doubt that there are some
   foundations of the system, which must first be firmly laid and
   afterwards the towering heights of perfection may be placed and raised
   upon them. And we have a light idea that these are its first
   principles; viz., that we should first learn by what meditations God
   may be grasped and contemplated, and next that we should manage to keep
   a very firm hold of this topic whatever it is which we do not doubt is
   the height of all perfection. And therefore we want you to show us some
   material for this recollection, by which we may conceive and ever keep
   the idea of God in the mind, so that by always keeping it before our
   eyes, when we find that we have dropped away from Him, we may at once
   be able to recover ourselves and return thither and may succeed in
   laying hold of it again without any delay from wandering around the
   subject and searching for it. For it happens that when we have wandered
   away from our spiritual speculations and have come back to ourselves as
   if waking from a deadly sleep, and, being thoroughly roused, look for
   the subject matter, by which we may be able to revive that spiritual
   recollection which has been destroyed, we are hindered by the delay of
   the actual search before we find it, and are once more drawn aside from
   our endeavour, and before the spiritual insight is brought about, the
   purpose of heart which had been conceived, has disappeared. And this
   trouble is certain to happen to us for this reason because we do not
   keep something special firmly set before our eyes like some principle
   to which the wandering thoughts may be recalled after many digressions
   and varied excursions; and, if I may use the expression, after long
   storms enter a quiet haven. And so it comes to pass that as the mind is
   constantly hindered by this want of knowledge and difficulty, and is
   always tossed about vaguely, and as if intoxicated, among various
   matters, and cannot even retain firm hold for any length of time of
   anything spiritual which has occurred to it by chance rather than of
   set purpose: while, as it is always receiving one thing after another,
   it does not notice either their beginning and origin or even their end.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    The answer on the efficacy of understanding, which is gained by experience.

   ISAAC: Your minute and subtle inquiry affords an indication of purity
   being very nearly reached. For no one would be able even to make
   inquiries on these matters,I will not say to look within and
   discriminate,--except one who had been urged to sound the depths of
   such questions by careful and effectual diligence of mind, and watchful
   anxiety, and one whom the constant aim after a well controlled life had
   taught by practical experience to attempt the entrance to this purity
   and to knock at its doors. And therefore as I see you, I will not say,
   standing before the doors of that true prayer of which we have been
   speaking, but touching its inner chambers and inward parts as it were
   with the hands of experience, and already laying hold of some parts of
   it, I do not think that I shall find any difficulty in introducing you
   now within what I may call its hall, for you to roam about its
   recesses, as the Lord may direct; nor do I think that you will be
   hindered from investigating what is to be shown you by any obstacles or
   difficulties. For he is next door to understanding who carefully
   recognizes what he ought to ask about, nor is he far from knowledge,
   who begins to understand how ignorant he is. And therefore I am not
   afraid of the charge of betraying secrets, and of levity, if I divulge
   what when speaking in my former discourse on the perfection of prayer I
   had kept back from discussing, as I think that its force was to be
   explained to us who are occupied with this subject and interest even
   without the aid of my words, by the grace of God.

  CHAPTER X.

    Of the method of continual prayer.

   WHEREFORE in accordance with that system, which you admirably compared
   to teaching children (who can only take in the first lessons on the
   alphabet and recognize the shapes of the letters, and trace out their
   characters with a steady hand if they have, by means of some copies and
   shapes carefully impressed on wax, got accustomed to express their
   figures, by constantly looking at them and imitating them daily), we
   must give you also the form of this spiritual contemplation, on which
   you may always fix your gaze with the utmost steadiness, and both learn
   to consider it to your profit in unbroken continuance, and also manage
   by the practice of it and by meditation to climb to a still loftier
   insight. This formula then shall be proposed to you of this system,
   which you want, and of prayer, which every monk in his progress towards
   continual recollection of God, is accustomed to ponder, ceaselessly
   revolving it in his heart, having got rid of all kinds of other
   thoughts; for he cannot possibly keep his hold over it unless he has
   freed himself from all bodily cares and anxieties. And as this was
   delivered to us by a few of those who were left of the oldest fathers,
   so it is only divulged by us to a very few and to those who are really
   keen. And so for keeping up continual recollection of God this pious
   formula is to be ever set before you. "O God, make speed to save me: O
   Lord, make haste to help me," [591] for this verse has not unreasonably
   been picked out from the whole of Scripture for this purpose. For it
   embraces all the feelings which can be implanted in human nature, and
   can be fitly and satisfactorily adapted to every condition, and all
   assaults. Since it contains an invocation of God against every danger,
   it contains humble and pious confession, it contains the watchfulness
   of anxiety and continual fear, it contains the thought of one's own
   weakness, confidence in the answer, and the assurance of a present and
   ever ready help. For one who is constantly calling on his protector, is
   certain that He is always at hand. It contains the glow of love and
   charity, it contains a view of the plots, and a dread of the enemies,
   from which one, who sees himself day and night hemmed in by them,
   confesses that he cannot be set free without the aid of his defender.
   This verse is an impregnable wall for all who are labouring under the
   attacks of demons, as well as impenetrable coat of mail and a strong
   shield. It does not suffer those who are in a state of moroseness and
   anxiety of mind, or depressed by sadness or all kinds of thoughts to
   despair of saving remedies, as it shows that He, who is invoked, is
   ever looking on at our struggles and is not far from His suppliants. It
   warns us whose lot is spiritual success and delight of heart that we
   ought not to be at all elated or puffed up by our happy condition,
   which it assures us cannot last without God as our protector, while it
   implores Him not only always but even speedily to help us. This verse,
   I say, will be found helpful and useful to every one of us in whatever
   condition we may be. For one who always and in all matters wants to be
   helped, shows that he needs the assistance of God not only in sorrowful
   or hard matters but also equally in prosperous and happy ones, that he
   may be delivered from the one and also made to continue in the other,
   as he knows that in both of them human weakness is unable to endure
   without His assistance. I am affected by the passion of gluttony. I ask
   for food of which the desert knows nothing, and in the squalid desert
   there are wafted to me odours of royal dainties and I find that even
   against my will I am drawn to long for them. I must at once say: "O
   God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me." I am
   incited to anticipate the hour fixed for supper, or I am trying with
   great sorrow of heart to keep to the limits of the right and regular
   meagre fare. I must cry out with groans: "O God, make speed to save me:
   O Lord, make haste to help me." Weakness of the stomach hinders me when
   wanting severer fasts, on account of the assaults of the flesh, or
   dryness of the belly and constipation frightens me. In order that
   effect may be given to my wishes, or else that the fire of carnal lust
   may be quenched without the remedy of a stricter fast, I must pray: "O
   God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me." When I come
   to supper, at the bidding of the proper hour I loathe taking food and
   am prevented from eating anything to satisfy the requirements of
   nature: I must cry with a sigh: "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord,
   make haste to help me." When I want for the sake of steadfastness of
   heart to apply myself to reading a headache interferes and stops me,
   and at the third hour sleep glues my head to the sacred page, and I am
   forced either to overstep or to anticipate the time assigned to rest;
   and finally an overpowering desire to sleep forces me to cut short the
   canonical rule for service in the Psalms: in the same way I must cry
   out: "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me."
   Sleep is withdrawn from my eyes, and for many nights I find myself
   wearied out with sleeplessness caused by the devil, and all repose and
   rest by night is kept away from my eyelids; I must sigh and pray: "O
   God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me." While I am
   still in the midst of a struggle with sin suddenly an irritation of the
   flesh affects me and tries by a pleasant sensation to draw me to
   consent while in my sleep. In order that a raging fire from without may
   not burn up the fragrant blossoms of chastity, I must cry out: "O God,
   make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me." I feel that the
   incentive to lust is removed, and that the heat of passion has died
   away in my members: In order that this good condition acquired, or
   rather that this grace of God may continue still longer or forever with
   me, I must earnestly say: "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make
   haste to help me." I am disturbed by the pangs of anger, covetousness,
   gloominess, and driven to disturb the peaceful state in which I was,
   and which was dear to me: In order that I may not be carried away by
   raging passion into the bitterness of gall, I must cry out with deep
   groans: "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me."
   I am tried by being puffed up by accidie, vainglory, and pride, and my
   mind with subtle thoughts flatters itself somewhat on account of the
   coldness and carelessness of others: In order that this dangerous
   suggestion of the enemy may not get the mastery over me, I must pray
   with all contrition of heart: "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord,
   make haste to help me." I have gained the grace of humility and
   simplicity, and by continually mortifying my spirit have got rid of the
   swellings of pride: In order that the "foot of pride" may not again
   "come against me," and "the hand of the sinner disturb me," [592] and
   that I may not be more seriously damaged by elation at my success, I
   must cry with all my might, "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make
   haste to help me." I am on fire with innumerable and various wanderings
   of soul and shiftiness of heart, and cannot collect my scattered
   thoughts, nor can I even pour forth my prayer without interruption and
   images of vain figures, and the recollection of conversations and
   actions, and I feel myself tied down by such dryness and barrenness
   that I feel I cannot give birth to any offspring in the shape of
   spiritual ideas: In order that it may be vouchsafed to me to be set
   free from this wretched state of mind, from which I cannot extricate
   myself by any number of sighs and groans, I must full surely cry out:
   "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me." Again, I
   feel that by the visitation of the Holy Spirit I have gained purpose of
   soul, steadfastness of thought, keenness of heart, together with an
   ineffable joy and transport of mind, and in the exuberance of spiritual
   feelings I have perceived by a sudden illumination from the Lord an
   abounding revelation of most holy ideas which were formerly altogether
   hidden from me: In order that it may be vouchsafed to me to linger for
   a longer time in them I must often and anxiously exclaim: "O God, make
   speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me." Encompassed by
   nightly horrors of devils I am agitated, and am disturbed by the
   appearances of unclean spirits, my very hope of life and salvation is
   withdrawn by the horror of fear. Flying to the safe refuge of this
   verse, I will cry out with all my might: "O God, make speed to save me:
   O Lord, make haste to help me." Again, when I have been restored by the
   Lord's consolation, and, cheered by His coming, feel myself encompassed
   as if by countless thousands of angels, so that all of a sudden I can
   venture to seek the conflict and provoke a battle with those whom a
   while ago I dreaded worse than death, and whose touch or even approach
   I felt with a shudder both of mind and body: In order that the vigour
   of this courage may, by God's grace, continue in me still longer, I
   must cry out with all my powers "O God, make speed to save me: O Lord,
   make haste to help me." We must then ceaselessly and continuously pour
   forth the prayer of this verse, in adversity that we may be delivered,
   in prosperity that we may be preserved and not puffed up. Let the
   thought of this verse, I tell you, be conned over in your breast
   without ceasing. Whatever work you are doing, or office you are
   holding, or journey you are going, do not cease to chant this. When you
   are going to bed, or eating, and in the last necessities of nature,
   think on this. This thought in your heart may be to you a saving
   formula, and not only keep you unharmed by all attacks of devils, but
   also purify you from all faults and earthly stains, and lead you to
   that invisible and celestial contemplation, and carry you on to that
   ineffable glow of prayer, of which so few have any experience. Let
   sleep come upon you still considering this verse, till having been
   moulded by the constant use of it, you grow accustomed to repeat it
   even in your sleep. When you wake let it be the first thing to come
   into your mind, let it anticipate all your waking thoughts, let it when
   you rise from your bed send you down on your knees, and thence send you
   forth to all your work and business, and let it follow you about all
   day long. This you should think about, according to the Lawgiver's
   charge, "at home and walking forth on a journey," [593] sleeping and
   waking. This you should write on the threshold and door of your mouth,
   this you should place on the walls of your house and in the recesses of
   your heart so that when you fall on your knees in prayer this may be
   your chant as you kneel, and when you rise up from it to go forth to
   all the necessary business of life it may be your constant prayer as
   you stand.

  CHAPTER XI.

    Of the perfection of prayer to which we can rise by the system described.

   THIS, this is the formula which the mind should unceasingly cling to
   until, strengthened by the constant use of it and by continual
   meditation, it casts off and rejects the rich and full material of all
   manner of thoughts and restricts itself to the poverty of this one
   verse, and so arrives with ready ease at that beatitude of the gospel,
   which holds the first place among the other beatitudes: for He says
   "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
   [594] And so one who becomes grandly poor by a poverty of this sort
   will fulfil this saying of the prophet: "The poor and needy shall
   praise the name of the Lord." [595] And indeed what greater or holier
   poverty can there be than that of one who knowing that he has no
   defence and no strength of his own, asks for daily help from another's
   bounty, and as he is aware that every single moment his life and
   substance depend on Divine assistance, professes himself not without
   reason the Lord's bedesman, and cries to Him daily in prayer: "But I am
   poor and needy: the Lord helpeth me." [596] And so by the illumination
   of God Himself he mounts to that manifold knowledge of Him and begins
   henceforward to be nourished on sublimer and still more sacred
   mysteries, in accordance with these words of the prophet: "The high
   hills are a refuge for the stags, the rocks for the hedgehogs," [597]
   which is very fairly applied in the sense we have given, because
   whosoever continues in simplicity and innocence is not injurious or
   offensive to any one, but being content with his own simple condition
   endeavours simply to defend himself from being spoiled by his foes, and
   becomes a sort of spiritual hedgehog and is protected by the continual
   shield of that rock of the gospel, i.e., being sheltered by the
   recollection of the Lord's passion and by ceaseless meditation on the
   verse given above he escapes the snares of his opposing enemies. And of
   these spiritual hedgehogs we read in Proverbs as follows: "And the
   hedgehogs are a feeble folk, who have made their homes in the rocks."
   [598] And indeed what is feebler than a Christian, what is weaker than
   a monk, who is not only not permitted any vengeance for wrongs done to
   him but is actually not allowed to suffer even a slight and silent
   feeling of irritation to spring up within? But whoever advances from
   this condition and not only secures the simplicity of innocence, but is
   also shielded by the virtue of discretion, becomes an exterminator of
   deadly serpents, and has Satan crushed beneath his feet, and by his
   quickness of mind answers to the figure of the reasonable stag, this
   man will feed on the mountains of the prophets and Apostles, i.e., on
   their highest and loftiest mysteries. And thriving on this pasture
   continually, he will take in to himself all the thoughts of the Psalms
   and will begin to sing them in such a way that he will utter them with
   the deepest emotion of heart not as if they were the compositions of
   the Psalmist, but rather as if they were his own utterances and his
   very own prayer; and will certainly take them as aimed at himself, and
   will recognize that their words were not only fulfilled formerly by or
   in the person of the prophet, but that they are fulfilled and carried
   out daily in his own case. For then the Holy Scriptures lie open to us
   with greater clearness and as it were their very veins and marrow are
   exposed, when our experience not only perceives but actually
   anticipates their meaning, and the sense of the words is revealed to us
   not by an exposition of them but by practical proof. For if we have
   experience of the very state of mind in which each Psalm was sung and
   written, we become like their authors and anticipate the meaning rather
   than follow it, i.e., gathering the force of the words before we really
   know them, we remember what has happened to us, and what is happening
   in daily assaults when the thoughts of them come over us, and while we
   sing them we call to mind all that our carelessness has brought upon
   us, or our earnestness has secured, or Divine Providence has granted or
   the promptings of the foe have deprived us of, or slippery and subtle
   forgetfulness has carried off, or human weakness has brought about, or
   thoughtless ignorance has cheated us of. For all these feelings we find
   expressed in the Psalms so that by seeing whatever happens as in a very
   clear mirror we understand it better, and so instructed by our feelings
   as our teachers we lay hold of it as something not merely heard but
   actually seen, and, as if it were not committed to memory, but
   implanted in the very nature of things, we are affected from the very
   bottom of the heart, so that we get at its meaning not by reading the
   text but by experience anticipating it. And so our mind will reach that
   incorruptible prayer to which in our former treatise, as the Lord
   vouchsafed to grant, the scheme of our Conference mounted, and this is
   not merely not engaged in gazing on any image, but is actually
   distinguished by the use of no words or utterances; but with the
   purpose of the mind all on fire, is produced through ecstasy of heart
   by some unaccountable keenness of spirit, and the mind being thus
   affected without the aid of the senses or any visible material pours it
   forth to God with groanings and sighs that cannot be uttered.

  CHAPTER XII.

    A question as to how spiritual thoughts can be retained without losing them.

   GERMANUS: We think that you have described to us not only the system of
   this spiritual discipline for which we asked, but perfection itself;
   and this with great clearness and openness. For what can be more
   perfect and sublime than for the recollection of God to be embraced in
   so brief a meditation, and for it, dwelling on a single verse, to
   escape from all the limitations of things visible, and to comprise in
   one short word the thoughts of all our prayers. And therefore we beg
   you to explain to us one thing which still remains; viz., how we can
   keep firm hold of this verse which you have given us as a formula, in
   such a way that, as we have been by God's grace set free from the
   trifles of worldly thoughts, so we may also keep a steady grasp on all
   spiritual ones.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    On the lightness of thoughts.

   FOR when the mind has taken in the meaning of a passage in any Psalm,
   this insensibly slips away from it, and ignorantly and thoughtlessly it
   passes on to a text of some other Scripture. And when it has begun to
   consider this with itself, while it is still not thoroughly explored,
   the recollection of some other passage springs up, and shuts out the
   consideration of the former subject. From this too it is transferred to
   some other, by the entrance of some fresh consideration, and the soul
   always turns about from Psalm to Psalm and jumps from a passage in the
   Gospels to read one in the Epistles, and from this passes on to the
   prophetic writings, and thence is carried to some spiritual history,
   and so it wanders about vaguely and uncertainly through the whole body
   of the Scriptures, unable, as it may choose, either to reject or keep
   hold of anything, or to finish anything by fully considering and
   examining it, and so becomes only a toucher or taster of spiritual
   meanings, not an author and possessor of them. And so the mind, as it
   is always light and wandering, is distracted even in time of service by
   all sorts of things, as if it were intoxicated, and does not perform
   any office properly. For instance, while it is praying, it is recalling
   some Psalm or passage of Scripture. While it is chanting, it is
   thinking about something else besides what the text of the Psalm itself
   contains. When it repeats a passage of Scripture, it is thinking about
   something that has to be done, or remembering something that has been
   done. And in this way it takes in and rejects nothing in a disciplined
   and proper way, and seems to be driven about by random incursions,
   without the power either of retaining what it likes or lingering over
   it. It is then well for us before everything else to know how we can
   properly perform these spiritual offices, and keep firm hold of this
   particular verse which you have given us as a formula, so that the rise
   and fall of our feelings may not be in a state of fluctuation from
   their own lightness, but may lie under our own control.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

    The answer how we can gain stability of heart or of thoughts.

   ISAAC: Although, in our former discussion on the character of prayer,
   enough was, as I think, said on this subject, yet as you want it
   repeated to you again, I will give you a brief instruction on
   steadfastness of heart. There are three things which make a shifting
   heart steadfast, watchings, meditation, and prayer, diligence in which
   and constant attention will produce steadfast firmness of mind. But
   this cannot be secured in any other way unless all cares and anxieties
   of this present life have been first got rid of by indefatigable
   persistence in work dedicated not to covetousness but to the sacred
   uses of the monastery, that we may thus be able to fulfil the Apostle's
   command: "Pray without ceasing." [599] For he prays too little, who is
   accustomed only to pray at the times when he bends his knees. But he
   never prays, who even while on his bended knees is distracted by all
   kinds of wanderings of heart. And therefore what we would be found when
   at our prayers, that we ought to be before the time of prayer. For at
   the time of its prayers the mind cannot help being affected by its
   previous condition, and while it is praying, will be either transported
   to things heavenly, or dragged down to earthly things by those thoughts
   in which it had been lingering before prayer.

   Thus far did Abbot Isaac carry on his Second Conference on the
   character of Prayer to us astonished hearers; whose instruction on the
   consideration of that verse quoted above (which he gave as a sort of
   outline for beginners to hold) we greatly admired, and wished to follow
   very closely, as we fancied that it would be a short and easy method;
   but we have found it even harder to observe than that system of ours by
   which we used formerly to wander here and there in varied meditations
   through the whole body of the Scriptures without being tied by any
   chains of perseverance. It is then certain that no one is kept away
   from perfection of heart by not being able to read, nor is rustic
   simplicity any hindrance to the possession of purity of heart and mind,
   which lies close at hand for all, if only they will by constant
   meditation on this verse keep the thoughts of the mind safe and sound
   towards God.

  PREFACE

   ALTHOUGH many of the saints who are taught by your example can scarcely
   emulate the greatness of your perfection, with which you shine like
   great luminaries with marvellous brightness in this world, yet still
   you, O holy brothers Honoratus and Eucherius, [600] are so stirred by
   the great glory of those splendid men from whom we received the first
   principles of monasticism, that one of you, presiding as he does over a
   large monastery of the brethren, is hoping that his congregation, which
   learns a lesson from the daily sight of your saintly life, may be
   instructed in the precepts of those fathers, while the other has been
   anxious to make his way to Egypt to be edified by the sight of these in
   the flesh, that he might leave this province that is frozen as it were
   with the cold of Gaul, and like some pure turtle dove fly to those
   lands on which the sun of righteousness looks and to which it
   approaches nearest, and which abound with the ripe fruits of virtues.
   As a matter of course the greatness of my love wrings this from me;
   viz., that considering the desire of the one and the labour of the
   other, I should not decline the danger and peril of writing, if only to
   the one there may be added authority among his children, and from the
   other may be removed the necessity for so risky a journey. Further
   since neither the Institutes of the coenobia which we wrote to the best
   of our ability in twelve books for Bishop Castor of blessed memory, nor
   the ten Conferences of the fathers living in the desert of Scete, which
   we composed somehow or other at the bidding of Saints Helladius and
   Leontius the Bishops, [601] were able to satisfy your faith and zeal,
   now in order that the reason for our journey may be also known, I have
   thought that seven Conferences of the three fathers whom we first saw
   living in another desert, might be written in the same style and
   dedicated to you, in which whatever has been in our previous works
   perhaps obscurely explained or even omitted on the subject of
   perfection, may be supplied. But if even this is not enough to satisfy
   the holy thirst of your desires, seven other Conferences, which are to
   be sent to the holy brethren living in the islands of the Stoechades,
   [602] will, I fancy, satisfy your wants and your ardour.

  CHAPTER I.

    Description of the town of Thennesus.

   WHEN we were living in a monastery in Syria after our first infancy in
   the faith, and when after we had grown somewhat we had begun to long
   for some greater grace of perfection, we determined straightway to seek
   Egypt and penetrating even to the remotest desert of the Thebaid, [603]
   to visit very many of the saints, whose glory and fame had spread
   abroad everywhere, with the wish if not to emulate them at any rate to
   know them. And so we came by a very lengthy voyage to a town of Egypt
   named Thennesus, [604] whose inhabitants are so surrounded either by
   the sea or by salt lakes that they devote themselves to business alone
   and get their wealth and substance by naval commerce as the land fails
   them, so that indeed when they want to build houses, there is no soil
   sufficient for this, unless it is brought by boat from a distance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [603] It is very doubtful whether Cassian ever carried out the
   intention, of which he here speaks, of visiting the Thebaid. So far as
   we can trace the course of his wanderings, he does not seem to have
   penetrated farther into Egypt than the desert of Scete.

   Menzaleh. For the description of the neighbouring country compare

  CHAPTER II.

    Of Bishop Archebius.

   AND when we arrived there, God gratified our wishes, and had brought
   about the arrival of that most blessed and excellent man Bishop
   Archebius, [605] who had been carried off from the assembly of
   anchorites and given as Bishop to the town of Panephysis, [606] and who
   kept all his life long to his purpose of solitude with such strictness
   that he relaxed nothing of the character of his former humility, nor
   flattered himself on the honour that had been added to him (for he
   vowed that he had not been summoned to that office as fit for it, but
   complained that he had been expelled from the monastic system as
   unworthy of it because though he had spent thirty-seven years in it he
   had never been able to arrive at the purity so high a profession
   demands); he then when he had received us kindly and most graciously in
   the aforesaid Thennesus whither the business of electing a Bishop there
   had brought him, as soon as he heard of our wish and desire to inquire
   of the holy fathers even in still more remote parts of Egypt: "Come,"
   said he, "see in the meanwhile the old men who live not far from our
   monastery, the length of whose service is shown by their bent bodies,
   as their holiness shines forth in their appearance, so that even the
   mere sight of them will give a great lesson to those who see them: and
   from them you can learn not so much by their words as by the actual
   example of their holy life, what I grieve that I have lost, and having
   lost cannot give to you. But I think that my poverty will be somewhat
   lessened by this zeal of mine, if when you are seeking that pearl of
   the Gospel which I have not, I at least provide where you can
   conveniently procure it."

   AND so he took his staff and scrip, as is there the custom for all
   monks starting on a journey, and himself led us as guide of our road to
   his own city, i.e., Panephysis, the lands of which and indeed the
   greater part of the neighbouring region (formerly an extremely rich one
   since from it, as report says, everything was supplied for the royal
   table), had been covered by the sea which was disturbed by a sudden
   earthquake and overflowed its banks, and so (almost all the villages
   being in ruins) covered what were formerly rich lands with salt
   marshes, so that you might think that what is spiritually sung in the
   psalm was a literal prophecy of that region. "He hath turned rivers
   into a wilderness; and the springs of waters into a thirsty land: a
   fruitful land into saltness for the wickedness of them that dwell
   therein." [607] In these districts then many towns perched in this way
   on the higher hills were deserted by their inhabitants and turned by
   the inundation into islands, and these afforded the desired solitude to
   the holy anchorites, among whom three old men; viz., Chæremon, Nesteros
   and Joseph, stood out as anchorites of the longest standing.

  CHAPTER IV.

    Of Abbot Chæremon and his excuse about the teaching which we asked for.

   AND so the blessed Archebius thought it best to take us first to
   Chæremon, [608] because he was nearer to his monastery, and because he
   was more advanced than the other two in age: for he had passed the
   hundredth year of his life, vigorous only in spirit, but with his back
   bowed with age and constant prayer, so that, as if he were once more in
   his childhood he crawled with his hands hanging down and resting on the
   ground. Gazing then at one and the same time on this man's wonderful
   face and on his walk (for though all his limbs had already failed and
   were dead yet he had lost none of the severity of his previous
   strictness) when we humbly asked for the word and doctrine, and
   declared that longing for spiritual instruction was the only reason for
   our coming, he sighed deeply and said: What doctrine can I teach you, I
   in whom the feebleness of age has relaxed my former strictness, as it
   has also destroyed my confidence in speaking? For how could I presume
   to teach what I do not do, or instruct another in what I know I now
   practise but feebly and coldly? Wherefore I do not allow any of the
   younger men to live with me now that I am of such an advanced age, lest
   the other's strictness should be relaxed owing to my example. For the
   authority of a teacher will never be strong unless he fixes it in the
   heart of his hearer by the actual performance of his duty.

  CHAPTER V.

    Of our answer to his excuse.

   AT this we were overwhelmed with no slight confusion and replied as
   follows: Although both the difficulty of the place and the solitary
   life itself, which even a robust youth could scarcely put up with,
   ought to be sufficient to teach us everything (and indeed without your
   saying anything they do teach and impress us a very great deal) yet
   still we ask you to lay aside your silence for a little and in a more
   worthy manner implant in us those principles by which we may be able to
   embrace, not so much by imitating it as by admiring it, that goodness
   which we see in you. For even if our coldness is known to you, and does
   not deserve to obtain what we are asking for, yet at least the trouble
   of so long a journey ought to be repaid by it, as we made haste to come
   here after our first beginning in the monastery of Bethlehem, owing to
   a longing for your instruction, and a yearning for our own good.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    Abbot Chæremon's statement that faults can be overcome in three ways.

   THEN the blessed CHÆREMON: There are, said he, three things which
   enable men to control their faults; viz., either the fear of hell or of
   laws even now imposed; or the hope and desire of the kingdom of heaven;
   or a liking for goodness itself and the love of virtue. For then we
   read that the fear of evil loathes contamination: "The fear of the Lord
   hateth evil." [609] Hope also shuts out the assaults of all faults: for
   "all who hope in Him shall not fail." [610] Love also fears no
   destruction from sins, for "love never faileth;" [611] and again: "love
   covers a multitude of sins." [612] And therefore the blessed Apostle
   confines the whole sum of salvation in the attainment of those three
   virtues, saying "Now abideth faith, hope, love, these three." [613] For
   faith is what makes us shun the stains of sin from fear of future
   judgment and punishment; hope is what withdraws our mind from present
   things, and despises all bodily pleasures from its expectation of
   heavenly rewards; love is what inflames us with keenness of heart for
   the love of Christ and the fruit of spiritual goodness, and makes us
   hate with a perfect hatred whatever is opposed to these. And these
   three things although they all seem to aim at one and the same end (for
   they incite us to abstain from things unlawful) yet they differ from
   each other greatly in the degrees of their excellence. For the two
   former belong properly to those men who in their aim at goodness have
   not yet acquired the love of virtue, and the third belongs specially to
   God and to those who have received into themselves the image and
   likeness of God. For He alone does the things that are good, with no
   fear and no thanks or reward to stir Him up, but simply from the love
   of goodness. For, as Solomon says, "The Lord hath made all things for
   Himself." [614] For under cover of His own goodness He bestows all the
   fulness of good things on the worthy and the unworthy because He cannot
   be wearied by wrongs, nor be moved by passions at the sins of men, as
   He ever remains perfect goodness and unchangeable in His nature.

  CHAPTER VII.

    By what steps we can ascend to the heights of love and what permanence there
    is in it.

   IF then any one is aiming at perfection, from that first stage of fear
   which we rightly termed servile (of which it is said: "When ye have
   done all things say: we are unprofitable servants," [615] ) he should
   by advancing a step mount to the higher path of hope--which is compared
   not to a slave but to a hireling, because it looks for the payment of
   its recompense, and as if it were free from care concerning absolution
   of its sins and fear of punishment, and conscious of its own good
   works, though it seems to look for the promised reward, yet it cannot
   attain to that love of a son who, trusting in his father's kindness and
   liberality, has no doubt that all that the father has is his, to which
   also that prodigal who together with his father's substance had lost
   the very name of son, did not venture to aspire, when he said: "I am no
   more worthy to be called thy son;" for after those husks which the
   swine ate, satisfaction from which was denied to him, i.e., the
   disgusting food of sin, as he "came to himself," and was overcome by a
   salutary fear, he already began to loathe the uncleanness of the swine,
   and to dread the punishment of gnawing hunger, and as if he had already
   been made a servant, desires the condition of a hireling and thinks
   about the remuneration, and says: "How many hired servants of my father
   have abundance of bread, and I perish here with hunger. I will then
   return to my father and will say unto him, `Father I have sinned
   against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy
   son: make me as one of thy hired servants.'" [616] But those words of
   humble penitence his father who ran to meet him received with greater
   affection than that with which they were spoken, and was not content to
   allow him lesser things, but passing through the two stages without
   delay restored him to his former dignity of sonship. We also ought
   forthwith to hasten on that by means of the indissoluble grace of love
   we may mount to that third stage of sonship, which believes that all
   that the father has is its own, nd so we may be counted worthy to
   receive the image and likeness of our heavenly Father, and be able to
   say after the likeness of the true son: "All that the Father hath is
   mine." [617] Which also the blessed Apostle declares of us, saying:
   "All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world,
   or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are
   yours." [618] And to this likeness the commands of our Saviour also
   summon us: "Be ye," says He, "perfect, even as your Father in heaven is
   perfect." [619] For in these persons sometimes the love of goodness is
   found to be interrupted, when the vigour of the soul is relaxed by some
   coldness or joy or delight, and so loses either the fear of hell for
   the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there is indeed in
   these a stage leading to some advance, which affects us so that when
   from fear of punishment or from hope of reward we begin to avoid sin we
   are enabled to pass on to the stage of love, for "fear," says one, "is
   not in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment,
   but he who fears is not perfect in love. We therefore love because God
   first loved us." [620] We can then only ascend to that true perfection
   when, as He first loved us for the grace of nothing but our salvation,
   we also have loved Him for the sake of nothing but His own love alone.
   Wherefore we must do our best to mount with perfect ardour of mind from
   this fear to hope, from hope to the love of God, and the love of the
   virtues themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the love of goodness
   itself, we may, as far as it is possible for human nature, keep firm
   hold of what is good.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    How greatly those excel who depart from sin through the feeling of love.

   FOR there is a great difference between one who puts out the fire of
   sin within him by fear of hell or hope of future reward, and one who
   from the feeling of divine love has a horror of sin itself and of
   uncleanness, and keeps hold of the virtue of purity simply from the
   love and longing for purity, and looks for no reward from a promise for
   the future, but, delighted with the knowledge of good things present,
   does everything not from regard to punishment but from delight in
   virtue. For this condition can neither abuse an opportunity to sin when
   all human witnesses are absent, nor be corrupted by the secret
   allurements of thoughts, while, keeping in its very marrow the love of
   virtue itself, it not only does not admit into the heart anything that
   is opposed to it, but actually hates it with the utmost horror. For it
   is one thing for a man in his delight at some present good to hate the
   stains of sins and of the flesh, and another thing to check unlawful
   desires by contemplating the future reward; and it is one thing to fear
   present loss and another to dread future punishment. Lastly it is a
   much greater thing to be unwilling to forsake good for good's own sake,
   than it is to withhold consent from evil for fear of evil. For in the
   former case the good is voluntary, but in the latter it is constrained
   and as it were violently forced out of a reluctant party either by fear
   of punishment or by greed of reward. For one who abstains from the
   allurements of sin owing to fear, will whenever the obstacle of fear is
   removed, once more return to what he loves and thus will not
   continually acquire any stability in good, nor will he ever rest free
   from attacks because he will not secure the sure and lasting peace of
   chastity. For where there is the disturbance of warfare there cannot
   help being the danger of wounds. For one who is in the midst of the
   conflict, even though he is a warrior and by fighting bravely inflicts
   frequent and deadly wounds on his foes, must still sometimes be pierced
   by the point of the enemy's sword. But one who has defeated the attack
   of sins and is now in the enjoyment of the security of peace, and has
   passed on to the love of virtue itself, will keep this condition of
   good continually, as he is entirely wrapped up in it, because he
   believes that nothing can be worse than the loss of his inmost
   chastity. For he deems nothing dearer or more precious than present
   purity, to whom a dangerous departure from virtue or a poisonous stain
   of sin is a grievous punishment. To such an one, I say, neither will
   regard for the presence of another add anything to his goodness nor
   will solitude take anything away from it: but as always and everywhere
   he bears about with him his conscience as a judge not only of his
   actions but also of his thoughts, he will especially try to please it,
   as he knows that it cannot be cheated nor deceived, and that he cannot
   escape it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    That love not only makes sons out of servants, but also bestows the image
    and likeness of God.

   AND if to anyone relying on the help of God and not on his own efforts,
   it has been vouchsafed to acquire this state, from the condition of a
   servant, wherein is fear, and from a mercenary greed of hope, whereby
   there is sought not so much the good of the donor as the recompense of
   reward, he will begin to pass on to the adoption of sons, where there
   is no longer fear, nor greed, but that love which never faileth
   continually endures. Of which fear and love the Lord in chiding some
   shows what is befitting for each one: "A son knoweth his own father,
   and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My
   honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?" [621] For one who is a
   servant must needs fear because "if knowing his lord's will he has done
   things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes." [622]
   Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God,
   will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and
   having somehow a like feeling of patience and gentleness will
   henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his compassion
   and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and,
   remembering that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of
   similar passions till by the Lord's mercy he was saved, will feel that,
   as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his own
   exertions but by God's protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown
   to those who go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God
   the following verse: "Thou hast broken my chains. I will offer to Thee
   the sacrifice of praise;" and: "except the Lord had helped me, my soul
   had almost dwelt in hell." [623] And while he continues in this
   humility of mind he will be able even to fulfil this Evangelic command
   of perfection: "Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and
   pray for them that persecute you and slander you." [624] And so it will
   be vouchsafed to us to attain that reward which is subjoined, whereby
   we shall not only bear the image and likeness of God, but shall even be
   called sons: "that ye may be," says He "sons of your Father which is in
   heaven, Who maketh His sun to rise on the good and evil, and sends rain
   on the just and on the unjust:" [625] and this feeling the blessed John
   knew that he had attained when he said: "that we may have confidence in
   the day of judgment, because as He is so are we also in this world."
   [626] For in what can a weak and fragile human nature be like Him,
   except in always showing a calm love in its heart towards the good and
   evil, the just and the unjust, in imitation of God, and by doing good
   for the love of goodness itself, arriving at that true adoption of the
   sons of God, of which also the blessed Apostle speaks as follows:
   "Every one that is born of God doeth not sin, for His seed is in him,
   and he cannot sin, because he is born of God;" and again: "We know that
   every one who is born of God sinneth not, but his birth of God
   preserves him, and the wicked one toucheth him not"? [627] And this
   must be understood not of all kinds of sins, but only of mortal sins:
   and if any one will not extricate and cleanse himself from these, for
   him the aforesaid Apostle tells us in another place that we ought not
   even to pray, saying: "If a man knows his brother to be sinning a sin
   not unto death, let him ask, and He will give him life for them that
   sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he
   should ask for it." [628] But of those which he says are not unto
   death, from which even those who serve Christ faithfully cannot, with
   whatever care they keep themselves, be free, of these he says: "If we
   say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in
   us;" and again: "If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar,
   and His word is not in us." [629] For it is an impossibility for any
   one of the saints not to fall into those trivial faults which are
   committed by word, and thought, and ignorance, and forgetfulness, and
   necessity, and will, and surprise: which though quite different from
   that sin which is said to be unto death, still cannot be free from
   fault and blame.

  CHAPTER X.

    How it is the perfection of love to pray for one's enemies and by what signs
    we may recognize a mind that is not yet purified.

   WHEN then any one has acquired this love of goodness of which we have
   been speaking, and the imitation of God, then he will be endowed with
   the Lord's heart of compassion, and will pray also for his persecutors,
   saying in like manner: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what
   they do." [630] But it is a clear sign of a soul that is not yet
   thoroughly purged from the dregs of sin, not to sorrow with a feeling
   of pity at the offences of others, but to keep to the rigid censure of
   the judge: for how will he be able to obtain perfection of heart, who
   is without that by which, as the Apostle has pointed out, the full
   requirements of the law can be fulfilled, saying: "Bear one another's
   burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ," [631] and who has not that
   virtue of love, which "is not grieved, is not puffed up, thinketh no
   evil," which "endureth all things, beareth all things." [632] For "a
   righteous man pitieth the life of his beasts: but the heart of the
   ungodly is without pity." [633] And so a monk is quite certain to fall
   into the same sins which he condemns in another with merciless and
   inhuman severity, for "a stern king will fall into misfortunes," and
   "one who stops his ears so as not to hear the weak, shall himself cry,
   and there shall be none to hear him." [634]

  CHAPTER XI.

    A question why he has called the feeling of fear and hope imperfect.

   GERMANUS: You have indeed spoken powerfully and grandly of the perfect
   love of God. But still this fact disturbs us; viz., that while you were
   exalting it with such praise, you said that the fear of God and the
   hope of eternal reward were imperfect, though the prophet seems to have
   thought quite differently about them, where he said: "Fear the Lord,
   all ye His saints, for they that fear Him lack nothing." [635] And
   again in the matter of observing God's righteous acts he admits that he
   has done them from consideration of the reward, saying: "I have
   inclined my heart to do thy righteous acts forever, for the reward."
   [636] And the Apostle says: "By faith Moses when he was grown up,
   denied himself to be the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to
   be afflicted with the people of God than to have the pleasure of sin
   for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
   treasure of the Egyptians; for he looked unto the reward." [637] How
   then can we think that they are imperfect, if the blessed David boasted
   that he did the righteous acts of God in hope of a recompense, and the
   giver of the Law is said to have looked for a future reward and so to
   have despised the adoption to royal dignity, and to have preferred the
   most terrible affliction to the treasures of the Egyptians?

  CHAPTER XII.

    The answer on the different kinds of perfection.

   CHÆREMON: In accordance with the condition and measure of every mind
   Holy Scripture summons our free wills to different grades of
   perfection. For no uniform crown of perfection can be offered to all
   men, because all have not the same virtue, or purpose, or fervour, and
   so the Divine Word has in some way appointed different ranks and
   different measures of perfection itself. And that this is so the
   variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly shows. For though they are
   called blessed, whose is the kingdom of heaven, and blessed are they
   who shall possess the earth, and blessed are they who shall receive
   their consolation, and blessed are they who shall be filled, yet we
   believe that there is a great difference between the habitations of the
   kingdom of heaven, and the possession of the earth, whatever it be, and
   also between the reception of consolation and the fulness and
   satisfaction of righteousness; and that there is a great distinction
   between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall be deemed
   worthy to enjoy the most glorious vision of God. "For there is one
   glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of
   the stars: for star differeth from star in glory, so also is the
   resurrection of the dead." [638] While therefore in accordance with
   this rule holy Scripture praises those who fear God, and says "Blessed
   are all they that fear the Lord," [639] and promises them for this a
   full measure of bliss, yet it says again: "There is no fear in love,
   but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment. But he that
   feareth is not yet perfect in love." [640] And again, though it is a
   grand thing to serve God, and it is said: "Serve the Lord in fear;"
   and: "It is a great thing for thee to be called My servant;" and:
   "Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so
   doing," [641] yet it is said to the Apostles: "I no longer call you
   servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I call
   you friends, for all things whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I
   have made known unto you." [642] And once more: "Ye are My friends, if
   ye do whatever I command you." [643] You see then that there are
   different stages of perfection, and that we are called by the Lord from
   high things to still higher in such a way that he who has become
   blessed and perfect in the fear of God; going as it is written "from
   strength to strength," [644] and from one perfection to another, i.e.,
   mounting with keenness of soul from fear to hope, is summoned in the
   end to that still more blessed stage, which, is love, and he who has
   been "a faithful and wise servant" [645] will pass to the companionship
   of friendship and to the adoption of sons. So then our saying also must
   be understood according to this meaning: not that we say that the
   consideration of that enduring punishment or of that blessed recompense
   which is promised to the saints is of no value, but because, though
   they are useful and introduce those who pursue them to the first
   beginning of blessedness, yet again love, wherein is already fuller
   confidence, and a lasting joy, will remove them from servile fear and
   mercenary hope to the love of God, and carry them on to the adoption of
   sons, and somehow make them from being perfect still more perfect. For
   the Saviour says that in His Father's house are "many mansions," [646]
   and although all the stars seem to be in the sky, yet there is a mighty
   difference between the brightness of the sun and of the moon, and
   between that of the morning star and the rest of the stars. And
   therefore the blessed Apostle prefers it not only above fear and hope
   but also above all gifts which are counted great and wonderful, and
   shows the way of love still more excellent than all. For when after
   finishing his list of spiritual gifts of virtues he wanted to describe
   its members, he began as follows: "And yet I show unto you a still more
   excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and
   though I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all
   knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains,
   and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to
   be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing." You see then
   that nothing more precious, nothing more perfect, nothing more sublime,
   and, if I may say so, nothing more enduring can be found than love. For
   "whether there be prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be
   tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge, it shall be
   destroyed," but "love never faileth," [647] and without it not only
   those most excellent kinds of gifts, but even the glory of martyrdom
   itself will fail.

  CHAPTER XIII.

    Of the fear which is the outcome of the greatest love.

   WHOEVER then has been established in this perfect love is sure to mount
   by a higher stage to that still more sublime fear belonging to love,
   which is the outcome of no dread of punishment or greed of reward, but
   of the greatest love; whereby a son fears with earnest affection a most
   indulgent father, or a brother fears his brother, a friend his friend,
   or a wife her husband, while there is no dread of his blows or
   reproaches, but only of a slight injury to his love, and while in every
   word as well as act there is ever care taken by anxious affection lest
   the warmth of his love should cool in the very slightest degree towards
   the object of it. And one of the prophets has finely described the
   grandeur of this fear, saying: "Wisdom and knowledge are the riches of
   salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure." [648] He could not
   describe with greater clearness the worth and value of that fear than
   by saying that the riches of our salvation, which consist in true
   wisdom and knowledge of God, can only be preserved by the fear of the
   Lord. To this fear then not sinners but saints are invited by the
   prophetic word where the Psalmist says: "O fear the Lord, all ye His
   Saints: for they that fear Him lack nothing." [649] For where a man
   fears the Lord with this fear it is certain that nothing is lacking to
   his perfection. For it was clearly of that other penal fear that the
   Apostle John said that "He who feareth is not made perfect in love, for
   fear hath punishment." [650] There is then a great difference between
   this fear, to which nothing is lacking, which is the treasure of wisdom
   and knowledge, and that imperfect fear which is called "the beginning
   of wisdom," [651] and which has in it punishment and so is expelled
   from the hearts of those who are perfect by the incoming of the fulness
   of love. For "there is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out
   fear." [652] And in truth if the beginning of wisdom consists in fear,
   what will its perfection be except in the love of Christ which, as it
   contains in it the fear which belongs to perfect love, is called not
   the beginning but the treasure of wisdom and knowledge? And therefore
   there is a twofold stage of fear. The one for beginners, i.e., for
   those who are still subject to the yoke and to servile terror; of which
   we read: "And the servant shall fear his Lord;" [653] and in the
   gospel: "I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not
   what his Lord doeth;" and therefore "the servant," He tells us,
   "abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever."
   [654] For He is instructing us to pass on from that penal fear to the
   fullest freedom of love, and the confidence of the friends and sons of
   God. Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by the power of the Lord's
   love already passed through the servile stage of fear, scorns lower
   things and declares that he has been enriched with good things by the
   Lord, "for God hath not given us" he says "a spirit of fear but of
   power and of love and of a sound mind." [655] Those also who are
   inflamed with a perfect love of their heavenly Father, and whom the
   Divine adoption has already made sons instead of servants, he addresses
   in these words: "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again
   to fear, but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
   Father." [656] It is of this fear too, that the prophet spoke when he
   would describe that sevenfold spirit, which according to the mystery of
   the Incarnation, full surely descended on the God man: [657] "And there
   shall rest upon Him the Spirit of the Lord: the Spirit of wisdom and of
   understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of
   knowledge and of true godliness," and in the last place he adds as
   something special these words: "And the Spirit of the fear of the Lord
   shall fill Him." [658] Where we must in the first place notice
   carefully that he does not say "and there shall rest upon Him the
   Spirit of fear," as he said in the earlier cases, but he says "there
   shall fill Him the Spirit of the fear of the Lord." For such is the
   greatness of its richness that when once it has seized on a man by its
   power, it takes possession not of a portion but of his whole mind. And
   not without good reason. For as it is closely joined to that love which
   "never faileth," it not only fills the man, but takes a lasting and
   inseparable and continual possession of him in whom it has begun, and
   is not lessened by any allurements of temporal joy or delights, as is
   sometimes the case with that fear which is cast out. This then is the
   fear belonging to perfection, with which we are told that the God-man,
   [659] who came not only to redeem mankind, but also to give us a
   pattern of perfection and example of goodness, was filled. For the true
   Son of God "who did no sin neither was guile found in His mouth," [660]
   could not feel that servile fear of punishment.

  CHAPTER XIV.

    A question about complete chastity.

   GERMANUS: Now that you have finished your discourse on perfect
   chastity, we want also to ask somewhat more freely about the end of
   chastity. For we do not doubt that those lofty heights of love, by
   which, as you have hitherto explained, we mount to the image and
   likeness of God, cannot possibly exist without perfect purity. But we
   should like to know whether a lasting grant of it can be secured so
   that no incitement to lust may ever disturb the serenity of our heart,
   and that thus we may be enabled to pass the time of our sojourneying in
   the flesh free from this carnal passion, so as never to be inflamed by
   the fire of excitement.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

    The postponement of the explanation which is asked for.

   CHÆREMON: It is indeed a sign of the utmost blessedness and of singular
   goodness both continually to learn and to teach that love by which we
   cling to the Lord, so that meditation on Him may, as the Psalmist says,
   occupy all the days and nights of our life, [661] and may support our
   soul, which insatiably hungers and thirsts after righteousness, by
   continually chewing the cud of this heavenly food. But we must also, in
   accordance with the kindly forethought of our Saviour, make some
   provision for the food of the body, that we faint not by the way, [662]
   for "the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." [663] And
   this we must now secure by taking a little food, so that after supper,
   the mind may be rendered more attentive for the careful tracing out of
   what you want.

THE THIRD CONFERENCE OF ABBOT CHÆREMON.

ON THE PROTECTION OF GOD. [665]
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Introduction.

   WHEN after a short sleep we returned for morning service and were
   waiting for the old man, Abbot Germanus was troubled by great scruples
   because in the previous discussion, the force of which had inspired us
   with the utmost longing for this chastity which was till now unknown to
   us, the blessed old man had by the addition of a single sentence broken
   down the claims of man's exertions, adding that man even though he
   strive with all his might for a good result, yet cannot become master
   of what is good unless he has acquired it simply by the gift of Divine
   bounty and not by the efforts of his own toil. While then we were
   puzzling over this question the blessed Chæremon arrived at the cell,
   and as he saw that we were whispering together about something, he cut
   the service of prayers and Psalms shorter than usual, and asked us what
   was the matter.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    A question why the merit of good deeds may not be ascribed to the exertions
    of the man who does them.

   THEN GERMANUS: As we are almost shut out, so to speak, by the greatness
   of that splendid virtue, which was described in last night's
   discussion, from believing in the possibility of it, so, if you will
   pardon my saying so, it seems to us absurd for the reward of our
   efforts, i.e., perfect chastity, which is gained by the earnestness of
   one's own toil, not to be ascribed chiefly to the exertions of the man
   who makes the effort. For it is foolish, if, when for example, we see a
   husbandman taking the utmost pains over the cultivation of the ground,
   we do not ascribe the fruits to his exertions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    The answer that without God's help not only perfect chastity but all good of
    every kind cannot be performed.

   CHÆREMON: By this very instance which you bring forward we can still
   more clearly prove that the exertions of the worker can do nothing
   without God's aid. For neither can the husbandman, when he has spent
   the utmost pains in cultivating the ground, forthwith ascribe the
   produce of the crops and the rich fruits to his own exertions, as he
   finds that these are often in vain unless opportune rains and a quiet
   and calm winter aids them, so that we have often seen fruits already
   ripe and set and thoroughly matured snatched as it were from the hands
   of those who were grasping them; and their continuous and earnest
   efforts were of no use to the workers because they were not under the
   guidance of the Lord's assistance. As then the Divine goodness does not
   grant these rich crops to idle husbandmen who do not till their fields
   by frequent ploughing, so also toil all night long is of no use to the
   workers unless the mercy of the Lord prospers it. But herein human
   pride should never try to put itself on a level with the grace of God
   or to intermingle itself with it, so as to fancy that its own efforts
   were the cause of Divine bounty, or to boast that a very plentiful crop
   of fruits was an answer to the merits of its own exertions. For a man
   should consider and with a most careful scrutiny weigh the fact that he
   could not by his own strength apply those very efforts which he has
   earnestly used in his desire for wealth, unless the Lord's protection
   and pity had given him strength for the performance of all agricultural
   labours; and that his own will and strength would have been powerless
   unless Divine compassion had supplied the means for the completion of
   them, as they sometimes fail either from too much or from too little
   rain. For when vigour has been granted by the Lord to the oxen, and
   bodily health and the power to do all the work, and prosperity in
   undertakings, still a man must pray lest there come to him, as
   Scripture says, "a heaven of brass and an earth of iron," and "the
   cankerworm eat what the locust hath left, and the palmerworm eat what
   the cankerworm hath left, and the mildew destroys what the palmerworm
   hath left." [666] Nor is it only in this that the efforts of the
   husbandman in his work need God's help, unless it also averts unlooked
   for accidents by which, even when the field is rich with the expected
   fruitful crops, not only is the man deprived of what he has vainly
   hoped and looked for, but actually loses the abundant fruits which he
   has already gathered and stored up in the threshing floor or in the
   barn. From which we clearly infer that the initiative not only of our
   actions but also of good thoughts comes from God, who inspires us with
   a good will to begin with, and supplies us with the opportunity of
   carrying out what we rightly desire: for "every good gift and every
   perfect gift cometh down from above, from the Father of lights," [667]
   who both begins what is good, and continues it and completes it in us,
   as the Apostle says: "But He who giveth seed to the sower will both
   provide bread to eat and will multiply your seed and make the fruits of
   your righteousness to increase." [668] But it is for us, humbly to
   follow day by day the grace of God which is drawing us, or else if we
   resist with "a stiff neck," and (to use the words of Scripture)
   "uncircumcised ears," [669] we shall deserve to hear the words of
   Jeremiah: "Shall he that falleth, not rise again? and he that is turned
   away, shall he not turn again? Why then is this people in Jerusalem
   turned away with a stubborn revolting? They have stiffened their necks
   and refused to return." [670]

  CHAPTER IV.

    An objection, asking how the Gentiles can be said to have chastity without
    the grace of God.

   GERMANUS: To this explanation, the excellence of which we cannot
   hastily disprove, it seems a difficulty that it tends to destroy free
   will. For as we see that many of the heathen to whom the assistance of
   Divine grace has certainly not been vouchsafed, are eminent not only in
   the virtues of frugality and patience, but (which is more remarkable)
   in that of chastity, how can we think that the freedom of their will is
   taken captive and that these virtues are granted to them by God's gift,
   especially as in following after the wisdom of this world, and in their
   utter ignorance not only of God's grace but even of the existence of
   the true God, as we have known Him by the course of our reading and the
   teaching of others--they are said to have gained the most perfect
   purity of chastity by their own efforts and exertions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    The answer on the imaginary chastity of the philosophers.

   CHÆREMON: I am pleased that, though you are fired with the greatest
   longing to know the truth, yet you bring forward some foolish points,
   as by your raising these objections the value of the Catholic faith may
   seem better established, and if I may use the expression, more
   thoroughly explored. For what wise man would make such contradictory
   statements as yesterday to maintain that the heavenly purity of
   chastity could not possibly even by God's grace be bestowed on any
   mortals, and now to hold that it was obtained even by the heathen by
   their own strength? But as you have certainly, as I said, made these
   objections from the desire of getting at the truth, consider what we
   hold on these points. First we certainly must not think that the
   philosophers attained such chastity of soul, as is required of us, on
   whom it is enjoined that not fornication only, but uncleanness be not
   so much as named among us. But they had a sort of merikh, i.e., some
   particle of chastity; viz. continence of the flesh, by which they could
   restrain their lust from carnal intercourse: but this internal purity
   of mind and continual purity of body they could not attain, I will not
   say, in act, but even in thought. Finally Socrates, the most famous of
   them all, as they themselves esteem him, was not ashamed to profess
   this of himself. For when one who judged a man's character by his looks
   (fusiognwmwn) looked at him, and said ommata paid erastou, i.e., "the
   eyes of a corrupter of boys," and his scholars rushed at him, and
   brought him to their master and wanted to avenge the insult, it is said
   that he checked their indignation with these words: pausaoqe, etairoi.
   Eimi gar, epecw de, i.e., Stop, my friends, for I am, but I restrain
   myself. It is then quite clearly shown not only by our assertions but
   actually by their own admissions that it was only the performance of
   indecent act, i.e., the disgrace of intercourse, that was by force of
   necessity checked by them, and that the desire and delight in this
   passion was not shut out from their hearts. But with what horror must
   one bring forward this saying of Diogenes? For a thing which the
   philosophers of this world were not ashamed to bring forward as
   something remarkable, cannot be spoken or heard by us without shame:
   for to one to be punished for the crime of adultery they relate that he
   said to dwrean pwloumenon qanatw mh agoraze, i.e., you should not buy
   with your death what is sold for nothing. [671] It is clear then that
   they did not recognize the virtue of the true chastity which we seek
   for, and so it is quite certain that our circumcision which is in the
   spirit cannot be acquired save only by the gift of God, and that it
   belongs only to those who serve God with full contrition of their
   spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [671] The source of these stories of Socrates and Diogenes has not been

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    That without the grace of God we cannot make any diligent efforts.

   AND therefore though in many things, indeed in everything, it can be
   shown that men always have need of God's help, and that human weakness
   cannot accomplish anything that has to do with salvation by itself
   alone, i.e., without the aid of God, yet in nothing is this more
   clearly shown than in the acquisition and preservation of chastity. For
   as the discussion on the difficulty of its perfection is put off for so
   long, let us meanwhile discourse briefly on the instruments of it. Who,
   I ask, could, however fervent he might be in spirit, relying on his own
   strength with no praise from men endure the squalor of the desert, and
   I will not say the daily lack but the supply of dry bread? Who without
   the Lord's consolation, could put up with the continual thirst for
   water, or deprive his human eyes of that sweet and delicious morning
   sleep, and regularly compress his whole time of rest and repose into
   the limits of four hours? Who would be sufficient without God's grace
   to give continual attendance to reading and constant earnestness in
   work, receiving no advantage of present gain? And all these matters, as
   we cannot desire them continuously without divine inspiration, so in no
   respect whatever can we perform them without His help. And that we may
   ensure that these things are not only proved to us by the teaching of
   experience, but also made still clearer by sure proof and arguments,
   does not some weakness intervene in the case of many things which we
   wish usefully to perform, and though the full keenness of our desire
   and the perfection of our will be not wanting, yet interfere with the
   wish we have conceived, so that there is no carrying out of our
   purpose, unless the power to perform it has been granted by the mercy
   of the Lord, so that, although there are countless swarms of people who
   are anxious to stick faithfully to the pursuit of virtue, you can
   scarcely find any who are able to carry it out and endure it, to say
   nothing of the fact that, even when no weakness at all hinders us, the
   opportunity for doing everything that we wish does not lie in our own
   power. For it is not in our power to secure the silence of solitude and
   severe fasts and undisturbed study even when we could use such
   opportunities, but by a chapter of accidents we are often very much
   against our will kept away from the salutary ordinances so that we have
   to pray to the Lord for opportunities of place or time in which to
   practise them. And it is clear that the ability for these is not
   sufficient for us unless there be also granted to us by the Lord an
   opportunity of doing what we are capable of (as the Apostle also says:
   "For we wanted to come to you once and again, but Satan hindered us"
   [672] ), so that sometimes we find for our advantage we are called away
   from these spiritual exercises in order that while without our own
   consent the regularity of our routine is broken and we yield something
   to weakness of the flesh, we may even against our will be brought to a
   salutary patience. Of which providential arrangement of God the blessed
   Apostle says something similar: "For which I besought the Lord thrice
   that it might depart from me. And He said to me: My grace is sufficient
   for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness:" and again: "For
   we know not what to pray for as we ought." [673]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

    Of the main purpose of God and His daily Providence.

   FOR the purpose of God whereby He made man not to perish but to live
   for ever, stands immovable. And when His goodness sees in us even the
   very smallest spark of good will shining forth, which He Himself has
   struck as it were out of the hard flints of our hearts, He fans and
   fosters it and nurses it with His breath, as He "willeth all men to be
   saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth," for as He says, "it
   is not the will of your Father which is in heaven that one of these
   little ones should perish," and again it says: "Neither will God have a
   soul to perish, but recalleth," meaning that he that is cast off should
   not altogether perish. [674] For He is true, and lieth not when He lays
   down with an oath: "As I live, saith the Lord God, for I will not the
   death of a sinner, but that he should turn from his way and live."
   [675] For if He willeth not that one of His little ones should perish,
   how can we imagine without grievous blasphemy that He does not
   generally will all men, but only some instead of all to be saved? Those
   then who perish, perish against His will, as He testifies against each
   one of them day by day: "Turn from your evil ways, and why will ye die,
   O house of Israel?" [676] And again: "How often would I have gathered
   thy children together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,
   and ye would not;" and: "Wherefore is this people in Jerusalem turned
   away with a stubborn revolting? They have hardened their faces and
   refused to return." [677] The grace of Christ then is at hand every
   day, which, while it "willeth all men to be saved and to come to the
   knowledge of the truth," calleth all without any exception, saying:
   "Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
   refresh you." [678] But if He calls not all generally but only some, it
   follows that not all are heavy laden either with original or actual
   sin, and that this saying is not a true one: "For all have sinned and
   come short of the glory of God;" nor can we believe that "death passed
   on all men." [679] And so far do all who perish, perish against the
   will of God, that God cannot be said to have made death, as Scripture
   itself testifies: "For God made not death, neither rejoiceth in the
   destruction of the living." [680] And hence it comes that for the most
   part when instead of good things we ask for the opposite, our prayer is
   either heard but tardily or not at all; and again the Lord vouchsafes
   to bring upon us even against our will, like some most beneficent
   physician, for our good what we think is opposed to it, and sometimes
   He delays and hinders our injurious purposes and deadly attempts from
   having their horrible effects, and, while we are rushing headlong
   towards death, draws us back to salvation, and rescues us without our
   knowing it from the jaws of hell.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of the grace of God and the freedom of the will.

   AND this care of His and providence with regard to us the Divine word
   has finely described by the prophet Hosea under the figure of Jerusalem
   as an harlot, and inclining with disgraceful eagerness to the worship
   of idols, where when she says: "I will go after my lovers, who give me
   my bread, and my water, and my wool, and my flax, and my oil, and my
   drink;" the Divine consideration replies having regard to her salvation
   and not to her wishes: "Behold I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
   I will stop it up with a wall, and she shall not find her paths. And
   she shall follow after her lovers, and shall not overtake them: and she
   shall seek them, and shall not find them, and shall say: I will return
   to my first husband, because it was better with me then than now."
   [681] And again our obstinacy, and scorn, with which we in our
   rebellious spirit disdain Him when He urges us to a salutary return, is
   described in the following comparison: He says: "And I said thou shalt
   call Me Father, and shalt not cease to walk after Me. But as a woman
   that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel despised Me,
   saith the Lord." [682] Aptly then, as He has compared Jerusalem to an
   adulteress forsaking her husband, He compares His own love and
   persevering goodness to a man who is dying of love for a woman. For the
   goodness and love of God, which He ever shows to mankind,--since it is
   overcome by no injuries so as to cease from caring for our salvation,
   or be driven from His first intention, as if vanquished by our
   iniquities,--could not be more fitly described by any comparison than
   the case of a man inflamed with most ardent love for a woman, who is
   consumed by a more burning passion for her, the more he sees that he is
   slighted and despised by her. The Divine protection then is inseparably
   present with us, and so great is the kindness of the Creator towards
   His creatures, that His Providence not only accompanies it, but
   actually constantly precedes it, as the prophet experienced and plainly
   confessed, saying: "My God will prevent me with His mercy." [683] And
   when He sees in us some beginnings of a good will, He at once
   enlightens it and strengthens it and urges it on towards salvation,
   increasing that which He Himself implanted or which He sees to have
   arisen from our own efforts. For He says "Before they cry, I will hear
   them: While they are still speaking I will hear them;" and again: "As
   soon as He hears the voice of thy crying, He will answer thee." [684]
   And in His goodness, not only does He inspire us with holy desires, but
   actually creates occasions for life and opportunities for good results,
   and shows to those in error the direction of the way of salvation.

  CHAPTER IX.

    Of the power of our good will, and the grace of God.

   WHENCE human reason cannot easily decide how the Lord gives to those
   that ask, is found by those that seek, and opens to those that knock,
   and on the other hand is found by those that sought Him not, appears
   openly among those who asked not for Him, and all the day long
   stretches forth His hands to an unbelieving and gainsaying people,
   calls those who resist and stand afar off, draws men against their will
   to salvation, takes away from those who want to sin the faculty of
   carrying out their desire, in His goodness stands in the way of those
   who are rushing into wickedness. But who can easily see how it is that
   the completion of our salvation is assigned to our own will, of which
   it is said: "If ye be willing, and hearken unto Me, ye shall eat the
   good things of the land," [685] and how it is "not of him that willeth
   or runneth, but of God that hath mercy"? [686] What too is this, that
   God "will render to every man according to his works;" [687] and "it is
   God who worketh in you both to will and to do, of His good pleasure;"
   [688] and "this is not of yourselves but it is the gift of God: not of
   works, that no man may boast"? [689] What is this too which is said:
   "Draw near to the Lord, and He will draw near to you," [690] and what
   He says elsewhere: "No man cometh unto Me except the Father who sent Me
   draw Him"? [691] What is it that we find: "Make straight paths for your
   feet and direct your ways," [692] and what is it that we say in our
   prayers: "Direct my way in Thy sight," and "establish my goings in Thy
   paths, that my footsteps be not moved"? [693] What is it again that we
   are admonished: "Make you a new heart and a new spirit," [694] and what
   is this which is promised to us: "I will give them one heart and will
   put a new spirit within them:" and "I will take away the stony heart
   from their flesh and will give them an heart of flesh that they may
   walk in Thy statutes and keep My judgments"? [695] What is it that the
   Lord commands, where He says: "Wash thine heart of iniquity, O
   Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved," [696] and what is it that the
   prophet asks for from the Lord, when he says "Create in me a clean
   heart, O God," and again: "Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter
   than snow"? [697] What is it that is said to us: "Enlighten yourselves
   with the light of knowledge;" [698] and this which is said of God: "Who
   teacheth man knowledge;" [699] and: "the Lord enlightens the blind,"
   [700] or at any rate this, which we say in our prayers with the
   prophet: "Lighten mine eyes that I sleep not in death," [701] unless in
   all these there is a declaration of the grace of God and the freedom of
   our will, because even of his own motion a man can be led to the quest
   of virtue, but always stands in need of the help of the Lord? For
   neither does anyone enjoy good health whenever he will, nor is he at
   his own will and pleasure set free from disease and sickness. But what
   good is it to have desired the blessing of health, unless God, who
   grants us the enjoyments of life itself, grant also vigorous and sound
   health? But that it may be still clearer that through the excellence of
   nature which is granted by the goodness of the Creator, sometimes first
   beginnings of a good will arise, which however cannot attain to the
   complete performance of what is good unless it is guided by the Lord,
   the Apostle bears witness and says: "For to will is present with me,
   but to perform what is good I find not." [702]

  CHAPTER X.

    On the weakness of free will.

   FOR Holy Scripture supports the freedom of the will where it says:
   "Keep thy heart with all diligence," [703] but the Apostle indicates
   its weakness by saying "The Lord keep your hearts and minds in Christ
   Jesus." [704] David asserts the power of free will, where he says "I
   have inclined my heart to do Thy righteous acts," [705] but the same
   man in like manner teaches us its weakness, by praying and saying,
   "Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies and not to covetousness:" [706]
   Solomon also: "The Lord incline our hearts unto Himself that we may
   walk in all His ways and keep His commandments, and ordinances and
   judgments." [707] The Psalmist denotes the power of our will, where he
   says: "Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they speak no
   guile," [708] our prayer testifies to its weakness, when we say: "O
   Lord, set a watch before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips." [709]
   The importance of our will is maintained by the Lord, when we find
   "Break the chains of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion:" [710] of
   its weakness the prophet sings, when he says: "The Lord looseth them
   that are bound:" and "Thou hast broken my chains: To Thee will I offer
   the sacrifice of praise." [711] We hear in the gospel the Lord
   summoning us to come speedily to Him by our free will: "Come unto Me
   all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you," [712]
   but the same Lord testifies to its weakness, by saying: "No man can
   come unto Me except the Father which sent Me draw him." [713] The
   Apostle indicates our free will by saying: "So run that ye may obtain:"
   [714] but to its weakness John Baptist bears witness where he says: "No
   man can receive anything of himself, except it be given him from
   above." [715] We are commanded to keep our souls with all care, when
   the Prophet says: "Keep your souls," [716] but by the same spirit
   another Prophet proclaims: "Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman
   waketh but in vain." [717] The Apostle writing to the Philippians, to
   show that their will is free, says "Work out your own salvation with
   fear and trembling," but to point out its weakness, he adds: "For it is
   God that worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure."

  CHAPTER XI.

    Whether the grace of God precedes or follows our good will.

   AND so these are somehow mixed up and indiscriminately confused, so
   that among many persons, which depends on the other is involved in
   great questionings, i.e., does God have compassion upon us because we
   have shown the beginning of a good will, or does the beginning of a
   good will follow because God has had compassion upon us? For many
   believing each of these and asserting them more widely than is right
   are entangled in all kinds of opposite errors. For if we say that the
   beginning of free will is in our own power, what about Paul the
   persecutor, what about Matthew the publican, of whom the one was drawn
   to salvation while eager for bloodshed and the punishment of the
   innocent, the other for violence and rapine? But if we say that the
   beginning of our free will is always due to the inspiration of the
   grace of God, what about the faith of Zaccheus, or what are we to say
   of the goodness of the thief on the cross, who by their own desires
   brought violence to bear on the kingdom of heaven and so prevented the
   special leadings of their vocation? But if we attribute the performance
   of virtuous acts, and the execution of God's commands to our own will,
   how do we pray: "Strengthen, O God, what Thou hast wrought in us;" and
   "The work of our hands stablish Thou upon us"? [719] We know that
   Balaam was brought to curse Israel, but we see that when he wished to
   curse he was not permitted to. Abimelech is preserved from touching
   Rebecca and so sinning against God. Joseph is sold by the envy of his
   brethren, in order to bring about the descent of the children of Israel
   into Egypt, and that while they were contemplating the death of their
   brother provision might be made for them against the famine to come: as
   Joseph shows when he makes himself known to his brethren and says:
   "Fear not, neither let it be grievous unto you that ye sold me into
   these parts: for for your salvation God sent me before you;" and below:
   "For God sent me before that ye might be preserved upon the earth and
   might have food whereby to live. Not by your design was I sent but by
   the will of God, who has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all
   his house, and chief over all the land of Egypt." And when his brethren
   were alarmed after the death of his father, he removed their suspicions
   and terror by saying: "Fear not: Can ye resist the will of God? You
   imagined evil against me but God turned it into good, that He might
   exalt me, as ye see at the present time, that He might save much
   people." [720] And that this was brought about providentially the
   blessed David likewise declare saying in the hundred and fourth Psalm:
   "And He called for a dearth upon the land: and brake all the staff of
   bread. He sent a man before them: Joseph was sold for a slave." [721]
   These two then; viz., the grace of God and free will seem opposed to
   each other, but really are in harmony, and we gather from the system of
   goodness that we ought to have both alike, lest if we withdraw one of
   them from man, we may seem to have broken the rule of the Church's
   faith: for when God sees us inclined to will what is good, He meets,
   guides, and strengthens us: for "At the voice of thy cry, as soon as He
   shall hear, He will answer thee;" and: "Call upon Me," He says, "in the
   day of tribulation and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me."
   [722] And again, if He finds that we are unwilling or have grown cold,
   He stirs our hearts with salutary exhortations, by which a good will is
   either renewed or formed in us.

  CHAPTER XII.

    That a good will should not always be attributed to grace, nor always to man
    himself.

   FOR we should not hold that God made man such that he can never will or
   be capable of what is good: or else He has not granted him a free will,
   if He has suffered him only to will or be capable of evil, but neither
   to will or be capable of what is good of himself. And, in this case how
   will that first statement of the Lord made about men after the fall
   stand: "Behold, Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil"?
   [723] For we cannot think that before, he was such as to be altogether
   ignorant of good. Otherwise we should have to admit that he was formed
   like some irrational and insensate beast: which is sufficiently absurd
   and altogether alien from the Catholic faith. Moreover as the wisest
   Solomon says: "God made man upright," i.e., always to enjoy the
   knowledge of good only, "But they have sought out many imaginations,"
   [724] for they came, as has been said, to know good and evil. Adam
   therefore after the fall conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not
   previously, but did not lose the knowledge of good which he had before.
   Finally the Apostle's words very clearly show that mankind did not lose
   after the fall of Adam the knowledge of good: as he says: "For when the
   Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things of the law,
   these, though they have not the law, are a law to themselves, as they
   show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience
   bearing witness to these, and their thoughts within them either
   accusing or else excusing them, in the day in which God shall judge the
   secrets of men." [725] And with the same meaning the Lord rebukes by
   the prophet the unnatural but freely chosen blindness of the Jews,
   which they by their obstinacy brought upon themselves, saying: "Hear ye
   deaf, and ye blind, behold that you may see. Who is deaf but My
   servant? and blind, but he to whom I have sent My messengers?" [726]
   And that no one might ascribe this blindness of theirs to nature
   instead of to their own will, elsewhere He says: "Bring forth the
   people that are blind and have eyes: that are deaf and have ears;" and
   again: "having eyes, but ye see not; and ears, but ye hear not." [727]
   The Lord also says in the gospel: "Because seeing they see not, and
   hearing they hear not neither do they understand." [728] And in them is
   fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: "Hearing ye shall hear and
   shall not understand: and seeing ye shall see and shall not see. For
   the heart of this people is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of
   hearing: and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with
   their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart,
   and be turned and I should heal them." [729] Finally in order to denote
   that the possibility of good was in them, in chiding the Pharisees, He
   says: "But why of your own selves do ye not judge what is right?" [730]
   And this he certainly would not have said to them, unless He knew that
   by their natural judgment they could discern what was fair. Wherefore
   we must take care not to refer all the merits of the saints to the Lord
   in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to
   human nature: in doing which we are confuted by the evidence of the
   most wise Solomon, or rather of the Lord Himself, Whose words these
   are; for when the building of the Temple was finished and he was
   praying, he spoke as follows: "And David my father would have built a
   house to the name of the Lord God of Israel: and the Lord said to David
   my father: Whereas thou hast thought in thine heart to build a house to
   My name, thou hast well done in having this same thing in thy mind.
   Nevertheless thou shall not build a house to My name." [731] This
   thought then and this purpose of king David, are we to call it good and
   from God or bad and from man? For if that thought was good and from
   God, why did He by whom it was inspired refuse that it should be
   carried into effect? But if it is bad and from man, why is it praised
   by the Lord? It remains then that we must take it as good and from man.
   And in the same way we can take our own thoughts today. For it was not
   given only to David to think what is good of himself, nor is it denied
   to us naturally to think or imagine anything that is good. It cannot
   then be doubted that there are by nature some seeds of goodness in
   every soul implanted by the kindness of the Creator: but unless these
   are quickened by the assistance of God, they will not be able to attain
   to an increase of perfection, for, as the blessed Apostle says:
   "Neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth, but God
   that giveth the increase." [732] But that freedom of the will is to
   some degree in a man's own power is very clearly taught in the book
   termed the Pastor, [733] where two angels are said to be attached to
   each one of us, i.e., a good and a bad one, while it lies at a man's
   own option to choose which to follow. And therefore the will always
   remains free in man, and can either neglect or delight in the grace of
   God. For the Apostle would not have commanded saying: "Work out your
   own salvation with fear and trembling," had he not known that it could
   be advanced or neglected by us. But that men might not fancy that they
   had no need of Divine aid for the work of Salvation, he subjoins: "For
   it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of His good
   pleasure." [734] And therefore he warns Timothy and says: "Neglect not
   the grace of God which is in thee;" and again: "For which cause I
   exhort thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee." [735] Hence
   also in writing to the Corinthians he exhorts and warns them not
   through their unfruitful works to show themselves unworthy of the grace
   of God, saying: "And we helping, exhort you that ye receive not the
   grace of God in vain:" [736] for the reception of saving grace was of
   no profit to Simon doubtless because he had received it in vain; for he
   would not obey the command of the blessed Peter who said: "Repent of
   thine iniquity, and pray God if haply the thoughts of thine heart may
   be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of
   bitterness and the bonds of iniquity." [737] It prevents therefore the
   will of man, for it is said: "My God will prevent me with His mercy;"
   [738] and again when God waits and for our good delays, that He may put
   our desires to the test, our will precedes, for it is said: "And in the
   morning my prayer shall prevent Thee;" and again: "I prevented the
   dawning of the day and cried;" and: "Mine eyes have prevented the
   morning." [739] For He calls and invites us, when He says: "All the day
   long I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying
   people;" [740] and He is invited by us when we say to Him: "All the day
   long I have stretched forth My hands unto Thee." [741] He waits for us,
   when it is said by the prophet: "Wherefore the Lord waiteth to have
   compassion upon us;" [742] and He is waited for by us, when we say: "I
   waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me;" and: "I have
   waited for thy salvation, O Lord." [743] He strengthens us when He
   says: "And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms; and they
   have imagined evil against me;" [744] and He exhorts us to strengthen
   ourselves when He says: "Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make strong
   the feeble knees." [745] Jesus cries: "If any man thirst let him come
   unto Me and drink;" [746] the prophet also cries to Him: "I have
   laboured with crying, my jaws are become hoarse: mine eyes have failed,
   whilst I hope in my God." [747] The Lord seeks us, when He says: "I
   sought and there was no man. I called, and there was none to answer;"
   [748] and He Himself is sought by the bride who mourns with tears: "I
   sought on my bed by night Him whom my soul loved: I sought Him and
   found Him not; I called Him, and He gave me no answer." [749]

  CHAPTER XIII.

    How human efforts cannot be set against the grace of God.

   AND so the grace of God always co-operates with our will for its
   advantage, and in all things assists, protects, and defends it, in such
   a way as sometimes even to require and look for some efforts of good
   will from it that it may not appear to confer its gifts on one who is
   asleep or relaxed in sluggish ease, as it seeks opportunities to show
   that as the torpor of man's sluggishness is shaken off its bounty is
   not unreasonable, when it bestows it on account of some desire and
   efforts to gain it. And none the less does God's grace continue to be
   free grace while in return for some small and trivial efforts it
   bestows with priceless bounty such glory of immortality, and such gifts
   of eternal bliss. For because the faith of the thief on the cross came
   as the first thing, no one would say that therefore the blessed abode
   of Paradise was not promised to him as a free gift, nor could we hold
   that it was the penitence of King David's single word which he uttered:
   "I have sinned against the Lord," and not rather the mercy of God which
   removed those two grievous sins of his, so that it was vouchsafed to
   him to hear from the prophet Nathan: "The Lord also hath put away thine
   iniquity: thou shalt not die." [750] The fact then that he added murder
   to adultery, was certainly due to free will: but that he was reproved
   by the prophet, this was the grace of Divine Compassion. Again it was
   his own doing that he was humbled and acknowledged his guilt; but that
   in a very short interval of time he was granted pardon for such sins,
   this was the gift of the merciful Lord. And what shall we say of this
   brief confession and of the incomparable infinity of Divine reward,
   when it is easy to see what the blessed Apostle, as he fixes his gaze
   on the greatness of future remuneration, announced on those countless
   persecutions of his? "for," says he, "our light affliction which is but
   for a moment worketh in us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
   glory," [751] of which elsewhere he constantly affirms, saying that
   "the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
   the future glory which shall be revealed in us." [752] However much
   then human weakness may strive, it cannot come up to the future reward,
   nor by its efforts so take off from Divine grace that it should not
   always remain a free gift. And therefore the aforesaid teacher of the
   Gentiles, though he bears his witness that he had obtained the grade of
   the Apostolate by the grace of God, saying: "By the grace of God I am
   what I am," yet also declares that he himself had corresponded to
   Divine Grace, where he says: "And His Grace in me was not in vain; but
   I laboured more abundantly than they all: and yet not I, but the Grace
   of God with me." [753] For when he says: "I laboured," he shows the
   effort of his own will; when he says: "yet not I, but the grace of
   God," he points out the value of Divine protection; when he says: "with
   me," he affirms that it cooperates with him when he was not idle or
   careless, but working and making an effort.

  CHAPTER XIV.

    How God makes trial of the strength of man's will by means of his
    temptations.

   AND this too we read that the Divine righteousness provided for in the
   case of Job His well tried athlete, when the devil had challenged him
   to single combat. For if he had advanced against his foe, not with his
   own strength, but solely with the protection of God's grace; and,
   supported only by Divine aid without any virtue of patience on his own
   part, had borne that manifold weight of temptations and losses,
   contrived with all the cruelty of his foe, how would the devil have
   repeated with some justice that slanderous speech which he had
   previously uttered: "Doth Job serve God for nought? Hast Thou not
   hedged him in, and all his substance round about? but take away thine
   hand," i.e., allow him to fight with me in his own strength, "and he
   will curse Thee to Thy face." [754] But as after the struggle the
   slanderous foe dare not give vent to any such murmur as this, he
   admired that he was vanquished by his strength and not by that of God;
   although too we must not hold that the grace of God was altogether
   wanting to him, which gave to the tempter a power of tempting in
   proportion to that which it knew that he had of resisting, without
   protecting him from his attacks in such a way as to leave no room for
   human virtue, but only providing for this; viz., that the most fierce
   foe should not drive him out of his mind and overwhelm him when
   weakened, with unequal thoughts and in an unfair contest. But that the
   Lord is sometimes wont to tempt our faith that it maybe made stronger
   and more glorious, we are taught by the example of the centurion in the
   gospel, in whose case though the Lord knew that He would cure his
   servant by the power of His word, yet He chose to offer His bodily
   presence, saying: "I will come and heal him:" but when the centurion
   overcame this offer of His by the ardour of still more fervent faith,
   and said: "Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my
   roof: but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed," the Lord
   marvelled at him and praised him, and put him before all those of the
   people of Israel who had believed, saying: "Verily, I say unto you, I
   have not found so great faith in Israel." [755] For there would have
   been no ground for praise or merit, if Christ had only preferred in him
   what He Himself had given. And this searching trial of faith we read
   that the Divine righteousness brought about also in the case of the
   grandest of the patriarchs; where it is said: "And it came to pass
   after these things that God did tempt Abraham." [756] For the Divine
   righteousness wished to try not that faith with which the Lord had
   inspired him, but that which when called and enlightened by the Lord he
   could show forth by his own free will. Wherefore the firmness of his
   faith was not without reason proved, and when the grace of God, which
   had for a while left him to prove him, came to his aid, it was said:
   "Lay not thine hand on the lad, and do nothing unto him: for now I know
   that thou fearest the Lord, and for my sake hast not spared thy beloved
   son." [757] And that this kind of temptation can befall us, for the
   sake of proving us, is sufficiently clearly foretold by the giver of
   the Law in Deuteronomy: "If there rise in the midst of you a prophet or
   one that saith he hath seen a dream, and foretell a sign and wonder;
   and that come to pass which he spoke, and he say to thee: Let us go and
   serve strange gods which ye know not, thou shalt not hear the words of
   that prophet or dreamer; for the Lord your God surely trieth thee,
   whether thou lovest Him with all thine heart, and keepest His
   Commandments, or no." [758] What then follows? When God has permitted
   that prophet or dreamer to arise, must we hold that He will protect
   those whose faith He is purposing to try, in such a way as to leave no
   place for their own free will, where they can fight with the tempter
   with their own strength? And why is it necessary for them even to be
   tried if He knows them to be so weak and feeble as not to be able by
   their own power to resist the tempter? But certainly the Divine
   righteousness would not have permitted them to be tempted, unless it
   knew that there was within them an equal power of resistance, by which
   they could by an equitable judgment be found in either result either
   guilty or worthy of praise. To the same effect also is this which the
   Apostle says: "Therefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed
   lest he fall. There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common
   to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
   above that ye are able, but will with the temptation make also a way of
   escape that ye may be able to bear it." [759] For when he says "Let him
   that standeth take heed lest he fall" he sets free will on its guard,
   as he certainly knew that, after grace had been received, it could
   either stand by its exertions or fall through carelessness. But when he
   adds: "there hath no temptation taken you but what is common to man" he
   chides their weakness and the frailty of their heart that is not yet
   strengthened, as they could not yet resist the attacks of the hosts of
   spiritual wickedness, against which he knew that he and those who were
   perfect daily fought; of which also he says to the Ephesians: "For we
   wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
   against powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against
   spiritual wickedness in heavenly places." [760] But when he subjoins:
   "But God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that
   ye are able," he certainly is not hoping that the Lord will not suffer
   them to be tempted, but that they may not be tempted above what they
   are able to bear. For the one shows the power of man's will, the other
   denotes the grace of the Lord who moderates the violence of
   temptations. In all these phrases then there is proof that Divine grace
   ever stirs up the will of man, not so as to protect and defend it in
   all things in such a way as to cause it not to fight by its own efforts
   against its spiritual adversaries, the victor over whom may set it down
   to God's grace, and the vanquished to his own weakness, and thus learn
   that his hope is always not in his own courage but in the Divine
   assistance, and that he must ever fly to his Protector. And to prove
   this not by our own conjecture but by still clearer passages of Holy
   Scripture let us consider what we read in Joshuah the son of Nun: "The
   Lord," it says, "left these nations and would not destroy them, that by
   them He might try Israel, whether they would keep the commandments of
   the Lord their God, and that they might learn to fight with their
   enemies." [761] And if we may illustrate the incomparable mercy of our
   Creator from something earthly, not as being equal in kindness, but as
   an illustration of mercy: if a tender and anxious nurse carries an
   infant in her bosom for a long time in order sometime to teach it to
   walk, and first allows it to crawl, then supports it that by the aid of
   her right hand it may lean on its alternate steps, presently leaves it
   for a little and if she sees it tottering at all, catches hold of it,
   and grabs at it when falling, when down picks it up, and either shields
   it from a fall, or allows it to fall lightly, and sets it up again
   after a tumble, but when she has brought it up to boyhood or the
   strength of youth or early manhood, lays upon it some burdens or
   labours by which it may be not overwhelmed but exercised, and allows it
   to vie with those of its own age; how much more does the heavenly
   Father of all know whom to carry in the bosom of His grace, whom to
   train to virtue in His sight by the exercise of free will, and yet He
   helps him in his efforts, hears him when he calls, leaves him not when
   he seeks Him, and sometimes snatches him from peril even without his
   knowing it.

  CHAPTER XV.

    Of the manifold grace of men's calls.

   AND by this it is clearly shown that God's "judgments are inscrutable
   and His ways past finding out," [762] by which He draws mankind to
   salvation. And this too we can prove by the instances of calls in the
   gospels. For He chose Andrew and Peter and the rest of the apostles by
   the free compassion of His grace when they were thinking nothing of
   their healing and salvation. Zacchæus, when in his faithfulness he was
   struggling to see the Lord, and making up for his littleness of stature
   by the height of the sycamore tree, He not only received, but actually
   honoured by the blessing of His dwelling with him. Paul even against
   his will and resisting He drew to Him. Another He charged to cleave to
   Him so closely that when he asked for the shortest possible delay in
   order to bury his father He did not grant it. To Cornelius when
   constantly attending to prayers and alms the way of salvation was shown
   by way of recompense, and by the visitation of an angel he was bidden
   to summon Peter, and learn from him the words of salvation, whereby he
   might be saved with all his. And so the manifold wisdom of God grants
   with manifold and inscrutable kindness salvation to men; and imparts to
   each one according to his capacity the grace of His bounty, so that He
   wills to grant His healing not according to the uniform power of His
   Majesty but according to the measure of the faith in which He finds
   each one, or as He Himself has imparted it to each one. For when one
   believed that for the cure of his leprosy the will of Christ alone was
   sufficient He healed him by the simple consent of His will, saying: "I
   will, be thou clean." [763] When another prayed that He would come and
   raise his dead daughter by laying His hands on her, He entered his
   house as he had hoped, and granted what was asked of Him. When another
   believed that what was essential for his salvation depended on His
   command, and answered: "Speak the word only, and my servant shall be
   healed," [764] He restored to their former strength the limbs that were
   relaxed, by the power of a word, saying: "Go thy way, and as thou hast
   believed so be it unto thee." [765] To others hoping for restoration
   from the touch of His hem, He granted rich gifts of healing. To some,
   when asked, He bestowed remedies for their diseases. To others He
   afforded the means of healing unasked: others He urged on to hope,
   saying: "Willest thou to be made whole?" [766] to others when they were
   without hope He brought help spontaneously. The desires of some He
   searched out before satisfying their wants, saying: "What will ye that
   I should do for you?" [767] To another who knew not the way to obtain
   what he desired, He showed it in His kindness, saying: "If thou
   believest thou shalt see the glory of God." [768] Among some so richly
   did He pour forth the mighty works of His cures that of them the
   Evangelist says: "And He healed all their sick." [769] But among others
   the unfathomable depth of Christ's beneficence was so stopped up, that
   it was said: "And Jesus could do there no mighty works because of their
   unbelief." [770] And so the bounty of God is actually shaped according
   to the capacity of man's faith, so that to one it is said: "According
   to thy faith be it unto thee:" [771] and to another: "Go thy way, and
   as thou hast believed so be it unto thee;" [772] to another "Be it unto
   thee according as thou wilt," [773] and again to another: "Thy faith
   hath made thee whole." [774]

  CHAPTER XVI.

    Of the grace of God; to the effect that it transcends the narrow limits of
    human faith.

   BUT let no one imagine that we have brought forward these instances to
   try to make out that the chief share in our salvation rests with our
   faith, according to the profane notion of some who attribute everything
   to free will and lay down that the grace of God is dispensed in
   accordance with the desert of each man: but we plainly assert our
   unconditional opinion that the grace of God is superabounding, and
   sometimes overflows the narrow limits of man's lack of faith. And this,
   as we remember, happened in the case of the ruler in the gospel, who,
   as he believed that it was an easier thing for his son to be cured when
   sick than to be raised when dead, implored the Lord to come at once,
   saying: "Lord, come down ere my child die;" and though Christ reproved
   his lack of faith with these words: "Except ye see signs and wonders ye
   will not believe," yet He did not manifest the grace of His Divinity in
   proportion to the weakness of his faith, nor did He expell the deadly
   disease of the fever by His bodily presence, as the man believed he
   would, but by the word of His power, saying: "Go thy way, thy son
   liveth." [775] And we read also that the Lord poured forth this
   superabundance of grace in the case of the cure of the paralytic, when,
   though he only asked for the healing of the weakness by which his body
   was enervated, He first brought health to the soul by saying: "Son, be
   of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee." After which, when the
   scribes did not believe that He could forgive men's sins, in order to
   confound their incredulity, He set free by the power of His word the
   man's limb, and put an end to his disease of paralysis, by saying: "Why
   think ye evil in your hearts? Whether is easier to say, thy sins be
   forgiven thee, or to say, arise and walk? But that ye may know that the
   Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, then saith He to the
   sick of the palsy: Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house."
   [776] And in the same way in the case of the man who had been lying for
   thirty-eight years near the edge of the pool, and hoping for a cure
   from the moving of the water, He showed the princely character of His
   bounty unasked. For when in His wish to arouse him for the saving
   remedy, He had said to him: "willest thou to be made whole," and when
   the man complained of his lack of human assistance and said: "I have no
   man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled," the Lord in
   His pity granted pardon to his unbelief and ignorance, and restored him
   to his former health, not in the way which he expected, but in the way
   which He Himself willed, saying: "Arise, take up thy bed and go unto
   thine house." [777] And what wonder if these acts are told of the
   Lord's power, when Divine grace has actually wrought similar works by
   means of His servants! For when Peter and John were entering the
   temple, when the man who was lame from his mother's womb and had no
   idea how to walk, asked an alms, they gave him not the miserable
   coppers which the sick man asked for, but the power to walk, and when
   he was only expecting the smallest of gifts to console him, enriched
   him with the prize of unlooked for health, as Peter said: "Silver and
   gold have I none: but such as I have, give I unto thee. In the name of
   Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." [778]

  CHAPTER XVII.

    Of the inscrutable providence of God.

   BY those instances then which we have brought forward from the gospel
   records we can very clearly perceive that God brings salvation to
   mankind in diverse and innumerable methods and inscrutable ways, and
   that He stirs up the course of some, who are already wanting it, and
   thirsting for it, to greater zeal, while He forces some even against
   their will, and resisting. And that at one time He gives his assistance
   for the fulfilment of those things which he sees that we desire for our
   good, while at another time He puts into us the very beginnings of holy
   desire, and grants both the commencement of a good work and
   perseverance in it. Hence it comes that in our prayers we proclaim God
   as not only our Protector and Saviour, but actually as our Helper and
   Sponsor. For whereas He first calls us to Him, and while we are still
   ignorant and unwilling, draws us towards salvation, He is our Protector
   and Saviour, but whereas when we are already striving, He is wont to
   bring us help, and to receive and defend those who fly to Him for
   refuge, He is termed our Sponsor and Refuge. Finally the blessed
   Apostle when revolving in his mind this manifold bounty of God's
   providence, as he sees that he has fallen into some vast and boundless
   ocean of God's goodness, exclaims: "O the depth of the riches of the
   wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are the judgments of God
   and His ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the
   Lord?" [779] Whoever then imagines that he can by human reason fathom
   the depths of that inconceivable abyss, will be trying to explain away
   the astonishment at that knowledge, at which that great and mighty
   teacher of the gentiles was awed. For if a man thinks that he can
   either conceive in his mind or discuss exhaustively the dispensation of
   God whereby He works salvation in men, he certainly impugns the truth
   of the Apostle's words and asserts with profane audacity that His
   judgments can be scrutinized, and His ways searched out. This
   providence and love of God therefore, which the Lord in His unwearied
   goodness vouchsafes to show us, He compares to the tenderest heart of a
   kind mother, as He wishes to express it by a figure of human affection,
   and finds in His creatures no such feeling of love, to which he could
   better compare it. And He uses this example, because nothing dearer can
   be found in human nature, saying: "Can a mother forget her child, that
   she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?" But not content
   with this comparison He at once goes beyond it, and subjoins these
   words: "And though she may forget, yet will not I forget thee." [780]

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    The decision of the fathers that free will is not equal to save a man.

   AND from this it is clearly gathered by those who, led not by
   chattering words but by experience, measure the magnitude of grace, and
   the paltry limits of man's will, that "the race is not to the swift nor
   the battle to the strong, nor food to the wise, nor riches to the
   prudent, nor grace to the learned," but that "all these worketh that
   one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He
   will." [781] And therefore it is proved by no doubtful faith but by
   experience which can (so to speak) be laid hold of, that God the Father
   of all things worketh indifferently all things in all, as the Apostle
   says, like some most kind father and most benign physician; and that
   now He puts into us the very beginnings of salvation, and gives to each
   the zeal of his free will; and now grants the carrying out of the work,
   and the perfecting of goodness; and now saves men, even against their
   will and without their knowledge, from ruin that is close at hand, and
   a headlong fall; and now affords them occasions and opportunities of
   salvation, and wards off headlong and violent attacks from purposes
   that would bring death; and assists some who are already willing and
   running, while He draws others who are unwilling and resisting, and
   forces them to a good will. But that, when we do not always resist or
   remain persistently unwilling, everything is granted to us by God, and
   that the main share in our salvation is to be ascribed not to the merit
   of our own works but to heavenly grace, we are thus taught by the words
   of the Lord Himself: "And you shall remember your ways and all your
   wicked doings with which you have been defiled; and you shall be
   displeased with yourselves in your own sight for all your wicked deeds
   which you have committed. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I
   shall have done well by you for My own name's sake, not according to
   your evil ways, nor according to your wicked deeds, O house of Israel."
   [782] And therefore it is laid down by all the Catholic fathers who
   have taught perfection of heart not by empty disputes of words, but in
   deed and act, that the first stage in the Divine gift is for each man
   to be inflamed with the desire of everything that is good, but in such
   a way that the choice of free will is open to either side: and that the
   second stage in Divine grace is for the aforesaid practices of virtue
   to be able to be performed, but in such a way that the possibilities of
   the will are not destroyed: the third stage also belongs to the gifts
   of God, so that it may be held by the persistence of the goodness
   already acquired, and in such a way that the liberty may not be
   surrendered and experience bondage. For the God of all must be held to
   work in all, so as to incite, protect, and strengthen, but not to take
   away the freedom of the will which He Himself has once given. If
   however any more subtle inference of man's argumentation and reasoning
   seems opposed to this interpretation, it should be avoided rather than
   brought forward to the destruction of the faith (for we gain not faith
   from understanding, but understanding from faith, as it is written:
   "Except ye believe, ye will not understand" [783] ) for how God works
   all things in us and yet everything can be ascribed to free will,
   cannot be fully grasped by the mind and reason of man.

   Strengthened by this food the blessed Chæremon prevented us from
   feeling the toil of so difficult a journey.

THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT NESTEROS.

ON SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    The words of Abbot Nesteros on the knowledge of the religious.

   THE order of our promise and course demands that there should follow
   the instruction of Abbot Nesteros, [784] a man of excellence in all
   points and of the greatest knowledge: who when he had seen that we had
   committed some parts of Holy Scripture to memory and desired to
   understand them, addressed us in these words. There are indeed many
   different kinds of knowledge in this world, since there is as great a
   variety of them as there is of the arts and sciences. But, while all
   are either utterly useless or only useful for the good of this present
   life, there is yet none which has not its own system and method for
   learning it, by which it can be grasped by those who seek it. If then
   those arts are guided by certain special rules for their publication,
   how much more does the system and expression of our religion, which
   tends to the contemplation of the secrets of invisible mysteries, and
   seeks no present gain but the reward of an eternal recompense, depend
   on a fixed order and scheme. And the knowledge of this is twofold:
   first, praktikh, i.e., practical, which is brought about by an
   improvement of morals and purification from faults: secondly,
   qewretikh, which consists in the contemplation of things Divine and the
   knowledge of most sacred thoughts.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [784] Nesteros. In the Vitae Patrum there are some stories of one or
   two of this name (for it is not quite clear whether they are distinct
   persons or one and the same to whom the stories refer). One was known
   as `o megas, and was a friend of St. Antony, and is supposed by some to
   be the same whose Conferences Cassian here relates, but nothing certain
   is known of him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    On grasping the knowledge of spiritual things.

   WHOEVER then would arrive at this theoretical knowledge must first
   pursue practical knowledge with all his might and main. For this
   practical knowledge can be acquired without theoretical, but
   theoretical cannot possibly be gained without practical. For there are
   certain stages, so distinct, and arranged in such a way that man's
   humility may be able to mount on high; and if these follow each other
   in turn in the order of which we have spoken, man can attain to a
   height to which he could not fly, if the first step were wanting. In
   vain then does one strive for the vision of God, who does not shun the
   stains of sins: "For the spirit of God hates deception, and dwells not
   in a body subject to sins." [785]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [785] Wisdom 1:4, 5.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    How practical perfection depends on a double system.

   BUT this practical perfection depends on a double system; for its first
   method is to know the nature of all faults and the manner of their
   cure. Its second, to discover the order of the virtues, and form our
   mind by their perfection so that it may be obedient to them, not as if
   it were forced and subject to some fierce sway, but as if it delighted
   in its natural good, and throve upon it, and mounted by that steep and
   narrow way with real pleasure. For in what way will one, who has
   neither succeeded in understanding the nature of his own faults, nor
   tried to eradicate them, be able to gain an understanding of virtues,
   which is the second stage of practical training, or the mysteries of
   spiritual and heavenly things, which exist in the higher stage of
   theoretical knowledge? For it will necessarily be maintained that he
   cannot advance to more lofty heights who has not surmounted the lower
   ones, and much less will he be able to grasp those things that are
   without, who has not succeeded in understanding what is within his
   comprehension. But you should know that we must make an effort with a
   twofold purpose in our exertion; both for the expulsion of vice, and
   for the attainment of virtue. And this we do not gather from our own
   conjecture, but are taught by the words of Him who alone knows the
   strength and method of His work: "Behold," He says: "I have set thee
   this day over the nations and over kingdoms, to root up, and to pull
   down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build and to plant." [786]
   He points out that for getting rid of noxious things four things are
   requisite; viz., to root up, to pull down, to waste, and to destroy:
   but for the performance of what is good, and the acquisition of what
   pertains to righteousness only to build and to plant. Whence it is
   perfectly evident that it is a harder thing to tear up and eradicate
   the inveterate passions of body and soul than to introduce and plant
   spiritual virtues.

  CHAPTER IV.

    How practical life is distributed among many different professions and
    interests.

   THIS practical life then, which as has been said rests on a double
   system, is distributed among many different professions and interests.
   For some make it their whole purpose to aim at the secrecy of an
   anchorite and purity of heart, as we know that in the past Elijah and
   Elisha, and in our own day the blessed Antony and others who followed
   with the same object, were joined most closely to God by the silence of
   solitude. Some have given all their efforts and interests towards the
   system of the brethren and the watchful care of the coenobium; as we
   remember that recently Abbot John, who presided over a big monastery in
   the neighbourhood of the city Thmuis, [787] and some other men of like
   merits were eminent with the signs of Apostles. Some are pleased with
   the kindly service of the guest house and reception, by which in the
   past the patriarch Abraham and Lot pleased the Lord, and recently the
   blessed Macarius, [788] a man of singular courtesy and patience who
   presided over the guest house at Alexandria in such a way as to be
   considered inferior to none of those who aimed at the retirement of the
   desert. Some choose the care of the sick, others devote themselves to
   intercession, which is offered up for the oppressed and afflicted, or
   give themselves up to teaching, or give alms to the poor, and flourish
   among men of excellence and renown, by reason of their love and
   goodness.

  CHAPTER V.

    On perseverance in the line that has been chosen.

   WHEREFORE it is good and profitable for each one to endeavour with all
   his might and main to attain perfection in the work that has been
   begun, according to the line which he has chosen as the grace which he
   has received; and while he praises and admires the virtues of others,
   not to swerve from his own line which he has once for all chosen, as he
   knows that, as the Apostle says, the body of the Church indeed is one,
   but the members many, and that it has "gifts differing according to the
   grace which is given us, whether prophecy, according to the proportion
   of the faith, whether ministry, in ministering, or he that teacheth, in
   doctrine, or he that exhorteth in exhortation, he that giveth, in
   simplicity, he that ruleth, with carefulness, he that showeth mercy,
   with cheerfulness." [789] For no members can claim the offices of other
   members, because the eyes cannot perform the duties of the hands, nor
   the nostrils of the ears. And so not all are Apostles, not all
   prophets, not all doctors, not all have the gifts of healing, not all
   speak with tongues, not all interpret. [790]

  CHAPTER VI.

    How the weak are easily moved.

   FOR those who are not yet settled in the line which they have taken up
   are often, when they hear some praised for different interests and
   virtues, so excited by the praise of them that they try forthwith to
   imitate their method: and in this human weakness is sure to expend its
   efforts to no purpose. For it is an impossibility for one and the same
   man to excel at once in all those good deeds which I enumerated above.
   And if anyone is anxious equally to affect them all, he is quite sure
   to come to this; viz., that while he pursues them all, he will not
   thoroughly succeed in any one, and will lose more than he will gain
   from this changing and shifting about. For in many ways men advance
   towards God, and so each man should complete that one which he has once
   fixed upon, never changing the course of his purpose, so that he may be
   perfect in whatever line of life his may be.

  CHAPTER VII.

    An instance of chastity which teaches us that all men should not be emulous
    of all things.

   FOR apart from that loss, which we have said that a monk incurs who
   wants in light-mindedness to pass from one pursuit to another, there is
   a risk of death that is hence incurred, because at times things which
   are rightly done by some are wrongly taken by others as an example, and
   things which turned out well for some, are found to be injurious to
   others. For, to give an instance, it is as if one wished to imitate the
   good deed of that man, which Abbot John is wont to bring forward, not
   for the sake of imitating him but simply out of admiration for him; for
   one came to the aforesaid old man in a secular dress and when he had
   brought him some of the first fruits of his crops, he found some one
   there possessed by a most fierce devil. And this one though he scorned
   the adjurations and commands of Abbot John, and vowed that he would
   never at his bidding leave the body which he had occupied, yet was
   terrified at the coming of this other, and departed with a most humble
   utterance of his name. And the old man marvelled not a little at his so
   evident grace and was the more astonished at him because he saw that he
   had on a secular dress; and so began carefully to ask of him the manner
   of his life and pursuit. And when he said that he was living in the
   world and bound by the ties of marriage, the blessed John, considering
   in his mind the greatness of his virtue and grace, searched out still
   more carefully what his manner of life might be. He declared that he
   was a countryman, and that he sought his food by the daily toil of his
   hands, and was not conscious of anything good about him except that he
   never went forth to his work in the fields in the morning nor came home
   in the evening without having returned thanks in Church for the food of
   his daily life, to God Who gave it; and that he had never used any of
   his crops without having first offered to God their first fruits and
   tithes; and that he had never driven his oxen over the bounds of
   another's harvest without having first muzzled them that his neighbour
   might not sustain the slightest loss through his carelessness. And when
   these things did not seem to Abbot John sufficient to procure such
   grace as that with which he saw that he was endowed, and he inquired of
   him and investigated what it was which could be connected with the
   merits of such grace, he was induced by respect for such anxious
   inquiries to confess that, when he wanted to be professed as a monk, he
   had been compelled by force and his parents' command, twelve years
   before to take a wife, who, without any body to that day being aware of
   it, was kept by him as a virgin in the place of a sister. And when the
   old man heard this, he was so overcome with admiration that he
   announced publicly in his presence that it was not without good reason
   that the devil who had scorned him himself, could not endure the
   presence of this man, whose virtue he himself, not only in the ardour
   of youth, but even now, would not dare to aim at without risk of his
   chastity. And though Abbot John would tell this story with the utmost
   admiration, yet he never advised any monk to try this plan as he knew
   that many things which are rightly done by some involved others who
   imitate them in great danger, and that that cannot be tried by all,
   which the Lord bestowed upon a few by a special gift.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of spiritual knowledge.

   BUT to return to the explanation of the knowledge from which our
   discourse took its rise. Thus, as we said above, practical knowledge is
   distributed among many subjects and interests, but theoretical is
   divided into two parts, i.e., the historical interpretation and the
   spiritual sense. Whence also Solomon when he had summed up the manifold
   grace of the Church, added: "for all who are with her are clothed with
   double garments." [791] But of spiritual knowledge there are three
   kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical, [792] of which we read as
   follows in Proverbs: "But do you describe these things to yourself in
   three ways according to the largeness of your heart." [793] And so the
   history embraces the knowledge of things past and visible, as it is
   repeated in this way by the Apostle: "For it is written that Abraham
   had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, the other by a free: but he who
   was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but he who was of the
   free was by promise." But to the allegory belongs what follows, for
   what actually happened is said to have prefigured the form of some
   mystery "For these," says he, "are the two covenants the one from Mount
   Sinai, which gendereth into bondage, which is Agar. For Sinai is a
   mountain in Arabia, which is compared to Jerusalem which now is, and is
   in bondage with her children." But the anagogical sense rises from
   spiritual mysteries even to still more sublime and sacred secrets of
   heaven, and is subjoined by the Apostle in these words: "But Jerusalem
   which is above is free, which is the mother of us. For it is written,
   Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not, break forth and cry, thou that
   travailest not, for many are the children of the desolate more than of
   her that hath an husband." [794] The tropological sense is the moral
   explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical
   teaching, as if we were to understand by these two covenants practical
   and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to want to
   take Jerusalem or Sion as the soul of man, according to this: "Praise
   the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion." [795] And so these four
   previously mentioned figures coalesce, if we desire, in one subject, so
   that one and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four senses:
   historically as the city of the Jews; allegorically as Church of
   Christ, anagogically as the heavenly city of God "which is the mother
   of us all," tropologically, as the soul of man, which is frequently
   subject to praise or blame from the Lord under this title. Of these
   four kinds of interpretation the blessed Apostle speaks as follows:
   "But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I
   profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge
   or by prophecy or by doctrine?" [796] For "revelation" belongs to
   allegory whereby what is concealed under the historical narrative is
   revealed in its spiritual sense and interpretation, as for instance if
   we tried to expound how "all our fathers were under the cloud and were
   all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea," and how they "all
   ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink from the
   rock that followed them. But the rock was Christ." [797] And this
   explanation where there is a comparison of the figure of the body and
   blood of Christ which we receive daily, contains the allegorical sense.
   But the knowledge, which is in the same way mentioned by the Apostle,
   is tropological, as by it we can by a careful study see of all things
   that have to do with practical discernment whether they are useful and
   good, as in this case, when we are told to judge of our own selves
   "whether it is fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head
   uncovered." [798] And this system, as has been said, contains the moral
   meaning. So "prophecy" which the Apostle puts in the third place,
   alludes to the anagogical sense by which the words are applied to
   things future and invisible, as here: "But we would not have you
   ignorant, brethren, concerning those that sleep: that ye be not sorry
   as others also who have no hope. For if we believe that Christ died and
   rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
   Him. For this we say to you by the word of God, that we which are alive
   at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent those that sleep in Christ,
   for the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
   voice of the archangel and with the trump of God; and the dead in
   Christ shall rise first." [799] In which kind of exhortation the figure
   of anagoge is brought forward. But "doctrine" unfolds the simple course
   of historical exposition, under which is contained no more secret
   sense, but what is declared by the very words: as in his passage: "For
   I delivered unto you first of all what I also received, how that Christ
   died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried,
   and that He rose again on the third day, and that he was seen of
   Cephas;" [800] and: "God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the
   law, to redeem them that were under the law;" [801] or this: "Hear, O
   Israel, the Lord the God is one Lord." [802]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [791] Prov. 31:21 (LXX).

   [792] The meaning of the four senses of Scripture here spoken of; viz.,
   the historical, tropological, allegorical, ana anagogical, is well
   summed up in these lines:         Litera, gesta docet; quid credas,
   allegoria;
           Moralis, quid agas; quo tendas anagogia. Or, as the lines are
   sometimes given:         Litera scripta docet; quod credas, allegoria;
           Quod speres, anagoge; quid agas, tropologia. Both Origen and
   Jerome had spoken of the threefold sense of Scripture, referring to the
   LXX. rendering of Prov. 22:20 (which Cassian quotes below): but in
   general the Latin Fathers, and the Schoolmen after them, separated the
   third of Origen's senses; viz., the spiritual, into two, the
   allegorical and the anagogical: and so the "fourfold" sense became the
   established method of interpretation in the West.

  CHAPTER IX.

    How from practical knowledge we must proceed to spiritual.

   WHEREFORE if you are anxious to attain to the light of spiritual
   knowledge, not wrongly for an idle boast but for the sake of being made
   better men, you are first inflamed with the longing for that
   blessedness, of which we read: "blessed are the pure in heart for they
   shall see God," [803] that you may also attain to that of which the
   angel said to Daniel: "But they that are learned shall shine as the
   splendor of the firmament: and they that turn many to righteousness as
   the stars for ever and ever;" and in another prophet: "Enlighten
   yourselves with the light of knowledge while there is time." [804] And
   so keeping up that diligence in reading, which I see that you have,
   endeavour with all eagerness to gain in the first place a thorough
   grasp of practical, i.e., ethical knowledge. For without this that
   theoretical purity of which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which
   those only, who are perfected not by the words of others who teach
   them, but by the excellence of their own actions, can after much
   expenditure of effort and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they
   gain their knowledge not from meditation on the law but from the fruit
   of their labour, they sing with the Psalmist: "From Thy commandments I
   have understanding;" and having overcome all their passions, they say
   with confidence: "I will sing, and I will understand in the undefiled
   way." [805] For he who is striving in an undefiled way in the course of
   a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm, understands the words which are
   chanted. And therefore if you would prepare in your heart a holy
   tabernacle of spiritual knowledge, purge yourselves from the stain of
   all sins, and rid yourselves of the cares of this world. For it is an
   impossibility for the soul which is taken up even to a small extent
   with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of knowledge or to become an
   author of spiritual interpretation, and diligent in reading holy
   things. Be careful therefore in the first place, and especially you,
   John, as your more youthful age requires you the rather to be careful
   about what I am going to say--that you may enjoin absolute silence on
   your lips, in order that your zeal for reading and the efforts of your
   purpose may not be destroyed by vain pride. For this is the first
   practical step towards learning, to receive the regulations and
   opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart, and with lips that
   are dumb; and diligently to lay them up in your heart, and endeavour
   rather to perform than to teach them. For from teaching, the dangerous
   arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the fruit of spiritual
   knowledge will flourish. And so you should never venture to say
   anything in the conference of the Elders unless some ignorance that
   might be injurious, or a matter which it is important to know leads you
   to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with vainglory, pretend
   that they ask, in order really to show off the knowledge which they
   perfectly possess. For it is an impossibility for one, who takes to the
   pursuit of reading with the purpose of gaining the praise of men, to be
   rewarded with the gift of true knowledge. For one who is bound by the
   chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage to other faults,
   and especially to that of pride: and so if he is baffled by his
   encounter with practical and ethical knowledge, he will certainly not
   attain that spiritual knowledge which springs from it. Be then in all
   things "swift to hear, but slow to speak," [806] lest there come upon
   you that which is noted by Solomon: "If thou seest a man who is quick
   to speak, know that there is more hope of a fool than of him; [807] and
   do not presume to teach any one in words what you have not already
   performed in deed. For our Lord taught us by His own example that we
   ought to keep to this order, as of Him it is said: "what Jesus began to
   do and to teach." [808] Take care then that you do not rush into
   teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number of those of
   whom the Lord speaks in the gospel to the disciples: "What they say
   unto you, that observe and do, but not after their words: for they say
   and do not. But they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and
   lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them
   with one of their fingers." [809] For if he who shall "break one of
   these commands, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the
   kingdom of heaven," [810] it follows that one who has dared to despise
   many and greater commands and to teach men so, shall certainly be
   considered not least in the kingdom of heaven, but greatest in the
   punishment of hell. And therefore you must be careful not to be led on
   to teach by the example of those who have attained some skill in
   discussion and readiness in speech and because they can discourse on
   what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess spiritual
   knowledge, by those who do not know how to distinguish its real force
   and character. For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant
   language, and quite another to penetrate into the very heart and marrow
   of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the soul on
   profound and hidden mysteries; for this can be gained by no learning of
   man's, nor condition of this world, only by purity of soul, by means of
   the illumination of the Holy Ghost.

  CHAPTER X.

    How to embrace the system of true knowledge.

   YOU must then, if you want to get at the true knowledge of the
   Scriptures, endeavour first to secure steadfast humility of heart, to
   carry you on by the perfection of love not to the knowledge which
   puffeth up, but to that which enlightens. For it is an impossibility
   for an impure mind to gain the gift of spiritual knowledge. And
   therefore with every possible care avoid this, lest through your zeal
   for reading there arise in you not the light of knowledge nor the
   lasting glory which is promised through the light that comes from
   learning but only the instruments of your destruction from vain
   arrogance. Next you must by all means strive to get rid of all anxiety
   and worldly thoughts, and give yourself over assiduously or rather
   continuously, to sacred reading, until continual meditation fills your
   heart, and fashions you so to speak after its own likeness, making of
   it, in a way, an ark of the testimony, [811] which has within it two
   tables of stone, i.e., the constant assurance of the two testaments;
   [812] and a golden pot, i.e., a pure and undefiled memory which
   preserves by a constant tenacity the manna stored up in it, i.e., the
   enduring and heavenly sweetness of the spiritual sense and the bread of
   angels; moreover also the rod of Aaron, i.e., the saving standard of
   Jesus Christ our true High Priest, that ever buds with the freshness of
   immortal memory. For this is the rod which after it had been cut from
   the root of Jesse, died and flourished again with a more vigorous life.
   But all these are guarded by two Cherubim, i.e., the fulness of
   historical and spiritual knowledge. For the Cherubim mean a multitude
   of knowledge: and these continually protect the mercy seat of God,
   i.e., the peace of your heart, and overshadow it from all the assaults
   of spiritual wickedness. And so your soul will be carried forward not
   only to the ark of the Divine Covenant, but also to the priestly
   kingdom, and owing to its unbroken love of purity being as it were
   engrossed in spiritual studies, will fulfil the command given to the
   priests, enjoined as follows by the giver of the Law: "And he shall not
   go forth from the sanctuary, lest he pollute the Sanctuary of God,"
   [813] i.e., his heart, in which the Lord promised that he would ever
   dwell, saying: "I will dwell in them and will walk among them." [814]
   Wherefore the whole series of the Holy Scriptures should be diligently
   committed to memory and ceaselessly repeated. For this continual
   meditation will bring us a twofold fruit: first, that while the
   attention of the mind is taken up in reading and preparing the lessons
   it cannot possibly be taken captive in any snares of bad thoughts: next
   that those things which were conned over and frequently repeated and
   which while we were trying to commit them to memory we could not
   understand as the mind was at that time taken up, we can afterward see
   more clearly, when we are free from the distraction of all acts and
   visions, and especially when we reflect on them in silence in our
   meditation by night. So that when we are at rest, and as it were
   plunged in the stupor of sleep, there is revealed to us the
   understanding of the most secret meanings, of which in our waking hours
   we had not the remotest conception.

  CHAPTER XI.

    Of the manifold meaning of the Holy Scriptures.

   BUT as the renewal of our soul grows by means of this study, Scripture
   also will begin to put on a new face, and the beauty of the holier
   meanings will somehow grow with our growth. For their form is adapted
   to the capacity of man's understanding, and will appear earthly to
   carnal people, and divine to spiritual ones, so that those to whom it
   formerly appeared to be involved in thick clouds, cannot apprehend its
   subtleties nor endure its light. But to make this which we are aiming
   at somewhat clearer by an instance, it will be enough to produce a
   single passage of the law, by which we can prove that all the heavenly
   commands as well are applied to men in accordance with the measure of
   our state. For it is written in the law: "Thou shalt not commit
   adultery." [815] This is rightly observed according to the simple
   meaning of the letter, by a man who is still in bondage to foul
   passions. But by one who has already forsaken these dirty acts and
   impure affections, it must be observed in the spirit, so that he may
   forsake not only the worship of idols but also all heathen
   superstitions and the observance of auguries and omens and all signs
   and days and times, or at any rate that he be not entangled in the
   conjectures of words and names which destroy the simplicity of our
   faith. For by fornication of this kind we read that Jerusalem was
   defiled, as she committed adultery "on every high hill and under every
   green tree," [816] whom also the Lord rebuked by the prophet, saying:
   "Let now the astrologers stand and save thee, they that gazed at the
   stars and counted the months, that from them they might tell the things
   that shall come to thee," [817] of which fornication elsewhere also the
   Lord says in rebuking them: "The spirit of fornication deceived them,
   and they went a whoring from their God." [818] But one who has forsaken
   both these kinds of fornication, will have a third kind to avoid, which
   is contained in the superstitions of the law and of Judaism; of which
   the Apostle says: "Ye observe days and months and times and years;" and
   again: "Touch not, taste not, handle not." [819] And there is no doubt
   that this is said of the superstitions of the law, into which one who
   has fallen has certainly gone a whoring from Christ, and is not worthy
   to hear this from the Apostle: "For I have espoused you to one husband,
   to exhibit you as a chaste virgin to Christ." [820] But this that
   follows will be directed to him by the words of the same Apostle: "But
   I am afraid lest as the serpent by his cunning deceived Eve, so your
   minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity which is in
   Christ Jesus." [821] But if one has escaped the uncleanness even of
   this fornication there will still be a fourth, which is committed by
   adulterous intercourse with heretical teaching. Of which too the
   blessed Apostle speaks: "I know that after my departure grievous wolves
   shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock, and of yourselves also
   shall arise men speaking perverse things so as to lead astray the
   disciples after them." [822] But if a man has succeeded in avoiding
   even this, let him beware lest he fall by a more subtle sin into the
   guilt of fornication. I mean that which consists in wandering thoughts,
   because every thought which is not only shameful but even idle, and
   departing in however small a degree from God is regarded by the perfect
   man as the foulest fornication.

  CHAPTER XII.

    A question how we can attain to forgetfulness of the cares of this world.

   UPON this I was at first moved by a secret emotion, and then groaned
   deeply and said, All these things which you have set forth so fully
   have affected me with still greater despair than that which I had
   previously endured: as besides those general captivities of the soul
   whereby I doubt not that weak people are smitten from without, a
   special hindrance to salvation is added by that knowledge of literature
   which I seem already to have in some slight measure attained, in which
   the efforts of my tutor, or my attention to continual reading have so
   weakened me that now my mind is filled with those songs of the poets so
   that even at the hour of prayer it is thinking about those trifling
   fables, and the stories of battles with which from its earliest infancy
   it was stored by its childish lessons: and when singing Psalms or
   asking forgiveness of sins either some wanton recollection of the poems
   intrudes itself or the images of heroes fighting presents itself before
   the eyes, and an imagination of such phantoms is always tricking me and
   does not suffer my soul to aspire to an insight into things above, so
   that this cannot be got rid of by my daily lamentations.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    Of the method by which we can remove the dross from our memory.

   NESTEROS: From this very fact, from which there springs up for you the
   utmost despair of your purification, a speedy and effectual remedy may
   arise if only you will transfer to the reading of and meditation upon
   the writings of the Spirit, the same diligence and earnestness which
   you say that you showed in those secular studies of yours. For your
   mind is sure to be taken up with those poems until it is gaining with
   the same zeal and assiduity other matters for it to reflect upon, and
   is in labour with spiritual and divine things instead of unprofitable
   earthly ones. But when these are thoroughly and entirely conceived and
   it has been nourished upon them, then by degrees the former thoughts
   can be expelled and utterly got rid of. For the mind of man cannot be
   emptied of all thoughts, and so as long as it is not taken up with
   spiritual interests, is sure to be occupied with what it learnt long
   since. For as long as it has nothing to recur to and exercise itself
   upon unweariedly, it is sure to fall back upon what it learnt in
   childhood, and ever to think about what it took in by long use and
   meditation. In order then that this spiritual knowledge may be
   strengthened in you with a lasting steadfastness, and that you may not
   enjoy it only for a time like those who just touch it not by their own
   exertions but at the recital of another, and if I may use the
   expression, perceive its scent in the air; but that it may be laid up
   in your heart, and deeply noted in it, and thoroughly seen and handled,
   it is well for you to use the utmost care in securing that, even if
   perhaps you hear things that you know very well produced in the
   Conference, you do not regard them in a scornful and disdainful way
   because you already know them, but that you lay them to your heart with
   the same eagerness, with which the words of salvation which we are
   longing for ought to be constantly poured into our ears or should ever
   proceed from our lips. For although the narration of holy things be
   often repeated, yet in a mind that feels a thirst for true knowledge
   the satiety will never create disgust, but as it receives it every day
   as if it were something new and what it wanted however often it may
   have taken it in, it will so much the more eagerly either hear or
   speak, and from the repetition of these things will gain confirmation
   of the knowledge it already possesses, rather than weariness of any
   sort from the frequent Conference. For it is a sure sign of a mind that
   is cold and proud, if it receives with disdain and carelessness the
   medicine of the words of salvation, although it be offered with the
   zeal of excessive persistence. For "a soul that is full jeers at
   honeycomb: but to a soul that is in want even little things appear
   sweet." [823] And so if these things have been carefully taken in and
   stored up in the recesses of the soul and stamped with the seal of
   silence, afterwards like some sweet scented wine that maketh glad the
   heart of man, they will, when mellowed by the antiquity of the thoughts
   and by long-standing patience, be brought forth from the jar of your
   heart with great fragrance, and like some perennial fountain will flow
   abundantly from the veins of experience and irrigating channels of
   virtue and will pour forth copious streams as if from some deep well in
   your heart. For that will happen in your case, which is spoken in
   Proverbs to one who has achieved this in his work: "Drink waters from
   your own cisterns and from the fount of your own wells. Let waters from
   your own fountain flow in abundance for you, but let your waters pass
   through into your streets." [824] And according to the prophet Isaiah:
   "Thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a fountain of water
   whose waters shall not fail. And the places that have been desolate for
   ages shall be built in thee; thou shalt raise up the foundations of
   generation and generation; and thou shalt be called the repairer of the
   fences, turning the paths into rest." [825] And that blessedness shall
   come upon thee which the same prophet promises: "And the Lord will not
   cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and thine eyes shall
   see thy teacher. And thine ears shall hear the word of one admonishing
   thee behind thy back: This is the way, walk ye in it, and go not aside
   either to the right hand or to the left." [826] And so it will come to
   pass that not only every purpose and thought of your heart, but also
   all the wanderings and rovings of your imagination will become to you a
   holy and unceasing pondering of the Divine law.

  CHAPTER XIV.

    How an unclean soul can neither give nor receive spiritual knowledge.

   BUT it is, as we have already said, impossible for a novice either to
   understand or to teach this. For if one is incapable of receiving it
   how can he be fit to pass it on to another? But if he has had the
   audacity to teach anything on these matters, most certainly his words
   will be idle and useless and only reach the ears of his hearers,
   without being able to touch their hearts, uttered as they were in sheer
   idleness and unfruitful vanity, for they do not proceed from the
   treasure of a good conscience, but from the empty impertinence of
   boastfulness. For it is impossible for an impure soul (however
   earnestly it may devote itself to reading) to obtain spiritual
   knowledge. For no one pours any rich ointment or fine honey or any
   precious liquid into a dirty and stinking vessel. For a jar that has
   once been filled with foul odours spoils the sweetest myrrh more
   readily than it receives any sweetness or grace from it, for what is
   pure is corrupted much more quickly than what is corrupt is purified.
   And so the vessel of our bosom unless it has first been purified from
   all the foul stains of sin will not be worthy to receive that blessed
   ointment of which it is said by the prophet: "Like the ointment upon
   the head, which ran down upon the beard of Aaron, which ran down upon
   the edge of his garment," [827] nor will it keep undefiled that
   spiritual knowledge and the words of Scripture which are "sweeter than
   honey and the honeycomb." [828] "For what share hath righteousness with
   iniquity? or what agreement hath light with darkness? or what concord
   has Christ with Belial?" [829]

  CHAPTER XV.

    An objection owing to the fact that many impure persons have knowledge while
    saints have not.

   GERMANUS: This assertion does not seem to us founded on truth, or based
   on solid reasoning. For if it is clear that all who either never
   receive the faith of Christ at all or who corrupt it by the wicked sin
   of heresy, are of unclean hearts, how is it that many Jews and
   heretics, and Catholics also who are entangled in various sins, have
   acquired perfect knowledge of the Scriptures and boast of the greatness
   of their spiritual learning, and on the other hand countless swarms of
   saintly men, whose heart has been purified from all stain of sin, are
   content with the piety of simple faith and know nothing of the
   mysteries of a deeper knowledge? How then will that opinion stand,
   which attributes spiritual knowledge solely to purity of heart?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    The answer to the effect that bad men cannot possess true knowledge.

   NESTEROS: One who does not carefully weigh every word of the opinions
   uttered cannot rightly discover the value of the assertion. For we said
   to begin with that men of this sort only possess skill in disputation
   and ornaments of speech; but cannot penetrate to the very heart of
   Scripture and the mysteries of its spiritual meanings. For true
   knowledge is only acquired by true worshippers of God; and certainly
   this people does not possess it to whom it is said: "Hear, O, foolish
   people, thou who hast no heart: ye who having eyes see not, and having
   ears, hear not." And again: "Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I
   also will reject thee from acting as My priest." [830] For as it is
   said that in Christ "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are
   hid," [831] how can we hold that he who has scorned to find Christ, or,
   when He is found blasphemes Him with impious lips, or at least defiles
   the Catholic faith by his impure deeds, has acquired spiritual
   knowledge? "For the Spirit of God will avoid deception, and dwelleth
   not in a body that is subject to sin." [832] There is then no way of
   arriving at spiritual knowledge but this which one of the prophets has
   finely described: "Sow to yourselves for righteousness: reap the hope
   of life. Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge." [833] First
   then we must sow for righteousness, i.e., by works of righteousness we
   must extend practical perfection; next we must reap the hope of life,
   i.e., by the expulsion of carnal sins must gather the fruits of
   spiritual virtues: and so we shall succeed in enlightening ourselves
   with the light of knowledge. And the Psalmist also sees that this
   system ought to be followed, when he says: "Blessed are they that are
   undefiled in the way: who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they
   that seek His testimonies." [834] For he does not say in the first
   place: "Blessed are they that seek His testimonies," and afterwards
   add: "Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way;" but he begins by
   saying: "Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way;" and by this
   clearly shows that no one can properly come to seek God's testimonies
   unless he first walks undefiled in the way of Christ by his practical
   life. Those therefore whom you mentioned do not possess that knowledge
   which the impure cannot attain, but yeudwnumon, i.e., what is falsely
   so called, of which the blessed Apostle speaks: "O Timothy, keep that
   which is committed to thee, avoiding profane novelties of words, and
   oppositions of the knowledge that is falsely so called;" [835] which is
   in the Greek tas antiqeseis ths yeudwnumou gnwsews. Of those then who
   seem to acquire some show of knowledge or of those who while they
   devote themselves diligently to reading the sacred volume and to
   committing the Scriptures to memory, yet forsake not carnal sins, it is
   well said in Proverbs: "Like as a golden ring in a swine's snout so is
   the beauty of an evil-disposed woman." [836] For what does it profit a
   man to gain the ornaments of heavenly eloquence and the most precious
   beauty of the Scriptures if by clinging to filthy deeds and thoughts he
   destroys it by burying it in the foulest ground, or defiles it by the
   dirty wallowing of his own lusts? For the result will be that which is
   an ornament to those who rightly use it, is not only unable to adorn
   them, but actually becomes dirty by the increased filth and mud. For
   "from the mouth of a sinner praise is not comely;" [837] as to him it
   is said by the prophet: "Wherefore dost thou declare My righteous acts,
   and takest My covenant in thy lips?" [838] of souls like this, who
   never possess in any lasting fashion the fear of the Lord of which it
   is said: "the fear of the Lord is instruction and wisdom," [839] and
   yet try to get at the meaning of Scripture by continual meditation on
   them, it is appropriately asked in Proverbs: "What use are riches to a
   fool? For a senseless man cannot possess wisdom." [840] But so far is
   this true and spiritual knowledge removed from that worldly erudition,
   which is defiled by the stains of carnal sins, that we know that it has
   sometimes flourished most grandly in some who were without eloquence
   and almost illiterate. And this is very clearly shown by the case of
   the Apostles and many holy men, who did not spread themselves out with
   an empty show of leaves, but were bowed down by the weight of the true
   fruits of spiritual knowledge: of whom it is written in the Acts of the
   Apostles: "But when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and
   perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned men, they were
   astonished." [841] And therefore if you are anxious to attain to that
   never-failing fragrance, you must first strive with all your might to
   obtain from the Lord the purity of chastity. For no one, in whom the
   love of carnal passions and especially of fornication still holds sway,
   can acquire spiritual knowledge. For "in a good heart wisdom will
   rest;" and: "He that feareth the Lord shall find knowledge with
   righteousness." [842] But that we must attain to spiritual knowledge in
   the order of which we have already spoken, we are taught also by the
   blessed Apostle. For when he wanted not merely to draw up a list of all
   his own virtues, but rather to describe their order, that he might
   explain which follows what, and which gives birth to what, after some
   others he proceeds as follows: "In watchings, in fastings, in chastity,
   in knowledge, in long suffering, in gentleness, in the Holy Ghost, in
   love unfeigned." [843] And by this enumeration of virtues he evidently
   meant to teach us that we must come from watchings and fastings to
   chastity, from chastity to knowledge, from knowledge to long suffering,
   from long suffering to gentleness, from gentleness to the Holy Ghost,
   from the Holy Ghost to the rewards of love unfeigned. When then by this
   system and in this order you too have come to spiritual knowledge, you
   will certainly have, as we said, not barren or idle learning but what
   is vigorous and fruitful; and the seed of the word of salvation which
   has been committed by you to the hearts of your hearers, will be
   watered by the plentiful showers of the Holy Ghost that will follow;
   and, according to this that the prophet promised, "the rain will be
   given to your seed, wherever you shall sow in the land, and the bread
   of the corn of the land shall be most plentiful and fat." [844]

  CHAPTER XVII.

    To whom the method of perfection should be laid open.

   TAKE care too, when your riper age leads you to teach, lest you be led
   astray by the love of vainglory, and teach at random to the most impure
   persons these things which you have learnt not so much by reading as by
   the effects of experience, and so incur what Solomon, that wisest of
   men, denounced: "Attach not a wicked man to the pastures of the just,
   and be not led astray by the fulness of the belly," for "delicacies are
   not good for a fool, nor is there room for wisdom where sense is
   wanting: for folly is the more led on, because a stubborn servant is
   not improved by words, for even though he understands, he will not
   obey." And "Do not say anything in the ears of an imprudent man, lest
   haply he mock at thy wise speeches." [845] And "give not that which is
   holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest haply they
   trample them under foot and turn again and rend you." [846] It is right
   then to hide the mysteries of spiritual meanings from men of this sort,
   that you may effectually sing: "Thy words have I hid within my heart:
   that I should not sin against Thee." [847] But you will perhaps say:
   And to whom are the mysteries of Holy Scripture to be dispensed?
   Solomon, the wisest of men, shall teach you: "Give, says he, strong
   drink to those who are in sorrow, and give wine to drink, to those who
   are in pain, that they may forget their poverty, and remember their
   pain no more," [848] i.e., to those who in consequence of the
   punishment of their past actions are oppressed with grief and sorrow,
   supply richly the joys of spiritual knowledge like "wine that maketh
   glad the heart of man," [849] and restore them with the strong drink of
   the word of salvation, lest haply they be plunged in continual sorrow
   and a despair that brings death, and so those who are of this sort be
   "swallowed up in overmuch sorrow." [850] But of those who remain in
   coldness and carelessness, and are smitten by no sorrow of heart we
   read as follows: "For one who is kindly and without sorrow, shall be in
   want." [851] With all possible care therefore avoid being puffed up
   with the love of vainglory, and so failing to become a partaker with
   him whom the prophet praises, "who hath not given his money upon
   usury." [852] For every one who, from love of the praise of men
   dispenses the words of God, of which it is said "the words of the Lord
   are pure words, as silver tried by the fire, purged from the earth,
   refined seven times," [853] puts out his money upon usury, and will
   deserve for this not merely no reward, but rather punishment. For this
   reason he chose to use up his Lord's money that he might be the garner
   from a temporal profit, and not that the Lord, as it is written, might
   "when He comes, receive His own with usury." [854]

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    Of the reasons for which spiritual learning is unfruitful.

   BUT it is certain that for two reasons the teaching of spiritual things
   is ineffectual. For either the teacher is commending what he has no
   experience of, and is trying with empty-sounding words to instruct his
   hearer, or else the hearer is a bad man and full of faults and cannot
   receive in his hard heart the holy and saving doctrine of the spiritual
   man; and of these it is said by the prophet: "For the heart of this
   people is blinded, and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes
   have they closed: lest at any time they should see with their eyes and
   hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and be converted
   and I should heal them." [855]


  CHAPTER XIX.

    How often even those who are not worthy can receive the grace of the saving
    word.

   BUT sometimes in the lavish generosity of God in His Providence, "Who
   willeth all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth,"
   [856] it is granted that one who has not shown himself by an
   irreproachable life to be worthy of the preaching of the gospel attains
   the grace of spiritual teaching for the good of many. But by what means
   the gifts of healing are granted by the Lord for the expulsion of
   devils it follows that we must in a similar discussion explain, which
   as we are going to rise for supper we will keep for the evening,
   because that is always more effectually grasped by the heart which is
   taken in by degrees and without excessive bodily efforts.

THE SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT NESTEROS.

ON DIVINE GIFTS.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Discourse of Abbot Nesteros on the threefold system of gifts.

   AFTER evening service we sat down together on the mats as usual ready
   for the promised narration: and when we had kept silence for some
   little time out of reverence for the Elder, he anticipated the silence
   of our respect by such words as these. The previous order of our
   discourse had brought us to the exposition of the system of spiritual
   gifts, which we have learnt from the tradition of the Elders is a
   threefold one. The first indeed is for the sake of healing, when the
   grace of signs accompanies certain elect and righteous men on account
   of the merits of their holiness, as it is clear that the apostles and
   many of the saints wrought signs and wonders in accordance with the
   authority of the Lord Who says: "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
   the lepers, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give."
   [857] The second when for the edification of the church or on account
   of the faith of those who bring their sick, or of those who are to be
   cured, the virtue of health proceeds even from sinners and men unworthy
   of it. Of whom the Saviour says in the gospel: "Many shall say to Me in
   that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy
   name cast out devils, and in Thy name done many mighty works? And then
   I will confess to them, I never knew you: Depart from Me, ye workers of
   iniquity." [858] And on the other hand, if the faith of those who bring
   them or of the sick is wanting, it prevents those on whom the gifts of
   healing are conferred from exercising their powers of healing. On which
   subject Luke the Evangelist says: "And Jesus could not there do any
   mighty work because of their unbelief." [859] Whence also the Lord
   Himself says: "Many lepers were in Israel in the days of Elisha the
   prophet, and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian." [860]
   The third method of healing is copied by the deceit and contrivance of
   devils, that, when a man who is enslaved to evident sins is out of
   admiration for his miracles regarded as a saint and a servant of God,
   men may be persuaded to copy his sins and thus an opening being made
   for cavilling, the sanctity of religion may be brought into disgrace,
   or else that he, who believes that he possesses the gift of healing,
   may be puffed up by pride of heart and so fall more grievously. Hence
   it is that invoking the names of those, who, as they know, have no
   merits of holiness or any spiritual fruits, they pretend that by their
   merits they are disturbed and made to flee from the bodies they have
   possessed. Of which it says in Deuteronomy: "If there rise up in the
   midst of thee a prophet, or one who says that he has seen a dream, and
   declare a sign and a wonder, and that which he hath spoken cometh to
   pass, and he say to thee: Let us go and follow after other gods whom
   thou knowest not, and let us serve them: thou shalt not hear the words
   of that prophet or of that dreamer, for the Lord thy God is tempting
   thee that it may appear whether thou lovest Him or not, with all thy
   heart and with all thy soul." [861] And in the gospel it says: "There
   shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall give great
   signs and wonders, so that, if it were possible, even the elect should
   be led astray." [862]

  CHAPTER II.

    Wherein one ought to admire the saints.

   WHEREFORE we never ought to admire those who affect these things, for
   these powers, but rather to look whether they are perfect in driving
   out all sins, and amending their ways, for this is granted to each man
   not for the faith of some other, or for a variety of reasons, but for
   his own earnestness, by the action of God's grace. For this is
   practical knowledge which is termed by another name by the Apostle;
   viz., love, and is by the authority of the Apostle preferred to all
   tongues of men and of angels, and to full assurance of faith which can
   even remove mountains, and to all knowledge, and prophecy, and to the
   distribution of all one's goods, and finally to the glory of martyrdom
   itself. For when he had enumerated all kinds of gifts and had said: "To
   one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of
   knowledge, to another faith, to another the gift of healing, to another
   the working of miracles, etc.:" [863] when he was going to speak about
   love notice how in a few words he put it before all gifts: "And yet,"
   he says, "I show unto you a still more excellent way." [864] By which
   it is clearly shown that the height of perfection and blessedness does
   not consist in the performance of those wonderful works but in the
   purity of love. And this not without good reason. For all those things
   are to pass away and be destroyed, but love is to abide for ever. And
   so we have never found that those works and signs were affected by our
   fathers: nay, rather when they did possess them by the grace of the
   Holy Spirit they would never use them, unless perhaps extreme and
   unavoidable necessity drove them to do so.

  CHAPTER III.

    Of a dead man raised to life by Abbot Macarius.

   AS also we remember that a dead man was raised to life by Abbot
   Macarius who was the first to find a home in the desert of Scete. [865]
   For when a certain heretic who followed the error of Eunomius was
   trying by dialectic subtlety to destroy the simplicity of the Catholic
   faith, and had already deceived a large number of men, the blessed
   Macarius was asked by some Catholics, who were terribly disturbed by
   the horror of such an upset, to set free the simple folk of all Egypt
   from the peril of infidelity, and came for this purpose. And when the
   heretic had approached him with his dialectic art, and wanted to drag
   him away in his ignorance to the thorns of Aristotle, the blessed
   Macarius put a stop to his chatter with apostolic brevity, saying: "the
   kingdom of God is not in word but in power." [866] Let us go therefore
   to the tombs, and let us invoke the name of the Lord over the first
   dead man we find, and let us, as it is written, "show our faith by our
   works," [867] that by His testimony the manifest proofs of a right
   faith may be shown, and we may prove the clear truth not by an empty
   discussion of words but by the power of miracles and that judgment
   which cannot be deceived. And when he heard this the heretic was
   overwhelmed with shame before the people who were present, and
   pretended for the moment that he consented to the terms proposed, and
   promised that he would come on the morrow, but the next day when they
   were all in expectation who had come together with greater eagerness to
   the appointed place, owing to their desire for the spectacle, he was
   terrified by the consciousness of his want of faith, and fled away, and
   at once escaped out of all Egypt. And when the blessed Macarius had
   waited together with the people till the ninth hour, and saw that he
   had owing to his guilty conscience avoided him, he took the people, who
   had been perverted by him and went to the tombs determined upon. Now in
   Egypt the overflow of the river Nile has introduced this custom that,
   since the whole breadth of that country is covered for no small part of
   the year by the regular flood of waters like a great sea so that there
   is no means of getting about except by a passage in boats, the bodies
   of the dead are embalmed and stored away in cells an good height up.
   For the soil of that land being damp from the continual moisture
   prevents them from burying them. For if it receives any bodies buried
   in it, it is forced by the excessive inundations to cast them forth on
   its surface. When then the blessed Macarius had taken up his position
   by a most ancient corpse, he said "O man, if that heretic and son of
   perdition had come hither with me, and, while he was standing by, I had
   exclaimed and invoked the name of Christ my God, say in the presence of
   these who were almost perverted by his fraud, whether you would have
   arisen." Then he arose and replied with words of assent. And then Abbot
   Macarius asked him what he had formerly been when he enjoyed life here,
   or in what age of men he had lived, or if he had then known the name of
   Christ, and he replied that he had lived under kings of most ancient
   date, and declared that in those days he had never heard the name of
   Christ. To whom once more Abbot Macarius: "Sleep," said he, "in peace
   with the others in your own order, to be roused again by Christ in the
   end." All this power then and grace of his which was in him would
   perhaps have always been hidden, unless the needs of the whole province
   which was endangered, and his entire devotion to Christ, and unfeigned
   love, had forced him to perform this miracle. And certainly it was not
   the ostentation of glory but the love of Christ and the good of all the
   people that wrung from him the performance of it. As the passage in the
   book of Kings shows us that the blessed Elijah also did, who asked that
   fire might descend from heaven on the sacrifices laid on the pyre, for
   this reason that he might set free the faith of the whole people which
   was endangered by the tricks of the false prophets.

    Of the miracle which Abbot Abraham wrought on the breasts of a woman.

   WHY also need I mention the acts of Abbot Abraham, [868] who was
   surnamed `aplous, i.e., the simple, from the simplicity of his life and
   his innocence. This man when he had gone from the desert to Egypt for
   the harvest in the season of Quinquagesima [869] was pestered with
   tears and prayers by a woman who brought her little child, already
   pining away and half dead from lack of milk; he gave her a cup of water
   to drink signed with the sign of the cross; and when she had drunk it
   at once most marvellously her breasts that had been till then utterly
   dry flowed with a copious abundance of milk.

  CHAPTER V.

    Of the cure of a lame man which the same saint wrought.

   OR when the same man as he went to a village was surrounded by mocking
   crowds, who sneered at him and showed him a man who was for many years
   deprived of the power of walking from a contracted knee, and crawled
   from a weakness of long standing, they tempted him and said, "Show us,
   father Abraham, if you are the servant of God, and restore this man to
   his former health, that we may believe that the name of Christ, whom
   you worship, is not vain." Then he at once invoked the name of Christ,
   and stooped down and laid hold of the man's withered foot and pulled
   it. And immediately at his touch the dried and bent knee was
   straightened, and he got back the use of his legs, which he had
   forgotten how to use in his long years of weakness, and went away
   rejoicing.

  CHAPTER VI.

    How the merits of each man should not be judged by his miracles.

   AND so these men gave no credit to themselves for their power of
   working such wonders, because they confessed that they were done not by
   their own merits but by the compassion of the Lord and with the words
   of the Apostle they refused the human honour offered out of admiration
   for their miracles: "Men and brethren, why marvel ye at this, or why
   look ye on us as though by our own power or holiness we had caused this
   man to walk." [870] Nor did they think that any one should be renowned
   for the gifts and marvels of God, but rather for the fruits of his own
   good deeds, which are brought about by the efforts of his mind and the
   power of his works. For often, as was said above, men of corrupt minds,
   reprobate concerning the truth, both cast out devils and perform the
   greatest miracles in the name of the Lord. Of whom when the Apostles
   complained and said: "Master, we saw one casting out devils in Thy
   name, and we forbade him because he followeth not with us," though for
   the present Christ replied to them "Forbid him not, for he that is not
   against you is for you," [871] still when they say at the end: "Lord,
   Lord, have we not in Thy name prophesied, and in Thy name cast out
   devils, and in Thy name done many mighty works?" He testifies that then
   He will answer: "I never knew you: depart from me, ye workers of
   iniquity." [872] And therefore He actually warns those, to whom He
   Himself has given this glory of miracles and mighty works because of
   their holiness, that they be not puffed up by them, saying: "Rejoice
   not because the devils are subject to you, but rejoice rather because
   your names are written in heaven." [873]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

    How the excellence of gifts consists not in miracles but in humility.

   FINALLY the Author Himself of all miracles and mighty works, when He
   called His disciples to learn His teaching, clearly showed what those
   true and specially chosen followers ought chiefly to learn from Him,
   saying: "Come and learn of Me," not chiefly to cast out devils by the
   power of heaven, not to cleanse the lepers, not to give sight to the
   blind, not to raise the dead: for even though I do these things by some
   of My servants, yet man's estate cannot insert itself into the praises
   of God, nor can a minister and servant gather hereby any portion for
   himself there where is the glory of Deity alone. But do ye, says He,
   learn this of Me, "for I am meek and lowly of heart." [874] For this it
   is which it is possible for all men generally to learn and practise,
   but the working of miracles and signs is not always necessary, nor good
   for all, nor granted to all. Humility therefore is the mistress of all
   virtues, it is the surest foundation of the heavenly building, it is
   the special and splendid gift of the Saviour. For he can perform all
   the miracles which Christ wrought, without danger of being puffed up,
   who follows the gentle Lord not in the grandeur of His miracles, but in
   the virtues of patience and humility. But he who aims at commanding
   unclean spirits, or bestowing gifts of healing, or showing some
   wonderful miracle to the people, even though when he is showing off he
   invokes the name of Christ, yet he is far from Christ, because in his
   pride of heart he does not follow his humble Teacher. For when He was
   returning to the Father, He prepared, so to speak, His will and left
   this to His disciples: "A new commandment," said He, "give I unto you
   that ye love one another; as I have loved you, so do ye also love one
   another:" and at once He subjoined: "By this shall all men know that ye
   are My disciples, if ye have love to one another." [875] He says not:
   "if ye do signs and miracles in the same way," but "if ye have love to
   one another;" and this it is certain that none but the meek and humble
   can keep. Wherefore our predecessors never reckoned those as good monks
   or free from the fault of vainglory, who professed themselves exorcists
   among men, and proclaimed with boastful ostentation among admiring
   crowds the grace which they had either obtained or which they claimed.
   But in vain, for "he who trusteth in lies feedeth the winds: and the
   same runneth after birds that fly away." [876] For without doubt that
   will happen to them which we find in Proverbs: "As the winds and clouds
   and rain are very clear so are these who boast of a fictitious gift."
   [877] And so if any one does any of these things in our presence, he
   ought to meet with commendation from us not from admiration of his
   miracles, but from the beauty of his life, nor should we ask whether
   the devils are subject to him, but whether he possesses those features
   of love which the Apostle describes.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    How it is more wonderful to have cast out one's faults from one's self than
    devils from another.

   AND in truth it is a greater miracle to root out from one's own flesh
   the incentives to wantonness than to cast out unclean spirits from the
   bodies of others, and it is a grander sign to restrain the fierce
   passions of anger by the virtue of patience than to command the powers
   of the air, and it is a greater thing to have shut out the devouring
   pangs of gloominess from one's own heart than to have expelled the
   sickness of another and the fever of his body. Finally it is in many
   ways a grander virtue and a more splendid achievement to cure the
   weaknesses of one's own soul than those of the body of another. For
   just as the soul is higher than the flesh, so is its salvation of more
   importance, and as its nature is more precious and excellent, so is its
   destruction more grievous and dangerous.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    How uprightness of life is of more importance than the working of miracles.

   AND of those cures it was said to the blessed Apostles: "Rejoice not
   that the devils are subject to you." [878] For this was wrought not by
   their own power, but by the might of the name invoked. And therefore
   they are warned not to presume to claim for themselves any blessedness
   or glory on this account as it was done simply by the power and might
   of God, but only on account of the inward purity of their life and
   heart, for which it was vouchsafed to them to have their names written
   in heaven.

   [878] S. Luke 10:20.

  CHAPTER X.

    A revelation on the trial of perfect chastity.

   AND to prove this that we have said both by the testimony of the
   ancients and divine oracles, we had better bring forward in his own
   words and experience what the blessed Paphnutius [879] felt on the
   subject of admiration of miracles and the grace of purity, or rather
   what he learnt from the revelation of an angel. For this man had been
   famous for many years for his signal strictness so that he fancied that
   he was completely free from the snares of carnal concupiscence because
   he felt himself superior to all the attacks of the demons with whom he
   had fought openly and for a long while; and when some holy men had come
   to him, he was preparing for them a porridge of lentiles which they
   call Athera, [880] and his hand, as it happened, was burnt in the oven,
   by a flame that darted up. And when this happened he was much mortified
   and began silently to consider with himself, and ask why was not the
   fire at peace with me, when my more serious contests with demons have
   ceased? or how will that unquenchable fire which searches out the
   deserts of all pass me by in that dread day of judgment, and fail to
   detain me, if this trivial temporal fire from without has not spared
   me? And as he was troubled by thoughts of this kind and vexation a
   sudden sleep overcame him and an angel of the Lord came to him and
   said: "Paphnutius, why are you vexed because that earthly fire is not
   yet at peace with you, while there still remains in your members some
   disturbance of carnal motions that is not completely removed? For as
   long as the roots of this flourish within you, they will not suffer
   that material fire to be at peace with you. And certainly you could not
   feel it harmless unless you found by such proofs as these that all
   these internal motions within you were destroyed. Go, take a naked and
   most beautiful virgin, and if while you hold her you find that the
   peace of your heart remains steadfast, and that carnal heat is still
   and quiet within you, then the touch of this visible flame also shall
   pass over you gently and without harming you as it did over the three
   children in Babylon." And so the Elder was impressed by this revelation
   and did not try the dangers of the experiment divinely shown to him,
   but asked his own conscience and examined the purity of his heart; and,
   guessing that the weight of purity was not yet sufficient to outweigh
   the force of this trial, it is no wonder, said he, if when the battles
   with unclean spirits come upon me, I still feel the flames of the fire,
   which I used to think of less importance than the savage attacks of
   demons, still raging against me. Since it is a greater virtue and a
   grander grace to extinguish the inward lust of the flesh than by the
   sign of the Lord [881] and the power of the might of the Most High to
   subdue the wicked demons which rush upon one from without, or to drive
   them by invoking the Divine name from the bodies which they have
   possessed. So far Abbot Nesteros, finishing the account of the true
   working of the gifts of grace accompanied us to the cell of the Elder
   Joseph which was nearly six miles distant from his, as we were eager
   for instruction in his doctrine.

THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOSEPH.

ON FRIENDSHIP.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    What Abbot Joseph asked us in the first instance.

   THE blessed Joseph, [882] whose instructions and precepts are now to be
   set forth, and who was one of the three whom we mentioned in the first
   Conference, [883] belonged to a most illustrious family, and was the
   chief man of his city in Egypt, which was named Thmuis, [884] and so
   was carefully trained in the eloquence of Greece as well as Egypt, so
   that he could talk admirably with us or with those who were utterly
   ignorant of Egyptian, not as the others did through an interpreter, but
   in his own person. And when he found that we were anxious for
   instruction from him, he first inquired whether we were own brothers,
   and when he heard that we were united in a tie of spiritual and not
   carnal brotherhood, and that from the first commencement of our
   renunciation of the world we had always been joined together in an
   unbroken bond as well in our travels, which we had both undertaken for
   the sake of spiritual service, as also in the pursuits of the
   monastery, he began his discourse as follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    Discourse of the same elder on the untrustworthy sort of friendship.

   THERE are many kinds of friendship and companionship which unite men in
   very different ways in the bonds of love. For some a previous
   recommendation makes to enter upon an intercourse first of acquaintance
   and afterwards even of friendship. In the case of others some bargain
   or an agreement to give and take something has joined them in the bonds
   of love. Others a similarity and union of business or science or art or
   study has united in the chain of friendship, by which even fierce souls
   become kindly disposed to each other, so that those, who in forests and
   mountains delight in robbery and revel in human bloodshed, embrace and
   cherish the partners of their crimes. But there is another kind of
   love, where the union is from the instincts of nature and the laws of
   consanguinity, whereby those of the same tribe, wives and parents, and
   brothers and children are naturally preferred to others, a thing which
   we find is the case not only with mankind but with all birds and
   beasts. For at the prompting of a natural instinct they protect and
   defend their offspring and their young ones so that often they are not
   afraid to expose themselves to danger and death for their sakes. Indeed
   those kinds of beasts and serpents and birds, which are cut off and
   separated from all others by their intolerable ferocity or deadly
   poison, as basilisks, unicorns and vultures, though by their very look
   they are said to be dangerous to every one, yet among themselves they
   remain peaceful and harmless owing to community of origin and
   fellow-feeling. But we see that all these kinds of love of which we
   have spoken, as they are common both to the good and bad, and to beasts
   and serpents, certainly cannot last for ever. For often separation of
   place interrupts and breaks them off, as well as forgetfulness from
   lapse of time, and the transaction of affairs and business and words.
   For as they are generally due to different kinds of connexions either
   of gain, or desires, or kinship, or business, so when any occasion for
   separation intervenes they are broken off.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    How friendship is indissoluble.

   AMONG all these then there is one kind of love which is indissoluble,
   where the union is owing not to the favour of a recommendation, or some
   great kindness or gifts, or the reason of some bargain, or the
   necessities of nature, but simply to similarity of virtue. This, I say,
   is what is broken by no chances, what no interval of time or space can
   sever or destroy, and what even death itself cannot part. This is true
   and unbroken love which grows by means of the double perfection and
   goodness of friends, and which, when once its bonds have been entered,
   no difference of liking and no disturbing opposition of wishes can
   sever. But we have known many set on this purpose, who though they had
   been joined together in companionship out of their burning love for
   Christ, yet could not maintain it continually and unbrokenly, because
   although they relied on a good beginning for their friendship, yet they
   did not with one and the same zeal maintain the purpose on which they
   had entered, and so there was between them a sort of love only for a
   while, for it was not maintained by the goodness of both alike, but by
   the patience of the one party, and so although it is held to by the one
   with unwearied heroism, yet it is sure to be broken by the pettiness of
   the other. For the infirmities of those who are somewhat cold in
   seeking the healthy condition of perfection, however patiently they may
   be borne by the strong, are yet not put up with by those who are weaker
   themselves. For they have implanted within them causes of disturbance
   which do not allow them to be at ease, just as those, who are affected
   by bodily weakness, generally impute the delicacy of their stomach and
   weak health to the carelessness of their cooks and servants, and
   however carefully their attendants may serve them, yet nevertheless
   they ascribe the grounds of their upset to those who are in good
   health, as they do not see that they are really due to the failure of
   their own health. Wherefore this, as we said, is the sure and
   indissoluble union of friendship, where the tie consists only in
   likeness in goodness. For "the Lord maketh men to be of one mind in an
   house." [885] And therefore love can only continue undisturbed in those
   in whom there is but one purpose and mind to will and to refuse the
   same things. And if you also wish to keep this unbroken, you must be
   careful that having first got rid of your faults, you mortify your own
   desires, and with united zeal and purpose diligently fulfil that in
   which the prophet specially delights: "Behold how good and joyful a
   thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." [886] Which
   should be taken of unity of spirit rather than of place. For it is of
   no use for those who differ in character and purpose to be united in
   one dwelling, nor is it an hindrance for those who are grounded on
   equal goodness to be separated by distance of place. For with God the
   union of character, not of place, joins brethren together in a common
   dwelling, nor can unruffled peace ever be maintained where difference
   of will appears.

  CHAPTER IV.

    A question whether anything that is really useful should be performed even
    against a brother's wish.

   GERMANUS: What then? If when one party wants to do something which he
   sees is useful and profitable according to the mind of God, the other
   does not give his consent, ought it to be performed even against the
   wish of the brother, or should it be thrown on one side as he wants?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    The answer, how a lasting friendship can only exist among those who are
    perfect.

   JOSEPH: For this reason we said that the full and perfect grace of
   friendship can only last among those who are perfect and of equal
   goodness, whose likemindedness and common purpose allows them either
   never, or at any rate hardly ever, to disagree, or to differ in those
   matters which concern their progress in the spiritual life. But if they
   begin to get hot with eager disputes, it is clear that they have never
   been at one in accordance with the rule which we gave above. But
   because no one can start from perfection except one who has begun from
   the very foundation, and your inquiring is not with regard to its
   greatness, but as to how you can attain to it, I think it well to
   explain to you, in a few words, the rule for it and the sort of path
   along which your steps should be directed, that you may be able more
   easily to secure the blessing of patience and peace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    By what means union can be preserved unbroken.

   THE first foundation then, of true friendship consists in contempt for
   worldly substance and scorn for all things that we possess. For it is
   utterly wrong and unjustifiable if, after the vanity of the world and
   all that is in it has been renounced, whatever miserable furniture
   remains is more regarded than what is most valuable; viz., the love of
   a brother. The second is for each man so to prune his own wishes that
   he may not imagine himself to be a wise and experienced person, and so
   prefer his own opinions to those of his neighbour. The third is for him
   to recognize that everything, even what he deems useful and necessary,
   must come after the blessing of love and peace. The fourth for him to
   realize that he should never be angry for any reason good or bad. The
   fifth for him to try to cure any wrath which a brother may have
   conceived against him however unreasonably, in the same way that he
   would cure his own, knowing that the vexation of another is equally bad
   for him, as if he himself were stirred against another, unless he
   removes it, to the best of his ability, from his brother's mind. The
   last is what is undoubtedly generally decisive in regard to all faults;
   viz., that he should realize daily that he is to pass away from this
   world; as the realization of this not only permits no vexation to
   linger in the heart, but also represses all the motions of lusts and
   sins of all kinds. Whoever then has got hold of this, can neither
   suffer nor be the cause of bitter wrath and discord. But when this
   fails, as soon as he who is jealous of love has little by little
   infused the poison of vexation in the hearts of friends, it is certain
   that owing to frequent quarrels love will gradually grow cool, and at
   sometime or other he will part the hearts of the lovers, that have been
   for a long while exasperated. For if one is walking along the course
   previously marked out, how can he ever differ from his friend, for if
   he claims nothing for himself, he entirely cuts off the first cause of
   quarrel (which generally springs from trivial things and most
   unimportant matters), as he observes to the best of his power what we
   read in the Acts of the Apostles on the unity of believers: "But the
   multitude of believers was of one heart and soul; neither did any of
   them say that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but
   they had all things common." [887] Then how can any seeds of discussion
   arise from him who serves not his own but his brother's will, and
   becomes a follower of his Lord and Master, who speaking in the
   character [888] of man which He had taken, said: "I am not come to do
   Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me"? [889] But how can he
   arouse any incitement to contention, who has determined to trust not so
   much to his own judgment as to his brother's decision, on his own
   intelligence and meaning, in accordance with his will either approving
   or disapproving his discoveries, and fulfilling in the humility of a
   pious heart these words from the Gospel: "Nevertheless, not as I will,
   but as Thou wilt." [890] Or in what way will he admit anything which
   grieves the brother, who thinks that nothing is more precious than the
   blessing of peace, and never forgets these words of the Lord: "By this
   shall all men know that ye are My disciples, that ye love one another;"
   [891] for by this, as by a special mark, Christ willed that the flock
   of His sheep should be known in this world, and be separated from all
   others by this stamp, so to speak? But on what grounds will he endure
   either to admit the rancour of vexation in himself or for it to remain
   in another, if his firm decision is that there cannot be any good
   ground for anger, as it is dangerous and wrong, and that when his
   broker is angry with him he cannot pray, in just the same way as when
   he himself is angry with his brother, as he ever keeps in an humble
   heart these words of our Lord and Saviour: "If thou bring thy gift to
   the altar and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee,
   leave there thy gift at the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled
   to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift." [892] For it will be
   of no use for you to declare that you are not angry, and to believe
   that you are fulfilling the command which says: "Let not the sun go
   down upon thy wrath;" and: "Whosoever is angry with his brother, shall
   be in danger of the judgment," [893] if you are with obstinate heart
   disregarding the vexation of another which you could smooth down by
   kindness on your part. For in the same way you will be punished for
   violating the Lord's command. For He who said that you should not be
   angry with another, said also that you should not disregard the
   vexations of another, for it makes no difference in the sight of God,
   "Who willeth all men to be saved," [894] whether you destroy yourself
   or someone else. Since the death of any one is equally a loss to God,
   and at the same time it is equally a gain to him to whom all
   destruction is delightful, whether it is acquired by your death or by
   the death of your brother. Lastly, how can he retain even the least
   vexation with his brother, who realizes daily that he is presently to
   depart from this world?

  CHAPTER VII.

    How nothing should be put before love, or after anger.

   AS then nothing should be put before love, so on the other hand nothing
   should be put below rage and anger. For all things, however useful and
   necessary they seem, should yet be disregarded that disturbing anger
   may be avoided, and all things even which we think are unfortunate
   should be undertaken and endured that the calm of love and peace may be
   preserved unimpaired, because we should reckon nothing more damaging
   than anger and vexation, and nothing more advantageous than love.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    On what grounds a dispute can arise among spiritual persons.

   FOR as our enemy separates brethren who are still weak and carnal by a
   sudden burst of rage on account of some trifling and earthly matter, so
   he sows the seeds of discord even between spiritual persons, on the
   ground of some difference of thoughts, from which certainly those
   contentions and strifes about words, which the Apostle condemns, for
   the most part arise: whereby consequently our spiteful and malignant
   enemy sows discord between brethren who were of one mind. For these
   words of wise Solomon are true: "Contention breeds hatred: but
   friendship will be a defence to all who do not strive." [895]

  CHAPTER IX.

    How to get rid even of spiritual grounds of discord.

   WHEREFORE for the preservation of lasting and unbroken love, it is of
   no use to have removed the first ground of discord, which generally
   arises from frail and earthly things, or to have disregarded all carnal
   things, and to have permitted to our brethren an unrestricted share in
   everything which our needs require, unless too we cut off in like
   manner the second, which generally arises under the guise of spiritual
   feelings; and unless we gain in everything humble thoughts and
   harmonious wills.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    On the best tests of truth.

   FOR I remember, that when my youthful age suggested to me to cling to a
   partner, thoughts of this sort often mingled with our moral training
   and the Holy Scriptures, so that we fancied that nothing could be truer
   or more reasonable: but when we came together and began to produce our
   ideas, in the general discussion which was held, some things were first
   noted by the others as false and dangerous, and then presently were
   condemned and pronounced by common consent to be injurious; though
   before they had seemed to shine as if with a light infused by the
   devil, so that they would easily have caused discord, had not the
   charge of the Elders, observed like some divine oracle, restrained us
   from all strife, that charge; namely, whereby it was ordered by them
   almost with the force of a law, that neither of us should trust to his
   own judgments more than his brother's, if he wanted never to be
   deceived by the craft of the devil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    How it is impossible for one who trusts to his own judgment to escape being
    deceived by the devil's illusions.

   FOR often it has been proved that what the Apostle says really takes
   place. "For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light,"
   [896] so that he deceitfully sheds abroad a confusing and foul
   obscuration of the thoughts instead of the true light of knowledge. And
   unless these thoughts are received in a humble and gentle heart, and
   kept for the consideration of some more experienced brother or approved
   Elder, and when thoroughly sifted by their judgment, either rejected or
   admitted by us, we shall be sure to venerate in our thoughts an angel
   of darkness instead of an angel of light, and be smitten with a
   grievous destruction: an injury which it is impossible for any one to
   avoid who trusts in his own judgment, unless he becomes a lover and
   follower of true humility and with all contrition of heart fulfils what
   the Apostle chiefly prays for: "If then there be any consolation in
   Christ, if any comfort of love, if any bowels of compassion, fulfil ye
   my joy, that you be of one mind, having the same love, being of one
   accord, doing nothing by contention, neither by vainglory; but in
   humility each esteeming others better than themselves;" and this: "in
   honour preferring one another," [897] that each may think more of the
   knowledge and holiness of his partner, and hold that the better part of
   true discretion is to be found in the judgment of another rather than
   in his own.


  CHAPTER XII.

    Why inferiors should not be despised in Conference.

   FOR it often happens either by an illusion of the devil or by the
   occurrence of a human mistake (by which every man in this life is
   liable to be deceived) that sometimes one who is keener in intellect
   and more learned, gets some wrong notion in his head, while he who is
   duller in wits and of less worth, conceives the matter better and more
   truly. And therefore no one, however learned he may be, should persuade
   himself in his empty vanity that he cannot require conference with
   another. For even if no deception of the devil blinds his judgment, yet
   he cannot avoid the noxious snares of pride and conceit. For who can
   arrogate this to himself without great danger, when the chosen vessel
   in whom, as he maintained, Christ Himself spoke, declares that he went
   up to Jerusalem simply and solely for this reason, that he might in a
   secret discussion confer with his fellow-Apostles on the gospel which
   he preached to the gentiles by the revelation and co-operation of the
   Lord? By which fact we are shown that we ought not only by these
   precepts to preserve unanimity and harmony, but that we need not fear
   any crafts of the devil opposing us, or snares of his illusions.

  CHAPTER XIII.

    How love does not only belong to God but is God.

   FINALLY so highly is the virtue of love extolled that the blessed
   Apostle John declares that it not only belongs to God but that it is
   God, saying: "God is love: he therefore that abideth in love, abideth
   in God, and God in him." [898] For so far do we see that it is divine,
   that we find that what the Apostle says is plainly a living truth in
   us: "For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
   Who dwelleth in us." [899] For it is the same thing as if he said that
   God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Who dwelleth in us:
   who also, when we know not what we should pray for, "makes intercession
   for us with groanings that cannot be uttered: But He that searcheth the
   hearts knoweth what the Spirit desireth, for He asketh for the saints
   according to God." [900]

  CHAPTER XIV.

    On the different grades of love.

   IT is possible then for all to show that love which is called agaph, of
   which the blessed Apostle says: "While therefore we have time, let us
   do good unto all men, but specially to them that are of the household
   of faith." [901] And this should be shown to all men in general to such
   an extent that we are actually commanded by our Lord to yield it to our
   enemies, for He says: "Love your enemies." [902] But diaqesis, i.e.,
   affection is shown to but a few and those who are united to us by
   kindred dispositions or by a tie of goodness; though indeed affection
   seems to have many degrees of difference. For in one way we love our
   parents, in another our wives, in another our brothers, in another our
   children, and there is a wide difference in regard to the claims of
   these feelings of affection, nor is the love of parents towards their
   children always equal. As is shown by the case of the patriarch Jacob,
   who, though he was the father of twelve sons and loved them all with a
   father's love, yet loved Joseph with deeper affection, as Scripture
   clearly shows: "But his brethren envied him, because his father loved
   him;" [903] evidently not that that good man his father failed in
   greatly loving the rest of his children, but that in his affection he
   clung to this one, because he was a type of the Lord, more tenderly and
   indulgently. This also, we read, was very clearly shown in the case of
   John the Evangelist, where these words are used of him: "that disciple
   whom Jesus loved," [904] though certainly He embraced all the other
   eleven, whom He had chosen in the same way, with His special love, as
   this He shows also by the witness of the gospel, where He says: "As I
   have loved you, so do ye also love one another;" of whom elsewhere also
   it is said: "Loving His own who were in the world, He loved them even
   to the end." [905] But this love of one in particular did not indicate
   any coldness in love for the rest of the disciples, but only a fuller
   and more abundant love towards the one, which his prerogative of
   virginity and the purity of his flesh bestowed upon him. And therefore
   it is marked by exceptional treatment, as being something more sublime,
   because no hateful comparison with others, but a richer grace of
   superabundant love singled it out. Something of this sort too we have
   in the character of the bride in the Song of Songs, where she says:
   "Set in order love in me." [906] For this is true love set in order,
   which, while it hates no one, yet loves some still more by reason of
   their deserving it, and which, while it loves all in general, singles
   out for itself some from those, whom it may embrace with a special
   affection, and again among those, who are the special and chief objects
   of its love, singles out some who are preferred to others in affection.

  CHAPTER XV.

    Of those who only increase their own or their brother's grievances by hiding
    them.

   ON the other hand we know (and O! would that we did not know) some of
   the brethren who are so hard and obstinate, that when they know that
   their own feelings are aroused against their brother, or that their
   brother's are against them, in order to conceal their vexation of mind,
   which is caused by indignation at the grievance of one or the other, go
   apart from those whom they ought to smooth down by humbly making up to
   them and talking with them; and begin to sing some verses of the
   Psalms. And these while they fancy that they are softening the bitter
   thoughts which have arisen in their heart, increase by their insolent
   conduct what they could have got rid of at once if they had been
   willing to show more care and humility, for a well-timed expression of
   regret would cure their own feelings and soften their brother's heart.
   For by that plan they nourish and cherish the sin of meanness or rather
   of pride, instead of stamping out all inducement to quarrelling, and
   they forget the charge of the Lord which says: "Whosoever is angry with
   his brother, is in danger of the judgment;" and: "if thou remember that
   thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the
   altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then
   come and offer thy gift." [907]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [907] S. Matt. 5:22-24.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    How it is that, if our brother has any grudge against us, the gifts of our
    prayers are rejected by the Lord.

   SO far therefore is our Lord anxious that we should not disregard the
   vexation of another that He does not accept our offerings if our
   brother has anything against us, i.e., He does not allow prayers to be
   offered by us to Him until by speedy amends we remove from his (our
   brother's) mind the vexation which he whether rightly or wrongly feels.
   For He does not say: "if thy brother hath a true ground for complaint
   against thee leave thy gift at the altar, and go thy way, first be
   reconciled to him;" but He says: "if thou remember that thy brother
   hath aught against thee," i.e., if there be anything however trivial or
   small, owing to which your brother's anger is roused against you, and
   this comes back to your recollection by a sudden remembrance, you must
   know that you ought not to offer the spiritual gift of your prayers
   until by kindly amends you have removed from your brother's heart the
   vexation arising from whatever cause. If then the words of the Gospel
   bid us make satisfaction to those who are angry for past and utterly
   trivial grounds of quarrel, and those which have arisen from the
   slightest causes, what will become of us wretches who with obstinate
   hypocrisy disregard more recent grounds of offence, and those of the
   utmost importance, and due to our own faults; and being puffed up with
   the devil's own pride, as we are ashamed to humble ourselves, deny that
   we are the cause of our brother's vexation and in a spirit of rebellion
   disdaining to be subject to the Lord's commands, contend that they
   never ought to be observed and never can be fulfilled? And so it comes
   to pass that as we make up our minds that He has commanded things which
   are impossible and unsuitable, we become, to use the Apostle's
   expression, "not doers but judges of the law." [908]

  CHAPTER XVII.

    Of those who hold that patience should be shown to worldly people rather
    than to the brethren.

   THIS too should be bitterly lamented; namely, that some of the
   brethren, when angered by some reproachful words, if they are besieged
   by the prayers of some one else who wants to smooth them down, when
   they hear that vexation ought not to be admitted or retained against a
   brother, according to what is written: "Whoever is angry with his
   brother is in danger of the judgment;" and: "Let not the sun go down
   upon your wrath," [909] instantly assert that if a heathen or one
   living in the world had said or done this, it rightly ought to be
   endured. But who could stand a brother who was accessory to so great a
   fault, or gave utterance to so insolent a reproach with his lips! As if
   patience were to be shown only to unbelievers and blasphemers, and not
   to all in general, or as if anger should be reckoned as bad when it is
   against a heathen, but good when it is against a brother; whereas
   certainly the obstinate rage of an angry soul brings about the same
   injury to one's self whoever may be the subject against whom it is
   aroused. But how terribly obstinate, aye and senseless is it for them,
   owing to the stupidity of their dull mind, not to be able to discern
   the meaning of these words, for it is not said: "Every one who is angry
   with a stranger shall be in danger of the judgment," which might
   perhaps according to their interpretation except those who are partners
   of our faith and life, but the word of the Gospel most significantly
   expresses it by saying: "Every one who is angry with his brother, shall
   be in danger of the judgment." And so though we ought according to the
   rule of truth to regard every man as a brother, yet in this passage one
   of the faithful and a partaker of our mode of life is denoted by the
   title of brother rather than a heathen.

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    Of those who pretend to patience but excite their brethren to anger by their
    silence.

   BUT what sort of a thing is this, that sometimes we fancy that we are
   patient because when provoked we scorn to answer, but by sullen silence
   or scornful motions and gestures so mock at our angry brothers that by
   our silent looks we provoke them to anger more than angry reproaches
   would have excited them, meanwhile thinking that we are in no way
   guilty before God, because we have let nothing fall from our lips which
   could brand us or condemn us in the judgment of men. As if in the sight
   of God mere words, and not mainly the will was called in fault, and as
   if only the actual deed of sin, and not also the wish and purpose, was
   reckoned as wrong; or as if it would be asked in the judgment only what
   each one had done and not what he also purposed to do. For it is not
   only the character of the anger roused, but also the purpose of the man
   who provokes it which is bad, and therefore the true scrutiny of our
   judge will ask, not how the quarrel was stirred up but by whose fault
   it arose: for the purpose of the sin, and not the way in which the
   fault is committed must be taken into account. For what does it matter
   whether a man kills a brother with a sword by himself, or drives him to
   death by some fraud, when it is clear that he is killed by his wiles
   and crime? As if it were enough not to have pushed a blind man down
   with one's own hand, though he is equally guilty who scorned to save
   him, when it was in his power, when fallen and on the point of tumbling
   into the ditch: or as if he alone were guilty who had caught a man with
   the hand, and not also the one who had prepared and set the trap for
   him, or who would not set him free when he might have done so. So then
   it is of no good to hold one's tongue, if we impose silence upon
   ourselves for this reason that by our silence we may do what would have
   been done by an outcry on our part, simulating certain gestures by
   which he whom we ought to have cured, may be made still more angry,
   while we are commended for all this, to his loss and damage: as if a
   man were not for this very reason the more guilty, because he tried to
   get glory for himself out of his brother's fall. For such a silence
   will be equally bad for both because while it increases the vexation in
   the heart of another, so it prevents it from being removed from one's
   own: and against such persons the prophet's curse is with good reason
   directed: "Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, and presenteth
   his gall, and maketh him drunk, that he may behold his nakedness. He is
   filled with shame instead of glory." [910] And this too which is said
   of such people by another: "For every brother will utterly supplant,
   and every friend will walk deceitfully. And a man shall mock his
   brother, and they will not speak the truth, for they have bent their
   tongue like a bow for lies and not for truth." [911] But often a
   feigned patience excites to anger more keenly than words, and, a
   spiteful silence exceeds the most awful insults in words, and the
   wounds of enemies are more easily borne than the deceitful blandishment
   of mockers, of which it is well said by the prophet: "Their words are
   smoother than oil, and yet they are darts:" and elsewhere "the words of
   the crafty are soft: but they smite within the belly:" to which this
   also may be finely applied: "With the mouth he speaks peace to his
   friend, but secretly he layeth snares for him;" with which however the
   deceiver is rather deceived, for "if a man prepares a net before his
   friend, it surrounds his own feet;" and: "if a man digs a pit for his
   neighbour, he shall fall into it himself." [912] Lastly when a great
   multitude had come with swords and staves to take the Lord, none of the
   murderers of the author of our life stood forth as more cruel than he
   who advanced before them all with a counterfeit respect and salutation
   and offered a kiss of feigned love; to whom the Lord said: "Judas,
   betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" [913] i.e., the bitterness
   of thy persecution and hatred has taken as a cloke this which expresses
   the sweetness of true love. More openly too and more energetically does
   He emphasize the force of this grief by the prophet, saying: "For if
   mine enemy had cursed me, I would have borne it: and if he who hated me
   had spoken great things against me, I would have hid myself from him.
   But it was thou, a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar friend:
   who didst take sweet meats together with me: in the house of God we
   walked with consent." [914]

  CHAPTER XIX.

    Of those who fast out of rage.

   THERE is too another evil sort of vexation which would not be worth
   mentioning were it not that we know it is allowed by some of the
   brethren who, when they have been vexed or enraged actually abstain
   persistently from food, so that (a thing which we cannot mention
   without shame) those who when they are calm declare that they cannot
   possibly put off their refreshment to the sixth or at most the ninth
   hour, when they are filled with vexation and rage do not feel fasts
   even for two days, and support themselves, when exhausted by such
   abstinence, by a surfeit of anger. Wherein they are plainly guilty of
   the sin of sacrilege, as out of the devil's own rage they endure fasts
   which ought specially to be offered to God alone out of desire for
   humiliation of heart and purification from sin: which is much the same
   as if they were to offer prayers and sacrifices not to God but to
   devils, and so be worthy of hearing this rebuke of Moses: "They
   sacrificed to devils and not to God; to gods whom they knew not." [915]

  CHAPTER XX.

    Of the feigned patience of some who offer the other cheek to be smitten.

   WE are not ignorant also of another kind of insanity, which we find in
   some of the brethren under colour of a counterfeit patience, as in this
   case it is not enough to have stirred up quarrels unless they incite
   them with irritating words so as to get themselves smitten, and when
   they have been touched by the slightest blow, at once they offer
   another part of their body to be smitten, as if in this way they could
   fulfil to perfection that command which says: "If a man smite thee on
   the right cheek, offer him the other also;" [916] while they totally
   ignore the meaning and purpose of the passage. For they fancy that they
   are practising evangelical patience through the sin of anger, for the
   utter eradication of which not only was the exchange of retaliation and
   the irritation of strife forbidden, but the command was actually given
   us to mitigate the wrath of the striker by the endurance of a double
   wrong.

  CHAPTER XXI.

    A question how if we obey the commands of Christ we can fail of evangelical
    perfection.

   GERMANUS: How can we blame one who satisfies the command of the Gospel
   and not only does not retaliate, but is actually prepared to have a
   double wrong offered to him?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

    The answer that Christ looks not only at the action but also at the will.

   JOSEPH: As was said a little before, we must look not only at the thing
   which is done, but also at the character of the mind and the purpose of
   the doer. And therefore if you weigh with a careful scrutiny of heart
   what is done by each man and consider with what mind it is done or from
   what feeling it proceeds, you will see that the virtue of patience and
   gentleness cannot possibly be fulfilled in the opposite spirit, i.e.,
   that of impatience and rage. Since our Lord and Saviour, when giving us
   a thorough lesson on the virtue of patience and gentleness (i.e.,
   teaching us not only to profess it with our lips, but to store it up in
   the inmost recesses of the soul) gave us this summary of evangelical
   perfection, saying: "If any one smites thee on thy right cheek, offer
   him the other also" [917] (doubtless the "right" cheek is mentioned, as
   another "right" cheek cannot be found except in the face of the inner
   man, so to speak), as by this He desires entirely to remove all
   incitement to anger from the deepest recesses of the soul, i.e., that
   if your external right cheek has received a blow from the striker, the
   inner man also humbly consenting may offer its right cheek to be
   smitten, sympathizing with the suffering of the outward man, and in a
   way submitting and subjecting its own body to wrong from the striker,
   that the inner man may not even silently be disturbed in itself at the
   blows of the outward man. You see then that they are very far from
   evangelical perfection, which teaches that patience must be maintained,
   not in words but in inward tranquillity of heart, and which bids us
   preserve it whatever evil happens, that we may not only keep ourselves
   always from disturbing anger, but also by submitting to their injuries
   compel those, who are disturbed by their own fault, to become calm,
   when they have had their fill of blows; and so overcome their rage by
   our gentleness. And so also we shall fulfil these words of the Apostle:
   "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good." [918] And it is
   quite clear that this cannot be fulfilled by those who utter words of
   gentleness and humility in such a spirit and rage that they not only
   fail to lessen the fire of wrath which has been kindled, but rather
   make it blaze up the more fiercely both in their own feelings and in
   those of their enraged brother. But these, even if they could in some
   way keep calm and quiet themselves, would yet not bear any fruits of
   righteousness, while they claim the glory of patience on their part by
   their neighbour's loss, and are thus altogether removed from that
   Apostolic love which "Seeketh not her own," [919] but the things of
   others. For it does not so desire riches in such a way as to make
   profit for itself out of one's neighbour's loss, nor does it wish to
   gain anything if it involves the spoiling of another.

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    How he is the strong and vigorous man, who yields to the will of another.

   BUT you must certainly know that in general he plays a stronger part
   who subjects his own will to his brother's, than he who is found to be
   the more pertinacious in defending and clinging to his own decisions.
   For the former by bearing and putting up with his neighbour gains the
   character of being strong and vigorous, while the latter gains that of
   being weak and sickly, who must be pampered and petted so that
   sometimes for the sake of his peace and quiet it is a good thing to
   relax something even in necessary matters. And indeed in this he need
   not fancy that he has lost anything of his own perfection, though by
   yielding he has given up something of his intended strictness, but on
   the contrary he may be sure that he has gained much more by his virtue
   of long-suffering and patience. For this is the Apostle's command: "Ye
   who are strong should bear the infirmities of the weak;" and: "Bear ye
   one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." [920] For a
   weak man will never support a weak man, nor can one who is suffering in
   the same way, bear or cure one in feeble health, but one who is himself
   not subject to infirmity brings remedies to one in weak health. For it
   is rightly said to him: "Physician, heal thyself." [921]

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    How the weak are harmful and cannot bear wrongs.

   WE must note too the fact that the nature of the weak is always such
   that they are quick and ready to offer reproaches and sow the seeds of
   quarrels, while they themselves cannot bear to be touched by the shadow
   of the very slightest wrong, and while they are riding roughshod over
   us and flinging about wanton charges, they are not able to bear even
   the slightest and most trivial ones themselves. And so according to the
   aforesaid opinion of the Elders love cannot last firm and unbroken
   except among men of the same purpose and goodness. For at some time or
   other it is sure to be broken, however carefully it may be guarded by
   one of them.

    A question how he can be strong who does not always support the weak.

   GERMANUS: How then can the patience of a perfect man be worthy of
   praise if it cannot always bear the weak?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVI.

    The answer that the weak does not always allow himself to be borne.

   JOSEPH: I did not say that the virtue and endurance of one who is
   strong and robust would be overcome, but that the miserable condition
   of the weak, encouraged by the tolerance of the perfect, and daily
   growing worse, is sure to give rise to reasons on account of which he
   himself ought no longer to be borne; or else with a shrewd suspicion
   that the patience of his neighbour shows up and sets off his own
   impatience at some time or other he chooses to make off rather than
   always to be borne by the magnanimity of the other. This then we think
   should be above all else observed by those who want to keep the
   affection of their companions unimpaired; viz., that first of all when
   provoked by any wrongs, a monk should keep not only his lips but even
   the depth of his breast unmoved: but if he finds that they are even
   slightly disturbed, let him keep himself in by entire silence, and
   diligently observe what the Psalmist speaks of: "I was troubled and
   spake nothing;" and: "I said I will take heed to thy ways that I offend
   not with my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner
   stood against me. I was dumb and was humbled, and kept silence from
   good things;" [922] and he should not pay any heed to his present
   state, nor give vent to what his violent rage suggests and his
   exasperated mind expresses at the moment, but should dwell on the grace
   of past love or look forward in his mind to the renewal and restoration
   of peace, and contemplate it even in the very hour of rage, as if it
   were sure presently to return. And while he is reserving himself for
   the delight of harmony soon to come, he will not feel the bitterness of
   the present quarrel and will easily make such answers that, when love
   is restored, he will not be able to accuse himself as guilty or be
   blamed by the other; and thus he will fulfil these words of the
   prophet: "In wrath remember mercy." [923]

  CHAPTER XXVII.

    How anger should be repressed.

   WE ought then to restrain every movement of anger and moderate it under
   the direction of discretion, that we may not by blind rage be hurried
   into that which is condemned by Solomon: "The wicked man expends all
   his anger, but the wise man dispenses it bit by bit," [924] i.e., a
   fool is inflamed by the passion of his anger to avenge himself; but a
   wise man, by the ripeness of his counsel and moderation little by
   little diminishes it, and gets rid of it. Something of the same kind
   too is this which is said by the Apostle: "Not avenging yourselves,
   dearly beloved: but give place to wrath," [925] i.e., do not under the
   compulsion of wrath proceed to vengeance, but give place to wrath,
   i.e., do not let your hearts be confined in the straits of impatience
   and cowardice so that, when a fierce storm of passion rises, you cannot
   endure it; but be ye enlarged in your hearts, receiving the adverse
   waves of anger in the wide gulf of that love which "suffereth all
   things, beareth all things;" [926] and so your mind will be enlarged
   with wide long-suffering and patience, and will have within it safe
   recesses of counsel, in which the foul smoke of anger will be received
   and be diffused and forthwith vanish away; or else the passage may be
   taken in this way: we give place to wrath, as often as we yield with
   humble and tranquil mind to the passion of another, and bow to the
   impatience of the passionate, as if we admitted that we deserved any
   kind of wrong. But those who twist the meaning of the perfection of
   which the Apostle speaks so as to make out that those give place to
   anger, who go away from a man in a rage, seem to me not to cut off but
   rather to foment the incitement to quarrelling, for unless a
   neighbour's wrath is overcome at once by amends being humbly made, a
   man provokes rather than avoids it by his flight. And there is
   something like this that Solomon says: "Be not hasty in thy spirit to
   be wroth, for anger reposes in the bosom of fools;" and: "Be not quick
   to rush into a quarrel, lest thou repent thereof at the last." [927]
   For he does not blame a hasty exhibition of quarrelling and anger in
   such a way as to praise a tardy one. In the same way too must this be
   taken: "A fool declares his anger in the very same hour, but a prudent
   man hides his shame." [928] For he does not lay it down that a shameful
   outburst of anger ought to be hidden by wise men in such a way that
   while he blames a speedy outburst of anger he fails to forbid a tardy
   one, as certainly, if owing to human weakness it does burst forth, he
   means that it should be hidden for this reason, that while for the
   moment it is wisely covered up, it may be destroyed forever. For the
   nature of anger is such that when it is given room it languishes and
   perishes, but if openly exhibited, it burns more and more. The hearts
   then should be enlarged and opened wide, lest they be confined in the
   narrow straits of cowardice, and be filled with the swelling surge of
   wrath, and so we become unable to receive what the prophet calls the
   "exceeding broad" commandment of God in our narrow heart, or to say
   with the prophet: "I have run the way of thy commandments for thou hast
   enlarged my heart." [929] For that long-suffering is wisdom we are
   taught by very clear passages of Scripture: for "a man who is
   long-suffering is great in prudence; but a coward is very foolish."
   [930] And therefore Scripture says of him who to his credit asked the
   gift of wisdom from the Lord: "God gave Solomon wisdom and prudence
   exceeding much, and largeness of heart as the sand of the sea for
   multitude." [931]

  CHAPTER XXVIII.

    How friendships entered upon by conspiracy cannot be lasting ones.

   THIS too has been often proved by many experiments; viz., that those
   who entered the bonds of friendship from a beginning of conspiracy,
   cannot possibly preserve their harmony unbroken; either because they
   tried to keep it not out of their desire for perfection nor because of
   the sway of Apostolic love, but out of earthly love, and because of
   their wants and the bonds of their agreement; or else because that most
   crafty foe of ours hurries them on the more speedily to break the
   chains of their friendship in order that he may make them breakers of
   their oath. This opinion then of the most prudent men is most certainly
   established; viz., that true harmony and undivided union can only exist
   among those whose life is pure, and who are men of the same goodness
   and purpose.

   Thus much the blessed Joseph discoursed in his spiritual talk on
   friendship, and fired us with a more ardent desire to preserve the love
   of our fellowship as a lasting one.

                                 CONFERENCE 17.

THE SECOND CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOSEPH.

ON MAKING PROMISES.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Of the vigils which we endured.

   WHEN then the previous Conference was ended, and the intervening
   silence of night as well, as we had been conducted by the holy Abbot
   Joseph to a separate cell for the sake of quiet, but had passed the
   whole night without sleep (since owing to his words a fire was raging
   in our hearts), we came forth from the cell and retired about a hundred
   yards from it and sat down in a secluded spot. And so as an opportunity
   was given by the shades of night for secret and familiar converse
   together, as we sat there Abbot Germanus groaned heavily.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    Of the anxiety of Abbot Germanus at the recollection of our promise.

   WHAT are we doing? said he. For we see that we are involved in a great
   difficulty and are in an evil plight, as reason itself and the life of
   the saints is effectually teaching us what is the best thing for our
   progress in the spiritual life, and yet our promise given to the Elders
   does not allow us to choose what is helpful. For we might, by the
   examples of such great men, be formed for a more perfect life and aim,
   were it not that the terms of our promise compelled us to return at
   once to the monastery. But if we return thither, we shall never get
   another chance of coming here again. But if we stay here and choose to
   carry out our wishes, what becomes of the faith of the oath which we
   are aware that we gave to our Elders promising a speedy return; that we
   might be allowed to make a hasty round of the monasteries and saints of
   this province? And when in this state of tumult we could not make up
   our minds what we ought to decide on the state of our salvation we
   simply testified by our groans the hard fate of our condition,
   upbraiding the audacity of our impudence, and yet hating the shame
   which was natural to us, weighed down by which we could not in any
   other way resist the prayers of those who kept us back against our
   profit and purpose, except by the promise of a speedy return, as we
   wept indeed that we laboured under the fault of that shame, of which it
   is said "There is a shame that bringeth sin." [932]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [932] Prov. 26:11.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    My ideas on this subject.

   THEN I replied: The counsel or rather the authority of the Elder to
   whom we ought to refer our anxieties would make a short way out of our
   difficulties, and whatever is decided by his verdict, may, like a
   divine and heavenly reply, put an end to all our troubles. And we need
   not have any doubt of what is given to us by the Lord through the lips
   of this Elder, both for the sake of his merits and for our own faith.
   For by His gift believers have often obtained saving counsel from
   unworthy people, and unbelievers from saints, as the Lord grants this
   either on account of the merit of those who answer, or on account of
   the faith of those who ask advice. And so the holy Abbot Germanus
   caught eagerly at these words as if I had uttered them not of myself
   but at the prompting of the Lord, and when we had waited a little for
   the coming of the Elder and the approaching hour of the nocturnal
   service, after we had welcomed him with the usual greeting and finished
   reciting the right number of Psalms and prayers, we sat down again as
   usual on the same mats on which we had settled ourselves to sleep.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    Abbot Joseph's question and our answer on the origin of our anxiety.

   THEN the venerable Joseph saw that we were in rather low spirits, and,
   guessing that this was not the case without reason, addressed us in
   these words of the patriarch Joseph: "Why are your faces sad today?"
   [933] to whom we answered: We are not like those bond slaves of Pharaoh
   who have seen a dream and there is none to interpret it, but I admit
   that we have passed a sleepless night and there is no one to lighten
   the weight of our troubles unless the Lord may remove them by your
   wisdom. Then he, who recalled the excellence of the patriarch both by
   his merits and name, said: Does not the cure of man's perplexities come
   from the Lord? Let them be brought forward: for the Divine Compassion
   is able to give a remedy for them by means of our advice according to
   your faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [933] Gen. 40:7.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    The explanation of Abbot Germanus why we wanted to stay in Egypt, and were
    drawn back to Syria.

   TO THIS GERMANUS: We used to think, said he, that we should go back to
   our monastery abundantly filled not only with spiritual joy but also
   with what is profitable by the sight of your holiness, and that after
   our return we should follow, though with but a feeble rivalry, what we
   had learnt from your teaching. For this our love for our Elders led us
   to promise them, while we fancied that we could in some degree follow
   in that monastery your sublime life and doctrine. Wherefore as we
   thought that by this means all joy would be bestowed upon us, so on the
   other hand we are overwhelmed with intolerable grief, as we find that
   we cannot possibly obtain in this way what we know to be good for us.
   On both sides then we are now hemmed in. For if we want to keep our
   promise which we made in the presence of all the brethren in the cave
   where our Lord Himself shone forth from His chamber in the Virgin's
   womb, [934] and which He Himself witnessed, we shall incur the greatest
   loss in our spiritual life. But if we ignore our promise and stay in
   this district, and choose to consider that oath of ours as of less
   importance than our perfection, we are afraid of the awful dangers of
   falsehood and perjury. But not even by this plan can we lighten our
   burdens; viz., by fulfilling the terms of our oath by a very hasty
   return, and then coming back again as quickly as possible to these
   parts. For although even a small delay is dangerous and hurtful for
   those who are aiming at goodness and advance in spiritual things, yet
   still we would keep our faith and promise, though by an unwilling
   return, were it not that we felt sure that we should be so tightly
   bound down both by the authority and also by the love of the Elders,
   that we should henceforth have no opportunity at all to come back again
   to this place.

  CHAPTER VI.

    Abbot Joseph's question whether we got more good in Egypt than in Syria.

   TO this the blessed Joseph, after a short silence: Are you sure, said
   he, that you can get more profit in spiritual matters in this country?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

    The answer on the difference of customs in the two countries.

   GERMANUS: Although we ought to be most grateful for the teaching of
   those men who taught us from our youth up to attempt great things, and,
   by giving us a taste of their excellence, implanted in our hearts a
   splendid thirst for perfection, yet if any reliance is to be placed on
   our judgment, we cannot draw any comparison between these customs and
   those which we learnt there, so as to hold our tongues about the
   inimitable purity of your life, which we believe is granted to you not
   only owing to the concentration of your mind and aim, but also owing to
   the aid and assistance of the place itself. Wherefore we do not doubt
   that for the following of your grand perfection this instruction which
   is given to us is not enough by itself, unless we have also the help of
   the life, and a long course of instruction somewhat dissolves the
   coldness of our heart by daily training.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    How those who are perfect ought not to make any promises absolutely, and
    whether decisions can be reversed without sin.

   JOSEPH: It is good indeed and right and altogether in accordance with
   our profession, for us effectually to perform what we decided to do in
   the case of any promise. Wherefore a monk ought not to make any promise
   hastily, lest he may be forced to do what he incautiously promised, or
   if he is kept back by consideration of a sounder view, appear as a
   breaker of his promise. But because at the present moment our purpose
   is to treat not so much of a state of health as of the cure of sickness
   we must with salutary counsel consider not what you ought to have done
   in the first instance, but how you can escape from the rocks of this
   perilous shipwreck. When then no chains impede us and no conditions
   restrict us, in the case of a comparison of good things, if a choice is
   proposed, that which is most advantageous should be preferred: but when
   some detriment and loss stands in the way, in a comparison of things to
   our hurt, that should be sought which exposes us to the smallest loss.
   Further, as your assertion shows, when your heedless promise has
   brought you to this state that in either case some serious loss and
   inconvenience must result to you, the will in choosing should incline
   to that side which involves a loss that is more tolerable, or can be
   more easily made up for by the remedy of making amends. If then you
   think that you will get more good for your spirit by staying here than
   what accrued to you from your life in that monastery, and that the
   terms of your promise cannot be fulfilled without the loss of great
   good, it is better for you to undergo the loss from a falsehood and an
   unfulfilled promise (as it is done once for all, and need not any
   longer be repeated or be the cause of other sins) than for you to incur
   that loss, through which you say that your state of life would become
   colder, and which would affect you with a daily and unceasing injury.
   For a careless promise is changed in such a way that it may be pardoned
   or indeed praised, if it is turned into a better path, nor need we take
   it as a failure in consistency, but as a correction of rashness,
   whenever a promise that was faulty is corrected. And all this may be
   proved by most certain witness from Scripture, that for many the
   fulfilment of their promise has led to death, and on the other hand
   that for many it has been good and profitable to have refused it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    How it is often better to break one's engagements than to fulfil them.

   AND both these points are very clearly shown by the cases of S. Peter
   the Apostle and Herod. For the former, because he departed from his
   expressed determination which he had as it were confirmed with an oath
   saying "Thou shalt never wash my feet," [935] gained an immortal
   partnership with Christ, whereas he would certainly have been cut off
   from the grace of this blessedness, if he had clung obstinately to his
   word. But the latter, by clinging to the pledge of his ill-considered
   oath, became the bloody murderer of the Lord's forerunner, and through
   the vain fear of perjury plunged himself into condemnation and the
   punishment of everlasting death. In everything then we must consider
   the end, and must according to it direct our course and aim, and if
   when some wiser counsel supervenes, we see it diverging to the worse
   part, it is better to discard the unsuitable arrangement, and to come
   to a better mind rather than to cling obstinately to our engagements
   and so become involved in worse sins.

   [935] S. John 13:8.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    Our question about our fear of the oath which we gave in the monastery in
    Syria.

   GERMANUS: In so far as it concerns our desire, which we undertook to
   carry out for the sake of spiritual profit, we were hoping to be
   edified by continual intercourse with you. For if we were to return to
   our monastery it is certain that we should not only fail of so sublime
   a purpose, but that we should also suffer grievous loss from the
   mediocrity of the manner of life there. But that command of the gospel
   frightens us terribly: "Let your speech be yea, yea, nay, nay: but
   whatsoever is more than these, is from the evil one." [936] For we hold
   that we cannot compensate for transgressing so important a command by
   any righteousness, nor can that finally turn out well which has once
   been started with a bad beginning.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [936] S. Matt. 5:37.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    The answer that we must take into account the purpose of the doer rather
    than the execution of the business.

   JOSEPH: In every case, as we said, we must look not at the progress of
   the work but at the intention of the worker, nor must we inquire to
   begin with what a man has done, but with what purpose, so that we may
   find that some have been condemned for those deeds from which good has
   afterwards arisen, and on the other hand that some have arrived by
   means of acts in themselves reprehensible at the height of
   righteousness. And in the case of the former the good result of their
   actions was of no avail to them as they took the matter in and with an
   evil purpose, and wanted to bring about--not the good which actually
   resulted, but something of the opposite character; nor was the bad
   beginning injurious to the latter, as he put up with the necessity of a
   blameworthy start; not out of disregard for God, or with the purpose of
   doing wrong, but with an eye to a needful and holy end.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    How a fortunate issue will be of no avail to evil doers, while bad deeds
    will not injure good men.

   AND that we may make these statements clear by instances from Holy
   Scripture, what could be brought about that was more salutary and more
   to the good of the whole world, than the saving remedy of the Lord's
   Passion? And yet it was not only of no advantage, but was actually to
   the disadvantage of the traitor by whose means it is shown to have been
   brought about, so that it is absolutely said of him: "It were good for
   that man if he had never been born." [937] For the fruits of his labour
   will not be repaid to him according to the actual result, but according
   to what he wanted to do, and believed that he would accomplish. And
   again, what could there be more culpable than craft and deceit shown
   even to a stranger, not to mention one's brother and father? And yet
   the patriarch Jacob not only met with no condemnation or blame for such
   things but was actually dowered with the everlasting heritage of the
   blessing. And not without reason, for the last mentioned desired the
   blessing destined for the first-born not out of a greedy desire for
   present gain but because of his faith in everlasting sanctification;
   while the former (Judas) delivered the Redeemer of all to death, not
   for the sake of man's salvation, but from the sin of covetousness. And
   therefore in each case the fruits of their action are reckoned
   according to the intention of the mind and purpose of the will,
   according to which the object of the one was not to work fraud, nor was
   that of the other to work salvation. For justly is there repayment to
   each man as the recompense of reward, for what he conceived in the
   first instance in his mind, and not for what resulted from it either
   well or badly, against the wish of the worker. And so the most just
   Judge regarded him who ventured on such a falsehood as excusable and
   indeed worthy of praise, because without it he could not secure the
   blessing of the first-born; and that should not be reckoned as a sin,
   which arose from desire of the blessing. Otherwise the aforesaid
   patriarch would have been not only unfair to his brother, but also a
   cheat of his father and a blasphemer, if there had been any other way
   by which he could secure the gift of that blessing, and he had
   preferred to follow this which would damage and injure his brother. You
   see then that with God the inquiry is not into the carrying out of the
   act, but into the purpose of the mind. With this preparation then for a
   return to the question proposed (for which all this has been premised)
   I want you first to tell me for what reason you bound yourselves in the
   fetters of that promise.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [937] S. Matt. 26:24.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    Our answer as to the reason which demanded an oath from us.

   GERMANUS: The first reason, as we said, was that we were afraid of
   vexing our Elders and resisting their orders; the second was that we
   very foolishly believed that, if we had learnt from you anything
   perfect or splendid to hear or look at, when we returned to the
   monastery, we should be able to perform it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

    The discourse of the Elder showing how the plan of action may be changed
    without fault provided that one keeps to the carrying out of a good
    intention.

   JOSEPH: As we premised, the intent of the mind brings a man either
   reward or condemnation, according to this passage: "Their thoughts
   between themselves accusing or also defending one another, in the day
   when God shall judge the secrets of men;" and this too: "But I am
   coming to gather together their works and thoughts together with all
   nations and tongues." [938] Wherefore it was, as I see, from a desire
   for perfection that you bound yourselves with the chain of these oaths,
   as you then thought that by this plan it could be gained, while now
   that a riper judgment has supervened, you see that you cannot by this
   means scale its heights. And so any departure from that arrangement,
   which may seem to have happened, will be no hindrance, if only no
   change in that first purpose follows. For a change of instrument does
   not imply a desertion of the work, nor does the choice of a shorter and
   more direct road argue laziness on the path of the traveller. And so in
   this matter an improvement in a short-sighted arrangement is not to be
   reckoned a breach of a spiritual promise. For whatever is done out of
   the love of God and desire for goodness, which has "promise of the life
   that now is and of that which is to come," [939] even though it may
   appear to commence with a hard and adverse beginning, is most worthy,
   not only of no blame, but actually of praise. And therefore the
   breaking of a careless promise will be no hindrance, if in every case
   the end, i.e., the proposed aim at goodness, be maintained. For we do
   all for this reason, that we may be able to show to God a clean heart,
   and if the attainment of this is considered to be easier in this
   country the alteration of the agreement extracted from you will be no
   hindrance to you, if only the perfection of that purity for the sake of
   which your promise was originally made, be the sooner secured according
   to the Lord's will.

  CHAPTER XV.

    A question whether it can be without sin that our knowledge affords to weak
    brethren an opportunity for lying.

   GERMANUS: As far as the force of the words which have been reasonably
   and carefully considered, is concerned, our scruple about our promise
   would have easily been removed from us were it not that we were
   terribly alarmed lest by this example an opportunity for lying might be
   offered to certain weaker brethren, if they knew that the faith of an
   agreement could be in any way lawfully broken, whereas this very thing
   is forbidden in such vigorous and threatening terms by the prophet when
   he says: "Thou shall destroy all those who utter a lie;" and: "the
   mouth that speaketh a lie, shall slay the soul." [940]

   [940] Ps. 5:7; Wisd. 1:11.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    The answer that Scripture truth is not to be altered on account of an
    offence given to the weak.

   JOSEPH: Occasions and opportunities for destroying themselves cannot
   possibly be wanting to those who are on the road to ruin, or rather who
   are anxious to destroy themselves; nor are those passages of Scripture
   to be rejected and altogether torn out of the volume, by which the
   perversity of heretics is encouraged, or the unbelief of the Jews
   increased, or the pride of heathen wisdom offended; but surely they are
   to be piously believed, and firmly held, and preached according to the
   rule of truth. And therefore we should not, because of another's
   unbelief, reject the oikonomias, i.e., the "economy" of the prophets
   and saints which Scripture relates, lest while we are thinking that we
   ought to condescend to their infirmities, we stain ourselves with the
   sin not only of lying but of sacrilege. But, as we said, we ought to
   admit these according to the letter, and explain how they were rightly
   done. But for those who are wrongly disposed, the opening for lies will
   not be blocked up by this means, if we are trying either altogether to
   deny or to explain away by allegorical interpretations the truth of
   those things which we are going to bring forward or have already
   brought forward. For how will the authority of these passages injure
   them if their corrupt will is alone sufficient to lead them to sin?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

    How the saints have profitably employed a lie like hellebore.

   AND so we ought to regard a lie and to employ it as if its nature were
   that of hellebore; which is useful if taken when some deadly disease is
   threatening, but if taken without being required by some great danger
   is the cause of immediate death. For so also we read that holy men and
   those most approved by God employed lying, so as not only to incur no
   guilt of sin from it, but even to attain the greatest goodness; and if
   deceit could confer glory on them, what on the other hand would the
   truth have brought them but condemnation? Just as Rahab, of whom
   Scripture gives a record not only of no good deed but actually of
   unchastity, yet simply for the lie, by means of which she preferred to
   hide the spies instead of betraying them, had it vouchsafed to her to
   be joined with the people of God in everlasting blessing. But if she
   had preferred to speak the truth and to regard the safety of the
   citizens, there is no doubt that she and all her house would not have
   escaped the coming destruction, nor would it have been vouchsafed to
   her to be inserted in the progenitors of our Lord's nativity, [941] and
   reckoned in the list of the patriarchs, and through her descendants
   that followed, to become the mother of the Saviour of all. Again
   Dalila, who to provide for the safety of her fellow citizens betrayed
   the truth she had discovered, obtained in exchange eternal destruction,
   and has left to all men nothing but the memory of her sin. When then
   any grave danger hangs on confession of the truth, then we must take to
   lying as a refuge, yet in such a way as to be for our salvation
   troubled by the guilt of a humbled conscience. But where there is no
   call of the utmost necessity present, there a lie should be most
   carefully avoided as if it were something deadly: just as we said of a
   cup of hellebore which is indeed useful if it is only taken in the last
   resort when a deadly and inevitable disease is threatening, while if it
   is taken when the body is in a state of sound and rude health, its
   deadly properties at once go to find out the vital parts. And this was
   clearly shown of Rahab of Jericho, and the patriarch Jacob; the former
   of whom could only escape death by means of this remedy, while the
   latter could not secure the blessing of the first-born without it. For
   God is not only the Judge and inspector of our words and actions, but
   He also looks into their purpose and aim. And if He sees that anything
   has been done or promised by some one for the sake of eternal salvation
   and shows insight into Divine contemplation, even though it may appear
   to men to be hard and unfair, yet He looks at the inner goodness of the
   heart and regards the desire of the will rather than the actual words
   spoken, because He must take into account the aim of the work and the
   disposition of the doer, whereby, as was said above, one man may be
   justified by means of a lie, while another may be guilty of a sin of
   everlasting death by telling the truth. To which end the patriarch
   Jacob also had regard when he was not afraid to imitate the hairy
   appearance of his brother's body by wrapping himself up in skins, and
   to his credit acquiesced in his mother's instigation of a lie for this
   object. For he saw that in this way there would be bestowed on him
   greater gains of blessing and righteousness than by keeping to the path
   of simplicity: for he did not doubt that the stain of this lie would at
   once be washed away by the flood of the paternal blessing, and would
   speedily be dissolved like a little cloud by the breath of the Holy
   Spirit; and that richer rewards of merit would be bestowed on him by
   means of this dissimulation which he put on than by means of the truth,
   which was natural to him.

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    An objection that only those men employed lies with impunity, who lived
    under the law.

   GERMANUS: It is no wonder that these schemes were properly employed in
   the Old Testament, and that some holy men laudably or at any rate
   venially told lies, as we see that many worse things were permitted to
   them owing to the rude character of the times. For why should we wonder
   that when the blessed David was fleeing from Saul, in answer to the
   inquiry of Abimelech the priest who said: "Why art thou alone, and is
   no man with thee?" he replied as follows: "The king hath commanded me a
   business, and said, Let no man know the thing for which thou art sent
   by me, for I have appointed my servants to such and such a place;" and
   again: "Hast thou here at hand a spear or a sword, for I brought not my
   own sword nor my own weapon with me, for the king's business required
   haste;" or this, when he was brought to Achish king of Gath, and
   feigned himself mad and frantic, "and changed his countenance before
   them, and slipped down between their hands; and stumbled against the
   doors of the gate and his spittle ran down on his beard;" [942] when
   they were even allowed to enjoy crowds of wives and concubines, and no
   sin was on this account imputed to them, and when moreover they often
   shed the blood of their enemies with their own hand, and this was
   thought not only worthy of no blame, but actually praiseworthy? And all
   these things we see by the light of the gospel are utterly forbidden,
   so that not one of them can be done without great sin and guilt. And in
   the same way we hold that no lie can be employed by any one, I will not
   say rightly, but not even venially, however it may be covered with the
   colour of piety, as the Lord says: "Let your speech be yea, yea, nay,
   nay: but whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one;" and the
   Apostle also agrees with this: "And lie not one to another." [943]

  CHAPTER XIX.

    The answer, that leave to lie, which was not even granted under the old
    Covenant, has rightly been taken by many.

   JOSEPH: All liberty in the matter of wives and many concubines, as the
   end of time is approaching and the multiplying of the human race
   completed, ought rightly to be cut off by evangelical perfection, as
   being no longer necessary. For up to the coming of Christ it was well
   that the blessing of the original sentence should be in full vigour,
   whereby it was said: "Increase and multiply, and fill the earth." [944]
   And therefore it was quite right that from the root of human fecundity
   which happily flourished in the synagogue, in accordance with that
   dispensation of the times, the buds of angelical virginity should
   spring, and the fragrant flowers of continence be produced in the
   Church. But that lying was even then condemned the text of the whole
   Old Testament clearly shows, as it says: "Thou shall destroy all them
   that speak lies;" and again: "The bread of lying is sweet to a man, but
   afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel;" and the Giver of the law
   himself says: "Thou shalt avoid a lie." [945] But we said that it was
   then properly employed as a last resort when some need or plan of
   salvation was linked on to it, on account of which it ought not to be
   condemned. As is the case, which you mentioned, of king David when in
   his flight from the unjust persecution of Saul, to Abimelech the priest
   he used lying words, not with the object of getting any gain nor with
   the desire to injure anybody, but simply to save himself from that most
   iniquitous persecution; inasmuch as he would not stain his hands with
   the blood of the hostile king, so often delivered up to him by God; as
   he said: "The Lord be merciful to me that I may do no such thing to my
   master the Lord's anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is
   the Lord's anointed." [946] And therefore these plans which we hear
   that holy men under the old covenant adopted either from the will of
   God, or for the prefiguring of spiritual mysteries or for the salvation
   of some people, we too cannot refuse altogether, when necessity
   constrains us, as we see that even apostles did not avoid them, where
   the consideration of something profitable required them: which in the
   meanwhile we will for a time postpone, while we first discuss those
   instances which we propose still to bring forward from the Old
   Testament, and afterwards we shall more suitably introduce them so as
   more readily to prove that good and holy men, both in the Old and in
   the New Testament, were entirely at one with each other in these
   contrivances. For what shall we say of that pious fraud of Hushai to
   Absalom for the salvation of king David, which though uttered with all
   appearance of good-will by the deceiver and cheat, and opposed to the
   good of him who asked advice, is yet commended by the authority of Holy
   Scripture, which says: "But by the will of the Lord the profitable
   counsel of Ahithophel was defeated that the Lord might bring evil upon
   Absalom"? [947] Nor could that be blamed which was done for the right
   side with a right purpose and pious intent, and was planned for the
   salvation and victory of one whose piety was pleasing to God, by a holy
   dissimulation. What too shall we say of the deed of that woman, who
   received the men who had been sent to king David by the aforesaid
   Hushai, and hid them in a well, and spread a cloth over its mouth, and
   pretended that she was drying pearl-barley, and said "They passed on
   after tasting a little water"; [948] and by this invention saved them
   from the hands of their pursuers? Wherefore answer me, I pray you, and
   say what you would have done, if any similar situation had arisen for
   you, living now under the gospel; would you prefer to hide them with a
   similar falsehood, saying in the same way: "They passed on after
   tasting a little water," and thus fulfil the command: "Deliver those
   who are being led to death, and spare not to redeem those who are being
   killed;" [949] or by speaking the truth, would you have given up those
   in hiding to the men who would kill them? And what then becomes of the
   Apostle's words: "Let no man seek his own but the things of another:"
   and: "Love seeketh not her own, but the things of others;" and of
   himself he says: "I seek not mine own good but the good of many that
   they may be saved"? [950] For if we seek our own, and want obstinately
   to keep what is good for ourselves, we must even in urgent cases of
   this sort speak the truth, and so become guilty of the death of
   another: but if we prefer what is for another's advantage to our own
   good, and satisfy the demands of the Apostle, we shall certainly have
   to put up with the necessity of lying. And therefore we shall not be
   able to keep a perfect heart of love, or to seek, as Apostolic
   perfection requires, the things of others, unless we relax a little in
   those things which concern the strictness and perfection of our own
   lives, and choose to condescend with ready affection to what is useful
   to others, and so with the Apostle become weak to the weak, that we may
   be able to gain the weak.

  CHAPTER XX.

    How even Apostles thought that a lie was often useful and the truth
    injurious.

   INSTRUCTED by which examples, the blessed Apostle James also, and all
   the chief princes of the primitive Church urged the Apostle Paul in
   consequence of the weakness of feeble persons to condescend to a
   fictitious arrangement and insisted on his purifying himself according
   to the requirements of the law, and shaving his head and paying his
   vows, as they thought that the present harm which would come from this
   hypocrisy was of no account, but had regard rather to the gain which
   would result from his still continued preaching. For the gain to the
   Apostle Paul from his strictness would not have counterbalanced the
   loss to all nations from his speedy death. And this would certainly
   have been then incurred by the whole Church unless this good and
   salutary hypocrisy had preserved him for the preaching of the Gospel.
   For then we may rightly and pardonably acquiesce in the wrong of a lie,
   when, as we said, a greater harm depends on telling the truth, and when
   the good which results to us from speaking the truth cannot
   counterbalance the harm which will be caused by it. And elsewhere the
   blessed Apostle testifies in other words that he himself always
   observed this disposition; for when he says: "To the Jews I became as a
   Jew that I might gain the Jews; to those who were under the law as
   being under the law, though not myself under the law, that I might gain
   those who were under the law; to those who were without law, I became
   as without law, though I was not without the law of God but under the
   law of Christ, that I might gain those who were without law; to the
   weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to
   all men, that I might save all;" [951] what does he show but that
   according to the weakness and the capacity of those who were being
   instructed he always lowered himself and relaxed something of the
   vigour of perfection, and did not cling to what his own strict life
   might seem to demand, but rather preferred that which the good of the
   weak might require? And that we may trace these matters out more
   carefully and recount one by one the glories of the good deeds of the
   Apostles, some one may ask how the blessed Apostle can be proved to
   have suited himself to all men in all things. When did he to the Jews
   become as a Jew? Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in
   his inmost heart the opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians
   saying: "Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ
   shall profit you nothing," [952] yet by circumcising Timothy he adopted
   a shadow as it were of Jewish superstition. And again, where did he
   become to those under the law, as under the law? There certainly where
   James and all the Elders of the Church, fearing lest he might be
   attacked by the multitude of Jewish believers, or rather of Judaizing
   Christians, who had received the faith of Christ in such a way as still
   to be bound by the rites of legal ceremonies, came to his rescue in his
   difficulty with this counsel and advice, and said: "Thou seest,
   brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, who have
   believed, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard of
   thee that thou teachest those Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart
   from Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children;"
   and below: "Do therefore this that we say unto thee: we have four men
   who have a vow on them. These take and sanctify thyself with them and
   bestow on them, that they may shave their heads; and all will know that
   the things which they have heard of thee are false, but that thou
   thyself also walkest keeping the law." [953] And so for the good of
   those who were under the law, he trode under foot for a while the
   strict view which he had expressed: "For I through the law am dead unto
   the law that I may live unto God;" [954] and was driven to shave his
   head, and be purified according to the law and pay his vows after the
   Mosaic rites in the Temple. Do you ask also where for the good of those
   who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he himself became as if
   without law? Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where
   heathen wickedness was flourishing: "As I passed by," he says, "I saw
   your idols and an altar on which was written: To the unknown God;" and
   when he had thus started from their superstition, as if he himself also
   had been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he
   introduced the faith of Christ, saying: "What therefore ye ignorantly
   worship, that declare I unto you." And after a little, as if he had
   known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a
   verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or Christ,
   saying: "As some also of your own poets have said: for we are also His
   offspring." And when he had thus approached them with their own
   authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by
   things false, he added and said: "Since then we are the offspring of
   God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or
   stone sculptured by the art and device of man." [955] But to the weak
   he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed
   those who could not contain themselves to return together again, [956]
   or when he fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says
   that he was with them in weakness and fear and much trembling. [957]
   But he became all things to all men that he might save all, when he
   says: "He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let
   not him that eateth not judge him that eateth:" and: "He that giveth
   his virgin in marriage doeth well, and he that giveth her not in
   marriage doeth better;" and elsewhere: "Who," says he, "is weak, and I
   am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?" and in this way he
   fulfilled what he had commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: "Be
   ye without offence to Jews and Greeks and the Church of Christ, as I
   also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit but that
   of the many, that they may be saved." [958] For it had certainly been
   profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his head, not to
   undergo Jewish purification, not to practice going barefoot, [959] not
   to pay legal vows; but he did all these things because he did not seek
   his own profit but that of the many. And although this was done with
   the full consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation.
   For one who through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might
   live to God, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law
   in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ,
   could not with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law;
   nor is it right to believe that he who had said: "For if I again
   rebuild what I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor," [960]
   would himself fall into what he had condemned. And to such an extent is
   account taken, not so much of the actual thing which is done as of the
   disposition of the doer, that on the other hand truth is sometimes
   found to have injured some, and a lie to have done them good. For when
   Saul was grumbling to his servants about David's flight, and saying:
   "Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards, and make you
   all tribunes and centurions: that all of you have conspired against me,
   and there is no one to inform me," did Doeg the Edomite say anything
   but the truth, when he told him: "I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with
   Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, who consulted the Lord for him,
   and gave him victuals, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the
   Philistine"? [961] For which true story he deserved to be rooted up out
   of the land of the living, and it is said of him by the prophet:
   "Wherefore God shall destroy thee forever, and pluck thee up and tear
   thee out of thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the living:"
   [962] He then for showing the truth is forever plucked and rooted up
   out of that land in which the harlot Rahab with her family is planted
   for her lie: just as also we remember that Samson most injuriously
   betrayed to his wicked wife the truth which he had hidden for a long
   time by a lie, and therefore the truth so inconsiderately disclosed was
   the cause of his own deception, because he had neglected to keep the
   command of the prophet: "Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that
   sleepeth in thy bosom." [963]

  CHAPTER XXI.

    Whether secret abstinence ought to be made known, without telling a lie
    about it, to those who ask, and whether what has once been declined may be
    taken in hand.

   AND to bring forward some instances from our unavoidable and almost
   daily wants which with all our care we can never so guard against as
   not to be driven to incur them whether with or against our will: what,
   I ask you, is to be done when, while we are proposing to put off our
   supper, a brother comes and asks us if we have had it: is our fast to
   be concealed, and the good act of abstinence hidden, or is it to be
   proclaimed by telling the truth? If we conceal it, to satisfy the
   Lord's command which says: "Thou shalt not appear unto men to fast but
   unto thy Father Who is in secret;" and again: "Let not thy left hand
   know what thy right hand doeth," [964] we must at once tell a lie. If
   we make manifest the good act of abstinence, the word of the gospel
   rightly discourages us: "Verily I say unto you, they have their
   reward." [965] But what if any one has refused with determination a cup
   offered to him by some brother, denying altogether that he will take
   what the other, rejoicing at his arrival, begs and intreats him to
   receive? Is it right that he should force himself to yield to his
   brother who goes on his knees and bows himself to the ground, and who
   thinks that he can only show his loving heart by this service, or
   should he obstinately cling to his own word and intention?

  CHAPTER XXII.

    An objection, that abstinence ought to be concealed, but that things that
    have been declined should not be received.

   GERMANUS: In the former instance we think there can be no doubt that it
   is better for our abstinence to be hidden than for it to be displayed
   to the inquirers, and in cases of this sort we also admit that a lie is
   unavoidable. But in the second there is no need for us to tell a lie,
   first because we can refuse what is offered by the service of a brother
   in such a way as to bind ourselves in no bond of determination, and
   next because when we once refuse we can keep our opinion unchanged.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    The answer that obstinacy in this decision is unreasonable.

   JOSEPH: There is no doubt that these are the decisions of those
   monasteries in which the infancy of your renunciation was, as you tell
   us, trained, as their leaders are accustomed to prefer their own will
   to their brother's supper, and most obstinately stick to what they have
   once intended. But our Elders, to whose faith the signs of Apostolical
   powers have borne witness, and who have treated everything with
   judgment and discretion of spirit rather than with stiff obstinacy of
   mind, have laid down that those men who give in to the infirmities of
   others, receive much richer fruits than those who persist in their
   determinations, and have declared that it is a better deed to conceal
   abstinence, as was said, by this needful and humble lie, rather than to
   display it with a proud show of truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    How Abbot Piamun chose to hide his abstinence.

   FINALLY Abbot Piamun [966] after twenty-five years did not hesitate to
   receive some grapes and wine offered to him by a certain brother, and
   at once preferred, against his rule, to taste what was brought him
   rather than to display his abstinence which was a secret from
   everybody. For if we would also bear in mind what we remember that our
   Elders always did, who used to conceal the marvels of their own good
   deeds, and their own acts, which they were obliged to bring forward in
   Conference for the instruction of the juniors, under cover of other
   persons, what else can we consider them but an open lie? And O that we
   too had anything worthy which we could bring forward for stirring up
   the faith of the juniors! Certainly we should have no scruples in
   following their fictions of that kind. For it is better under the
   colour of a figure like that to tell a lie than for the sake of
   maintaining that unreasonable truthfulness either hide in ill-advised
   silence what might be edifying to the hearers, or run into the display
   of an objectionable vanity by telling them truthfully in our own
   character. And the teacher of the Gentiles clearly teaches us the same
   lesson by his teaching, as he chose to bring forward the great
   revelations made to him, under the character of some one else, saying:
   "I know a man in Christ, whether in the body or out of the body I
   cannot tell, God knoweth, caught up even unto the third heaven: and I
   know such a man, that he was caught up into paradise and heard
   unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for man to utter." [967]

  CHAPTER XXV.

    The evidence of Scripture on changes of determination.

   IT is impossible for us briefly to run through everything. For who
   could count up almost all the patriarchs and numberless saints, some of
   whom for the preservation of life, others out of desire for a blessing,
   others out of pity, others to conceal some secret, others out of zeal
   for God, others in searching for the truth, became, so to speak,
   patrons of lying? And as all cannot be enumerated, so all ought not to
   be altogether passed over. For piety forced the blessed Joseph to raise
   a false charge against his brethren even with an oath by the life of
   the king, saying: "Ye are spies: to see the nakedness of the land are
   ye come;" and below: "send," says he, "one of you, and bring your
   brothers hither: but ye shall be kept here until your words are made
   manifest whether ye speak the truth or no: but if not, by the life of
   Pharaoh, ye are spies." [968] For if he had not out of pity alarmed
   them by this lie, he would not have been able to see again his father
   and his brother, nor to preserve them in their great danger of
   starvation, nor to free the conscience of his brethren from the guilt
   of selling him. The act then of striking his brethren with fear by
   means of a lie was not so reprehensible as was it a holy and laudable
   act to urge his enemies and seekers to a salutary penitence by means of
   a feigned danger. Finally when they were weighed down by the odium of
   the very serious accusation, they were conscience-stricken not at the
   charge falsely raised against them, but at the thought of their earlier
   crime, and said to one another: "We suffer this rightly because we
   sinned against our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when
   he asked us and we did not hearken to him: wherefore all this trouble
   hath come upon us." [969] And this confession, we think, expiated by
   most salutary humility their terrible sin not only against their
   brother, against whom they had sinned with wicked cruelty, but also
   against God. What about Solomon, who in his first judgment manifested
   the gift of wisdom, which he had received of God, only by making use of
   falsehood? For in order to get at the truth which was hidden by the
   woman's lie, even he used the help of a lie most cunningly invented,
   saying: "Bring me a sword and divide the living child into two parts,
   and give the one half to the one and the other half to the other." And
   when this pretended cruelty stirred the heart of the true mother, but
   was received with approval by her who was not the true mother, then at
   last by this most sagacious discovery of the truth he pronounced the
   judgment which every one has felt to have been inspired by God, saying:
   "Give her the living child and slay it not: she is the mother of it."
   [970] Further we are more fully taught by other passages of Scripture
   as well that we neither can nor should carry out everything which we
   determine either with peace or disturbance of mind, as we often hear
   that holy men and angels and even Almighty God Himself have changed
   what they had decided upon. For the blessed David determined and
   confirmed it by an oath, saying: "May God do so and add more to the
   foes of David if I leave of all that belong unto Nabal until the
   morning a single male." And presently when Abigail his wife interceded
   and intreated for him, he gave up his threats, lightened the sentence,
   and preferred to be regarded as a breaker of his word rather than to
   keep his pledged oath by cruelly executing it, saying: "As the Lord
   liveth, if thou hadst not quickly come to meet me there had not been
   left to Nabal by the morning light a single male." [971] And as we do
   not hold that his readiness to take a rash oath (which resulted from
   his anger and disturbance of mind) ought to be copied by us, so we do
   think that the pardon and revision of his determination is to be
   followed. The "chosen vessel," in writing to the Corinthians, promises
   unconditionally to return, saying: "But I will come to you when I pass
   through Macedonia: for I will pass through Macedonia. But I will stay
   or even pass the winter with you that you may conduct me whithersoever
   I shall go. For I do not want only to see you in passing: for I hope to
   stay with you for some time." [972] And this fact he remembers in the
   Second Epistle, thus: "And in this confidence I was minded first to
   come unto you, that ye might receive a second favour, and by you to
   pass into Macedonia and again to come to you from Macedonia and by you
   be conducted to Judæa." But a better plan suggested itself and he
   plainly admits that he is not going to fulfil what he had promised.
   "When then," says he, "I purposed this, did I use light-mindedness? or
   the things that I think, do I think after the flesh, that there should
   be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay?" Lastly, he declares even with the
   affirmation of an oath, why it was that he preferred to put on one side
   his pledged word rather than by his presence to bring a burden and
   grief to his disciples: "But I call God to witness against my soul that
   it was to spare you that I came not as far as Corinth. For I determined
   this with myself that I would not come unto you in sorrow." [973]
   Though when the angels had refused to enter the house of Lot at Sodom,
   saying to him: "We will not enter but will remain in the street," they
   were presently forced by his prayers to change their determination, as
   Scripture subjoins: "And Lot constrained them, and they turned in to
   him." [974] And certainly if they knew that they would turn in to him,
   they refused his request with a sham excuse: but if their excuse was a
   real one, then they are clearly shown to have changed their mind. And
   certainly we hold that the Holy Spirit inserted this in the sacred
   volume for no other reason but to teach us by their examples that we
   ought not to cling obstinately to our own determinations, but to
   subject them to our will, and so to keep our judgment free from all the
   chains of law that it may be ready to follow the call of good counsel
   in any direction, and may not delay or refuse to pass without any delay
   to whatever a sound discretion may find to be the better choice. And to
   rise to still higher instances, when king Hezekiah was lying on his bed
   and afflicted with grievous sickness the prophet Isaiah addressed him
   in the person of God, and said: "Thus saith the Lord: set thine house
   in order for thou shall die and not live. And Hezekiah," it says,
   "turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord and said: I beseech
   thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before Thee in truth and with
   a perfect heart, and how I have done what was right in Thy sight. And
   Hezekiah wept sore." After which it was again said to him: "Go, return,
   and speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Thus saith the Lord God of
   David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: and
   behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years: and I will deliver thee
   out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this
   city for thy sake and for my servant David's sake." [975] What can be
   clearer than this proof that out of consideration for mercy and
   goodness the Lord would rather break His word and instead of the
   pre-arranged limit of death extend the life of him who prayed, for
   fifteen years, rather than be found inexorable because of His
   unchangeable decree? In the same way too the Divine sentence says to
   the men of Nineveh: "Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown;"
   [976] and presently this stern and abrupt sentence is softened by their
   penitence and fasting, and is turned to the side of mercy with goodness
   that is easy to be intreated. But if any one maintains that the Lord
   had threatened the destruction of their city (while He foreknew that
   they would be converted) for this reason, that He might incite them to
   a salutary penitence, it follows that those who are set over their
   brethren may, if need arises, without any blame for telling lies,
   threaten those who need improvement with severer treatment than they
   are really going to inflict. But if one says that God revoked that
   severe sentence in consideration of their penitence, according to what
   he says by Ezekiel: "If I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: and
   he becomes penitent for his sin, and doeth judgment and justice, he
   shall surely live, he shall not die;" [977] we are similarly taught
   that we ought not obstinately to stick to our determination, but that
   we should with gentle pity soften down the threats which necessity
   called forth. And that we may not fancy that the Lord granted this
   specially to the Ninevites, He continually affirms by Jeremiah that He
   will do the same in general towards all, and promises that without
   delay He will change His sentence in accordance with our deserts;
   saying: "I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom
   to root out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation repent
   of the evil, which I have spoken against it, I also will repent of the
   evil which I thought to do to them. And I will suddenly speak of a
   nation and a kingdom, to build up and to plant it. If it shall do evil
   in My sight, that it obey not My voice: I will repent of the good that
   I thought to do to it." To Ezekiel also: "Leave out not a word, if so
   be they will hearken and be converted every one from his evil way: that
   I may repent Me of the evil that I thought to do to them for the
   wickedness of their doings." [978] And by these passages it is declared
   that we ought not obstinately to stick to our decisions, but to modify
   them with reason and judgment, and that better courses should always be
   adopted and preferred, and that we should turn without any delay to
   that course which is considered the more profitable. For this above all
   that invaluable sentence teaches us, because though each man's end is
   known beforehand to Him before his birth, yet somehow He so orders all
   things by a plan and method for all, and with regard to man's
   disposition, that He decides on everything not by the mere exercise of
   His power, nor according to the ineffable knowledge which His
   Prescience possesses, but according to the present actions of men, and
   rejects or draws to Himself each one, and daily either grants or
   withholds His grace. And that this is so the election of Saul also
   shows us, of whose miserable end the foreknowledge of God certainly
   could not be ignorant, and yet He chose him out of so many thousands of
   Israel and anointed him king, rewarding the then existing merits of his
   life, and not considering the sin of his coming fall, so that after he
   became reprobate, God complains almost in human terms and, with man's
   feelings, as if He repented of his choice, saying: "It repenteth Me
   that I have appointed Saul king: for he hath forsaken Me, and hath not
   performed My words;" and again: "But Samuel was grieved for Saul
   because the Lord repented that He had made Saul king over Israel."
   [979] Finally this that He afterwards executed, that the Lord also
   declares by the prophet Ezekiel that He will by His daily judgment do
   with all men, saying: "Yea, if I shall say to the righteous that he
   shall surely live, and he trusting in his righteousness commit
   iniquity: all his righteousness shall be forgotten, and in his iniquity
   which he hath committed, in the same he shall die. And if I shall say
   to the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and if he repent of his sin and
   do judgment and righteousness, and if that wicked man restore the
   pledge and render what he hath robbed, and walk in the commandments of
   life, and do no righteous thing, he shall surely live, he shall not
   die. None of his sins which he hath committed shall be imputed unto
   him." [980] Finally, when the Lord would for their speedy fall turn
   away His merciful countenance from the people, whom He had chosen out
   of all nations, the giver of the law interposes on their behalf and
   cries out: "I beseech Thee, O Lord, this people have sinned a great
   sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold; and now if Thou
   forgivest their sin, forgive it; but if not, blot me out of Thy book
   which Thou hast written. To whom the Lord answered: If any man hath
   sinned before Me, I will blot him out of My book." [981] David also,
   when complaining in prophetic spirit of Judas and the Lord's
   persecutors, says: "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;"
   and because they did not deserve to come to saving penitence because of
   the guilt of their great sin, he subjoins: "And let them not be written
   among the righteous." [982] Finally in the case of Judas himself the
   meaning of the prophetic curse was clearly fulfilled, for when his
   deadly sin as completed, he killed himself by hanging, that he might
   not after his name was blotted out be converted and repent and deserve
   to be once more written among the righteous in heaven. We must
   therefore not doubt that at the time when he was chosen by Christ and
   obtained a place in the Apostolate, the name of Judas was written in
   the book of the living, and that he heard as well as the rest the
   words: "Rejoice not because the devils are subject unto you, but
   rejoice because your names are written in heaven." [983] But because he
   was corrupted by the plague of covetousness and had his name struck out
   from that heavenly list, it is suitably said of him and of men like him
   by the prophet: "O Lord, let all those that forsake Thee be confounded.
   Let them that depart from Thee be written in the earth, because they
   have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters." And elsewhere:
   "They shall not be in the counsel of My people, nor shall they be
   written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter
   into the land of Israel." [984]

  CHAPTER XXVI.

    How saintly men cannot be hard and obstinate.

   NOR must we omit the value of that command because even if we have
   bound ourselves by some oath under the influence of anger or some other
   passion, (a thing which ought never to be done by a monk) still the
   case for each side should be weighed by a thorough judgment of the
   mind, and the course on which we have determined should be compared to
   that which we are urged to adopt, and we should without hesitation
   adopt that which on the occurrence of sounder considerations is decided
   to be the best. For it is better to put our promise on one side than to
   undergo the loss of something good and more desirable. Finally we never
   remember that venerable and approved fathers were hard and unyielding
   in decisions of this sort, but as wax under the influence of heat, so
   they were modified by reason, and when sounder counsels prevailed, did
   not hesitate to give in to the better side. But those whom we have seen
   obstinately clinging to their determinations we have always set down as
   unreasonable and wanting in judgment.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVII.

    A question whether the saying: "I have sworn and am purposed" is opposed to
    the view given above.

   GERMANUS: So far as this consideration is concerned which has been
   clearly and fully treated of, a monk ought never to determine anything
   for fear lest he turn out a breaker of his word or else obstinate. And
   what then can we make of this saying of the Psalmist: "I have sworn and
   am purposed to keep Thy righteous judgments"? [985] What is "to swear
   and purpose" except to keep one's determinations fixedly?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [985] Ps. 118 (119):106.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVIII.

    The answer telling in what cases the determination is to be kept fixedly,
    and in what cases it may be broken if need be.

   JOSEPH: We do not lay this down with regard to those fundamental
   commands, without which our salvation cannot in any way exist, but with
   regard to those which we can either relax or hold fast to without
   endangering our state, as for instance, an unbroken and strict fast, or
   total abstinence from wine or oil, or entire prohibition to leave one's
   cell, or incessant attention to reading and meditation, all of which
   can be practised at pleasure, without damage to our profession and
   purpose, and, if need be, can be given up without blame. But we must
   most resolutely make up our minds to observe those fundamental
   commands, and not even, if need arise, to avoid death in their cause,
   with regard to which we must immovably assert: "I have sworn and am
   purposed." And this should be done for the preservation of love, for
   which all things else should be disregarded lest the beauty and
   perfection of its calm should suffer a stain. In the same way we must
   swear for the purity of our chastity, and we ought to do the same for
   faith, and sobriety and justice, to all of which we must cling with
   unchangeable persistence, and to forsake which even for a little is
   worthy of blame. But in the case of those bodily exercises, which are
   said to be profitable for a little, [986] we must, as we said, decide
   in such a way that, if there occurs any more decided opportunity for a
   good act, which would lead us to relax them, we need not be bound by
   any rule about them, but may give them up and freely adopt what is more
   useful. For in the case of those bodily exercises, if they are dropped
   for a time, there is no danger: but to have given up these others even
   for a moment is deadly.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [986] Cf. 1 Tim. 4:8.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIX.

    How we ought to do those things which are to be kept secret.

   YOU must also provide with the same care that if by chance some word
   has slipped out of your mouth which you want to be a secret, no
   injunction to secrecy may trouble the hearer. For it will be more
   likely to be unheeded if it is let pass carelessly and simply, because
   the brother, whoever he is, will not be tormented with such a
   temptation to divulge it, as he will take it as something trivial
   dropped in casual conversation, and as what is for this very reason of
   less account, because it was not committed to the hearer's mind with a
   strict injunction to silence. For even if you bind his faith by
   exacting an oath from him, you need not doubt that it will very soon be
   divulged; for a fiercer assault of the devil's power will be made upon
   him, both to annoy and betray you, and to make him break his oath as
   quickly as possible.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXX.

    That no determination should be made on those things which concern the needs
    of the common life.

   AND therefore a monk ought not hastily to make any promise on those
   things which merely concern bodily exercise, for fear lest he may stir
   up the enemy still more to attack what he is keeping as it were under
   the observance of the law, and so he may be more readily compelled to
   break it. Since every one who lives under the grace of liberty, and
   sets himself a law, thereby binds himself in a dangerous slavery, so
   that if by chance necessity constrains him to do what he might have
   ventured on lawfully, and indeed laudably and with thanksgiving, he is
   forced to act as a transgressor, and to fall into sin: "for where there
   is no law there is no transgression." [987]

   By this instruction and the teaching of the blessed Joseph we were
   confirmed as by a Divine oracle and made up our minds to stop in Egypt.
   But though henceforward we were but a little anxious about our promise,
   yet when seven years were over we were very glad to fulfil it. For we
   hastened to our monastery, at a time when we were confident of
   obtaining permission to return to the desert, and first paid our
   respects properly to our Elders; next we revived the former love in
   their minds as out of the ardour of their love they had not been at all
   softened by our very frequent letters to satisfy them, and in the last
   place, we entirely removed the sting of our broken promise and returned
   to the recesses of the desert of Scete, as they themselves forwarded us
   with joy.

   This learning and doctrine of the illustrious fathers, our ignorance, O
   holy brother, has to the best of its ability made plain to you. And if
   perhaps our clumsy style has confused it instead of setting it in
   order, I trust that the blame which our clumsiness deserves will not
   interfere with the praise due to these grand men. Since it seemed to us
   a safer course in the sight of our Judge to state even in unadorned
   style this splendid doctrine rather than to hold our tongues about it,
   since if he considers the grandeur of the thoughts, the fact that the
   awkwardness of our style annoys him, need not be prejudicial to the
   profit of the reader, and for our part we are more anxious about its
   usefulness than its being praised. This at least I charge all those
   into whose hand this little book may fall; viz., that they must know
   that whatever in it pleases them belongs to the fathers, and whatever
   they dislike is all our own. [988]

  PREFACE



   WHEN by the help of the grace of Christ I had published ten Conferences
   of the Fathers, which were composed at the urgent request of the most
   blessed Helladius and Leontius, I dedicated seven others to Honoratus a
   Bishop blessed in name as well as merits, and also to that holy servant
   of Christ, Eucherius. The same number also I have thought good to
   dedicate now to you, O holy brothers, Jovinianus, Minervius, Leontius,
   and Theodore. [989] Since the last named of you founded that holy and
   splendid monastic rule in the province of Gaul, with the strictness of
   ancient virtue, while the rest of you by your instructions have stirred
   up monks not only before all to seek the common life of the coenobia,
   but even to thirst eagerly for the sublime life of the anchorite. For
   those Conferences of the best of the fathers are arranged with such
   care, and so carefully considered in all respects, that they are suited
   to both modes of life whereby you have made not only the countries of
   the West, but even the isles to flourish with great crowds of brethren;
   i.e., I mean that not only those who still remain in congregations with
   praiseworthy subjection to rule, but those also who retire to no great
   distance from your monasteries, and try to carry out the rule of
   anchorites, may be more fully instructed, according as the nature of
   the place and the character of their condition may require. And to this
   your previous efforts and labours have especially contributed this,
   that, as they are already prepared and practised in these exercises,
   they can more readily receive the precepts and institutes of the
   Elders, and receiving into their cells the authors of the Conferences
   together with the actual volumes of the Conferences and talking with
   them after a fashion by daily questions and answers, they may not be
   left to their own resources to find that way which is difficult and
   almost unknown in this country, but full of danger even there where
   well-known paths and numberless instances of those who have gone before
   are not wanting, but may rather learn to follow the rule of the
   anchorite's life taught by their examples, whom ancient tradition and
   industry and long experience have thoroughly instructed.

CONFERENCE OF ABBOT PIAMUN.

ON THE THREE SORTS OF MONKS.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    How we came to Diolcos and were received by Abbot Piamun. [990]

   AFTER visiting and conversing with those three Elders, whose
   Conferences we have at the instance of our brother Eucherius tried to
   describe, as we were still more ardently desirous to seek out the
   further parts of Egypt, in which a larger and more perfect company of
   saints dwelt, we came--urged not so much by the necessities of our
   journey as by the desire of visiting the saints who were dwelling
   there--to a village named Diolcos, [991] lying on one of the seven
   mouths of the river Nile. For when we heard of very many and very
   celebrated monasteries founded by the ancient fathers, like most eager
   merchants, at once we undertook the journey on an uncertain quest,
   urged on by the hope of greater gain. And when we wandered about there
   for some long time and fixed our curious eyes on those mountains of
   virtue conspicuous for their lofty height, the gaze of those around
   first singled out Abbot Piamun, the senior of all the anchorites living
   there and their presbyter, as if he were some tall lighthouse. For he
   was set on the top of a high mountain like that city in the gospel,
   [992] and at once shed his light on our faces, whose virtues and
   miracles, which were wrought by him under our very eyes, Divine Grace
   thus bearing witness to his excellence, if we are not to exceed the
   plan and limits of this volume, we feel we must pass over in silence.
   For we promised to commit to memory what we could recollect, not of the
   miracles of God, but of the institutes and pursuits of the saints, so
   as to supply our readers merely with necessary instruction for the
   perfect life, and not with matter for idle and useless admiration
   without any correction of their faults. And so when Abbot Piamun had
   received us with welcome, and had refreshed us with becoming kindness,
   as he understood that we were not of the same country, he first asked
   us anxiously whence or why we had visited Egypt, and when he discovered
   that we had come thither from a monastery in Syria out of desire for
   perfection he began as follows: --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [990] Piamun, who has already been spoken of in XVII. xxiv., is also
   mentioned by Rufinus (History of the Monks, c. xxxii), Palladius (the
   Lausiac History, clxxii.), and Sozomen (H. E. VI. xxix.), all of whom
   tell, with slight variation, the same story, how that one day while he
   was officiating at the altar, he saw an angel writing down the names of
   some of the brethren, and passing by the names of others, all of whom
   Piamun on subsequent inquiry found to have been guilty of some grievous
   sin.

   [991] On Diolcos see [note] on the Institutes V. xxxvi.

   [992] Cf. S. Matt. 5:14.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    The words of Abbot Piamun, how monks who were novices ought to be taught by
    the example of their elders.

   WHATEVER man, my children, is desirous to attain skill in any art,
   unless he gives himself up with the utmost pains and carefulness to the
   study of that system which he is anxious to learn, and observes the
   rules and orders of the best masters of that work or science, is
   indulging in a vain hope to reach by idle wishes any similarity to
   those whose pains and diligence he avoids copying. For we know that
   some have come from your country to these parts, only to go round the
   monasteries for the sake of getting to know the brethren, not meaning
   to adopt the rules and regulations, for the sake of which they
   travelled hither, nor to retire to the cells and aim at carrying out in
   action what they had learnt by sight or by teaching. And these people
   retained their character and pursuits to which they had grown
   accustomed, and, as is thrown in their teeth by some, are held to have
   changed their country not for the sake of their profit, but owing to
   the need of escaping want. For in the obstinacy of their stubborn mind,
   they not only could learn nothing, but actually would not stay any
   longer in these parts. For if they changed neither their method of
   fasting, nor their scheme of Psalms, nor even the fashion of their
   garments, what else could we think that they were after in this
   country, except only the supply of their victuals.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    How the juniors ought not to discuss the orders of the seniors.

   WHEREFORE if, as we believe, the cause of God has drawn you to try to
   copy our knowledge, you must utterly ignore all the rules by which your
   early beginnings were trained, and must with all humility follow
   whatever you see our Elders do or teach. And do not be troubled or
   drawn away and diverted from imitating it, even if for the moment the
   cause or reason of any deed or action is not clear to you, because if
   men have good and simple ideas on all things and are anxious faithfully
   to copy whatever they see taught or done by their Elders, instead of
   discussing it, then the knowledge of all things will follow through
   experience of the work. But he will never enter into the reason of the
   truth, who begins to learn by discussion, because as the enemy sees
   that he trusts to his own judgment rather than to that of the fathers'
   he easily urges him on so far till those things which are especially
   useful and helpful seem to him unnecessary or injurious, and the crafty
   foe so plays upon his presumption, that by obstinately clinging to his
   own opinion he persuades himself that only that is holy, which he
   himself in his pig-headed error thinks to be good and right.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    Of the three sorts of monks which there are in Egypt.

   WHEREFORE you should first hear how or whence the system and beginning
   of our order took its rise. For only then can a man at all effectually
   be trained in any art he may wish, and be urged on to practise it
   diligently, when he has learnt the glory of its authors and founders.
   There are three kinds of monks in Egypt, of which two are admirable,
   the third is a poor sort of thing and by all means to be avoided. The
   first is that of the coenobites, who live together in a congregation
   and are governed by the direction of a single Elder: and of this kind
   there is the largest number of monks dwelling throughout the whole of
   Egypt. The second is that of the anchorites, who were first trained in
   the coenobium and then being made perfect in practical life chose the
   recesses of the desert: and in this order we also hope to gain a place.
   The third is the reprehensible one of the Sarabaites. [993] And of
   these we will discourse more fully one by one in order. Of these three
   orders then you ought, as we said, first to know about the founders.
   For at once from this there may arise either a hatred for the order
   which is to be avoided, or a longing for that which is to be followed,
   because each way is sure to carry the man who follows it, to that end
   which its author and discoverer has reached.

  CHAPTER V.

    Of the founders who originated the order of coenobites.

   AND so the system of coenobites took its rise in the days of the
   preaching of the Apostles. For such was all that multitude of believers
   in Jerusalem, which is thus described in the Acts of the Apostles: "But
   the multitude of believers was of one heart and one soul, neither said
   any of them that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but
   they had all things common. They sold their possessions and property
   and divided them to all, as any man had need." And again: "For neither
   was there any among them that lacked; for as many as possessed fields
   or houses, sold them and brought the price of the things that they sold
   and laid them before the feet of the Apostles: and distribution was
   made to every man as he had need." [994] The whole Church, I say, was
   then such as now are those few who can be found with difficulty in
   coenobia. But when at the death of the Apostles the multitude of
   believers began to wax cold, and especially that multitude which had
   come to the faith of Christ from diverse foreign nations, from whom the
   Apostles out of consideration for the infancy of their faith and their
   ingrained heathen habits, required nothing more than that they should
   "abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from fornication, and from
   things strangled, and from blood," [995] and so that liberty which was
   conceded to the Gentiles because of the weakness of their newly-born
   faith, had by degrees begun to mar the perfection of that Church which
   existed at Jerusalem, and the fervour of that early faith cooled down
   owing to the daily increasing number both of natives and foreigners,
   and not only those who had accepted the faith of Christ, but even those
   who were the leaders of the Church relaxed somewhat of that strictness.
   For some fancying that what they saw permitted to the Gentiles because
   of their weakness, was also allowable for themselves, thought that they
   would suffer no loss if they followed the faith and confession of
   Christ keeping their property and possessions. But those who still
   maintained the fervour of the apostles, mindful of that former
   perfection left their cities and intercourse with those who thought
   that carelessness and a laxer life was permissible to themselves and
   the Church of God, and began to live in rural and more sequestered
   spots, and there, in private and on their own account, to practise
   those things which they had learnt to have been ordered by the apostles
   throughout the whole body of the Church in general: and so that whole
   system of which we have spoken grew up from those disciples who had
   separated themselves from the evil that was spreading. And these, as by
   degrees time went on, were separated from the great mass of believers
   and because they abstained from marriage and cut themselves off from
   intercourse with their kinsmen and the life of this world, were termed
   monks or solitaries from the strictness of their lonely and solitary
   life. Whence it followed that from their common life they were called
   coenobites and their cells and lodgings coenobia. That then alone was
   the earliest kind of monks, which is first not only in time but also in
   grace, and which continued unbroken for a very long period up to the
   time of Abbot Paul and Antony; and even to this day we see its traces
   remaining in strict coenobia.

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of the system of the Anchorites and its beginning.

   OUT of this number of the perfect, and, if I may use the expression,
   this most fruitful root of saints, were produced afterwards the flowers
   and fruits of the anchorites as well. And of this order we have heard
   that the originators were those whom we mentioned just now; viz., Saint
   Paul [996] and Antony, men who frequented the recesses of the desert,
   not as some from faintheartedness, and the evil of impatience, but from
   a desire for loftier heights of perfection and divine contemplation,
   although the former of them is said to have found his way to the desert
   by reason of necessity, while during the time of persecution he was
   avoiding the plots of his neighbours. So then there sprang from that
   system of which we have spoken another sort of perfection, whose
   followers are rightly termed anchorites; i.e., withdrawers, because,
   being by no means satisfied with that victory whereby they had trodden
   under foot the hidden snares of the devil, while still living among
   men, they were eager to fight with the devils in open conflict, and a
   straightforward battle, and so feared not to penetrate the vast
   recesses of the desert, imitating, to wit, John the Baptist, who passed
   all his life in the desert, and Elijah and Elisha and those of whom the
   Apostle speaks as follows: "They wandered about in sheepskins and
   goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted, of whom the world was
   not worthy, wandering in deserts, in mountains and in dens and in caves
   of the earth." Of whom too the Lord speaks figuratively to Job: "But
   who hath sent out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his bands? To
   whom I have given the wilderness for an house, and a barren land for
   his dwelling. He scorneth the multitude of the city and heareth not the
   cry of the driver; he looketh round about the mountains of his pasture,
   and seeketh for every green thing." In the Psalms also: "Let now the
   redeemed of the Lord say, those whom He hath redeemed from the hand of
   the enemy;" and after a little: "They wandered in a wilderness in a
   place without water: they found not the way of a city of habitation.
   They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them. And they
   cried unto the Lord in their trouble and He delivered them out of their
   distress;" whom Jeremiah too describes as follows: "Blessed is the man
   that hath borne the yoke from his youth. He shall sit solitary and hold
   his peace because he hath taken it up upon himself," and there sing in
   heart and deed these words of the Psalmist: "I am become like a pelican
   in the wilderness. I watched and am become like a sparrow alone upon
   the house-top." [997]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [996] Paul was from very early days celebrated as the first of the
   anchorites. Indeed, S. Jerome, who wrote his life (Works, Vol. ii. p.
   13 ed. Migne) calls him "auctor vitæ monasticæ" (Ep. xxii. ad
   Eustochium). He is said to have fled to the Thebaid from the terrors of
   the Decian persecution, and to have died there in extreme old age.
   Antony has already been several times mentioned by Cassian. See the
   Institutes V. iv.; Conference II. ii.; III. iv., etc.

  CHAPTER VII.

    Of the origin of the Sarabaites and their mode of life.

   AND while the Christian religion was rejoicing in these two orders of
   monks though this system had begun by degrees to deteriorate, there
   arose afterwards that disgusting and unfaithful kind of monks; or
   rather, that baleful plant revived and sprang up again which when it
   first shot up in the persons of Ananias and Sapphira in the early
   Church was cut off by the severity of the Apostle Peter--a kind which
   among monks has been for a long while considered detestable and
   execrable, and which was adopted by no one any more, so long as there
   remained stamped on the memory of the faithful the dread of that very
   severe sentence, in which the blessed Apostle not merely refused to
   allow the aforesaid originators of the novel crime to be cured by
   penitence or any amends, but actually destroyed that most dangerous
   germ by their speedy death. When then that precedent, which was
   punished with Apostolical severity in the case of Ananias and Sapphira
   had by degrees faded from the minds of some, owing to long carelessness
   and forgetfulness from lapse of time, there arose the race of
   Sarabaites, who owing to the fact that they have broken away from the
   congregations of the coenobites and each look after their own affairs,
   are rightly named in the Egyptian language Sarabaites, [998] and these
   spring from the number of those, whom we have mentioned, who wanted to
   imitate rather than truly to aim at Evangelical perfection, urged
   thereto by rivalry or by the praises of those who preferred the
   complete poverty of Christ to all manner of riches. These then while in
   their feeble mind they make a pretence of the greatest goodness and are
   forced by necessity to join this order, while they are anxious to be
   reckoned by the name of monks without emulating their pursuits, in no
   sort of way practise discipline, or are subject to the will of the
   Elders, or, taught by their traditions, learn to govern their own wills
   or take up and properly learn any rule of sound discretion; but making
   their renunciation only as a public profession, i.e., before the face
   of men, either continue in their homes devoted to the same occupations
   as before, though dignified by this title, or building cells for
   themselves and calling them monasteries remain in them perfectly free
   and their own masters, never submitting to the precepts of the gospel,
   which forbid them to be busied with any anxiety for the day's food, or
   troubles about domestic matters: commands which those alone fulfil with
   no unbelieving doubt, who have freed themselves from all the goods of
   this world and subjected themselves to the superiors of the coenobia so
   that they cannot admit that they are at all their own masters. But
   those who, as we said, shirk the severity of the monastery, and live
   two or three together in their cells, not satisfied to be under the
   charge and rule of an Abbot, but arranging chiefly for this; viz., that
   they may get rid of the yoke of the Elders and have liberty to carry
   out their wishes and go and wander where they will, and do what they
   like, these men are more taken up both day and night in daily business
   than those who live in the coenobia, but not with the same faith and
   purpose. For these Sarabaites do it not to submit the fruits of their
   labours to the will of the steward, but to procure money to lay by. And
   see what a difference there is between them. For the others think
   nothing of the morrow, and offer to God the most acceptable fruits of
   their toil: while these extend their faithless anxiety not only to the
   morrow, but even to the space of many years, and so fancy that God is
   either false or impotent as He either could not or would not grant them
   the promised supply of food and clothing. The one seek this in all
   their prayers; viz., that they may gain akthmosunhn, i.e., the
   deprivation of all things, and lasting poverty: the other that they may
   secure a rich quantity of all sorts of supplies. The one eagerly strive
   to go beyond the fixed rule of daily work that whatever is not wanted
   for the sacred purposes of the monastery, may be distributed at the
   will of the Abbot either among the prisons, or in the guest-chamber or
   in the infirmary or to the poor; the others that whatever the day's
   gorge leaves over, may be useful for extravagant wants or else laid by
   through the sin of covetousness. Lastly, if we grant that what has been
   collected by them with no good design, may be disposed of in better
   ways than we have mentioned, yet not even thus do they rise to the
   merits of goodness and perfection. For the others bring in such returns
   to the monastery, and daily report to them, and continue in such
   humility and subjection that they are deprived of their rights over
   what they gain by their own efforts, just as they are of their rights
   over themselves, as they constantly renew the fervour of their original
   act of renunciation, while they daily deprive themselves of the fruits
   of their labours: but these are puffed up by the fact that they are
   bestowing something on the poor, and daily fall headlong into sin. The
   one party are by patience and the strictness whereby they continue
   devoutly in the order which they have once embraced, so as never to
   fulfil their own will, crucified daily to this world and made living
   martyrs; the others are cast down into hell by the lukewarmness of
   their purpose. These two sorts of monks then vie with each other in
   almost equal numbers in this province; but in other provinces, which
   the need of the Catholic faith compelled me to visit, we have found
   that this third class of Sarabaites flourishes and is almost the only
   one, since in the time of Lucius who was a Bishop of Arian mis-belief
   [999] in the reign of Valens, while we carried alms [1000] to our
   brethren; viz., those from Egypt and the Thebaid, who had been
   consigned to the mines of Pontus and Armenia [1001] for their
   steadfastness in the Catholic faith, though we found the system of
   coenobia in some cities few and far between, yet we never made out that
   even the name of anchorites was heard among them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [998] Sarabaites, this third sort of monks, whom Cassian here paints in
   such dark colours, are spoken of by S. Jerome (Ep. xxii. ad Eustochium)
   under the name of Remoboth. The origin of both names is obscure, but
   Jerome and Cassian are quite at one in their scorn for these pretended
   monks. S. Benedict begins his monastic rule by describing the four
   kinds of monks, coenobites, anchorites, sarabaites, and a fourth class
   to which he gives the name of "gyrovagi," i.e., wandering monks; these
   must be those of whom Cassian speaks below in c. viii. without giving
   them any definite name. See further Bingham, Antiquities VII. ii., and
   the Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, Art. Sarabaites.

   [999] Lucius took the lead of the Arian party at Alexandria after the
   murder of George of Cappadocia in 361, and was put forward by his party
   as the candidate for the see which they regarded as vacant. In 373,
   after the death of Athanasius, he was forced upon the reluctant Church
   of Alexandria by the Arian Emperor Valens, and according to Gregory
   Nazianzen a fresh persecution of the orthodox party at once began; and
   to this it is that Piamun alludes in the text.

   [1000] Diaconia. The word is used again by Cassian for almsgiving in
   Conf. XXI. i., viii., ix., and cf. Gregory the Great, Ep. xxii., and
   compare eis diakonian in Acts 11:29.

   [1001] To work in the mines was a punishment to which the Confessors
   were frequently subjected in the time of persecution: Cf. the prayer in
   the Liturgy of S. Mark that God would have mercy on those in prison, or
   in the mines, etc. Hammond's Liturgies, p. 181.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of a fourth sort of monks.

   THERE is however another and a fourth kind, which we have lately seen
   springing up among those who flatter themselves with the appearance and
   form of anchorites, and who in their early days seem in a brief fervour
   to seek the perfection of the coenobium, but presently cool off, and,
   as they dislike to put an end to their former habits and faults, and
   are not satisfied to bear the yoke of humility and patience any longer,
   and scorn to be in subjection to the rule of the Elders, look out for
   separate cells and want to remain by themselves alone, that as they are
   provoked by nobody they may be regarded by men as patient, gentle, and
   humble: and, this arrangement, or rather this lukewarmness never
   suffers those, of whom it has once got hold, to approach to perfection.
   For in this way their faults are not merely not rooted up, but actually
   grow worse, while they are excited by no one, like some deadly and
   internal poison which the more it is concealed, so much the more deeply
   does it creep in and cause an incurable disease to the sick person. For
   out of respect for each man's own cell no one ventures to reprove the
   faults of a solitary, which he would rather have ignored than cured.
   Moreover virtues are created not by hiding faults but by driving them
   out.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    A question as to what is the difference between a coenobium and a monastery.

   GERMANUS: Is there any distinction between a coenobium and a monastery,
   or is the same thing meant by either name?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    The answer.

   PIAMUN: Although many people indifferently speak of monasteries instead
   of coenobia, yet there is this difference, that monastery is the title
   of the dwelling, and means nothing more than the place, i.e., the
   habitation of monks, while coenobium describes the character of the
   life and its system: and monastery may mean the dwelling of a single
   monk, while a coenobium cannot be spoken of except where dwells a
   united community of a large number of men living together. They are
   however termed monasteries in which groups of Sarabaites live.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    Of true humility, and how Abbot Serapion exposed the mock humility of a
    certain man.

   WHEREFORE as I see that you have learnt the first principles of this
   life from the best sort of monks, i.e., that starting from the
   excellent school of the coenobium you are aiming at the lofty heights
   of the anchorite's rule, you should with genuine feeling of heart
   pursue the virtue of humility and patience, which I doubt not that you
   learnt there; and not feign it, as some do, by mock humility in words,
   or by an artificial and unnecessary readiness for some duties of the
   body. And this sham humility Abbot Serapion [1002] once laughed to
   scorn most capitally. For when one had come to him making a great
   display of his lowliness by his dress and words, and the old man urged
   him, after his custom, to "collect the prayer" [1003] he would not
   consent to his request, but debasing himself declared that he was
   involved in such crimes that he did not deserve even to breathe the air
   which is common to all, and refusing even the use of the mat preferred
   to sit down on the bare ground. But when he had shown still less
   inclination for the washing of the feet, then Abbot Serapion, when
   supper was finished, and the customary Conference gave him an
   opportunity, began kindly and gently to urge him not to roam with
   shifty lightmindedness over the whole world, idly and vaguely,
   especially as he was young and strong, but to keep to his cell in
   accordance with the rule of the Elders and to elect to be supported by
   his own efforts rather than by the bounty of others; which even the
   Apostle Paul would not allow, and though when he was labouring in the
   cause of the gospel this provision might lightly have been made for
   him, yet he preferred to work night and day, to provide daily food for
   himself and for those who were ministering to him and could not do the
   work with their own hands. Whereupon the other was filled with such
   vexation and disgust that he could not hide by his looks the annoyance
   which he felt in his heart. To whom the Elder: Thus far, my son, you
   have loaded yourself with the weight of all kinds of crimes, not
   fearing lest by the confession of such awful sins you bring a reproach
   upon your reputation; how is it then, I pray, that now, at our simple
   admonition, which involved no reproof, but simply showed a feeling for
   your edification and love, I see that you are moved with such disgust
   that you cannot hide it by your looks, or conceal it by an appearance
   of calmness? Perhaps while you were humiliating yourself, you were
   hoping to hear from our lips this saying: "The righteous man is the
   accuser of himself in the opening of his discourse"? [1004] Further,
   true humility of heart must be preserved, which comes not from an
   affected humbling of body and in word, but from an inward humbling of
   the soul: and this will only then shine forth with clear evidences of
   patience when a man does not boast about sins, which nobody will
   believe, but, when another insolently accuses him of them, thinks
   nothing of it, and when with gentle equanimity of spirit he puts up
   with wrongs offered to him.

   [1004] Prov. 18:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    A question how true patience can be gained.

   GERMANUS: We should like to know how that calmness can be secured and
   maintained, that, as when silence is enjoined on us we shut the door of
   our mouth, and lay an embargo on speech, so also we may be able to
   preserve gentleness of heart, which sometimes even when the tongue is
   restrained loses its state of calmness within: and for this reason we
   think that the blessing of gentleness can only be preserved by one in a
   remote cell and solitary dwelling.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    The answer.

   PIAMUN: True patience and tranquillity is neither gained nor retained
   without profound humility of heart: and if it has sprung from this
   source, there will be no need either of the good offices of the cell or
   of the refuge of the desert. For it will seek no external support from
   anything, if it has the internal support of the virtue of humility, its
   mother and its guardian. But if we are disturbed when attacked by
   anyone it is clear that the foundations of humility have not been
   securely laid in us, and therefore at the outbreak even of a small
   storm, our whole edifice is shaken and ruinously disturbed. For
   patience would not be worthy of praise and admiration if it only
   preserved its purposed tranquillity when attacked by no darts of
   enemies, but it is grand and glorious because when the storms of
   temptation beat upon it, it remains unmoved. For wherein it is believed
   that a man is annoyed and hurt by adversity, therein is he strengthened
   the more; and he is therein the more exercised, wherein he is thought
   to be annoyed. For everybody knows that patience gets its name from the
   passions and endurance, and so it is clear that no one can be called
   patient but one who bears without annoyance all the indignities offered
   to him, and so it is not without reason that he is praised by Solomon:
   "Better is the patient man than the strong, and he who restrains his
   anger than he who takes a city;" and again: "For a long-suffering man
   is mighty in prudence, but a faint-hearted man is very foolish." [1005]
   When then anyone is overcome by a wrong, and blazes up in a fire of
   anger, we should not hold that the bitterness of the insult offered to
   him is the cause of his sin, but rather the manifestation of secret
   weakness, in accordance with the parable of our Lord and Saviour which
   He spoke about the two houses, [1006] one of which was founded upon a
   rock, and the other upon the sand, on both of which He says that the
   tempest of rain and waters and storm beat equally: but that one which
   was founded on the solid rock felt no harm at all from the violence of
   the shock, while that which was built on the shifting and moving sand
   at once collapsed. And it certainly appears that it fell, not because
   it was struck by the rush of the storms and torrents, but because it
   was imprudently built upon the sand. For a saint does not differ from a
   sinner in this, that he is not himself tempted in the same way, but
   because he is not worsted even by a great assault, while the other is
   overcome even by a slight temptation. For the fortitude of any good man
   would not, as we said, be worthy of praise, if his victory was gained
   without his being tempted, as most certainly there is no room for
   victory where there is no struggle and conflict: for "Blessed is the
   man that endureth temptation, for when he has been proved he shall
   receive the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love
   Him." [1007] According to the Apostle Paul also "Strength is made
   perfect" not in ease and delights but "in weakness." "For behold," says
   He, "I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron,
   and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Judah, and to
   the princes thereof, and to the priests thereof, and to all the people
   of the land. And they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail:
   for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee." [1008]

  CHAPTER XIV.

    Of the example of patience given by a certain religious woman.

   OF this patience then I want to give you at least two examples: one of
   a certain religious woman, who aimed at the virtue of patience so
   eagerly that she not only did not avoid the assaults of temptation, but
   actually made for herself occasions of trouble that she might not cease
   to be tried more often. For this woman as she was living at Alexandria
   and was born of no mean ancestors, and was serving the Lord religiously
   in the house which had been left to her by her parents, came to
   Athanasius the Bishop, of blessed memory, and entreated him to give her
   some other widow to support, who was being provided for at the expense
   of the Church. And, to give her petition in her own words: "Give me,"
   she said, "one of the sisters to look after." When then the Bishop had
   commended the woman's purpose because he saw that she was very ready
   for a work of a mercy, he ordered a widow to be chosen out of the whole
   number, who was preferred to all the rest for the goodness of her
   character, and her grave and well-regulated life, for fear lest her
   wish to be liberal might be overcome by the fault of the recipient of
   her bounty, and she who sought gain out of the poor might be disgusted
   at her bad character and so suffer an injury to her faith. And when the
   woman was brought home, she ministered to her with all kinds of
   service, and found out her excellent modesty and gentleness, and saw
   that every minute she was honoured by thanks from her for her kind
   offices, and so after a few days she came back to the aforesaid Bishop,
   and said: I asked you to bid that a woman be given to me for me to
   support and to serve with obedient complaisance. And when he, not yet
   understanding the woman's object and desire, thought that her petition
   had been neglected by the deceitfulness of the superior, and inquired
   not without some anger in his mind, what was the reason of the delay,
   at once he discovered that a widow who was better than all the rest had
   been assigned to her, and so he secretly gave orders that the one who
   was the worst of all should be given to her, the one, I mean, who
   surpassed in anger and quarrelling and wine-bibbing and talkativeness
   all who were under the power of these faults. And when she was only too
   easily found and given to her, she began to keep her at home, and to
   minister to her with the same care as to the former widow, or even more
   attentively, and this was all the thanks which she got from her for her
   services; viz., to be constantly tried by unworthy wrongs and
   continually annoyed by her by reproaches and upbraiding, as she
   complained of her, and chid her with spiteful and disparaging remarks,
   because she had asked for her from the Bishop not for her refreshment
   but rather for her torment and annoyance, and had taken her away from
   rest to labour instead of from labour to rest. When then her continual
   reproaches broke out so far that the wanton woman did not restrain
   herself from laying hands on her, the other only redoubled her services
   in still humbler offices, and learnt to overcome the vixen not by
   resisting her, but by subjecting herself still more humbly, so that,
   when provoked by all kinds of indignities, she might smooth down the
   madness of the shrew by gentleness and kindness. And when she had been
   thoroughly strengthened by these exercises, and had attained the
   perfect virtue of the patience she had longed for, she came to the
   aforesaid Bishop to thank him for his decision and choice as well as
   for the blessing of her exercise, because he had at last as she wished
   provided her with a most worthy mistress for her patience, strengthened
   daily by whose constant annoyance as by some oil for wrestling, she had
   arrived at complete patience of mind; and, at last, said she, you have
   given me one to support, for the former one rather honoured and
   refreshed me by her services. This may be sufficient to have told about
   the female sex, that by this tale we may not only be edified, but even
   confounded, as we cannot maintain our patience unless we are like wild
   beasts removed in caves and cells.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

    Of the example of patience given by Abbot Paphnutius.

   NOW let us give the other instance of Abbot Paphnutius, who always
   remained so zealously in the recesses of that renowned and far-famed
   desert of Scete, in which he is now Presbyter, so that the rest of the
   anchorites gave him the name of Bubalis, [1009] because he always
   delighted in dwelling in the desert as if with a sort of innate liking.
   And so as even in boyhood he was so good and full of grace that even
   the renowned and great men of that time admired his gravity and
   steadfast constancy, and although he was younger in age, yet put him on
   a level with the Elders out of regard for his virtues, and thought fit
   to admit him to their order, the same envy, which formerly excited the
   minds of his brethren against the patriarch Joseph, inflamed one out of
   the number of his brethren with a burning and consuming jealousy. And
   this man wanting to mar his beauty by some blemish or spot, hit on this
   kind of devilry, so as to seize an opportunity when Paphnutius had left
   his cell to go to Church on Sunday: and secretly entering his cell he
   slyly hid his own book among the boughs which he used to weave of palm
   branches, and, secure of his well-planned trick, himself went off as if
   with a pure and clean conscience to Church. And when the whole service
   was ended as usual, in the presence of all the brethren he brought his
   complaint to S. Isidore [1010] who was Presbyter of this desert before
   this same Paphnutius, and declared that his book had been stolen from
   his cell. And when his complaint had so disturbed the minds of all the
   brethren, and more especially of the Presbyter, so that they knew not
   what first to suspect or think, as all were overcome with the utmost
   astonishment at so new and unheard of a crime, such as no one
   remembered ever to have been committed in that desert before that time,
   and which has never happened since, he who had brought forward the
   matter as the accuser urged that they should all be kept in Church and
   certain selected men be sent to search the cells of the brethren one by
   one. And when this had been entrusted to three of the Elders by the
   Presbyter, they turned over the bed-chambers of them all, and at last
   found the book hidden in the cell of Paphnutius among the boughs of the
   palms which they call seira, just as the plotter had hidden it. And
   when the inquisitors at once brought it back to the Church and produced
   it before all, Paphnutius, although he was perfectly clear in the
   sincerity of his conscience, yet like one who acknowledged the guilt of
   thieving, gave himself up entirely to make amends and humbly asked for
   a plan of repentance, as he was so careful of his shame and modesty
   (and feared) lest if he tried to remove the stain of the theft by
   words, he might further be branded as a liar, as no one would believe
   anything but what had been found out. And when he had immediately left
   the Church not cast down in mind but rather trusting to the judgment of
   God, he continually shed tears at his prayers, and fasted thrice as
   often as before, and prostrated himself in the sight of men with all
   humility of mind. But when he had thus submitted himself with all
   contrition of flesh and spirit for almost a fortnight, so that he came
   early on the morning of Saturday and Sunday not to receive the Holy
   Communion [1011] but to prostrate himself on the threshold of the
   Church and humbly ask for pardon, He, Who is the witness of all secret
   things and knows them, suffered him to be no longer tried by Himself or
   defamed by others. For what the author of the crime, the wicked thief
   of his own property, the cunning defamer of another's credit, had done
   with no man there as a witness, that He made known by means of the
   devil who was himself the instigator of the sin. For possessed by a
   most fierce demon, he made known all the craft of his secret plot, and
   the same man who had conceived the accusation and the cheat betrayed
   it. But he was so long and grievously vexed by that unclean spirit that
   he could not even be restored by the prayers of the saints living
   there, who by means of divine gifts can command the devils, nor could
   the special grace of the Presbyter Isidore himself cast out from him
   his cruel tormentor, though by the Lord's bounty such power was given
   him that no one who was possessed was ever brought to his doors without
   being at once healed; for Christ was reserving this glory for the young
   Paphnutius, that the man should be cleansed only by the prayers of him
   against whom he had plotted, and that the jealous enemy should receive
   pardon for his offence and an end of his present punishment, only by
   proclaiming his name, from whose credit he had thought that he could
   detract. He then in his early youth already gave these signs of his
   future character, and even in his boyish years sketched the lines of
   that perfection which was to grow up in mature age. If then we want to
   attain to his height of virtue, we must lay the same foundation to
   begin with.

  CHAPTER XVI.

    On the perfection of patience.

   A TWOFOLD reason however led me to relate this fact, first that we may
   weigh this steadfastness and constancy of the man, and as we are
   attacked by less serious wiles of the enemy, may the better secure a
   greater feeling of calmness and patience, secondly that we may with
   resolute decision hold that we cannot be safe from the storms of
   temptation and assaults of the devil if we make all the protection for
   our patience and all our confidence consist not in the strength of our
   inner man but in the doors of our cell or the recesses of the desert,
   and companionship of the saints, or the safeguard of anything else
   outside us. For unless our mind is strengthened by the power of His
   protection Who says in the gospel "the kingdom of God is within you,"
   [1012] in vain do we fancy that we can defeat the plots of our airy foe
   by the aid of men who are living with us, or that we can avoid them by
   distance of place, or exclude them by the protection of walls. For
   though none of these things was wanting to Saint Paphnutius yet the
   tempter did not fail to find a way of access against him to attack him;
   nor did the encircling walls, or the solitude of the desert or the
   merits of all those saints in the congregation repulse that most foul
   spirit. But because the holy servant of God had fixed the hope of his
   heart not on those external things but on Him Who is the judge of all
   secrets, he could not be moved even by the machinations of such an
   assault as that. On the other hand did not the man whom envy had
   hurried into so grievous a sin enjoy the benefit of solitude and the
   protection of a retired dwelling, and intercourse with the blessed
   Abbot and Presbyter Isidore and other saints? And yet because the storm
   raised by the devil found him upon the sand, it not only drove in his
   house but actually overturned it. We need not then seek for our peace
   in externals, nor fancy that another person's patience can be of any
   use to the faults of our impatience. For just as "the kingdom of God is
   within you," so "a man's foes are they of his own household." [1013]
   For no one is more my enemy than my own heart which is truly the one of
   my household closest to me. And therefore if we are careful, we cannot
   possibly be injured by intestine enemies. For where those of our own
   household are not opposed to us, there also the kingdom of God is
   secured in peace of heart. For if you diligently investigate the
   matter, I cannot be injured by any man however spiteful, if I do not
   fight against myself with warlike heart. But if I am injured, the fault
   is not owing to the other's attack, but to my own impatience. For as
   strong and solid food is good for a man in good health, so it is bad
   for a sick one. But it cannot hurt the man who takes it, unless the
   weakness of its recipient gives it its power to hurt. If then any
   similar temptation ever arises among brethren, we need never be shaken
   out of the even tenor of our ways and give an opening to the
   blasphemous snarls of men living in the world, nor wonder that some bad
   and detestable men have secretly found their way into the number of the
   saints, because so long as we are trodden down and trampled in the
   threshing floor of this world, the chaff which is destined for eternal
   fire is quite sure to be mingled with the choicest of the wheat.
   Finally if we bear in mind that Satan was chosen among the angels, and
   Judas among the apostles, and Nicholas the author of a detestable
   heresy among the deacons, it will be no wonder that the basest of men
   are found among the ranks of the saints. For although some maintain
   that this Nicholas was not the same man who was chosen for the work of
   the ministry by the Apostles, [1014] nevertheless they cannot deny that
   he was of the number of the disciples, all of whom were clearly of such
   a character and so perfect as those few whom we can now with difficulty
   discover in the coenobia. Let us then bring forward not the fall of the
   above-mentioned brother, who fell in the desert with so grievous a
   collapse, nor that horrible stain which he afterwards wiped out by the
   copious tears of his penitence, but the example of the blessed
   Paphnutius; and let us not be destroyed by the ruin of the former,
   whose ingrained sin of envy was increased and made worse by his
   affected piety, but let us imitate with all our might the humility of
   the latter, which in his case was no sudden production of the quiet of
   the desert, but had been gained among men, and was consummated and
   perfected by solitude. However you should know that the evil of envy is
   harder to be cured than other faults, for I should almost say that a
   man whom it has once tainted with the mischief of its poison is without
   a remedy. For it is the plague of which it is figuratively said by the
   prophet: "Behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against
   which there is no charm: and they shall bite you." [1015] Rightly then
   are the stings of envy compared by the prophet to the deadly poison of
   basilisks, as by it the first author of all poisons and their chief
   perished and died. For he slew himself before him of whom he was
   envious, and destroyed himself before that he poured forth the poison
   of death against man: for "by the envy of the devil death entered into
   the world: they therefore who are on his side follow him." [1016] For
   just as he who was the first to be corrupted by the plague of that
   evil, admitted no remedy of penitence, nor any healing plaster, so
   those also who have given themselves up to be smitten by the same
   pricks, exclude all the aid of the sacred charmer, because as they are
   tormented not by the faults but by the prosperity of those of whom they
   are jealous, they are ashamed to display the real truth and look out
   for some external unnecessary and trifling causes of offence: and of
   these, because they are altogether false, vain is the hope of cure,
   while the deadly poison which they will not produce is lurking in their
   veins. Of which the wisest of men has fitly said: "If a serpent bite
   without hissing, there is no supply for the charmer." [1017] For those
   are silent bites, to which alone the medicine of the wise is no
   succour. For that evil is so far incurable that it is made worse by
   attentions, it is increased by services, is irritated by presents,
   because as the same Solomon says: "envy endures nothing." [1018] For
   just in proportion as another has made progress in humble submission or
   in the virtue of patience or in the merit of munificence, so is a man
   excited by worse pricks of envy, because he desires nothing less than
   the ruin or death of the man whom he envies. Lastly no submission on
   the part of their harmless brother could soften the envy of the eleven
   patriarchs, so that Scripture relates of them: "But his brothers envied
   him because his father loved him, and they could not speak peaceably
   unto him" [1019] until their jealousy, which would not listen to any
   entreaties on the part of their obedient and submissive brother,
   desired his death, and would scarcely be satisfied with the sin of
   selling a brother. It is plain then that envy is worse than all faults,
   and harder to get rid of, as it is inflamed by those remedies by which
   the others are destroyed. For, for example, a man who is grieved by a
   loss that has been caused to him, is healed by a liberal compensation:
   one who is sore owing to a wrong done to him, is appeased by humble
   satisfaction being made. What can you do with one who is the more
   offended by the very fact that he sees you humbler and kinder, who is
   not aroused to anger by any greed which can be appeased by a bribe; or
   by any injurious attack or love of vengeance, which is overcome by
   obsequious services; but is only irritated by another's success and
   happiness? But who is there who in order to satisfy one who envies him,
   would wish to fall from his good fortune, or to lose his prosperity or
   to be involved in some calamity? Wherefore we must constantly implore
   the divine aid, to which nothing is impossible, in order that the
   serpent may not by a single bite of this evil destroy whatever is
   flourishing in us, and animated as it were by the life and quickening
   power of the Holy Ghost. For the other poisons of serpents, i.e.,
   carnal sins and faults, in which human frailty is easily entangled and
   from which it is as easily purified, show some traces of their wounds
   in the flesh, whereby although the earthly body is most dangerously
   inflamed, yet if any charmer well skilled in divine incantations
   applies a cure and antidote or the remedy of words of salvation, the
   poisonous evil does not reach to the everlasting death of the soul. But
   the poison of envy as if emitted by the basilisk, destroys the very
   life of religion and faith, even before the wound is perceived in the
   body. For he does not raise himself up against men, but, in his
   blasphemy, against God, who carps at nothing in his brother except his
   felicity, and so blames no fault of man, but simply the judgment of
   God. This then is that "root of bitterness springing up" [1020] which
   raises itself to heaven and tends to reproaching the very Author Who
   bestows good things on man. Nor shall anyone be disturbed because God
   threatens to send "serpents, basilisks," [1021] to bite those by whose
   crimes He is offended. For although it is certain that God cannot be
   the author of envy, yet it is fair and worthy of the divine judgment
   that, while good gifts are bestowed on the humble and refused to the
   proud and reprobate, those who, as the Apostle says, deserve to be
   given over "to a reprobate mind," [1022] should be smitten and consumed
   by envy sent as it were by Him, according to this passage: "They have
   provoked me to jealousy by them that are no gods: and I will provoke
   them to jealousy by them that are no nation." [1023]

   By this discourse the blessed Piamun excited still more keenly our
   desire in which we had begun to be promoted from the infant school of
   the coenobium to the second standard of the anchorites' life. For it
   was under his instruction that we made our first start in solitary
   living, the knowledge of which we afterwards followed up more
   thoroughly in Scete.

CONFERENCE OF ABBOT JOHN.

ON THE AIM OF THE COENOBITE AND HERMIT.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Of the coenobium of Abbot Paul and the patience of a certain brother.

   AFTER only a few days we made our way once more with great alacrity,
   drawn by the desire for further instruction, to the coenobium of Abbot
   Paul, where though a greater number than two hundred of the brethren
   dwell there, yet, in honour of the festival which was then being held,
   an enormous collection of monks from other coenobia had come there as
   well: for the anniversary of the death [1024] of a former Abbot who had
   presided over the same monastery was being solemnly kept. And we have
   mentioned this assembly for this reason that we may briefly treat of
   the patience of a certain brother, which was remarkable for immovable
   gentleness on his part in the presence of all this congregation. For
   though the object of this work has regard to another person; viz., that
   we may produce the utterances of Abbot John [1025] who left the desert
   and submitted himself to that coenobium with the utmost goodness and
   humility, yet we think it not at all absurd to relate without any
   unnecessary verbiage, what we think is most instructive to those who
   are eager for goodness. And so when the whole body of the monks was
   seated in separate parties of twelve, in the large open court, when one
   of the brethren had been rather slow in fetching and bringing in a
   dish, the aforesaid Abbot Paul, who was busily hurrying about among the
   troops of brethren who were serving, saw it and struck him such a blow
   before them all on his open palm that the sound of the hand which was
   struck actually reached the ears of those whose backs were turned and
   who were sitting some way off. But the youth of remarkable patience
   received it with such calmness of mind that not only did he let no word
   fall from his mouth or give the slightest sign of murmuring by the
   silent movements of his lips, but actually did not change colour in the
   slightest degree or (lose) the modest and peaceful look about his
   mouth. And this fact struck with astonishment not merely us, who had
   lately come from a monastery of Syria and had not learnt the blessing
   of this patience by such clear examples, but all those as well who were
   not without experience of such earnestness, so that by it a great
   lesson was taught even to those who were well advanced, because even if
   this paternal correction had not disturbed his patience, neither did
   the presence of so great a number bring the slightest sign of colour to
   his cheeks.

   burial) in Calendars and Martyrologies.

   [1025] On this Abbot John compare the note on the Institutes V. xxvii.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    Of Abbot John's humility and our question.

   IN this coenobium then we found a very old man named John, whose words
   and humility we think ought certainly not to be passed over in silence
   as in them he excelled all the saints, as we know that he was
   especially vigorous in this perfection, which though it is the mother
   of all virtues and the surest foundation of the whole spiritual
   superstructure, yet is altogether a stranger to our system. Wherefore
   it is no wonder that we cannot attain to the height of those men, as we
   cannot stand the training of the coenobium I will not say up to old
   age, but are scarcely content to endure the yoke of subjection for a
   couple of years, and at once escape to enjoy a dangerous liberty, while
   even for that short time we seem to be subject to the rule of the Elder
   not according to any strict rule, but as our free will directs. When
   then we had seen this old man in Abbot Paul's coenobium, we were
   struck, first by his age and the grace with which the man was endowed,
   and with looks fixed on the ground began to entreat him to vouchsafe to
   explain to us why he had forsaken the freedom of the desert and that
   exalted profession, in which his fame and celebrity had raised him
   above others who had adopted the same life, and why he had chosen to
   enter under the yoke of the coenobium. He said that as he was unequal
   to the system of the anchorites and unworthy of the heights of such
   perfection, he had gone back to the infant school, that he might learn
   to carry out the lessons taught there, according as the life demanded.
   And when our entreaties were not satisfied and we refused to take this
   humble answer, at last he began as follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

    Abbot John's answer why he had left the desert.

   THE system of the anchorites, which you are surprised at my leaving, I
   not only neither reject nor refuse, but rather embrace and regard with
   the utmost veneration: in which system, and after I had passed thirty
   years living in a coenobium, I rejoice that I have also spent twenty
   more, so that I can never be accused of sloth among those who tried it
   in a half-hearted way. But because its purity, of which I had had some
   slight experience, was sometimes soiled by the presence of anxiety
   about carnal matters, it seemed better to return to the coenobium to
   secure a readier attainment of an easier aim undertaken, and less
   danger from venturing on the higher life of the humble solitary. [1026]
   For it is better to seem earnest with smaller promises than careless in
   larger ones. And therefore if possibly I bring forward anything
   somewhat arrogantly and indeed somewhat too freely, I beg that you will
   not think it due to the sin of boasting but rather to my desire for
   your edification; and that, as I think that, when you ask so earnestly,
   nothing of the truth should be kept back from you, you will set it down
   to love rather than to boasting. For I think that some instruction may
   be given to you if I lay aside my humility, and simply lay bare the
   whole truth about my aim. For I trust that I shall not incur any
   reproach of vainglory from you because of the freedom of my words, nor
   any charge of falsehood from my conscience because of any suppression
   of the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1026] The true reading, as given by Petschenig, appears to be the
   following: Et minus de praesumptae sublimioris professionis humilitate
   periculum. It is probably on account of its difficulty that humilitate
   has been altered into difficultate, as in the text of Gazet (the two
   humilitate difficultate are found together in some MSS.). But the fact
   appears to be that humilitas is here used for the life of an anchorite,
   as in Conference XXIV. ix., where Abbot Abraham uses the expression
   districtionem hujus humilitatis. The word is also used in a somewhat
   similar sense in Conf. I. xx. and XI. ii.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    Of the excellence which the aforesaid old man showed in the system of the
    anchorites.

   IF then anyone else delights in the recesses of the desert and would
   forget all human intercourse and say with Jeremiah: "I have not desired
   the day of man: Thou knowest," [1027] I confess that by the blessing of
   God's grace, I also secured or at any rate tried to secure this. And so
   by the kind gift of the Lord I remember that I was often caught up into
   such an ecstasy as to forget that I was clothed with the burden of a
   weak body, and my soul on a sudden forgot all external notions and
   entirely cut itself off from all material objects, so that neither my
   eyes nor ears performed their proper functions. And my soul was so
   filled with divine meditations and spiritual contemplations that often
   in the evening I did not know whether I had taken any food and on the
   next day was very doubtful whether I had broken my fast yesterday. For
   which reason, a supply of food for seven days, i.e., seven sets of
   biscuits were set apart in a sort of hand-basket, [1028] and laid by on
   Saturday, that there might be no doubt when supper had been omitted;
   and by this plan another mistake also from forgetfulness was obviated,
   for when the number of cakes was finished it showed that the course of
   the week was over, and that the services of the same day had come
   round, and that the festival and holy day and services of the
   congregation could not escape the notice of the solitary. But even if
   that ecstasy of mind of which we have spoken should happen to interfere
   with this arrangement, yet still the method of the days' work would
   show the number of the days and check the mistake. And to pass over in
   silence the other advantages of the desert (for it is not our business
   to treat of their number and quantity, but rather of the aim of
   solitude and the coenobium) I will the rather briefly explain the
   reasons why I preferred to leave it, which you also wanted to know, and
   will in a concise discourse glance at all those fruits of solitude
   which I mentioned, and show to what greater advantages on the other
   side they ought to be held inferior.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    Of the advantages of the desert.

   SO long then as owing to the fewness of those who were then living in
   the desert, a greater freedom was afforded to us in a wider expanse of
   the wilderness, so long as in the seclusion of larger retreats we were
   caught up to those celestial ecstasies, and were not overwhelmed by a
   great quantity of brethren to visit us, and thus owing to the necessity
   of showing hospitality overburdened in our thoughts by the distractions
   of great cares, I frequented with insatiable desire and all my heart
   the peaceful retreats of the desert and that life which can only be
   compared to the bliss of the angels. But when, as I said, a larger
   number of the brethren began to seek a dwelling in that desert, and by
   cramping the freedom of the vast wilderness, not only caused that fire
   of divine contemplation to grow cold, but also entangled the mind in
   many ways in the chains of carnal matters, I determined to carry out my
   purpose in this system rather than to grow cold in that sublime mode of
   life, by providing for carnal wants; so that, if that liberty and those
   spiritual ecstasies are denied me, yet as all care for the morrow is
   avoided, I may console myself by fulfilling the precept of the gospel,
   and what I lose in sublimity of contemplation, may be made up to me by
   submission and obedience. For it is a wretched thing for a man to
   profess to learn any art or pursuit, and never to arrive at perfection
   in it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    Of the conveniences of the coenobium.

   WHEREFORE I will briefly explain what advantages I now enjoy in this
   manner of life. You must consider my words and judge whether those
   advantages of the desert outweigh these comforts, and by this you will
   also be able to prove whether I chose to be cramped within the narrow
   limits of the coenobium from dislike or from desire of that purity of
   the solitary life. In this life then there is no providing for the
   day's work, no distractions of buying and selling, no unavoidable care
   for the year's food, no anxiety about bodily things, by which one has
   to get ready what is necessary not only for one's own wants but also
   for those of any number of visitors, finally no conceit from the praise
   of men, which is worse than all these things and sometimes in the sight
   of God does away with the good of even great efforts in the desert.
   But, to pass over those waves of spiritual pride and the deadly peril
   of vainglory in the life of the anchorite, let us return to this
   general burden which affects everybody, i.e., the ordinary anxiety in
   providing food, which has so far exceeded I say not the measure of that
   ancient strictness which altogether did without oil, but is beginning
   not to be content even with the relaxation of our own time according to
   which the requirements of all the supply of food for a year were
   satisfied by the preparation of a single pint of oil and a modius of
   lentils prepared for the use of visitors; but now the needful supply of
   food is scarcely met by two or three times that amount. And to such an
   extent has the force of this dangerous relaxation grown among some
   that, when they mix vinegar and sauce, they do not add that single drop
   of oil, which our predecessors who followed the rules of the desert
   with greater powers of abstinence, were accustomed to pour in simply
   for the sake of avoiding vainglory, [1029] but they break an Egyptian
   cheese for luxury and pour over it more oil than is required, and so
   take, under a single pleasant relish, two sorts of food which differ in
   their special flavour, each of which ought singly to be a pleasant
   refreshment at different times for a monk. To such a pitch however has
   this `ulikh kthsis, i.e., acquisition of material things grown, that
   actually under pretence of hospitality and welcoming guests anchorites
   have begun to keep a blanket in their cells--a thing which I cannot
   mention without shame--to omit those things by which the mind that is
   awed by and intent on spiritual meditation is more especially hampered;
   viz., the concourse of brethren, the duties of receiving the coming and
   speeding the parting guest, visits to each other and the endless worry
   of various confabulations and occupations, the expectation of which
   owing to the continuous character of these customary interruptions
   keeps the mind on the stretch even during the time when these bothers
   seem to cease. And so the result is that the freedom of the anchorite's
   life is so hindered by these ties that it can never rise to that
   ineffable keenness of heart, and thus loses the fruits of its hermit
   life. And if this is now denied to me while I am living in the
   congregation and among others, at least there is no lack of peace of
   mind and tranquillity of heart that is freed from all business. And
   unless this is ready at hand for those also who live in the desert,
   they will indeed have to undergo the labours of the anchorite's life,
   but will lose its fruits which can only be gained in peaceful stability
   of mind. Finally even if there is any diminution of my purity of heart
   while I am living in the coenobium, I shall be satisfied by keeping in
   exchange that one precept of the Gospel, which certainly cannot be less
   esteemed than all those fruits of the desert; I mean that I should take
   no thought for the morrow, and submitting myself completely to the
   Abbot seem in some degree to emulate Him of whom it is said: "He
   humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death;" and so be able humbly
   to make use of His words: "For I came not to do mine own will, but the
   will of the Father which sent me." [1030]

  CHAPTER VII.

    A question on the fruits of the coenobium and the desert.

   GERMANUS: Since it is evident that you have not, like so many, just
   touched the mere outskirts of each mode of life, but have ascended to
   the very heights, we should like to know what is the end of the
   coenobite's life and what the end of the hermit's. For no one can doubt
   that no man can discourse with greater fulness or fidelity, on these
   subjects than one who, taught by long use and experience, has followed
   them both, and so can by veracious teaching show us their value and
   aim.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    The answer to the question proposed.

   JOHN: I should absolutely maintain that one and the same man could not
   attain perfection in both lives unless I was hindered by the example of
   some few. And since it is no small matter to find a man who is perfect
   in either of them, it is clear how much harder and I had almost said
   impossible it is for a man to be thoroughly efficient in both. And if
   this has ever happened, it cannot come under any general rule. For a
   general rule must be based not on exceptional instances, i.e., on the
   experience of a very few, but on what is within the power of the many
   or rather of all. But what is attained to here and there by but one or
   two, and is beyond the capacity of ordinary goodness, must be kept out
   of general rules as something permitted outside the condition and
   nature of human weakness, and should be brought forward as a miracle
   rather than as an example. Wherefore I will, as my slender ability
   allows, briefly intimate what you want to know. The aim indeed of the
   coenobite is to mortify and crucify all his desires and, according to
   that salutary command of evangelic perfection, to take no thought for
   the morrow. And it is perfectly clear that this perfection cannot be
   attained by any except a coenobite, such a man as the prophet Isaiah
   describes and blesses and praises as follows: "If thou turn away thy
   foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy own will in my holy day, and
   glorify Him, while thou dost not thine own ways, and thine own will is
   not found to speak a word: then shalt thou be delighted in the Lord,
   and I will lift thee up above the high places of the earth, and will
   feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of
   the Lord hath spoken it." [1031] But the perfection for a hermit is to
   have his mind freed from all earthly things, and to unite it, as far as
   human frailty allows, with Christ: and such a man the prophet Jeremiah
   describes when he says: "Blessed is the man who hath borne the yoke
   from his youth. He shall sit solitary and hold his peace, because he
   hath taken it upon himself;" the Psalmist also: "I am become like a
   pelican in the desert. I watched and became as a sparrow alone upon the
   housetop." [1032] To this aim then, which we have described as that of
   either life, unless each of them attains, in vain does the one adopt
   the system of the coenobium, and the other of the hermitage: for
   neither of them will get the good of his method of life.

  CHAPTER IX.

    Of true and complete perfection.

   BUT this is merikh, i.e., no thorough and altogether complete
   perfection, but only a partial one. Perfection then is very rare and
   granted by God's gift to but a very few. For he is truly and not
   partially perfect who with equal imperturbability can put up with the
   squalor of the wilderness in the desert, as well as the infirmities of
   the brethren in the coenobium. And so it is hard to find one who is
   perfect in both lives, because the anchorite cannot thoroughly acquire
   akthmosunh, i.e., a disregard for and stripping oneself of material
   things, nor the coenobite purity in contemplation, although we know
   that Abbot Moses and Paphnutius and the two Macarii [1033] were masters
   of both in perfection. And so they were perfect in either life, and
   while they withdrew further than all the dwellers in the desert and
   delighted themselves unceasingly in the retirement of the wilderness,
   and as far as in them lay never sought intercourse with other men, yet
   they put up with the presence and the infirmities of those who came to
   them so that when a large number of the brethren came to them for the
   sake of seeing them and profiting by it, they endured this almost
   continuous trouble of receiving them with imperturbable patience, and
   men fancied that all the days of their life they had neither learnt nor
   practised anything but how to show common civility to those who came,
   so that it was a puzzle to all to say in which life their zeal was
   mainly shown, i.e., whether their greatness adapted itself more
   remarkably to the purity of the hermitage or to the common life.

  CHAPTER X.

    Of those who while still imperfect retire into the desert.

   BUT some are sometimes so tantalized by the silence of the desert
   lasting all through the day that they altogether dread intercourse with
   men, and, when they have even for a little while broken through their
   habit of retirement owing to the accident of a visit from some of the
   brethren, boil over with marked vexation of mind, and show clear signs
   of annoyance. And this especially happens in the case of those who have
   betaken themselves to the solitary life without a well-matured purpose
   and without being thoroughly trained in the coenobium, as these men are
   always imperfect and easily upset, and incline to one side or the
   other, as the gales of trouble may drive them. For as they boil over
   impatiently at intercourse or conversation with the brethren, so while
   they are living in solitude they cannot stand the vastness of that
   silence which they themselves have courted, inasmuch as they themselves
   do not even know the reason why solitude ought to be wanted and sought
   for, but imagine that the value and the main part of this life consist
   in this; viz., in avoiding intercourse with the brethren and simply
   shunning and loathing the sight of a man.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    A question how to cure those who have hastily left the congregation of the
    coenobium.

   GERMANUS: By what treatment can any help be given to us or to others
   who are thus weak and only up to this; who had received but little
   instruction in the system of the coenobium when we began to aspire to
   dwell in solitude before we had got rid of our faults; or by what means
   shall we be able to acquire the constancy of an imperturbable mind, and
   immovable steadfastness of patience; we who all too soon gave up the
   common life in the coenobium, and forsook the schools and training
   ground for these exercises, in which our principles ought first to have
   been thoroughly schooled and perfected? How then can we now while we
   are living alone gain perfection in long-suffering and patience; or how
   can conscience, that searcher out of inward motives, discover whether
   these virtues exist in us or are wanting, so that because we are
   severed from intercourse with men, and not irritated by any of their
   provocations, we may not be deceived by false notions, and fancy that
   we have gained that imperturbable peace of mind?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    The answer telling how a solitary can discover his faults.

   JOHN: To those who are really seeking relief, healing remedies from the
   true Physician of souls will certainly not be wanting; and to those
   above all will they be given who do not disregard their ill-condition
   (either because they despair of it, or because they do not care about
   it), nor hide the danger they are in from their wound, nor in their
   wanton heart reject the remedy of penitence, but with an humble and yet
   careful heart flee to the heavenly Physician for the diseases they have
   contracted from ignorance or error or necessity. And so we ought to
   know that if we retire to solitude or secret places, without our faults
   being first cured, their operation is but repressed, while the power of
   feeling them is not extinguished. For the root of all sins not having
   been eradicated is still lying hid in us, or rather creeping up, and
   that it is still alive we can tell by these signs. For instance, if,
   when we are living in solitude we receive the approach of some
   brethren, or any very slight tarrying on their part, with any anxiety
   or fretfulness of mind, we should recognize that an incentive to the
   most hasty impatience is still existing in us. But if when we are
   hoping for the coming of a brother, and from some cause he perhaps
   delays a little, our mental indignation either silently blames his
   slowness, and annoyance at this inconvenient waiting disturbs our mind,
   the examination of our conscience will show that the sin of anger and
   vexation is plainly still remaining in us. Again, if when a brother
   asks for our book to read, or for some other article to use, his
   request annoys us, or a refusal on our part disgusts him, there can be
   no doubt that we are still entangled in the meshes of avarice or
   covetousness. But if a sudden thought or a passage of Holy Scripture
   brings up the recollection of a woman and we feel that we are at all
   attracted towards her, we should know that the fire of fornication is
   not yet extinguished in us. But if on a comparison of our own
   strictness with the laxity of another even th slightest conceit tries
   our mind, it is clear that we are affected with the dreadful plague of
   pride. When then we detect these signs of faults in our heart, we
   should clearly recognize that it is only the opportunity and not the
   passion of sin of which we are deprived. And certainly these passions,
   if at any time we were to mingle in the ordinary life of men, would at
   once start up from their lurking places in our thoughts and prove that
   they did not then for the first time come into existence when they
   broke out, but that they were then at last made public, because they
   had been long lying hid. And so even a solitary can detect by sure
   signs that the roots of each fault are still implanted in him, if he
   tries not to show his purity to men, but to maintain it inviolate in
   His sight, from whom no secrets of the heart can be hid.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

    A question how a man can be cured who has entered on solitude without having
    his faults eradicated.

   GERMANUS: We very clearly and plainly see the proofs by which the signs
   of infirmities are inferred, and the method of discerning diseases,
   i.e., how the faults which are concealed in us can be detected: for our
   every day experience and the daily motions of our thoughts show us all
   these as they have been stated. It remains then that as the proofs and
   causes of our maladies have been exposed to us in a most clear way so
   their remedies and cures may also be shown. For no one can doubt that
   one who has first discovered the grounds and beginnings of ailments,
   with the approving witness of the conscience of those affected, can
   best discourse on their remedies. And so though the teaching of your
   holiness has laid bare the secrets of our wounds whereby we venture to
   have some hope of a remedy, because so clear a diagnosis of the disease
   gives promise of the hope of a cure, yet because, as you say, the first
   elements of salvation are acquired in the coenobium, and men cannot be
   in a sound condition in solitude, unless they have first been healed by
   the medicine of the coenobium, we have fallen again into a dangerous
   state of despair lest as we left the coenobium in an imperfect
   condition we may not now that we are in the desert succeed in becoming
   perfect.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

    The answer on their remedies.

   JOHN: For those who are anxious for the cure of their ailments a saving
   remedy is sure not to be wanting, and therefore remedies should be
   sought by the same means that the signs of each fault are discovered.
   For as we have said that the faults of men's ordinary life are not
   wanting to solitaries, so we do not deny that all zeal for virtue, and
   all the means of healing are at the disposal of all those who are cut
   off from men's ordinary life. When then anyone discovers by those signs
   which we described above, that he is attacked by outbreaks of
   impatience or anger, he should always practise himself in the opposite
   and contrary things, and by setting before himself all sorts of
   injuries and wrongs, as if offered to him by somebody else, accustom
   his mind to submit with perfect humility to everything that wickedness
   can bring upon him; and by often representing to himself all kinds of
   rough and intolerable things, continually consider with all sorrow of
   heart with what gentleness he ought to meet them. And, by thus looking
   at the sufferings of all the saints, or indeed at those of the Lord
   Himself, he will admit that the various reproaches as well as
   punishments are less than he deserves, and prepare himself to endure
   all kinds of griefs. And when occasionally he has been recalled by some
   invitation to the assembly of the brethren--a thing which cannot but
   happen every now and then even to the strictest inmates of the
   desert,--if he finds that his mind is silently disturbed even for
   trifles, he should like some stern censor of his secret emotions charge
   himself with all those various hard wrongs, to the perfect endurance of
   which he was training himself by his daily meditations, and blaming and
   chiding himself as follows, say My good man, are you the fellow who
   while training yourself in the practising ground of solitude, ventured
   most determinedly to think that you would get the better of all bad
   qualities, and who just now, when you were representing to yourself not
   only all sorts of bitter reproaches, but also intolerable punishments,
   fancied that you were pretty strong and able to stand against all
   storms? How is it that that unconquered patience of yours is upset by
   the first trial even of a light word? How is it that even a gentle
   breeze has shaken that house of yours which you fancied was built so
   strongly on the solid rock? Where is that which you announced when
   during a time of peace you were in your foolish confidence longing for
   war? "I am ready, and am not troubled;" and this which you used often
   to say with the prophet: "Prove me, O Lord, and try me: search out my
   reins and my heart;" and: "prove me, O Lord, and know my heart:
   question me and know my paths; and see if there be any way of
   wickedness in me." [1034] How has a tiny ghost of an enemy frightened
   your grand preparations for war? With such reproaches and remorse a man
   should condemn himself and not allow the sudden temptation which has
   upset him to go unpunished, but by chastising his flesh with a severer
   penalty of fasting and vigils; and, by punishing his sin of lightness
   of mind by continual pains of self-restraint, he should while living in
   solitude consume in this fire of practice what he ought to have
   thoroughly driven out in the life of the coenobium. This at any rate we
   must firmly and resolutely hold to in order to secure a lasting and
   unbroken patience; viz., that for us, to whom by the Divine law not
   merely vengeance for, but even the recollection of injuries is
   forbidden, it is not permissible to be roused to anger because of some
   loss or annoyance. For what greater injury can happen to the soul than
   for it, owing to some sudden blindness from rage, to lose the
   brightness of the true and eternal light and to fail of the sight of
   Him "Who is meek and lowly of heart"? [1035] What I ask could be more
   dangerous or awkward than for a man to lose his power of judging of
   goodness, and his standard and rule of true discernment, and for one in
   his sober senses to do what even a drunken man, and a fool would not be
   pardoned for doing? One then who carefully considers these and other
   injuries of the same kind, will readily endure and disregard not only
   all kinds of losses, but also whatever wrongs and punishments can be
   inflicted by the cruellest of men, as he will hold that there is
   nothing more damaging than anger, nor more valuable than peace of mind
   and unbroken purity of heart, for the sake of which we should think
   nothing of the advantages not merely of carnal matters but also of
   those things which appear to be spiritual, if they cannot be gained or
   done without some disturbance of this tranquillity.

  CHAPTER XV.

    A question whether chastity ought to be ascertained just as the other
    feelings.

   GERMANUS: As the cure for other ailments, viz., anger, vexation, and
   impatience, has been shown to consist in opposing to them their
   contraries, so also we should like to learn what sort of treatment we
   ought to use against the spirit of fornication: I mean, whether the
   fire of lust can be quenched by the representation, as in those other
   cases, of greater inducements and things to excite it: because not
   merely to increase the incentives to lust within us, but even to touch
   them with a passing look of the mind, we believe to be utterly fatal to
   chastity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    The answer giving the proofs by which it can be recognized.

   JOHN: Your shrewd question has anticipated the subject, which even if
   you had said nothing must have arisen from our discourse, and therefore
   I do not doubt that it will be effectually grasped by your minds, since
   indeed your sharp wits have outstripped our instruction. For the puzzle
   of any question is easily removed, when the inquiry anticipates the
   answer, and is the first to travel along the road which it is to
   follow. And so to the treatment of those faults of which we have spoken
   above, intercourse with other men is not merely no hindrance, but a
   considerable help, for the more often that the outbursts of their
   impatience are exposed, the more thorough is the sorrow and compunction
   which they bring on those who have failed, and the speedier is the
   recovery of health which they confer on those who struggle against
   them. Wherefore even when we are living in solitude, though the
   incentive to irritation and matter for it cannot arise from men, yet we
   ought of set purpose to meditate on incitements to it, that as we are
   fighting against it with a continual struggle in our thoughts a
   speedier cure for it may be found for us. But against the spirit of
   fornication the system is different, and the method an altered one. For
   as we must deprive the body of opportunities of lust, and contact with
   flesh, so we must deprive the mind of the recollection of it. For it is
   sufficiently dangerous for bosoms that are still weak and infirm even
   to tolerate the slightest recollection of this passion, in such a way
   that sometimes at the remembrance of holy women, or in reading a story
   in Holy Scripture a stimulus of dangerous excitement is aroused. For
   which reason our Elders used deliberately to omit passages of this kind
   when any of the juniors were present. However for those who are perfect
   and established in the feelings of chastity there can be no lack of
   proofs by which they may examine themselves, and establish their
   perfect uprightness of heart by the uncorrupted judgment of their own
   conscience. There will then be for the man who is thoroughly
   established a similar test even in regard to this passion, so that one
   who is sure that he has altogether exterminated the roots of this evil
   may for the sake of ascertaining his chastity, call up some picture as
   with a lascivious mind. But it is by no means proper for such a test to
   be attempted by those who are still weak (for to them it will be
   dangerous rather than useful), ut conjunctionem femineam et palpationem
   quodammodo teneram atque mollissimam corde pertractent. Cum ergo
   perfecta quis virtute fundatus ad illecebram blandissimorum tactuum,
   quos cogitando confinxerit, nullum mentis assensum, nullam commotionem
   carnis in se deprehenderit exagitatam, he will have a very sure proof
   of his purity, so that training himself to this steadfast purity he
   will not only possess the blessing of chastity and freedom from
   defilement in his heart, but even if he is obliged to touch the body of
   a woman, he will be horrified at it.

   With this Abbot John brought his Conference to an end, as he saw that
   it was just time for the refreshment of the ninth hour.

CONFERENCE OF ABBOT PINUFIUS.

ON THE END OF PENITENCE AND THE MARKS OF SATISFACTION.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Of the humility of Abbot Pinufius, and of his hiding-place.

   NOW that I am going to relate the precepts of that excellent and
   remarkable man, Abbot Pinufius, on the end of penitence, I fancy that I
   can dispose of a very large part of my material, if out of
   consideration lest I weary my reader, I here pass over in silence the
   praise of his humility, which I touched on in a brief discourse in the
   fourth book of the Institutes, [1036] which was entitled "Of the rules
   to be observed by renunciants," especially as many who have no
   knowledge of that work, may happen to read this, and then all the
   authority of the utterances will be weakened if there is no account of
   the virtues of the speaker. For this man when he was presiding as Abbot
   and Presbyter over a large coenobium not far from Panephysis, a city,
   as was there said, of Egypt, and when all that province had praised him
   to the skies for his virtues and miracles, so that he already seemed to
   himself to have received the reward of his labours in the remuneration
   of the praise of men, as he was afraid lest the emptiness of popular
   favour, which he especially disliked, might interfere with the fruits
   of an eternal reward, he secretly fled from his monastery and made his
   way to the furthest recesses of the monks of Tabennæ, [1037] where he
   chose not the solitude of the desert, not that freedom from care of
   which the life of one alone affords, which even those who are imperfect
   and who cannot endure the effort which obedience requires in the
   coenobium, sometimes seek after with proud presumption, but he chose to
   submit himself to a most famous monastery. Where, however, that he
   might not be betrayed by any signs of his dress, he clothed himself in
   a secular garb, and lay before the doors with tears, as is the custom
   there, for many days, and clinging to the knees of all after being
   daily repulsed by those who to test his purpose said that now in
   extreme old age he was seeking this holy life not in sincerity, but
   driven by the lack of food, at last he obtained admission, and there he
   was told off to help a young brother who had been given the charge of a
   garden, and when he not only fulfilled with such marvellous and holy
   humility everything which his chief ordered him or which the care of
   the work entrusted to him demanded, but also performed in stealthy
   labour by night certain necessary offices which were avoided by the
   rest out of disgust for them, so that when morning dawned, all the
   congregation was delighted at such useful works but knew not their
   author; and when he had passed nearly three years there rejoicing in
   the labours, which he had desired, but to which he as so unfairly
   subjected, it happened that a certain brother known to him came there
   from the same parts of Egypt from which he himself had come. And this
   man for a time hesitated because the meanness of his clothes and of his
   office prevented him from readily recognizing him at once, but after
   looking very closely at him, fell at his feet, and first astonished all
   the brethren, and afterwards, when he betrayed his name, which the fame
   of his special sanctity had made known to them also, he smote them with
   sorrow and compunction because they had told off a man of his virtues
   and a priest to such mean offices. But he, shedding copious tears, and
   charging the accident of his betrayal to the serious envy of the devil,
   was brought in honourable custody by his brethren surrounding him to
   the monastery; and after that he had stayed there for a short time, he
   was once more troubled by the respect shown to his dignity and rank,
   and stealthily embarked on board ship and sailed to the Palestinian
   province of Syria, where he was received as a beginner and a novice in
   the house of that monastery in which we were living, and was charged by
   the Abbot to stop in our cell. But not even there could his virtues and
   merits long remain secret. For he was discovered and betrayed in the
   same way, and brought back to his own monastery with the utmost honour
   and respect.

  CHAPTER II.

    Of our coming to him.

   WHEN then after no long time a desire for holy instruction had urged us
   also to visit Egypt, we sought him out with the utmost eagerness and
   devotion and were welcomed by him with such kindness and courtesy that
   he actually honoured us, as former sharers of the same cell with him,
   with a lodging in his own cell which he had built in the furthest
   corner of his garden. And there when in the presence of all the
   brethren at service he had delivered to one of the brethren who was
   submitting to the rule of the monastery sufficiently difficult and
   elevated precepts, which as we said, I summarized as briefly as I could
   in the fourth book of the Institutes, the heights of a true
   renunciation seemed to us so unattainable and so marvellous that we did
   not think that such humble folks as we could ever scale them. And
   therefore, cast down in despair, and not concealing in our looks the
   inner bitterness of our thoughts, we came back to the blessed old man
   with a tolerably anxious heart: and when he at once asked the reason
   why we were so sad, Abbot Germanus groaned deeply and replied as
   follows.

  CHAPTER III.

    A question on the end of penitence and the marks of satisfaction.

   AS your grand and splendid exposition of a doctrine new to us has
   opened out to us a more difficult road to the most glorious
   renunciation, and has removed the scales from our eyes, and shown to us
   its summit raised in the heavens, so are we proportionately cast down
   with a greater weight of despair. Since, when we measure its vastness
   against our puny strength, and compare the excessively humble character
   of our ignorance with the boundless height of virtue shown to us, we
   feel that we are so small that we not only cannot attain to it, but
   that we are sure to fall short in what we have. For as we are weighed
   down by the burden of excessive despair, we fall away somehow from the
   lowest depths to still lower ones. Accordingly there is one and only
   one support which can provide a cure for our wounds; viz., for us to
   learn something of the end of penitence and especially on the marks of
   satisfaction, that we may feel sure of the forgiveness of past sins,
   and so be spurred on to scale the heights of the perfection described
   above.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    The answer on the humility shown by our request.

   PINUFIUS: I am indeed delighted at the very plentiful fruits of your
   humility, which indeed I saw with no indifferent concern, when I was
   formerly received in the habitation of that cell of yours, and I am
   very glad that you welcome with such respect the charge given by us,
   the least of all Christians, and the words that I have taken the
   liberty of saying so that if I am not mistaken you carry them out as
   soon as ever they are spoken by us; and though, as I remember, the
   importance of the words scarcely deserves the efforts you bestow on
   them, yet you so conceal the merits of your virtue, as if no breath
   ever reached you of those things which you are daily practising. But
   because this fact is worthy of the highest praise; viz., that you
   declare that those institutes of the saints are still unknown to you as
   if you were still beginners we will, as briefly as possible, summarize
   what you so eagerly ask of us. For we must even beyond our powers and
   ability, obey the commands of such old friends as you. And so on the
   value and appeasing power of penitence many have published a great
   deal, not only in words but also in writing, showing how useful it is,
   how strong, and full of grace, so that when God is offended by our past
   sins, and on the point of inflicting a most just punishment for such
   offences, it somehow, if it is not wrong to say so, stops Him, and, if
   I may so say, stays the right hand of the Avenger even against His
   will. But I have no doubt that all this is well known to you, either
   from your natural wisdom, or from your unwearied study of Holy
   Scripture, so that from this the first shoots, so to speak, of your
   conversion sprang up. Finally, you are anxious not about the character
   of penitence but about its end, and the marks of satisfaction, and so
   by a very shrewd question ask what has been left out by others.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    Of the method of penitence and the proof of pardon.

   WHEREFORE in order to satisfy as briefly and shortly as possible, your
   desire and question, the full and perfect description of penitence is,
   never again to yield to those sins for which we do penance, or for
   which our conscience is pricked. But the proof of satisfaction and
   pardon is for us to have expelled the love of them from our hearts. For
   each one may be sure that he is not yet free from his former sins as
   long as any image of those sins which he has committed or of others
   like them dances before his eyes, and I will not say a delight in--but
   the recollection of--them haunts his inmost soul while he is devoting
   himself to satisfaction for them and to tears. And so one who is on the
   watch to make satisfaction may then feel sure that he is free from his
   sins and that he has obtained pardon for past faults, when he never
   feels that his heart is stirred by the allurements and imaginations of
   these same sins. Wherefore the truest test of penitence and witness of
   pardon is found in our own conscience, which even before the day of
   judgment and of knowledge, while we are still in the flesh, discloses
   our acquittal from guilt, and reveals the end of satisfaction and the
   grace of forgiveness. And that what has been said may be more
   significantly expressed, then only should we believe that the stains of
   past sins are forgiven us, when the desires for present delights as
   well as the passions have been expelled from our heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    A question whether our sins ought to be remembered out of contrition of
    heart.

   GERMANUS: And whence can there be aroused in us this holy and salutary
   contrition from humiliation, which is described as follows in the
   person of the penitent: "I have acknowledged my sin, and mine
   unrighteousness have I not hid. I said: I will acknowledge against
   myself mine unrighteousness to the Lord," so that we may be able
   effectually to say also what follows: "And Thou forgavest the iniquity
   of my heart;" [1038] or how, when we kneel in prayer shall we be able
   to stir ourselves up to tears of confession, by which we may be able to
   obtain pardon for our offences, according to these words: "Every night
   will I wash my bed: I will water my couch with tears;" [1039] if we
   expel from our hearts all recollection of our faults, though on the
   contrary we are bidden carefully to preserve the remembrance of them,
   as the Lord says: "And thine iniquities I will not remember: but do
   thou recollect them"? [1040] Wherefore not only when I am at work, but
   also when I am at prayer I try of set purpose to recall to my mind the
   recollection of my sins, that I may be more effectually inclined to
   true humility and contrition of heart, and venture to say with the
   prophet: "Look upon my humility and my labour: and forgive me all my
   sins." [1041]

   [1041] Ps. 24 (25):18.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

    The answer showing how far we ought to preserve the recollection of previous
    actions.

   PINUFIUS: Your question, as has been already said above, was not raised
   with regard to the character of penitence, but with regard to its end,
   and the marks of satisfaction: to which, as I think, a fair and
   pertinent reply has been given. But what you have said as to the
   remembrance of sins is sufficiently useful and needful to men who are
   still doing penance, that they may with constant smiting of the breast
   say: "For I acknowledge my wickedness: and my sin is ever before me;"
   and this too: "And I will think for my sin." [1042] While then we do
   penance, and are still grieved by the recollection of faulty actions,
   the shower of tears which is caused by the confession of our faults is
   sure to quench the fire of our conscience. But when, while a man is
   still in this state of humility of heart and contrition of spirit and
   continuing to labour and to weep, the remembrance of these things fades
   away, and the thorns of conscience are by God's grace extracted from
   his inmost heart, then it is clear that he has attained to the end of
   satisfaction and the reward of pardon, and that he is purged from the
   stain of the sins he has committed. To which state of forgetfulness we
   can only attain by the obliteration of our former sins and likings, and
   by perfect and complete purity of heart. And this most certainly will
   not be attained by any of those who from sloth or carelessness have
   failed to purge out their faults, but only by one who by constantly
   continuing to groan and sigh sorrowfully has removed every spot of his
   former stains, and by the goodness of his heart and his labour has
   proclaimed to the Lord: "I have acknowledged my sin, and mine
   unrighteousness have I not hid;" and: "My tears have been my meat day
   and night;" so that in the end it may be vouchsafed to him to hear
   these words: "Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thine eyes from
   tears: for there is a reward for thy labour, saith the Lord;" [1043]
   and these words also may be uttered of him by the voice of the Lord: "I
   have blotted out as a cloud thine iniquities, and as a mist thy sins:"
   and again: "I even I am He that blotteth out thine iniquities for mine
   own sake, and thine offences I will no longer remember;" [1044] and so,
   when he is freed from the "cords of his sins," by which "everyone is
   bound," [1045] he will with all thanksgiving sing to the Lord: "Thou
   hast broken my chains: I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise."

  CHAPTER VIII.

    Of the various fruits of penitence.

   FOR after that grace of baptism which is common to all, and that most
   precious gift of martyrdom which is gained by being washed in blood,
   there are many fruits of penitence by which we can succeed in expiating
   our sins. For eternal salvation is not only promised to the bare fact
   of penitence, of which the blessed Apostle Peter says: "Repent and be
   converted that your sins may be forgiven;" and John the Baptist and the
   Lord Himself: "Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand:" [1047]
   but also by the affection of love is the weight of our sins
   overwhelmed: for "charity covers a multitude of sins." [1048] In the
   same way also by the fruits of almsgiving a remedy is provided for our
   wounds, because "As water extinguishes fire, so does almsgiving
   extinguish sin." [1049] So also by the shedding of tears is gained the
   washing away of offences, for "Every night I will wash my bed: I will
   water my couch with tears." Finally to show that they are not shed in
   vain, he adds: "Depart from me all ye that work iniquity, for the Lord
   hath heard the voice of my weeping." [1050] Moreover by means of
   confession of sins, their absolution is granted: for "I said: I will
   confess against myself my sin to the Lord: and Thou forgavest the
   iniquity of my heart;" and again: "Declare thine iniquities first, that
   thou mayest be justified." [1051] By afflicting the heart and body also
   is forgiveness of sins committed in like manner obtained, for he says:
   "Look on my humility and my labour, and forgive me all my sins;" and
   more especially by amendment of life: "Take away," he says, "the evil
   of your thoughts from mine eyes. Cease to do evil, learn to do well.
   Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed: judge the orphan, defend the
   widow. And come, reason with Me, saith the Lord: and though your sins
   were as scarlet, yet shall they be as white as snow, though they were
   red as crimson, they shall be as white as wool." [1052] Sometimes too
   the pardon of our sins is obtained by the intercession of the saints,
   for "if a man knows his brother to sin a sin not unto death, he asks,
   and He will give to him his life, for him that sinneth not unto death;"
   and again: "Is any sick among you? Let him send for the Elders of the
   Church and they shall pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name
   of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
   will raise him up, and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him."
   [1053] Sometimes too by the virtue of compassion and faith the stains
   of sin are removed, according to this passage: "By compassion and faith
   sins are purged away." [1054] And often by the conversion and salvation
   of those who are saved by our warnings and preaching: "For he who
   converts a sinner from the error of his way, shall save his soul from
   death, and cover a multitude of sins." [1055] Moreover by pardon and
   forgiveness on our part we obtain pardon of our sins: "For if ye
   forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will also forgive you
   your sins." [1056] You see then what great means of obtaining mercy the
   compassion of our Saviour has laid open to us, so that no one when
   longing for salvation need be crushed by despair, as he sees himself
   called to life by so many remedies. For if you plead that owing to
   weakness of the flesh you cannot get rid of your sins by fasting, and
   you cannot say: "My knees are weak from fasting, and my flesh is
   changed for oil; for I have eaten ashes for my bread, and mingled my
   drink with weeping," [1057] then atone for them by profuse almsgiving.
   If you have nothing that you can give to the needy (although the claims
   of want and poverty exclude none from this office, since the two mites
   of the widow are ranked higher than the splendid gifts of the rich, and
   the Lord promises that He will give a reward for a cup of cold water),
   at least you can purge them away by amendment of life. But if you
   cannot secure perfection in goodness by the eradication of all your
   faults, you can show a pious anxiety for the good and salvation of
   another. But if you complain that you are not equal to this service,
   you can cover your sins by the affection of love. And if in this also
   some sluggishness of mind makes you weak, at least you should
   submissively with a feeling of humility entreat for remedies for your
   wounds by the prayers and intercession of the saints. Finally who is
   there who cannot humbly say: "I have acknowledged my sin: and mine
   unrighteousness have I not hid;" so that by this confession he may be
   able also to add this: "And Thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart."
   [1058] But if shame holds you back, and you blush to reveal them before
   men, you should not cease to confess them with constant supplication to
   Him from Whom they cannot be hid, and to say to Him: "I acknowledge
   mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against Thee only have I
   sinned, and have done evil before Thee;" [1059] as He is wont to heal
   them without any publication which brings shame, and to forgive sins
   without any reproaching. And further besides that ready and sure aid
   the Divine condescension has afforded us another also that is still
   easier, and has entrusted the possession of the remedy to our own will,
   so that we can infer from our own feelings the forgiveness of our
   offences, when we say to Him: "Forgive us our debts as we also forgive
   our debtors." [1060] Whoever then desires to obtain forgiveness of his
   sins, should study to fit himself for it by these means. Let not the
   stubbornness of an obdurate heart turn away any from the saving remedy
   and the fount of so much goodness, because even if we have done all
   these things, they will not be able to expiate our offences, unless
   they are blotted out by the goodness and mercy of the Lord, who when He
   sees the service of pious efforts offered by us with a humble heart,
   supports our small and puny efforts with the utmost bounty, and says:
   "I even I am He that blotteth out thine iniquities for Mine own sake,
   and I will remember thy sins no more." [1061] Whoever then is aiming at
   this condition, which we have mentioned, will seek the grace of
   satisfaction by daily fasting and mortification of heart and body, for,
   as it is written, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission;"
   [1062] and this not without good reason. For "flesh and blood cannot
   inherit the kingdom of God." [1063] And therefore one who would
   withhold "the sword of the spirit which is the word of God" [1064] from
   this shedding of blood certainly comes under the lash of that curse of
   Jeremiah's; for "Cursed," says he "is he who withholds his sword from
   blood." [1065] For this is the sword which for our good sheds that bad
   blood whereby the material of our sins lives; and cuts off and pares
   away everything carnal and earthly which it finds to have grown up in
   the members of our soul; and makes men die to sin and live to God, and
   flourish with spiritual virtues. And so he will begin to weep no more
   at the recollection of former sins, but at the hope of what is to come,
   and, thinking less of past evils than of good things to come, will shed
   tears not from sorrow at his sins, but from delight in that eternal
   joy, and "forgetting those things which are behind," i.e., carnal sins,
   will press on "to those before," [1066] i.e., to spiritual gifts and
   virtues.

  CHAPTER IX.

    How valuable to the perfect is the forgetfulness of sin.

   BUT with regard to this that you said a little way back; viz., that you
   of set purpose go over the recollections of past sins, this ought
   certainly not to be done, nay, if it forcibly surprises you, it must be
   at once expelled. For it greatly hinders the soul from the
   contemplation of purity, and especially in the case of one who is
   living in solitude, as it entangles him in the stains of this world and
   swamps him in foul sins. For while you are recalling those things which
   you did through ignorance or wantonness in accordance with the prince
   of this world, though I grant you that while you are engaged in these
   thoughts no delight in them steals in, yet at least the mere taint of
   the ancient filthiness is sure to corrupt your soul with its foul
   stink, and to shut out the spiritual fragrance of goodness, i.e., the
   odour of a sweet savour. When then the recollection of past sins comes
   over your mind, you must recoil from it just as an honest and upright
   man runs away if he is sought out in public by an immodest and wanton
   woman either by words or by embraces. And certainly unless he at once
   withdraws himself from contact with her, and if he allows himself to
   linger the very least in impure talk, even if he refuses his consent to
   the shameful pleasures, yet he cannot avoid the brand of infamy and
   scorn in the judgment of all the passers by. So then we also, if by
   noxious recollections we are led to thoughts of this kind, ought at
   once to desist from dwelling upon them and to fulfil what we are
   commanded by Solomon: "But go forth," says he, "do not linger in her
   place, nor fix thine eye on her;" [1067] lest if the angels see us
   taken up with unclean and foul thoughts, they may not be able to say to
   us in passing by: "The blessing of the Lord be upon you." [1068] For it
   is impossible for the soul to continue in good thoughts, when the main
   part of the heart is taken up with foul and earthly considerations. For
   this saying of Solomon's is true: "When thine eyes look on a strange
   woman, then shall thy mouth speak wickedly, and thou shalt lie as it
   were in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot in a great storm. But thou
   shalt say: They have beaten me, but I felt no pain; and they mocked me,
   but I felt not." [1069] So then we should forsake not only all foul but
   even all earthly thoughts and ever raise the desires of our soul to
   heavenly things, in accordance with this saying of our Saviour: "For
   where I am," He says, "there also shall My servant be." [1070] For it
   often happens that when anyone out of pity is in thought going over his
   own falls or those of other faulty persons, he is affected by the
   delight and assent to this most subtle attack, and that which was
   undertaken and started with a show of goodness ends with a filthy and
   damaging termination, for "there are ways which appear to men to be
   right, but the ends thereof will come to the depths of hell." [1071]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

    How the recollection of our sins should be avoided.

   WHEREFORE we must endeavour to rouse ourselves to this praiseworthy
   contrition, by aiming at virtue and by the desire for the kingdom of
   heaven rather than by dangerous recollections of sins, for a man is
   sure to be suffocated by the pestilential smells of the sewer as long
   as he chooses to stand over it or to stir its filth.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    Of the marks of satisfaction, and the removal of past sins.

   BUT we know, as we have often said, that then only have we made
   satisfaction for past sins, when the very motions and feelings, through
   which, we were guilty of what we have to sorrow for, have been
   eradicated from our hearts. But no one should fancy that he can secure
   this, unless he has first with all the fervour of his spirit cut off
   the opportunities and occasions, owing to which he fell into those
   sins; as for instance, if through dangerous familiarity with a woman he
   has fallen into fornication or adultery, he must take the utmost pains
   to avoid even looking on one; or if he has been overcome by too much
   wine and over-eating, he should chastise with the utmost severity his
   craving for immoderate food. And again if he has been led astray by the
   desire for and love of money, and has fallen into perjury or theft or
   murder or blasphemy, he should cut off the occasion for avarice, which
   has allured and deceived him. If he is driven by the passion of pride
   into the sin of anger, he should with all the virtue of humility,
   remove the incentive to arrogance. And so, in order that each single
   sin may be destroyed, the occasion and opportunity by which or for
   which it was committed should be first got rid of. For by this curative
   treatment we can certainly attain to forgetfulness of the sins we have
   committed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    Wherein we must do penance for a time only; and wherein it can have no end.

   BUT that description of the forgetfulness spoken of only has to do with
   capital offences, which are also condemned by the mosaic law, the
   inclination to which is destroyed and put an end to by a good life, and
   so also the penance for them has an end. But for those small offences
   in which, as it is written, "the righteous falls seven times and will
   rise again" [1072] penitence will never cease. For either through
   ignorance, or forgetfulness, or thought, or word, or surprise, or
   necessity, or weakness of the flesh, or defilement in a dream, we often
   fall every day either against our will or voluntarily; offences for
   which David also prays the Lord, and asks for purification and pardon,
   and says: "Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me; and
   from those of others spare Thy servant;" and the Apostle: "For the good
   which I would I do not, and the evil which I would not, that I do." For
   which also the same man exclaims with a sigh "O wretched man that I am!
   who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" [1073] For we slip
   into these so easily as it were by a law of nature, that however
   carefully and guardedly we are on the lookout against them, we cannot
   altogether avoid them. Since it was of these that one of the disciples,
   whom Jesus loved, declared and laid down absolutely saying: "If we say
   that we have no sin we deceive ourselves, and His word is not in us."
   [1074] Further for a man who is anxious to reach the heights of
   perfection it will not greatly help him to have arrived at the end of
   penitence, i.e., to restrain himself from unlawful acts, unless he has
   always urged himself forward in unwearied course to those virtues
   whereby we come to the signs of satisfaction. For it will not be enough
   for a man to have kept himself clear from those foul stains of sins
   which the Lord hates, unless he has also secured by purity of heart and
   perfect Apostolical love that sweet fragrance of virtue in which the
   Lord delights.

   Thus far Abbot Pinufius discoursed on the marks of satisfaction and the
   end of penitence. And although he pressed us with anxious love to
   decide to stay in his coenobium, yet when he could not retain us, as we
   were incited by the fame of the desert of Scete, he sent us on our way.

THE FIRST CONFERENCE OF ABBOT THEONAS.

ON THE RELAXATION DURING THE FIFTY DAYS. [1075]
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER. I.

    How Theonas came to Abbot John.

   BEFORE we begin to set forth the words of this Conference held with
   that excellent man Abbot Theonas, [1076] I think it well to describe in
   a brief discourse the origin of his conversion because from this the
   reader will be able to see more clearly both the excellence and the
   grace of the man. He then while still very young was by the desire and
   command of his parents joined in the tie of marriage, for as with pious
   anxiety they were careful about his chastity, and were afraid of a
   critical fall at a dangerous age, they thought that the passions of
   youth might be anticipated by the remedy of a lawful marriage. When
   then he had lived for five years with a wife, he came to Abbot John,
   who was then for his marvellous sanctity chosen to preside over the
   administration of the alms. [1077] For it is not anyone who likes who
   is of his own wish or ambition promoted to this office, but only he
   whom the congregation of all the Elders considers from the advantage of
   his age and the witness of his faith and virtues to be more excellent
   than, and superior to, all others. To this blessed John then the
   aforesaid young man had come in the eagerness of his pious devotion,
   bringing gifts of piety among other owners who were eager to offer
   tithes and first-fruits of their substance to the old man I mentioned,
   [1078] and when the old man saw them pouring in upon him with many
   gifts, and was anxious to make some recompense in return for their
   offerings, he began, as the Apostle says, to sow spiritual things to
   them whose carnal gifts he was reaping. [1079] And finally thus began
   his word of exhortation.

   [1078] This is noteworthy as being the earliest instance on record of
   the payment of tithes to a monastery. The language of the Conference,
   it will be noted, shows that they were not regarded as legally due or
   in any way compulsory, but as a free-will offering on the part of the
   faithful. Cf. Bingham, Antiquities, Book VII. ciii. § 19; and the

  CHAPTER II.

    The exhortation of Abbot John to Theonas and the others who had come
    together with him.

   I AM indeed delighted, my children, with the duteous liberality of your
   gifts; and your devout offering, the disposal of which is entrusted to
   me, I gratefully accept, because you are offering your firstfruits and
   tithes for the good and use of the needy, as a sacrifice to the Lord,
   of a sweet smelling savour, in the belief that by the offering of them,
   the abundance of your fruits and all your substance, from which you
   have taken away these for the Lord, will be richly blessed, and that
   you yourselves will according to the faith of His command be endowed
   even in this world with manifold richness in all good things: "Honour
   the Lord from thy righteous labours, and offer to Him of the fruits of
   thy righteousness; that thy garners may be full of abundance of wheat,
   and thy vats may overflow with wine." [1080] And as you are faithfully
   carrying out this service, you may know that you have fulfilled the
   righteousness of the old law, under which those who then lived if they
   transgressed it inevitably incurred guilt, while if they fulfilled it
   they could not attain to a pitch of perfection.

  CHAPTER III.

    Of the offering of tithes and firstfruits.

   FOR indeed by the Lord's command tithes were consecrated to the service
   of the Levites, but oblations and firstfruits for the priests. [1081]
   But this was the law of the firstfruits; viz., that the fiftieth part
   of fruits or animals should be given for the service of the temple and
   the priests: and this proportion some who were faithlessly indifferent
   diminished, while those who were very religious increased it, so that
   the one gave only the sixtieth part, and the other gave the fortieth
   part of their fruits. For the righteous, for whom the law is not
   enacted, are thus shown to be not under the law, as they try not only
   to fulfil but even to exceed the righteousness of the law, and their
   devotion is greater than the legal requirement, as it goes beyond the
   observance of precepts and adds to what is due of its own free will.

  CHAPTER IV.

    How Abraham, David, and other saints went beyond the requirement of the law.

   FOR so we read that Abraham went beyond the requirement of the law
   which was afterwards to be given, when after his victory over the four
   kings, he would not touch any of the spoils of Sodom, which were fairly
   due to him as the conqueror, and which indeed the king himself, whose
   spoils he had rescued, offered him; and with an oath by the Divine name
   he exclaimed: "I lift up my hand to the Lord Most High, who made heaven
   and earth, that I will not take from a thread to a shoe's latchet of
   all that is thine." [1082] So we know that David went beyond the
   requirement of the law, as, though Moses commanded that vengeance
   should be taken on enemies, [1083] he not only did not do this, but
   actually embraced his persecutors with love, and piously entreated the
   Lord for them, and wept bitterly and avenged them when they were slain.
   So we are sure that Elijah and Jeremiah were not under the law, as
   though they might without blame have taken advantage of lawful
   matrimony, yet they preferred to remain virgins. So we read that Elisha
   and others of the same mode of life went beyond the commands of Moses,
   as of them the Apostle speaks as follows: "They went about in
   sheepskins and in goatskins, they were oppressed, afflicted, in want,
   of whom the world was not worthy, they wandered about in deserts and in
   mountains, and in caves and in dens of the earth." [1084] What shall I
   say of the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab, of whom we are told that,
   when at the Lord's bidding the prophet Jeremiah offered them wine, they
   replied: "We drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father,
   commanded us, saying: Ye shall drink no wine, ye and your sons forever:
   and ye shall build no house, nor sow any seed, nor plant vineyards nor
   possess them: but ye shall dwell in tents all your days"? Wherefore
   also they were permitted to hear from the same prophet these words:
   "Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: there shall not
   fail a man from the stock of Jonadab the son of Rechab to stand in My
   sight all the days;" [1085] as all of them were not satisfied with
   merely offering tithes of their possessions, but actually refused
   property, and offered the rather to God themselves and their souls, for
   which no redemption can be made by man, as the Lord testifies in the
   gospel: "For what shall a man give in exchange for his own soul?"

  CHAPTER V.

    How those who live under the grace of the Gospel ought to go beyond the
    requirement of the law.

   WHEREFORE we ought to know that we from whom the requirements of the
   law are no longer exacted, but in whose ears the word of the gospel
   daily sounds: "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast
   and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come
   follow Me," [1087] when we offer to God tithes of our substance, are
   still in a way ground down beneath the burden of the law, and not able
   to rise to those heights of the gospel, those who conform to which are
   recompensed not only by blessings in this present life, but also by
   future rewards. For the law promises to those who obey it no rewards of
   the kingdom of heaven, but only solaces in this life, saying: "The man
   that doeth these things shall live in them." [1088] But the Lord says
   to His disciples: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
   kingdom of heaven;" and: "Everyone that leaveth house or brothers or
   sisters or father or mother or wife or children or field for My name's
   sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life."
   [1089] And this with good reason. For it is not so praiseworthy for us
   to abstain from forbidden as from lawful things, and not to use these
   last out of reverence for Him, Who has permitted us to use them because
   of our weakness. And so if even those who, faithfully offering tithes
   of their fruits, are obedient to the more ancient precepts of the Lord,
   cannot yet climb the heights of the gospel, you can see very clearly
   how far short of it those fall who do not even do this. For how can
   those men be partakers of the grace of the gospel who disregard the
   fulfilment even of the lighter commands of the law, to the easy
   character of which the weighty words of the giver of the law bear
   testimony, as a curse is actually invoked on those who do not fulfil
   them; for it says: "Cursed is everyone that does not continue in all
   things that are written in the book of the law to do them." [1090] But
   here on account of the superiority and excellence of the commandments
   it is said: "He that can receive it, let him receive it." [1091] There
   the forcible compulsion of the lawgiver shows the easy character of the
   precepts; for he says: "I call heaven and earth to record against you
   this day, that if ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord your God
   ye shall perish from off the face of the earth." [1092] Here the
   grandeur of sublime commands is shown by the very fact that He does not
   order, but exhorts, saying: "if thou wilt be perfect go" and do this or
   that. There Moses lays a burden that cannot be refused on those who are
   unwilling: here Paul meets with counsels those who are willing and
   eager for perfection. For that was not to be enjoined as a general
   charge, nor to be required, if I may so say, as a regular rule from
   all, which could not be secured by all, owing to its wonderful and
   lofty nature; but by counsels all are rather stimulated to grace, that
   those who are great may deservedly be crowned by the perfection of
   their virtues, while those who are small, and not able to come up to
   "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ," [1093] although
   they seem to be lost to sight and hidden as it were by the brightness
   of larger stars, may yet be free from the darkness of the curses which
   are in the law, and not adjudged to suffer present evils or visited
   with eternal punishment. Christ therefore does not constrain anyone, by
   the compulsion of a command, to those lofty heights of goodness, but
   stimulates them by the power of free will, and urges them on by wise
   counsels and the desire of perfection. For where there is a command,
   there is duty, and consequently punishment. But those who keep those
   things to which they are driven by the severity of the law established
   escape the punishment with which they were threatened, instead of
   obtaining rewards and a recompense.

  CHAPTER VI.

    How the grace of the gospel supports the weak so that they can obtain
    pardon, as it secures to the perfect the kingdom of God.

   AND as the word of the gospel raises those that are strong to sublime
   and lofty heights, so it suffers not the weak to be dragged down to the
   depths, for it secures to the perfect the fulness of blessing, and
   brings to those who are overcome through weakness pardon. For the law
   placed those who fulfilled its commands in a sort of middle state
   between what they deserved in either case, severing them from the
   condemnation due to transgressors, as it also kept them away from the
   glory of the perfect. But how wretched and miserable this is, you can
   see from comparing the state of this present life, in which it is
   considered a very poor thing for a man to sweat and labour only to
   avoid being regarded as guilty among good men, not also to be esteemed
   rich and honourable and renowned.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

    How it lies in our own power to choose whether to remain under the grace of
    the gospel or under the terror of the law.

   WHEREFORE it lies today in our own power whether we choose to live
   under the grace of the gospel or under the terrors of the law: for each
   man must incline to one side or the other in accordance with the
   character of his actions, for either the grace of Christ welcomes those
   who go beyond the law, or else the law keeps its hold over the weaker
   ones as those who are its debtors and within its clutches. For one who
   is guilty as regards the precepts of the law will never be able to
   attain to the perfection of the gospel, even though he idly boasts that
   he is a Christian and freed by the Lord's grace: for we must not only
   regard as still under the law the man who refuses to fulfil what the
   law enjoins, but the man as well who is satisfied with the mere
   observance of what the law commands, and who never brings forth fruits
   worthy of his vocation and the grace of Christ, where it is not said:
   "Thou shalt offer to the Lord thy God thy tithes and firstfruits;" but:
   "Go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and come follow
   Me;" [1094] where, owing to the grandeur of perfection, to the request
   of the disciple there is not granted even the very short space of an
   hour in which to bury his father, [1095] as the offices of human
   charity are outweighed by the virtue of Divine love.

  CHAPTER VIII.

    How Theonas exhorted his wife that she too should make her renunciation.

   AND when he had heard this the blessed Theonas was fired with an
   uncontrollable desire for the perfection of the gospel, and, committed,
   as it were, the seed of the word, which he had received in a fruitful
   heart, to the deep and broken furrows of his bosom, as he was greatly
   humiliated and conscience-stricken because the old man had said not
   only that he had failed to attain to the perfection of the gospel, but
   also that he had scarcely fulfilled the commands of the law; since
   though he was accustomed every year to pay the tithes of his fruits as
   alms, yet he mourned that he had never even heard of the law of the
   firstfruits; and even if he had in the same way fulfilled this, he
   humbly confessed that still he would in the old man's view have been
   very far from the perfection of the gospel. And so he returned home sad
   and filled with that sorrow which worketh repentance unto salvation,
   [1096] and of his own will and determination turns all his wife's care
   and anxiety of mind towards salvation; and began to stir her up to the
   same eager desire with which he himself had been inflamed, with the
   same sort of exhortations, and with tears day and night to urge her
   that together they might serve God in sanctity and chastity, telling
   her that their conversion to a better life ought not to be deferred
   because a vain hope in their youth would be no argument against the
   inevitableness of a sudden death, which carries off boys and youths and
   young persons equally with old men.

  CHAPTER IX.

    How he fled to a monastery when his wife would not consent.

   AND when his wife was hard and would not consent to him as he
   constantly persisted with entreaties of this kind, but said that as she
   was in the flower of her age she could not altogether do without the
   solace of her husband, and further that supposing she was deserted by
   him and fell into sin, the guilt would rather be his who had broken the
   bonds of wedlock: to this he, when he had for a long while urged the
   condition of human nature (which being so weak and uncertain, it would
   be dangerous for it to be any longer mixed up with carnal desires and
   works), added the assertion that it was not right for anyone to cut
   himself off from that virtue to which he had learnt that he ought by
   all means to cleave, and that it was more dangerous to disregard
   goodness when discovered, than to fail to love it before it was
   discovered; further that he was already involved in the guilt of a fall
   if when he had discovered such grand and heavenly blessings he had
   preferred earthly and mean ones. Further that the grandeur of
   perfection was open to every age and either sex, and that all the
   members of the Church were urged to scale the heights of heavenly
   goodness when the Apostle said: "So run that ye may obtain;" [1097] nor
   should those who were ready and eager for it hang back because of the
   delays of the slow and dawdlers, as it is better for the sluggards to
   be urged on by those running before than for those who are doing their
   best to be hampered by the slothful. Further that he had determined and
   made up his mind to renounce the world and to die to the world that he
   might live to God, and that if he could not attain this happiness;
   viz., to pass with his wife into union with Christ, he would rather be
   saved even with the loss of one member, and enter into the kingdom of
   heaven as one maimed rather than be condemned with his body whole. But
   he also added and spoke as follows: If Moses suffered wives to be
   divorced for the hardness of their hearts, why should not Christ allow
   this for the desire of chastity, especially when the same Lord among
   those other affections; viz., for fathers and mothers and children (all
   due regard to which not only the law but He Himself also charged to be
   shown, yet for His name's sake and for the desire of perfection He
   decreed that they should not simply be disregarded but actually
   hated)--to these, I say, He joined also the mention of wives, saying:
   "And everyone that hath left house, or brethren or sisters or father or
   mother or wife or children for My name's sake, shall receive an
   hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life." [1098] So far then is He
   from allowing anything to be set against that perfection which He is
   proclaiming, that He actually enjoins that the ties to father and
   mother should be broken and disregarded out of love for Him, though
   according to the Apostle it is the first commandment with promise;
   viz., "Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment
   with promise, that it may be well with thee and that thy days may be
   long upon earth." [1099] And as the word of the gospel condemns those
   who break the chains of matrimony where there has been no sin of
   adultery, so it clearly promises a reward of an hundredfold to those
   who have cast off a carnal yoke out of love for Christ and the desire
   for chastity. Wherefore if it can be brought about that you may listen
   to reason and be turned together with me to this most desirable choice;
   viz., that we should together serve the Lord and escape the pains of
   hell, I will not refuse the affection of marriage, nay I will embrace
   it with a still greater love. For I acknowledge and honour my helpmeet
   assigned to me by the word of the Lord, and I do not refuse to be
   joined to her in an unbroken tie of love in Christ, nor do I separate
   from me what the Lord joined to me by the law of the original
   condition, [1100] if only you yourself will be what your Maker meant
   you to be. But if you will not be a helpmeet, but prefer to make
   yourself a deceiver and an assistance not to me but to the adversary,
   and fancy that the sacrament of matrimony was granted to you for this
   reason that you may deprive yourself of this salvation which is offered
   to you, and also hold me back from following the Saviour as a disciple,
   then I will resolutely lay hold on the words which were uttered by the
   lips of Abbot John, or rather of Christ Himself, so that no carnal
   affection may be able to tear me away from spiritual blessings, for He
   says: "He that hateth not father and mother and children and brothers
   and sisters and wife and lands, yea and his own soul also, cannot be My
   disciple." [1101] When then by these and such like words the woman's
   purpose was not moved and she persisted in the same obstinate hardness,
   If, said the blessed Theonas, I cannot drag you away from death,
   neither shall you separate me from Christ: but it is safer for me to be
   divorced from a human person than from God. And so by the aid of God's
   grace he at once set about the execution of his purpose and suffered
   not the ardour of his desire to grow cool through any delay. For at
   once he stripped himself of all his worldly goods, and fled to a
   monastery, where in a very short time he was so famous for the
   splendour of his sanctity and humility that when John of blessed memory
   departed this life to the Lord, and the holy Elias, a man who was no
   less great than his predecessor, had likewise died, Theonas was chosen
   by the judgment of all as the third to succeed them in the
   administration of the almsgiving.

  CHAPTER X.

    An explanation that we may not appear to recommend separation from wives.

   BUT let no one imagine that we have invented this for the sake of
   encouraging divorce, as we not only in no way condemn marriage, but
   also, following the words of the Apostle, say: "Marriage is honourable
   in all, and the bed undefiled," [1102] but it was in order faithfully
   to show the reader the origin of the conversion by which this great man
   was dedicated to God. And I ask the reader kindly to allow that,
   whether he likes this or no, in either case I am free from blame, and
   to give the praise or blame for this act to its real author. But as for
   me, as I have not put forward an opinion of my own on this matter, but
   have given a simple narration of the history of the facts, it is fair
   that as I claim no praise from those who approve of what was done, so I
   should not be attacked by the hatred of those who disapprove of it. Let
   every man therefore, as we said, have his own opinion on the matter.
   But I advise him to restrain his censure in considering it, lest he
   come to fancy that he is more just and holy than the Divine judgment,
   whereby the signs even of Apostolic virtue were conferred upon him
   (viz., Theonas), not to mention the opinion of such great fathers by
   whom it is clear that his action was not only not blamed, but even so
   far praised that in the election to the office of almoner they
   preferred him to splendid and most excellent men. And I fancy that the
   judgment of so many spiritual men, uttered with God as its author, was
   not wrong, as it was, as was said above, confirmed by such wonderful
   signs.

  CHAPTER XI.

    An inquiry why in Egypt they do not fast during all the fifty days (of
    Easter) nor bend their knees in prayer.

   BUT it is now time to follow out the plan of the promised discourse. So
   then when Abbot Theonas had come to visit us in our cell during
   Eastertide [1103] after Evensong was over we sat for a little while on
   the ground and began diligently to consider why they were so very
   careful that no one should during the whole fifty days either bend his
   knees in prayer [1104] or venture to fast till the ninth hour, and we
   made our inquiry the more earnestly because we had never seen this
   custom so carefully observed in the monasteries of Syria.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1103] Quinquagesima.

   [1104] The 20th Canon of the Council of Nicæa (A.D. 325) alludes to
   diversities of custom with regard to posture for prayer on Sundays and
   from Easter to Pentecost, and ordered that for the future prayer should
   be made standing at these times. Cassian's language in the text would
   seem to show that in his day the Canon in question, though kept in
   Egypt, was not strictly observed in Palestine, but that the ancient
   diversity of customs still to some extent prevailed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

    The answer on the nature of things good, bad, and indifferent.

   TO this Abbot Theonas thus began his reply. It is indeed right for us,
   even when we cannot see the reason, to yield to the authority of the
   fathers and to a custom of our predecessors that has been continued
   through so many years down to our own time, and to observe it, as
   handed down from antiquity, with constant care and reverence. But since
   you want to know the reasons and grounds for this, receive in few words
   what we have heard as handed down by our Elders on this subject. But
   before we bring forward the authority of Holy Scripture, we will, if
   you please, say a little about the nature and character of the fast,
   that afterwards the authority of Holy Scripture may support our words.
   The Divine Wisdom has pointed out in Ecclesiastes that for everything,
   i.e., for all things happy or those which are considered unfortunate
   and unhappy, there is a right time: saying: "For all things there is a
   time, and a time for everything under the heaven. A time to bring forth
   and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to pull down what is
   planted; a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to destroy and a
   time to build; a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and
   a time to dance; a time to cast away stones and a time to gather
   stones; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing; a time
   to get and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to send away; a
   time to scatter and a time to collect; a time to be silent and a time
   to speak; a time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time
   for peace;" and below: "For there is a time," it says, "for everything
   and for every deed." [1105] None therefore of these things does it lay
   down as always good, but only when any of them are fittingly done and
   at the right time, so that these very things which at one time, when
   done at the right moment, turn out well, if they are ventured on at a
   wrong or unsuitable time, are found to be useless or harmful; only
   excepting those things which are in their own nature good or bad, and
   which cannot ever be made the opposite, as, e.g., justice, prudence,
   fortitude, temperance and the rest of the virtues, or on the other
   hand, those faults, the description of which cannot possibly be altered
   or fall under the other head. But those things which can sometimes turn
   out with either result, so that, in accordance with the character of
   those who use them, they are found to be either good or bad, these we
   consider to be not absolutely in their own natures useful or injurious,
   but only so in accordance with the mind of the doer, and the
   suitableness of the time.

  CHAPTER XIII.

    What kind of good fasting is.

   WHEREFORE we must now inquire what we ought to hold about the state of
   fasting, whether we meant that it was good in the same sort of way as
   justice, prudence, fortitude and temperance, which cannot possibly be
   made anything else, or whether it is something indifferent which
   sometimes is useful when done, and may be sometimes omitted without
   condemnation; and which sometimes it is wrong to do, and sometimes
   laudable to omit. For if we hold fasting to be included in that list of
   virtues, so that abstinence from food is placed among those things
   which are good in themselves, then certainly the partaking of food will
   be bad and wrong. For whatever is the opposite of that which is in its
   own nature good, must certainly be held to be in its own nature bad.
   But this the authority of Holy Scripture does not allow to us to lay
   down. For if we fast with such thoughts and intentions, so as to think
   that we fall into sin by taking food, we shall not only gain no
   advantage by our abstinence but shall actually contract grievous guilt
   and fall into the sin of impiety, as the Apostle says: "Abstaining from
   meats which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by the
   faithful and those who know the truth. For every creature of God is
   good, and nothing to be refused if it is partaken of with
   thanksgiving." For "if a man thinks that a thing is common, to him it
   is common." [1106] And therefore we never read that anyone is condemned
   simply for taking food, but only when something was joined with it or
   followed afterwards, for which he deserved condemnation.

  CHAPTER XIV.

    How fasting is not good in its own nature.

   AND so that it is a thing indifferent is very clearly shown from this
   also; viz., because as it brings justification when observed, so it
   does not bring condemnation when it is broken in upon; unless perhaps
   the transgression of a command rather than the partaking of food brings
   punishment. But in the case of a thing that is good in its own nature,
   no time should be without it, in such a way as that a man may do
   without it, for if it ceases, the man who is careless about it is sure
   to fall into mischief. Nor again is any time given for what is bad in
   its own nature, because what is hurtful cannot help hurting, if it is
   indulged in, nor can it ever be made of a praiseworthy character. And
   further it is clear that these things, for which we see conditions and
   times appointed, and which sanctify, when observed without corrupting
   us when they are neglected, are things indifferent, as, e.g., marriage,
   agriculture, riches, retirement into the desert, vigils, reading and
   meditation on Holy Scripture and fasting itself, from which our
   discussion took its rise. All of which things the Divine precepts and
   the authority of Holy Scripture decreed should not be so incessantly
   aimed at, or so constantly observed, as for it to be wrong for them to
   be for a time intermitted. For anything that is absolutely commanded
   brings death if it be not fulfilled: but whatever things we are urged
   to rather than commanded, when done are useful, when left undone bring
   no punishment. And therefore in the case of all or some of these things
   our predecessors commanded us either to do them with consideration, or
   to observe them carefully with regard to the reason, place, manner, and
   time, because if any of them are done suitably, it is fit and
   convenient, but if incongruously, then it becomes foolish and hurtful.
   And if at the coming of a brother in whose person he ought to refresh
   Christ with courtesy and to embrace him with a most kindly welcome, a
   man should choose to observe a strict fast, would he not rather be
   guilty of incivility than gain the praise or reward of devoutness? or
   if when the failure or weakness of the flesh requires the strength to
   be restored by the partaking of food, a man will not consent to relax
   the rigour of his abstinence, is he not to be regarded as a cruel
   murderer of his own body rather than as one who is careful for his
   salvation? So too when a festival season permits a suitable indulgence
   in food and a necessarily liberal repast, if a man will resolutely
   cling to the strict observance of a fast he must be considered as not
   religious so much as boorish and unreasonable. But to those men also
   will these things be found bad, who are on the lookout for the praises
   of men by their fasts, and by a foolish show of paleness gain credit
   for sanctity, of whom the word of the Gospel tells us that they have
   received their reward in this life, and whose fast the Lord execrates
   by the prophet. In whose person he first objected to himself and said:
   "Wherefore have we fasted and Thou hast not regarded: wherefore have we
   humbled our souls, and Thou hast not known it?" and then at once he
   answered and explained the reasons why they did not deserve to be
   heard: "Behold," he says, "in the days of your fast your own will is
   found and you exact of all your debtors. Behold you fast for debates
   and strife, and strike with the fist wickedly. Do not fast as ye have
   done unto this day, to make your cry to be heard on high. Is this such
   a fast as I have chosen, for a man to afflict his soul for a day? Is it
   this, to wind his head about like a circle, and to spread sackcloth and
   ashes? Will ye call this a fast and a day acceptable o the Lord?" Then
   he proceeds to teach how the abstinence of one who fasts may become
   acceptable, and clearly lays down that fasting cannot be good of itself
   alone, but only when it has the following reasons which are added: "Is
   not this," he says, "the fast that I have chosen? Loose the bands of
   wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress, let them that are broken go
   free, and break asunder every burden. Deal thy bread to the hungry, and
   bring the needy and the harbourless into thine house: and when thou
   shalt see one naked cover him, and despise not thine own flesh. Then
   shalt thy light break forth as the morning and thy health shall
   speedily arise, and thy righteousness shall go before thy face and the
   glory of the Lord shall gather thee up. Then shalt thou call, and the
   Lord shall hear: thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I." [1107]
   You see then that fasting is certainly not considered by the Lord as a
   thing that is good in its own nature, because it becomes good and
   well-pleasing to God not by itself but by other works, and again from
   the surrounding circumstances it may be regarded as not merely vain but
   actually hateful, as the Lord says: "When they fast I will not hear
   their prayers." [1108]

  CHAPTER XV.

    How a thing that is good in its own nature ought not to be done for the sake
    of some lesser good.

   FOR we ought not to practise pity, patience and love, and the precepts
   of the virtues mentioned above, wherein there is what is good in its
   own nature, for the sake of fasting, but rather fasting for the sake of
   them. For our endeavour must be that those virtues which are really
   good may be gained by fasting, not that the practice of those virtues
   may lead to fasting as its end. For this then the affliction of the
   flesh is useful, for this the remedy of abstinence must be employed;
   viz., that by it we may succeed in attaining to love, wherein there is
   what is good without change, and continually with no exception of time.
   For medicines, and the goldsmith's art, and the systems of other arts
   which there are in this world are not employed for the sake of the
   instruments which belong to the particular work; but rather the
   implements are prepared for the practice of the art. And as they are
   useful for those who understand them, so they are useless to those who
   are ignorant of the system of the art in question; and as they are a
   great help to those who rely on their aid for doing their work, so they
   cannot be of the smallest use to those who do not know for what purpose
   they were made, and are contented simply with the possession of them;
   because they make all their value consist in the mere having of them,
   and not in the performance of work. That then is in its own nature the
   best thing, for the sake of which things indifferent are done, but the
   very chiefest good is done not for the sake of anything else but
   because of its own intrinsic goodness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    How what is good in its own nature can be distinguished from other things
    that are good.

   AND this may be distinguished from those other things which we have
   termed indifferent, in these ways: if a thing is good in itself and not
   by reason of something else: if it is useful for its own sake, and not
   for the sake of something else: if it is unchangeably and at all times
   good, and always keeps its character and can never become anything
   different: if its removal or cessation cannot fail to produce the
   greatest harm: if that which is its opposite is in the same way evil in
   its own nature, and can never be turned into anything good. And these
   descriptions by which the nature of things that are good in themselves
   can be distinguished, cannot possibly be applied to fasting, for it is
   not good of itself, nor useful for its own sake because it is wisely
   used for the acquisition of purity of heart and body, that the pricks
   of the flesh being dulled the soul may be pacified and reconciled to
   its Creator, nor is it unchangeably and at all times good, because
   often we are not injured by its intermission, and indeed sometimes if
   it is unreasonably practised it becomes injurious. Nor is that which
   seems its opposite evil in its own nature, i.e., the partaking of food,
   which is naturally agreeable, which cannot be regarded as evil, unless
   intemperance and luxury or some other faults are the result; "For not
   that which entereth into the mouth, defileth a man, but that which
   cometh out of the mouth, that defileth a man." [1109] And so a man
   disparages what is good in its own nature, and does not treat it
   properly or without sin, if he does it not for its own sake but for the
   sake of something else, for everything else should be done for the sake
   of it, but it should be sought for its own sake alone.

  CHAPTER XVII.

    Of the reason for fasting and its value.

   SO then let us constantly remember this description of the character of
   fasting, and always aim at it with all the powers of the soul, in such
   a way as to recognize that then only is it suitable for us if in it we
   preserve regard for time, its character and degree, and this not so as
   to set the end of our hope upon it, but so that by it we may succeed in
   attaining to purity of heart and Apostolical love. Therefore from this
   it is clear that fasting, for which not only are there special seasons
   appointed at which it should be practised or relaxed, but conditions
   and rules also laid down, is not good in its own nature, but something
   indifferent. But those things which are either enjoined as good by the
   authority of a precept, or are forbidden as bad, are never subject to
   any exceptions of time in such a way that sometimes we should do what
   is forbidden or omit what is commanded. For there is no limit set to
   justice, patience, soberness, modesty, love, nor on the other hand is a
   licence ever granted for injustice, impatience, wrath, immodesty, envy,
   and pride.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    How fasting is not always suitable.

   WHEREFORE as we have premised this on the conditions of fasting, it
   seems well to subjoin the authority of Holy Scripture, by which it will
   be more clearly proved that fasting neither can nor should be always
   observed. In the Gospel when the Pharisees were fasting together with
   the disciples of John the Baptist, as the Apostles, as friends and
   companions of the heavenly Bridegroom, were not yet keeping the
   observance of a fast, the disciples of John (who thought that they
   acquired perfect righteousness by their fasts, as they were followers
   of that grand preacher of repentance who afforded a pattern to all the
   people by his own example, as he not only refused the different kinds
   of food which are supplied for man's use, but actually altogether did
   without eating the bread which is common to all) complained to the Lord
   and said: "Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast
   not?" to whom the Lord in His reply plainly showed that fasting is not
   suitable or necessary at all times, when any festival season or
   opportunity for love intervenes and permits an indulgence in food,
   saying: "Can the children of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom
   is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken
   away from them; and then shall they fast;" [1110] words which although
   they were spoken before the resurrection of His Body, yet specially
   point to the season of Eastertide, in which after His resurrection for
   forty days He ate with His disciples, and their joy in His daily
   Presence did not allow them to fast.

  CHAPTER XIX.

    A question why we break the fast all through Eastertide.

   GERMANUS: Why then do we relax the rigour of our abstinence in our
   meals all through the fifty days, whereas Christ only remained with His
   disciples for forty days after His resurrection?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

    The answer.

   YOUR pertinent question deserves to be told the perfect true reason.
   After the Ascension of our Saviour which took place on the fortieth day
   after His Resurrection, the apostles returned from the Mount of Olives,
   on which He had suffered them to see Him when He was returning to the
   Father, as the book of the Acts of the Apostles also testifies, and
   entered Jerusalem and are said to have waited ten days for the coming
   of the Holy Ghost, and when these were fulfilled on the fiftieth day
   they received Him with joy. And thus in this way the number of this
   festival was clearly made up, which as we read was figuratively
   foreshadowed also in the Old Testament, where when seven weeks were
   fulfilled the bread of the firstfruits was ordered to be offered by the
   priests to the Lord: [1111] and this was indeed shown to be offered to
   the Lord by the preaching of the Apostles which they are said on that
   day to have addressed to the people; the true bread of the firstfruits,
   which when produced from the instruction of a new doctrine, consecrated
   the firstfruits of the Jews as a Christian people to the Lord, five
   thousand men being filled with the gifts of the food. And therefore
   these ten days are to be kept with equal solemnity and joy as the
   previous forty. And the tradition about this festival, transmitted to
   us by Apostolic men, should be kept with the same uniformity. For
   therefore on those days they do not bow their knees in prayer, because
   the bending of the knees is a sign of penitence and mourning. Wherefore
   also during these days we observe in all things the same solemnities as
   on Sunday, on which day our predecessors taught that men ought not to
   fast nor to bow the knee, out of reverence for the Lord's Resurrection.

  CHAPTER XXI.

    A question whether the relaxation of the fast is not prejudicial to the
    chastity of the body.

   GERMANUS: Can the flesh, attracted by the unwonted luxuries of so long
   a festival fail to produce something thorny from the incentives to sin
   although they have been cut down? or can the soul weighed down by the
   consumption of unaccustomed feasts fail to mitigate the rigour of its
   rule over its servant the body, especially when in our case our mature
   age can excite our subject members to a speedy revolt, if we venture to
   take our usual food in larger quantities, or unaccustomed food more
   freely than usual?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

    The answer on the way to keep control over abstinence.

   THEONAS: If we weigh everything that we do, by a reasonable judgment of
   the mind, and on the purity of our heart always consult not the
   opinions of other people but our own conscience, that interval for
   refreshment is sure not to interfere with our proper strictness, if
   only, as was said, our pure mind impartially considers the right limits
   of indulgence and abstinence, and fairly checks excess in either, and
   with real discrimination discerns whether the weight of the delicacies
   is a burden upon our spirits, or whether too much austerity in
   abstaining weighs down the other side, i.e., that of the body, and
   either depresses or raises that side which it sees to be raised or
   weighed down. For our Lord would have nothing done to His honour and
   glory without being tempered by judgment, for "the honour of a king
   loveth judgment," [1112] and therefore Solomon, the wisest of men,
   urges us not to let our judgment incline to either side, saying:
   "Honour God with thy righteous labours and offer to Him of the fruits
   of thy righteousness." [1113] For we have residing in our conscience an
   uncorrupt and true judge who sometimes, when all are wrong, is the only
   person not deceived as to the state of our purity. And so with all care
   and pains we should preserve a constant purpose in our circumspect
   heart for fear lest if the judgment of our discretion goes wrong, we
   may be fired with the desire for an ill-considered abstinence, or
   allured by the wish for an excessive relaxation, and so weigh the
   substance of our strength in the tongue of an unfair balance; but we
   should place in one of the scales our purity of soul, and in the other
   our bodily strength, and weigh them both in the true judgment of
   conscience, so that we may not perversely incline the scale of fairness
   to either side, either to undue strictness or to excessive relaxation,
   from the preponderating desire for one or the other, and so have this
   said to us by reason of excessive strictness or relaxation: "If thou
   offerest rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned?"
   [1114] For those offerings of fasts, which we thoughtlessly extort by
   violently tearing our bowels, and fancy that we rightly offer to the
   Lord, these He execrates who "loves mercy and judgment" saying: "I the
   Lord love judgment, but I hate robbery in a burnt offering." [1115]
   Those also who take the main part of their offerings, i.e., their
   offices and actions, to benefit the flesh for their own use, but leave
   the remains of them and a tiny portion for the Lord, these the Divine
   Word thus condemns as fraudulent workmen: "Cursed is he that doeth the
   work of the Lord fraudulently." [1116] It is not then without reason
   that the Lord reproves him who thus deceives himself by unfair
   considerations, saying: "But vain are the children of men: the children
   of men are liars upon the balances that they may deceive." [1117] And
   therefore the blessed Apostle warns us to keep hold of the reins of
   discretion and not to be attracted by excess and swerve to either side,
   saying: "Your reasonable service." [1118] And the giver of the law
   similarly forbids the same thing, saying: "Let the balance be just and
   the weights equal, the bushel just and the sextarius equal," [1119] and
   Solomon also gives a like opinion on this matter: "Great and small
   weights and double measures are both unclean before the Lord, and one
   who uses them shall be hindered in his contrivances." [1120] Further
   not only in the way in which we have said, but also in this must we
   strive not to have unfair weights in our hearts, nor double measures in
   the storehouse of our conscience, i.e., not to overwhelm those, to whom
   we are to preach the word of the Lord, with precepts that are too
   strict and heavier than we ourselves can bear, while we take for
   granted that for ourselves those things which have to do with the rule
   of strictness are to be softened by a freer allowance of relaxation.
   For when we do this, what is it but to weigh and measure the goods and
   fruits of the Lord's commands in a double weight and measure? For if we
   dispense them in one way to ourselves and in another to our brethren,
   we are rightly blamed by the Lord because we have unfair balances and
   double measures, in accordance with the saying of Solomon which tells
   us that "A double weight is an abomination to the Lord, and a deceitful
   balance is not good in His sight." [1121] In this way also we plainly
   incur the guilt of using a deceitful weight and a double measure, if
   out of the desire for the praise of men, we make a show before the
   brethren of greater strictness than what we practice in private in our
   own cells, trying to appear more abstinent and holier in the sight of
   men than in the sight of God, an evil which we should not only avoid
   but actually loathe. But meanwhile as we have wandered some way from
   the question before us, let us return to the point from which we
   started.

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    Of the time and measure of refreshment.

   SO then we should keep the observance of the days mentioned in such a
   way that the relaxation allowed may be useful rather than harmful to
   the good of body and soul, because the joy of any festival cannot blunt
   the pricks of the flesh, nor can that fierce enemy of ours be pacified
   by regard for days. In order then that the observance of the customs
   appointed for festival seasons may be kept and that the most salutary
   rule of abstinence be not at all exceeded it is enough for us to allow
   the permitted relaxation to go so far, as for us out of regard for the
   festival season to take the food, which ought to be taken at the ninth
   hour, a little earlier; viz., at the sixth hour, but with this
   condition, that the regular allowance and character of the food be not
   altered, for fear lest the purity of body and uprightness of soul which
   has been gained by the abstinence of Lent be lost by the relaxation of
   Eastertide, and it profit us nothing to have acquired by our fast what
   a careless satiety causes us presently to lose, especially as the
   well-known cunning of our enemy assaults the stronghold of our purity
   then chiefly when he sees that our guard over it is somewhat relaxed at
   the celebration of some festival. Wherefore we must most vigilantly
   look out that the vigour of our soul be never enervated by seductive
   flatteries, and we lose not the purity of our chastity, gained, as was
   said, by the continuous efforts of Lent, by the repose and carelessness
   of Eastertide. And therefore no addition at all should be made to the
   quality or the quantity of the food, but even on the highest festivals
   we should similarly abstain from those foods, by abstinence from which
   we preserve our uprightness on common days, that the joy of the
   festival may not excite in us a most deadly conflict of carnal desires,
   and so be turned to grief, and put an end to that most excellent
   festival of the heart, which exults in the joy of purity; and after a
   brief show of carnal joy we begin to mourn our lost purity of heart
   with a lasting sorrow of repentance. Moreover we should strive that
   this warning of the prophetic exhortation may not be uttered against us
   to no purpose: "Celebrate, O Judah, thy festivals, and pay thy vows."
   [1122] For if the occurrence of festival days does not interfere with
   the continuity of our abstinence, we shall continually enjoy spiritual
   festivals and so, when we cease from servile work, "there shall be
   month after month and Sabbath after Sabbath." [1123]

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    A question on the different ways of keeping Lent.

   GERMANUS: What is the reason why Lent is kept for six weeks, while in
   some countries a possibly more earnest care for religion seems to have
   added a seventh week as well, though neither number when you subtract
   Sunday and Saturday, gives the total of forty days? For only six and
   thirty days are included in these weeks. [1124]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1124] On the different uses in regard to the Lenten fast Socrates (H.
   E. V. xxii.) writes as follows: "Those at Rome fast three successive
   weeks before Easter, excepting Saturdays and Sundays. The Illyrians,
   Achaians, and Alexandrians observe a fast of six weeks, which they call
   the forty days' fast. Others commencing their fast from the seventh
   week before Easter, and fasting for fifteen days by intervals, yet call
   that time the forty days' fast." There are difficulties in the way of
   accepting the statement about the custom at Rome (see below), but the
   great variety of customs is fully confirmed by Sozomen (H. E. VII.
   xix.): "In some churches the time before Easter, which is called
   Quadragesima, and is devoted by the people to fasting, is made to
   consist of six weeks: and this is the case in Illyria, and the western
   regions, in Libya, throughout Egypt, and in Palestine: whereas it is
   made to comprise seven weeks at Constantinople, and in the neighbouring
   provinces as far as Phoenicia. In some churches the people fast three
   alternate weeks during the space of six or seven weeks; whereas in
   others they fast continuously during the three weeks immediately
   preceding the festival." The statement here made with regard to the
   West is true except as regards Milan, where Saturday was kept (as in
   the East) as a festival: while for the Constantinopolitan practice
   Chrysostom (Hom. xi. in Gen. § 2) confirms what Sozomen says: while
   Cassian's language in the text bears witness to the fact that both
   Egypt and Palestine agreed with the Roman practice. In either case,
   whether the fast began seven or six weeks before Easter, the number of
   days observed in the fast was the same; Saturdays (with the exception
   of Easter Eve which was always regarded as a fast) being excluded in
   the former case, while they were all included in the latter. Cf. below,
   c. xxvi.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

    The answer to the effect that the fast of Lent has reference to the tithe of
    the year.

   THEONAS: Although the pious simplicity of some folks would put aside a
   question on this subject, yet because you are more scrupulous in your
   examination of those things which another would consider unworthy to be
   asked about, and want to know the whole truth of this observance of
   ours and the secret of it, you shall have a very clear reason for this
   also, that you may still more plainly be convinced that our
   predecessors taught nothing unreasonable. By the law of Moses the
   command propounded to all the people generally was this: "Thou shalt
   offer to the Lord thy God thy tithes and firstfruits." [1125] And so,
   while we are commanded to offer tithes of our substance and all our
   fruits, it is much more needful for us to offer tithes of our life and
   ordinary employments and actions, which certainly is clearly arranged
   for in the calculation of Lent. For the tithe of the number of all the
   days included in the revolving circle of the year is thirty-six days
   and a half. But in seven weeks, if Sundays and Saturdays are
   subtracted, there remain thirty-five days assigned for fasting. But by
   the addition of Easter Eve when the Saturday's fast is prolonged to the
   cock-crowing at the dawn of Easter Day, not only is the number of
   thirty-six days made up, but in regard to the tithe of the five days
   which seemed to be over, if the bit of the night which was added be
   taken into account nothing will be wanting to the whole sum.

  CHAPTER XXVI.

    How we ought also to offer our firstfruits to the Lord.

   BUT what shall I say of the firstfruits which surely are given daily by
   all who serve Christ faithfully? For when men waking from sleep and
   arising with renewed activity after their rest, before they take in any
   impulse or thought in their heart, or admit any recollection or
   consideration of business consecrate their first and earliest thoughts
   as divine offerings, what are they doing indeed but rendering the
   firstfruits of their produce through the High Priest Jesus Christ for
   the enjoyment of this life and a figure of the daily resurrection? And
   also when roused from sleep in the same way they offer to God a
   sacrifice of joy and invoke Him with the first motion of their tongue
   and celebrate His name and praise, and throwing open, the first thing,
   the door of their lips to sing hymns to Him they offer to God the
   offices of their mouth; and to Him also in the same way they bring the
   earliest offerings of their hands and steps, when they rise from bed
   and stand in prayer and before they use the services of their limbs for
   their own purposes, take to themselves nothing of their services, but
   for His glory advance their steps, and set them in His praise and so
   render the first fruits of all their movements by stretching forth the
   hands, bending the knees, and prostrating the whole body. For in no
   other way can we fulfil that of which we sing in the Psalm: "I
   prevented the dawning of the day and cried;" and: "Mine eyes to Thee
   have prevented the morning that I might meditate on Thy words;" and:
   "In the morning shall my prayer prevent Thee;" [1126] unless after our
   rest in sleep when, as we said above, we are restored as from darkness
   and death to this light, we have the courage not to begin by taking any
   of all the services both of mind and body for our own uses. For there
   is no other morning which the prophet "prevented," or which in the same
   way we ought to prevent, except either ourselves, i.e., our occupations
   and feelings and earthly cares, without which we cannot exist--or the
   most subtle suggestions of the adversary, which he tries to suggest to
   us, while still resting and overcome with sleep, by the phantoms of
   vain dreams, with which, when we presently awake, he will fill our
   minds and occupy us, that he may be the first to seize and carry off
   the spoils of our firstfruits. Wherefore we must take the utmost care
   (if we want to fulfil in act the meaning of the above quoted verse)
   that an anxious watchfulness takes regard of our first and earliest
   morning thoughts, that they may not be defiled beforehand being hastily
   taken possession of by our jealous adversary, and thus he may make our
   firstfruits to be rejected by the Lord as worthless and common. And if
   he is not prevented by us with watchful circumspection of mind, he will
   not lay aside his habit of miserably anticipating us nor cease day
   after day to prevent us by his wiles. And therefore if we want to offer
   firstfruits that are acceptable and well pleasing to God of the fruits
   of our mind, we ought to spend no ordinary care to keep all the senses
   of our body, especially during the hours of the morning, as a sacred
   holocaust to the Lord pure and undefiled in all things. And this kind
   of devotion many even of those who live in the world observe with the
   utmost care, as they rise before it is light or very early, and do not
   at all mix in the ordinary and necessary business of this world before
   hastening to church and striving to consecrate in the sight of God the
   firstfruits of all their actions and doings.

  CHAPTER XXVII.

    Why Lent is kept by very many with a different number of days.

   FURTHER, as for what you say; viz., that in some countries Lent is kept
   in different ways, i.e., for six or seven weeks, it is but one system
   and the same manner of the fast that is preserved by the different
   observance of the weeks. For those who think one ought to fast also on
   the Saturday, have determined on the observance of six weeks. They
   therefore fast for six days out of the seven, and this being six times
   repeated makes up the six and thirty days. It is therefore, as we said,
   but one system and the same manner of the fast, although there seems to
   be a difference in the number of the weeks.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVIII.

    Why it is called Quadragesima, when the fast is only kept for thirty-six
    days.

   BUT further, as man's carelessness dropped out of sight the reason of
   this, this season when, as was said, the tithes of the year are offered
   by fasts for thirty-six days and a half, was called Quadragesima,
   [1127] a name which perhaps they thought ought to be given to it for
   this reason; viz., that it is said that Moses and Elijah and our Lord
   Jesus Christ Himself fasted for forty days. To the mystery of which
   number are not unsuitably applied those forty years in which Israel
   dwelt in the wilderness, and in like manner the forty stations which
   they are said to have passed through with a mystic meaning. Or perhaps
   the tithe was properly given the name of Quadragesima from the use of
   the custom-house. For so that state tax is commonly called, from which
   the same proportion of the increment is assigned for the king's use, as
   the legal tribute of Quadragesima, which is required of us by the King
   of all the ages for the use of our life. At any rate, although this has
   nothing to do with the question raised, yet I think that I ought not to
   omit the fact that very often our elders used to testify that
   especially on these days the whole body of monks was attacked according
   to the ancient custom of the people opposed to them, and was more
   vehemently urged to forsake their homes, for this reason, because in
   accordance with this figure, whereby the Egyptians formerly oppressed
   the children of Israel with grievous afflictions, so now also the
   spiritual Egyptians try to bow down the true Israel, i.e., the monastic
   folk, with hard and vile tasks, lest by means of that peace which is
   dear to God, we should forsake the land of Egypt, and for our good
   cross to the desert of virtues, so that Pharaoh rages against us and
   says: "They are idle and therefore they cry saying: Let us go and
   sacrifice to the Lord our God. Let them be oppressed with labours, and
   be harassed in their works, and they shall not be harassed by vain
   words." [1128] For certainly their folly imagines that the holy
   sacrifice of the Lord, which is only offered in the desert of a pure
   heart, is the height of folly, for "religion is an abomination to a
   sinner." [1129]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1127] Cassian here gives three suggestions why the fast of thirty-six
   days' duration was called Quadragesima. (1) As roughly corresponding to
   the forty days fast of Moses, Elijah, and the Lord Himself; (2) because
   "forty" is the number associated with a time of probation in Scripture;
   and (3) because of the analogy of a legal tribute of "Quadragesima"
   paid to the Sovereign. It is certainly a curious and difficult question
   why the name Quadragesima should have been so universally applied to
   the fast, when there is no evidence of its having been kept for forty
   days till sometime after the date of Gregory the Great, when Ash
   Wednesday and the three following days were prefixed to the six weeks
   expressly for the purpose of making up the number forty. The name
   however, had as we see from Socrates, Sozomen, Cassian himself, and
   many other writers, existed long before this; and on the whole it
   appears probable that it originated in none of the reasons given above
   by Cassian, but that in the first instance it was connected "with the
   period during which our Lord yielded to the power of death, which was
   estimated at forty hours; viz., from noon on Friday till 4 a.m. on
   Sunday." See Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, Vol. ii. p. 973; and
   cf. Irenæus Ep. ad Victor. in Euseb. V. xxiv.; and Tertullian De Orat.

  CHAPTER XXIX.

    How those who are perfect go beyond the fixed rule of Lent.

   BY this law of Lent then the man who is upright and perfect is not
   restrained nor is he content with merely submitting to that paltry rule
   which the heads of the church have established for those who all the
   year round are involved in pleasure or business, that they may be bound
   by this legal requirement and forced at any rate during these days to
   find time for the Lord, and dedicate to Him the tithe of the days of
   their life, all of which they would have consumed as their profits. But
   the righteous, for whom the law is not appointed, and who devote to
   spiritual duties not a small part; viz., the tenth, but the whole time
   of their life, because they are free from the burden of tithes
   according to law, for his reason, if any worthy and pious occasion
   happening to them constrains them, are ready to relax their station
   fast [1130] without any hesitation. For in their case it is no paltry
   tithe that is diminished, as they offer all that they have to the Lord
   equally with themselves. And this certainly a man could not do without
   being guilty of a grievous wrong, who, offering nothing of his own free
   will to God, is forced to pay his tithes by the stern compulsion of the
   law which takes no excuse. Wherefore it is clearly established that the
   servant of the law cannot be perfect, who only shuns those things which
   are forbidden and does those things which are commanded, but that those
   are really perfect who do not take advantage even of those things which
   the law allows. And in this way, though it is said of the Mosaic law
   that "the law brought nothing to perfection," [1131] we read that some
   of the saints in the Old Testament were perfect because they went
   beyond the commands of the law and lived under the perfection of the
   Gospel: "Knowing that the law is not appointed for the righteous but
   for the unrighteous and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for
   the wicked and defiled, etc." [1132]

  CHAPTER XXX.

    Of the origin and beginning of Lent.

   HOWBEIT you should know that as long as the primitive church retained
   its perfection unbroken, this observance of Lent did not exist. For
   they were not bound by the requirements of this order, or by any legal
   enactments, nor confined in the very narrow limits of the fast, as the
   fast embraced equally the whole year round. But when the multitude of
   believers began day by day to decline from that apostolic fervour, and
   to look after their own wealth, and not to portion it out for the good
   of all the faithful in accordance with the arrangement of the apostles,
   but having an eye to their own private expenses, tried not only to keep
   it but actually to increase it, not content with following the example
   of Ananias and Sapphira, then it seemed good to all the priests that
   men who were hampered by worldly cares, and almost ignorant, if I may
   say so, of abstinence and contrition, should be recalled to the pious
   duty by a fast canonically enjoined, and be constrained by the
   necessity of paying the legal tithes, as this certainly would be good
   for the weak brethren and could not do any harm to the perfect who were
   living under the grace of the gospel and by their voluntary devotion
   going beyond the law, so as to succeed in attaining to the blessedness
   which the Apostle speaks of: "For sin shall not have dominion over you;
   for ye are not under the law but under grace." [1133] For of a truth
   sin cannot exercise dominion over one who lives faithfully under the
   liberty of grace.

  CHAPTER XXXI.

    A question, how we ought to understand the Apostle's words: "Sin shall not
    have dominion over you."

   GERMANUS: Because this saying of the Apostle, which promises freedom
   from care not only to monks but to all Christians in general, cannot
   lead us wrong, it seems to us somewhat obscure. For whereas he
   maintains that all those who believe the gospel are at liberty and free
   from the yoke and dominion of sin, how is it that the dominion of sin
   holds vigorous sway over almost all the baptized, in accordance with
   the Lord's words, where He says: "Every one that doeth sin is the
   servant of sin"? [1134]

  CHAPTER XXXII.

    The answer on the difference between grace and the commands of the law.

   THEONAS: Your inquiry once more raises before us a question of no small
   extent. The explanation of which though I know that it cannot be taught
   to or understood by the inexperienced, yet as far as I can, I will try
   to set forth in words and briefly to explain, if only your minds will
   follow up and act upon what we say. For whatever is known not by
   teaching but by experience, just as it cannot be taught by one without
   experience, so neither can it be grasped or taken in by the mind of one
   who has not laid the foundation by a similar study and training. And
   therefore I think it necessary for us first to inquire somewhat
   carefully what is the purpose or meaning of the law, and what is the
   system and perfection of grace, that from this we may succeed in
   understanding the dominion of sin and how to drive it out. And so the
   law chiefly commands men to seek the bonds of wedlock, saying: "Blessed
   is he that hath seed in Sion and an household in Jerusalem;" [1135]
   and: "Cursed is the barren that hath not borne." [1136] On the other
   hand grace invites us to the purity of perpetual chastity, and the
   undefiled state of blessed virginity, saying: "Blessed are the barren,
   and the breasts which have not given suck;" and: "he that hateth not
   father and mother and wife cannot be my disciple;" and this of the
   Apostle: "It remaineth that they that have wives be as though they had
   them not." [1137] The law says: "Thou shall not delay to offer thy
   tithes and firstfruits;" grace says: "If thou wilt be perfect, go and
   sell all that thou hast and give to the poor:" [1138] The law forbids
   not retaliation for wrongs and vengeance for injuries, saying" "An eye
   for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." Grace would have our patience
   proved by the injuries and blows offered to us being redoubled, and
   bids us be ready to endure twice as much damage; saying: "If a man
   strike thee on one cheek, offer him the other also; and to him who will
   contend with thee at the law and take away thy coat, give him thy cloak
   also." [1139] The one decrees that we should hate our enemies, the
   other that we should love them so that it holds that even for them we
   ought always to pray to God.

  CHAPTER XXXIII.

    Of the fact that the precepts of the gospel are milder than those of the
    law.

   WHOEVER therefore climbs this height of evangelical perfection, is at
   once raised by the merits of such virtue above every law, and
   disregarding as trivial all that is commanded by Moses, recognizes that
   he is only subject to the grace of the Saviour, by whose aid he knows
   that he attained to that most exalted condition. Therefore sin has no
   dominion over him, "because the love of God, which is shed abroad in
   our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us," [1140] shuts out
   all care for everything else, and can neither desire what is forbidden,
   or disregard what is commanded, as its whole aim and all its desire is
   ever fixed on divine love, and to such an extent is it not caught by
   the delights of worthless things, that it actually does not take
   advantage of those things which are permitted. But under the law, where
   lawful marriages are observed, although the rovings of wantonness are
   restrained, and bound down to one woman alone, yet the pricks of carnal
   lust cannot help being vigorous; and it is hard for the fire, for which
   fuel is expressly supplied, to be thus shut in within prearranged
   limits, so as not to spread further and burn up anything it touches. As
   even if this objection occurs to it that it is not allowed to be
   kindled beyond these limits, yet even while it is kept in check, it is
   on fire because the will itself is in fault, and its habit of carnal
   intercourse hurries it into too speedy excesses of adultery. But those
   whom the grace of the Saviour has fired with the holy love of chastity,
   so consume all the thorns of carnal desires in the fire of the Lord's
   love, that no dying embers of sin interfere with the coldness of their
   purity. The servants of the law then from the use of lawful things fall
   away to unlawful; the partakers of grace while they disregard lawful
   things know nothing of unlawful ones. But as sin is alive in one who
   loves marriage, so is it also in one who is satisfied with merely
   paying his tithes and firstfruits. For, while he is dawdling or
   careless, he is sure to sin in regard to either their quality or
   quantity, or the daily distribution of them. For as he is commanded
   unweariedly to minister to those in want of what is his, although he
   may dispense it with the fullest faith and devotion, yet it is hard for
   him not to fall often into the snares of sin. But over those who have
   not set at naught the counsel of the Lord, but who, disposing of all
   their property to the poor, take up their cross and follow the bestower
   of grace, sin can have no dominion. For no faithless anxiety for
   getting food will annoy him who piously distributes and disperses his
   wealth already consecrated to Christ and no longer regarded as his own;
   nor will any grudging hesitation take away from the cheerfulness of his
   almsgiving, because without any thought of his own needs or fear of his
   own food running short he is distributing what has once for all been
   completely offered to God, and is no longer regarded as his own, as he
   is sure that when he has succeeded in stripping himself as he desires,
   he will be fed by God much more than the birds of the air. On the other
   hand he who retains his goods of this world, or, bound by the rules of
   the old law, distributes the tithe of his produce, and his firstfruits,
   or a portion of his income, although he may to a considerable degree
   quench the fire of his sins by this dew of almsgiving, yet, however
   generously he gives away his wealth, it is impossible for him
   altogether to rid himself of the dominion of sin, unless perhaps by the
   grace of the Saviour, together with his substance he gets rid of all
   love of possessing. In the same way he cannot fail to be subject to the
   bloody sway of sin, whoever chooses to pull out, as the law commands,
   an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, or to hate his enemy, for while
   he desires by retaliation in exchange to avenge an injury done to
   himself, and while he cherishes bitter hatred against an enemy, he is
   sure always to be inflamed with the passion of anger and rage. But
   whoever lives under the light of the grace of the gospel, and overcomes
   evil by not resisting it, but by bearing it, and does not hesitate of
   his own free will to give to one who smites his right cheek, the other
   also, and to one who wants to raise a lawsuit against him for his coat,
   gives his cloak also, and who loves his enemies, and prays for those
   who slander him, this man has broken the yoke of sin and burst its
   chains. For he is not living under the law, which does not destroy the
   seeds of sin (whence not without reason the Apostle says of it: "There
   is a setting aside of the former commandment because of the weakness
   and unprofitableness thereof: for the law brought nothing to
   perfection;" and the Lord says by the prophet: "And I gave them
   commands that were not good, and ordinances, whereby they could not
   live" [1141] , but under grace which does not merely lop off the boughs
   of wickedness, but actually tears up the very roots of an evil will.

  CHAPTER XXXIV.

    How a man can be shown to be under grace.

   WHOEVER then strives to reach the perfection of evangelical teaching,
   this man living under grace is not oppressed by the dominion of sin,
   for to be under grace is to do those things which grace commands. But
   whoever will not submit himself to the complete requirements of
   evangelical perfection, must not remain ignorant that, although he
   seems to be baptized and to be a monk, yet he is not under grace, but
   is still shackled by the chains of the law, and weighed down by the
   burden of sin. For it is the aim of Him, who by the grace of adoption
   accepts all those by whom He has been received, not to destroy but to
   build upon, not to abolish but to fulfil the Mosaic requirements. But
   some knowing nothing about this, and disregarding the splendid counsels
   and exhortations of Christ, are so emancipated by the carelessness of a
   freedom too hastily assumed, that they not only fail to carry out the
   commands of Christ as if they were too hard, but actually scorn as
   antiquated, the commands given to them as beginners and children by the
   law of Moses, saying in this dangerous freedom of theirs that which the
   Apostle execrates: "We have sinned, because we are not under the law
   but under grace." [1142] He then who is neither under grace, because he
   has never climbed the heights of the Lord's teaching, nor under the
   law, because he has not accepted even those small commands of the law,
   this man, ground down beneath a twofold rule of sin, fancies that he
   has received the grace of Christ, simply and solely for this, that by
   this dangerous liberty of his he may make himself none of His, and
   falls into that state, which the Apostle Peter warns us to avoid,
   saying: "Act as free, and not having your liberty as a cloak of
   wickedness." The blessed Apostle Paul also says: "For ye, brethren,
   were called to liberty," i.e., that ye might be free from the dominion
   of sin, "only use not your liberty for an occasion of the flesh,"
   [1143] i.e., believe that the doing away with the commands of the law
   is a licence to sin. But this liberty, the Apostle Paul teaches us is
   nowhere but where the Lord is dwelling, for he says: "The Lord is the
   Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty." [1144]
   Wherefore I know not whether I could express and explain the meaning of
   the blessed Apostle, as those know how, who have experience; one thing
   I do know, that it is very clearly revealed even without anyone's
   explanation to all those who have perfectly acquired praktikh, i.e.,
   practical training. For they will need no effort to understand in
   discussion what they have already learnt by practice.

    A question, why sometimes when we are fasting more strictly than usual, we
    are troubled by carnal desires more keenly than usual.

   GERMANUS: You have very clearly explained a most difficult question,
   and one which, as we think, is unknown to many. Wherefore we pray you
   to add this also for our good, and carefully to expound why sometimes
   when we are fasting more strictly than usual, and are exhausted and
   worn out, severer bodily struggles are excited. For often on waking
   from sleep, when we have discovered that we have been defiled [1145] we
   are so dejected in heart that we do not even venture faithfully to rise
   even for prayer.

  CHAPTER XXXVI.

    The answer, telling that this question should be reserved for a future
    Conference.

   THEONAS: Your zeal indeed, whereby you desire to reach the way of
   perfection, not for a moment only but fully and perfectly, urges us to
   continue this discussion unweariedly. For you are anxiously inquiring
   not about external chastity or outward circumcision, but about that
   which is secret, as you know that complete perfection does not consist
   in this visible continence of the flesh which can be attained either by
   constraint, or by hypocrisy even by unbelievers, but in that voluntary
   and invisible purity of heart, which the blessed Apostle describes as
   follows: "For he is not a Jew which is so outwardly, nor is that
   circumcision which is outward in the flesh, but he is a Jew which is
   one inwardly, and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit
   not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of God," [1146] who
   alone searches the secrets of the heart. But because it is not possible
   for your wish to be fully satisfied (as the short space of the night
   that is left is not enough for the investigation of this most difficult
   question,) I think it well to postpone it for a while. For these
   matters, as they should be propounded by us quietly and with an heart
   entirely free from all bustling thoughts, so should they be received
   into your minds; for just as the inquiry ought to be undertaken for the
   sake of our common purity, so they cannot be learnt or acquired by one
   who is without the gift of uprightness. For we do not ask what
   arguments of empty words, but what the inward faith of the conscience
   and the greater force of truth can persuade. And therefore with regard
   to the knowledge and teaching of this purification nothing can be
   brought forward except by one who has had experience of it, nor can
   anything be committed except to one who is a most eager and very
   earnest lover of the truth itself, who does not hope to attain it by
   asking questions with mere vain words, but by striving with all his
   might and main, with no wish for useless chattering but with the desire
   to purify himself internally.

ON SINLESSNESS.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    Discourse of Abbot Theonas on the Apostle's words: "For I do not the good
    which I would."

   AT the return of light therefore, as the old man was forced by our
   intense urgency to investigate the depths of the Apostle's subject, he
   spoke as follows: As for the passages by which you try to prove that
   the Apostle Paul spoke not in his own person but in that of sinners:
   "For I do not the good that I would, but the evil which I hate, that I
   do;" or this: "But if I do that which I would not, it is no longer I
   that do it but sin that dwelleth in me;" or what follows: "For I
   delight in the law of God after the inner man, but I see another law in
   my members opposing the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity
   to the law of sin which is in my members;" [1148] these passages on the
   contrary plainly show that they cannot possibly fit the person of
   sinners, but that what is said can only apply to those that are
   perfect, and that it only suits the chastity of those who follow the
   good example of the Apostles. Else how could these words apply to the
   person of sinners: "For I do not the good which I would, but the evil
   which I hate that I do"? or even this: "But if I do what I would not it
   is no longer I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me"? For what sinner
   defiles himself unwillingly by adulteries and fornication? Who against
   his will prepares plots against his neighbour? Who is driven by
   unavoidable necessity to oppress a man by false witness or cheat him by
   theft, or covet the goods of another or shed his blood? Nay rather, as
   Scripture says, "Mankind is diligently inclined to wickedness from his
   youth." [1149] For to such an extent are all inflamed by the love of
   sin and desire to carry out what they like, that they actually look out
   with watchful care for an opportunity of committing wickedness and are
   afraid of being too slow to enjoy their lusts, and glory in their shame
   and the mass of their crimes, as the Apostle says in censure, [1150]
   and seek credit for themselves out of their own confusion, of whom also
   the prophet Jeremiah maintains that they commit their flagitious crimes
   not only not unwillingly nor with ease of heart and body, but with
   laborious efforts to such an extent that they come to toil to carry
   them out, so that they are prevented even by the hindrance of arduous
   difficulty from their deadly quest of sin; as he says: "They have
   laboured to do wickedly." [1151] Who also will say that this applies to
   sinners: "And so with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with
   the flesh the law of sin," as it is plain that they serve God neither
   with the mind nor the flesh? Or how can those who sin with the body
   serve God with the mind, when the flesh receives the incitement to sin
   from the heart, and the Creator of either nature Himself declares that
   the fount and spring of sin flows from the latter, saying: "From the
   heart proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false
   witness, etc." [1152] Wherefore it is clearly shown that this cannot in
   any way be taken of the person of sinners, who not only do not hate,
   but actually love what is evil and are so far from serving God with
   either the mind or the flesh that they sin with the mind before they do
   with the flesh, and before they carry out the pleasures of the body are
   overcome by sin in their mind and thoughts.

  CHAPTER II.

    How the Apostle completed many good actions.

   IT remains therefore for us to measure its meaning and drift from the
   inmost feelings of the speaker, and to discuss what the blessed Apostle
   called good, and what he pronounced by comparison evil, not by the bare
   meaning of the words, but with the same insight which he showed, and to
   investigate his meaning with due regard to the worth and goodness of
   the speaker. For then we shall be able to understand the words, which
   were uttered by God's inspiration, in accordance with his purpose and
   wish, when we weigh the position and character of those by whom they
   were spoken, and are ourselves clothed with the same feelings (not in
   words but by experience), in accordance with the character of which
   most certainly all the thoughts are conceived and opinions uttered.
   Wherefore let us carefully consider what was in the main that good
   which the Apostle could not do when he would. For we know that there
   are many good things which we cannot deny that the blessed Apostle and
   all men as good as he either have by nature, or acquire by grace. For
   chastity is good, continence is praiseworthy, prudence is to be
   admired, kindness is liberal, sobriety is careful, temperance is
   modest, pity is kind, justice is holy: all of which we cannot doubt
   existed fully and in perfection in the Apostle Paul and his companions,
   so that they taught religion by the lesson of their virtues rather than
   their words. What if they were always consumed with the constant care
   of all the churches and watchful anxiety? How great a good is this
   pity, what perfection it is to burn for them that are offended, to be
   weak with the weak! [1153] If then the Apostle abounded with such good
   things, we cannot recognize what that good was, in the perfection of
   which the Apostle was lacking, unless we have advanced to that state of
   mind in which he was speaking. And so all those virtues which we say
   that he possessed, though they are like most splendid and precious
   gems, yet when they are compared with that most beautiful and unique
   pearl which the merchant in the gospel sought and wanted to acquire by
   selling all that he possessed, so does their value seem poor and
   trifling, so that if they are without hesitation got rid of, the
   possession of one good thing alone will enrich the man who sells
   countless good things.

  CHAPTER III.

    What is really the good which the Apostle testifies that he could not
    perform.

   WHAT then is that one thing which is so incomparably above those great
   and innumerable good things, that, while they are all scorned and
   rejected, it alone should be acquired? Doubtless it is that truly good
   part, the grand and lasting character of which is thus described by the
   Lord, when Mary disregarded the duties of hospitality and courtesy and
   chose it: "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many
   things: but there is but need of but few things or even of one only.
   Mary hath chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her."
   [1154] Contemplation then, i.e., meditation on God, is the one thing,
   the value of which all the merits of our righteous acts, all our aims
   at virtue, come short of. And all those things which we said existed in
   the Apostle Paul, were not only good and useful, but even great and
   splendid. But as, for example, the metal of alloy which is considered
   of some use and worth, becomes worthless when silver is taken into
   account, and again the value of silver disappears in comparison with
   gold, and gold itself is disregarded when compared with precious
   stones, and yet a quantity of precious stones however splendid are
   outdone by the brightness of a single pearl, so all those merits of
   holiness, although they are not merely good and useful for the present
   life, but also secure the gift of eternity, yet if they are compared
   with the merit of Divine contemplation, will be considered trifling and
   so to speak, fit to be sold. And to support this illustration by the
   authority of Scripture, does not Scripture declare of all things in
   general which were created by God, and say: "And behold everything that
   God had made was very good;" and again: "And things that God hath made
   are all good in their season"? [1155] These things then which in the
   present time are termed not simply and solely good, but emphatically
   "very good" (for they are really convenient for us while living in this
   world, either for purposes of life, or for remedies for the body, or by
   reason of some unknown usefulness, or else they are indeed "very good,"
   because they enable us "to see the invisible things of God from the
   creatures of the world, being understood by the things that are made,
   even His eternal power and Godhead," [1156] from this great and orderly
   arrangement of the fabric of the world; and to contemplate them from
   the existence of everything in it), yet none of these things will keep
   the name of good if they are regarded in the light of that world to
   come, where no variation of good things, and no loss of true
   blessedness need be feared. The bliss of which world is thus described:
   "The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light
   of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days." [1157] These
   things then which are great and wondrous to be gazed on, and
   marvellous, will at once appear as vanity if they are compared with the
   future promises from faith; as David says: "They all shall wax old as a
   garment, and as a vesture shall Thou change them, and they shall be
   changed. But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail." [1158]
   Because then there is nothing of itself enduring, nothing unchangeable,
   nothing good but Deity alone, while every creature, to obtain the
   blessing of eternity and immutability, aims at this not by its own
   nature but by participation of its Creator, and His grace, they cannot
   maintain their character for goodness when compared with their Creator.

  CHAPTER IV.

    How man's goodness and righteousness are not good if compared with the
    goodness and righteousness of God.

   BUT if we want also to establish the force of this opinion by still
   clearer proofs, is it not the case that while we read of many things as
   called good in the gospel, as a good tree, and good treasure, and a
   good man, and a good servant, for He says: "A good tree cannot bring
   forth evil fruit;" and: "a good man out of the good treasure of his
   heart brings forth good things;" and: "Well done, good and faithful
   servant;" [1159] and certainly there can be no doubt that none of these
   are good in themselves, yet if we take into consideration the goodness
   of God, none of them will be called good, as the Lord says: "None is
   good save God alone"? [1160] In whose sight even the apostles
   themselves, who in the excellence of their calling in many ways went
   beyond the goodness of mankind, are said to be evil, as the Lord thus
   speaks to them: "If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to
   your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give
   good things to them that ask Him." [1161] Finally as our goodness turns
   to badness in the eyes of the Highest so also our righteousness when
   set against the Divine righteousness is considered like a menstruous
   cloth, as Isaiah the prophet says: "All your righteousness is like a
   menstruous cloth." [1162] And to produce something still plainer, even
   the vital precepts of the law itself, which are said to have been
   "given by angels by the hand of a mediator," and of which the same
   Apostle says: "So the law indeed is holy and the commandment is holy
   and just and good," [1163] when they are compared with the perfection
   of the gospel are pronounced anything but good by the Divine oracle:
   for He says: "And I gave them precepts that were not good, and
   ordinances whereby they should not live in them." [1164] The Apostle
   also affirms that the glory of the law is so dimmed by the light of the
   New Testament that he declares that in comparison with the splendour of
   the gospel it is not to be considered glorious, saying: "For even that
   which was glorious was not glorified by reason of the glory that
   excelleth." [1165] And Scripture keeps up this comparison on the other
   side also, i.e., in weighing the merits of sinners, so that in
   comparison with the wicked it justifies those who have sinned less,
   saying: "Sodom is justified above thee;" and again: "For what hath thy
   sister Sodom sinned?" and: "The rebellious Israel hath justified her
   soul in comparison of the treacherous Judah." [1166] So then the merits
   of all the virtues, which I enumerated above, though in themselves they
   are good and precious, yet become dim in comparison of the brightness
   of contemplation. For they greatly hinder and retard the saints who are
   taken up with earthly aims even at good works, from the contemplation
   of that sublime good.

  CHAPTER V.

    How no one can be continually intent upon that highest good.

   FOR who, when "delivering the poor from the hand of them that are too
   strong for him, and the needy and the poor from them that strip him,"
   who when "breaking the jaws of the wicked and snatching their prey from
   between their teeth," [1167] can with a calm mind regard the glory of
   the Divine Majesty during the actual work of intervention? Who when
   ministering support to the poor, or when receiving with benevolent
   kindness the crowds that come to him, can at the very moment when he is
   with anxious mind perplexed for the wants of his brethren, contemplate
   the vastness of the bliss on high, and while he is shaken by the
   troubles and cares of the present life look forward to the state of the
   world to come with an heart raised above the stains of earth? Whence
   the blessed David when laying down that this alone is good for man,
   longs to cling constantly to God, and says: "It is good for me to cling
   to God, and to put my hope in the Lord." [1168] And Ecclesiastes also
   declares that this cannot be done without fault by any of the saints,
   and says: "For there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good
   and sinneth not." [1169] For who, even if he be the chief of all
   righteous and holy men, can we ever think could, while bound in the
   chains of this life, so acquire this chief good, as never to cease from
   divine contemplation, or be thought to be drawn away by earthly
   thoughts even for a short time from Him Who alone is good? Who ever
   takes no care for food, none for clothing or other carnal things, or
   when anxious about receiving the brethren, or change of place, or
   building his cell, has never desired the aid of man's assistance, nor
   when harassed by scarcity and want has incurred this sentence of
   reproof from the Lord: "Be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat,
   nor for your body what ye shall put on"? [1170] Further we confidently
   assert that even the Apostle Paul himself who surpassed in the number
   of his sufferings the toils of all the saints, could not possibly
   fulfil this, as he himself testifies to the disciples in the Acts of
   the Apostles: "Ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered to
   my need, and to the needs of those who were with me," or when in
   writing in the Thessalonians he testifies that he "worked in labour and
   weariness night and day." [1171] And although for this there were great
   rewards for his merits prepared, yet his mind, however holy and sublime
   it might be, could not help being sometimes drawn away from that
   heavenly contemplation by its attention to earthly labours. Further,
   when he saw himself enriched with such practical fruits, and on the
   other hand considered in his heart the good of meditation, and weighed
   as it were in one scale the profit of all these labours and in the
   other the delights of divine contemplation, when for a long time he had
   corrected the balance in his breast, while the vast rewards for his
   labours delighted him on one side, and on the other the desire for
   unity with and the inseparable companionship of Christ inclined him to
   depart this life, at last in his perplexity he cries out and says:
   "What I shall choose I know not. For I am in a strait betwixt two,
   having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, for it were much
   better: but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes."
   [1172] Though then in many ways he preferred this excellent good to all
   the fruits of his preaching, yet he submits himself in consideration of
   love, without which none can gain the Lord; and for their sakes, whom
   hitherto he had soothed with milk as nourishment from the breasts of
   the gospel, does not refuse to be parted from Christ, which is bad for
   himself though useful for others. For he is driven to choose this the
   rather by that excessive goodness of his whereby for the salvation of
   his brethren he is ready, were it possible, to incur even the last evil
   of an Anathema. "For I could wish," he says, "that I myself were
   Anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake, who are my kinsmen
   according to the flesh, who are Israelites," [1173] i.e., I could wish
   to be subject not only to temporal, but even to perpetual punishment,
   if only all men, were it possible, might enjoy the fellowship of
   Christ: for I am sure that the salvation of all would be better for
   Christ and for me than my own. That then the Apostle might perfectly
   gain this chief good, i.e., to enjoy the vision of God and to be joined
   continually to Christ, he was ready to be parted from this body, which
   as it is feeble and hindered by the many requirements of its frailties
   cannot help separating from union with Christ: for it is impossible for
   the mind, that is harassed by such frequent cares, and hampered by such
   various and tiresome troubles, always to enjoy the Divine vision. For
   what aim of the saints can be so persistent, what purpose can be so
   high that that crafty plotter does not sometimes destroy it? Who has
   frequented the recesses of the desert and shunned intercourse with all
   men in such a way that he never trips by unnecessary thoughts, and by
   looking on things or being occupied in earthly actions falls away from
   that contemplation of God, which truly alone is good? Who ever could
   preserve such fervour of spirit as not sometimes to pass by roving
   thoughts from his attention to prayer, and fall away suddenly from
   heavenly to earthly things? Which of us (to pass over other times of
   wandering) even at the very moment when he raises his soul in prayer to
   God on high, does not fall into a sort of stupor, and even against his
   will offend by that very thing from which he hoped for pardon of his
   sins? Who, I ask, is so alert and vigilant as never, while he is
   singing a Psalm to God, to allow his mind to wander from the meaning of
   Scripture? Who is so intimate with and closely joined to God, as to
   congratulate himself on having carried out for a single day that rule
   of the Apostle's, whereby he bids us pray without ceasing? [1174] And
   though all these things may seem to some, who are involved in grosser
   sins, to be trivial and altogether foreign to sin, yet to those who
   know the value of perfection a quantity even of very small matters
   becomes most serious.

  CHAPTER VI.

    How those who think that they are without sin are like purblind people.

   AS if we were to suppose that two men, one of whom was clear sighted
   with perfect vision, and the other, one whose eyesight was obscured by
   dimness of vision, had together entered some great house that was
   filled with a quantity of bundles, instruments, and vessels, would not
   he, whose dullness of vision prevented his seeing everything, assert
   that there was nothing there but chests, beds, benches, tables, and
   whatever met the fingers of one who felt them rather than the eyes of
   one who saw them, while on the other hand would not the other, who
   searched out what was hidden with clear and bright eyes, declare that
   there were there many most minute articles, and what could scarcely be
   counted; which if they were ever gathered up into a single pile, would
   by their number equal or perhaps exceed the size of those few things
   which the other had felt. So then even saints, and, if we may so say,
   men who see, whose aim is the utmost perfection, cleverly detect in
   themselves even those things which the gaze of our mind being as it
   were darkened cannot see, and condemn them very severely, to such an
   extent that those who have not, as it seems to our carelessness, dimmed
   the whiteness of their body, which is as it were like snow, with even
   the slightest spot of sin, seem to themselves to be covered with many
   stains, if, I will not say any evil or vain thoughts creep into the
   doors of their mind, but even the recollection of a Psalm which has to
   be said takes off the attention of the kneeler at the time for prayer.
   For if, say they, when we ask some great man, I will not say for our
   life and salvation, but for some advantage and profit, we fasten all
   our attention of mind and body upon him, and hang with trembling
   expectation on his nod, with no slight dread lest haply some foolish or
   unsuitable word may turn aside the pity of our hearer, and then too,
   when we are standing in the forum or in the courts of earthly judges,
   with our opponent standing over against us, if in the midst of the
   prosecution and trial any coughing or spitting, or laughing, or
   yawning, or sleep overtakes us, with what malice will our ever watchful
   opponent stir up the severity of the judge to our damage: how much
   more, when we entreat Him who knows all secrets, should we, by reason
   of our imminent danger of everlasting death, plead with earnest and
   anxious prayer for the kindness of the judge, especially as on the
   other side there stands one who is both our crafty seducer and our
   accuser! And not without reason will he be bound by no light sin, but
   by a grievous fault of wickedness, who, when he pours forth his prayer
   to God, departs at once from His sight as if from the eyes of one who
   neither sees nor hears, and follows the vanity of wicked thoughts. But
   they who cover the eyes of their heart with a thick veil of their sins,
   and as the Saviour says, "Seeing see not and hearing hear not nor
   understand," [1175] hardly regard in the inmost recesses of their
   breast even those faults which are great and deadly, and cannot with
   clear eyes look at any deceitful thoughts, nor even those vague and
   secret desires which strike the mind with slight and subtle
   suggestions, nor the captivities of their soul, but always wandering
   among impure thoughts they know not how to be sorry when they are
   distracted from that meditation which is so special, nor can they
   grieve that they have lost anything as while they lay open their mind
   to the entrance of any thought as they please, they have nothing set
   before them to hold to as the main thing or to desire in every way.

  CHAPTER VII.

    How those who maintain that a man can be without sin are charged with a
    twofold error.

   THE reason however which drives us into this error is that, as we are
   utterly ignorant of the virtue of being without sin, [1176] we fancy
   that we cannot contract any guilt from those idle and random vagaries
   of our thoughts, but being rendered stupid by dullness and as it were
   smitten with blindness we can see nothing in ourselves but capital
   offences, and think that we have only to keep clear of those things
   which are condemned also by the severity of secular laws, and if we
   find that even for a short time we are free from these we at once
   imagine that there is no sin at all in us. Accordingly we are
   distinguished from the number of those who see, because we do not see
   the many small stains, which are crowded together in us, and are not
   smitten with saving contrition, if the malady of vexation overtakes our
   thoughts, nor are we sorry that we are struck by the suggestions of
   vainglory, nor do we weep over our prayers offered up so tardily and
   coldly, nor consider it a fault if while we are singing or praying,
   something else besides the actual prayer or Psalm fills our thoughts,
   nor are we horrified because we do not blush to conceive many things
   which we are ashamed to speak or do before men, in our heart, which, as
   we know, lies open to the Divine gaze; nor do we purge away the
   pollution of filthy dreams with copious ablutions of our tears, nor
   grieve that in the pious act of almsgiving when we are assisting the
   needs of the brethren, or ministering support to the poor, the
   brightness of our cheerfulness is clouded over by a stingy delay, nor
   do we think that we are affected by any loss when we forget God and
   think about things that are temporal and corrupt, so that these words
   of Solomon fairly apply to us: "They smite me but I have not grieved,
   and they have mocked me, but I knew it not." [1177]

  CHAPTER VIII.

    How it is given to but few to understand what sin is.

   THOSE on the other hand who make the sum of all their joy and delight
   and bliss consist in the contemplation of divine and spiritual things
   alone, if they are unwillingly withdrawn from them even for a short
   time by thoughts that force themselves upon them, punish this as if it
   were a kind of sacrilege in them, and avenge it by immediate
   chastisement, and in their grief that they have preferred some
   worthless creature (to which their mental gaze was turned aside) to
   their Creator, charge themselves with the guilt (I had almost said) of
   impiety, and although they turn the eyes of their heart with the utmost
   speed to behold the brightness of the Divine Glory, yet they cannot
   tolerate even for a very short time the darkness of carnal thoughts,
   and execrate whatever keeps back their soul's gaze from the true light.
   Finally when the blessed Apostle John would instill this feeling into
   everybody he says: "Little children, love not the world, neither the
   things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of
   God is not in him: for everything that is in the world is the lust of
   the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not
   of the Father but of the world. And the world perisheth and the lust
   thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever." [1178] The
   saints therefore scorn all those things on which the world exists, but
   it is impossible for them never to be carried away to them by a brief
   aberration of thoughts, and even now no man, except our Lord and
   Saviour, can keep his naturally wandering mind always fixed on the
   contemplation of God so as never to be carried away from it through the
   love of something in this world; as Scripture says: "Even the stars are
   not clean in His sight," and again: "If He puts no trust in His saints,
   and findeth iniquity in His angels," or as the more correct translation
   has it: "Behold among His saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens
   are not pure in His sight." [1179]

  CHAPTER IX.

    Of the care with which a monk should preserve the recollection of God.

   I SHOULD say then that the saints who keep a firm hold of the
   recollection of God and are borne along, as it were, with their steps
   suspended on a line stretched out on high, may be rightly compared to
   rope dancers, commonly called funambuli, who risk all their safety and
   life on the path of that very narrow rope, with no doubt that they will
   immediately meet with a most dreadful death if their foot swerves or
   trips in the very slightest degree, or goes over the line of the course
   in which alone is safety. And while with marvellous skill they ply
   their airy steps through space, if they keep not their steps to that
   all too narrow path with careful and anxious regulation, the earth
   which is the natural base and the most solid and safest foundation for
   all, becomes to them an immediate and clear danger, not because its
   nature is changed, but because they fall headlong upon it by the weight
   of their bodies. So also that unwearied goodness of God and His
   unchanging nature [1180] hurts no one indeed, but we ourselves by
   falling from on high and tending to the depths are the authors of our
   own death, or rather the very fall becomes death to the faller. For it
   says: "Woe to them for they have departed from Me: they shall be wasted
   because they have transgressed against Me;" and again: "Woe to them
   when I shall depart from them." For "thine own wickedness shall reprove
   thee, and thy apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou and see that it is
   an evil and a bitter thing for thee to have left the Lord thy God;" for
   "every man is bound by the cords of his sins." [1181] To whom this
   rebuke is aptly directed by the Lord: "Behold," He says, "all you that
   kindle a fire, encompassed with flames, walk ye in the light of your
   fire and in the flames which you have kindled;" and again: "He that
   kindleth iniquity, shall perish by it." [1182]

  CHAPTER X.

    How those who are on the way to perfection are truly humble, and feel that
    they always stand in need of God's grace.

   WHEN then holy men feel that they are oppressed by the weight of
   earthly thoughts and fall away from their loftiness of mind, and that
   they are led away against their will or rather without knowing it, into
   the law of sin and death, and (to pass over other matters) are kept
   back by those actions which I described above, which are good and right
   though earthly, from the vision of God; they have something to groan
   over constantly to the Lord; they have something for which indeed to
   humble themselves, and in their contrition to profess themselves not in
   words only but in heart, sinners; and for this, while they continually
   ask of the Lord's grace pardon for everything that day by day they
   commit when overcome by the weakness of the flesh, they should shed
   without ceasing true tears of penitence; as they see that being
   involved even to the very end of their life in the very same troubles,
   with continual sorrow for which they are tried, they cannot even offer
   their prayers without harassing thoughts. So then as they know by
   experience that through the hindrance of the burden of the flesh they
   cannot by human strength reach the desired end, nor be united according
   to their heart's desire with that chief and highest good, but that they
   are led away from the vision of it captive to worldly things, they
   betake themselves to the grace of God, "Who justifieth the ungodly,"
   [1183] and cry out with the Apostle: "O wretched man that I am! Who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through
   our Lord Jesus Christ." [1184] For they feel that they cannot perform
   the good that they would, but are ever falling into the evil which they
   would not, and which they hate, i.e., wandering thoughts and care for
   carnal things.

  CHAPTER XI.

    Explanation of the phrase: "For I delight in the law of God after the inner
    man," etc.

   AND they "delight" indeed "in the law of God after the inner man,"
   which soars above all visible things and ever strives to be united to
   God alone, but they "see another law in their members," i.e., implanted
   in their natural human condition, which "resisting the law of their
   mind," [1185] brings their thoughts into captivity to the forcible law
   of sin, compelling them to forsake that chief good and submit to
   earthly notions, which though they may appear necessary and useful when
   they are taken up in the interests of some religious want, yet when
   they are set against that good which fascinates the gaze of all the
   saints, are seen by them to be bad and such as should be avoided,
   because by them in some way or other and for a short time they are
   drawn away from the joy of that perfect bliss. For the law of sin is
   really what the fall of its first father brought on mankind by that
   fault of his, against which there was uttered this sentence by the most
   just Judge: "Cursed is the ground in thy works; thorns and thistles
   shall it bring forth to thee, and in the sweat of thy brow shalt thou
   eat bread." [1186] This, I say, is the law, implanted in the members of
   all mortals, which resists the law of our mind and keeps it back from
   the vision of God, and which, as the earth is cursed in our works after
   the knowledge of good and evil, begins to produce the thorns and
   thistles of thoughts, by the sharp pricks of which the natural seeds of
   virtues are choked, so that without the sweat of our brow we cannot eat
   our bread which "cometh down from heaven," and which "strengtheneth
   man's heart." [1187] The whole human race in general therefore is
   without exception subject to this law. For there is no one, however
   saintly, who does not take the bread mentioned above with the sweat of
   his brow and anxious efforts of his heart. But many rich men, as we
   see, are fed on that common bread without any sweat of their brow.

  CHAPTER XII.

    Of this also: "But we know that the law is spiritual," etc.

   AND this law the Apostle also calls spiritual saying: "But we know that
   the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin." [1188] For this
   law is spiritual which bids us eat in the sweat of our brow that "true
   bread which cometh down from heaven" [1189] but that sale under sin
   makes us carnal. What, I ask, or whose is that sin? Doubtless Adam's,
   by whose fall and, if I may so say, ruinous transaction and fraudulent
   bargain we were sold. For when he was led astray by the persuasion of
   the serpent he brought all his descendants under the yoke of perpetual
   bondage, as they were alienated by taking the forbidden food. For this
   custom is generally observed between the buyer and seller, that one who
   wants to make himself over to the power of another, receives from his
   buyer a price for the loss of his liberty, and his consignment to
   perpetual slavery. And we can very plainly see that this took place
   between Adam and the serpent. For by eating of the forbidden tree he
   received from the serpent the price of his liberty, and gave up his
   natural freedom and chose to give himself up to perpetual slavery to
   him from whom he had obtained the deadly price of the forbidden fruit;
   and thenceforth he was bound by this condition and not without reason
   subjected all the offspring of his posterity to perpetual service to
   him whose slave he had become. For what can any marriage in slavery
   produce but slaves? What then? Did that cunning and crafty buyer take
   away the rights of ownership from the true and lawful lord? Not so. For
   neither did he overcome all God's property by the craft of a single act
   of deception so that the true lord lost his rights of ownership, who
   though the buyer himself was a rebel and a renegade, yet oppressed him
   with the yoke of slavery; but because the Creator had endowed all
   reasonable creatures with free will, he would not restore to their
   natural liberty against their will those who contrary to right had sold
   themselves by the sin of greedy lust. Since anything that is contrary
   to goodness and fairness is abhorrent to Him who is the Author of
   justice and piety. For it would have been wrong for Him to have
   recalled the blessing of freedom granted, unfair for Him to have by His
   power oppressed man who was free, and by taking him captive, not to
   have allowed him to exercise the prerogative of the freedom he had
   received, as He was reserving his salvation for future ages, that in
   due season the fulness of the appointed time might be fulfilled. For it
   was right that his offspring should remain under the ancient conditions
   for so long a time, until by the price of His own blood the grace of
   the Lord redeemed them from their original chains and set them free in
   the primeval state of liberty, though He was able even then to save
   them, but would not, because equity forbade Him to break the terms of
   His own decree. Would you know the reason for your being sold? Hear thy
   Redeemer Himself proclaiming openly by Isaiah the prophet: "What is
   this bill of the divorce of your mother with which I have put her away?
   Or who is My creditor to whom I sold you? Behold you are sold for your
   iniquities and for your wicked deeds have I put your mother away."
   Would you also plainly see why when you were consigned to the yoke of
   slavery He would not redeem you by the might of His own power? Hear
   what He added to the former passage, and how He charges the same
   servants of sin with the reason for their voluntary sale. "Is My hand
   shortened and become little that I cannot redeem, or is there no
   strength in Me to deliver?" [1190] But what it is which is always
   standing in the way of His most powerful pity the same prophet shows
   when he says: "Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it
   cannot save, neither is His ear heavy that it cannot hear: But your
   iniquities have divided between you and your God and your sins have hid
   His face from you that He should not hear." [1191]

  CHAPTER XIII.

    Of this also: "But I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good
    thing."

   BECAUSE then the original curse of God has made us carnal and condemned
   us to thorns and thistles, and our father has sold us by that unhappy
   bargain so that we cannot do the good that we would, while we are torn
   away from the recollection of God Most High and forced to think on what
   belongs to human weakness, while burning with the love of purity, we
   are often even against our will troubled by natural desires, which we
   would rather know nothing about; we know that in our flesh there
   dwelleth no good thing [1192] viz., the perpetual and lasting peace of
   this meditation of which we have spoken; but there is brought about in
   our case that miserable and wretched divorce, that when with the mind
   we want to serve the law of God, since we never want to remove our gaze
   from the Divine brightness, yet surrounded as we are by carnal darkness
   we are forced by a kind of law of sin to tear ourselves away from the
   good which we know, as we fall away from that lofty height of mind to
   earthly cares and thoughts, to which the law of sin, i.e., the sentence
   of God, which the first delinquent received, has not without reason
   condemned us. And hence it is that the blessed Apostle, though he
   openly admits that he and all saints are bound by the constraint of
   this sin, yet boldly asserts that none of them will be condemned for
   this, saying: "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are
   in Christ Jesus: for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
   set me free from the law of sin and death," [1193] i.e., the grace of
   Christ day by day frees all his saints from this law of sin and death,
   under which they are constantly reluctantly obliged to come, whenever
   they pray to the Lord for the forgiveness of their trespasses. You see
   then that it was in the person not of sinners but of those who are
   really saints and perfect, that the blessed Apostle gave utterance to
   this saying: "For I do not the good that I would, but the evil which I
   hate, that I do;" and: "I see another law in my members resisting the
   law of my mind and bringing me captive to the law of sin which is in my
   members." [1194]

  CHAPTER XIV.

    An objection, that the saying: "For I do not the good that I would," etc.,
    applies to the persons neither of unbelievers nor of saints.

   GERMANUS: We say that this does not apply to the persons either of
   those who are involved in capital offences, or of an Apostle and those
   who have advanced to his measure, but we think that it ought properly
   to be taken of those who after receiving the grace of God and the
   knowledge of the truth, are anxious to keep themselves from carnal sins
   but, as ancient custom like a natural law rules most forcibly in their
   members, they are carried away to the ingrained lust of their passions.
   For the custom and frequency of sinning becomes like a natural law,
   which, implanted in the man's weak members, leads the feelings of the
   soul that is not yet instructed in all the pursuits of virtue, but is
   still, if I may say so, of an uninstructed and tender chastity, captive
   to sin and subjecting them by an ancient law to death, brings them
   under the yoke of sin that rules over them, not suffering them to
   obtain the good of purity which they love, but rather forcing them to
   do the evil which they hate.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

    The answer to the objection raised.

   THEONAS: Your notion does not come to much; as you yourselves have
   actually now begun to maintain that this cannot possibly stand in the
   person of those who are out and out sinners, but that it properly
   applies to those who are trying to keep themselves clear from carnal
   sins. And since you have already separated these from the number of
   sinners, it follows that you must shortly admit them into the ranks of
   the faithful and holy. For what kinds of sin do you say that those can
   commit, from which, if they are involved in them after the grace of
   baptism, they can be freed by the daily grace of Christ? or of what
   body of death are we to think that the Apostle said: "Who shall deliver
   me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
   our Lord"? [1195] Is it not clear, as truth compels you yourselves also
   to admit, that it is spoken not of those members of capital crimes, by
   which the wages of eternal death are gained; viz., murder, fornication,
   adultery, drunkenness, thefts and robberies, but of that body before
   mentioned, which the daily grace of Christ assists? For whoever after
   baptism and the knowledge of God falls into that death, must know that
   he will either have to be cleansed, not by the daily grace of Christ,
   i.e., an easy forgiveness, which our Lord when at any moment He is
   prayed to, is wont to grant to our errors, but by a lifelong affliction
   of penitence and penal sorrow, or else will be hereafter consigned to
   the punishment of eternal fire for them, as the same Apostle thus
   declares: "Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
   adulterers, nor effeminate, nor defilers of themselves with mankind,
   nor thieves, nor covetous persons, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor
   extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God." [1196] Or what is that
   law warring in our members which resists the law of our mind, and when
   it has led us resisting but captives to the law of sin and death, and
   has made us serve it with the flesh, nevertheless suffers us to serve
   the law of God with the mind? For I do not suppose that this law of sin
   denotes crimes or can be taken of the offences mentioned above, of
   which if a man is guilty he does not serve the law of God with the
   mind, from which law he must first have departed in heart before he is
   guilty of any of them with the flesh. For what is it to serve the law
   of sin, but to do what is commanded by sin? What sort of sin then is it
   to which so great holiness and perfection feels that it is captive, and
   yet doubts not that it will be freed from it by the grace of Christ,
   saying: "O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body
   of this death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord"? What
   law, I ask, will you maintain to be implanted in our members, which,
   withdrawing us from the law of God and bringing us into captivity to
   the law of sin, could make us wretched rather than guilty so that we
   should not be consigned to eternal punishment, but still as it were
   sigh for the unbroken joys of bliss, and, seeking for a helper who
   shall restore us to it, exclaim with the Apostle: "O wretched man that
   I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" For what is it
   to be led captive to the law of sin but to continue to perform and
   commit sin? Or what other chief good can be given which the saints
   cannot fulfil, except that in comparison with which, as we said above,
   everything else is not good? Indeed we know that many things in this
   world are good, and chiefly, modesty, continence, sobriety, humility,
   justice, mercy, temperance, piety: but all of these things fail to come
   up to that chief good, and can be done I say not by apostles, but even
   by ordinary folk; and, those by whom they are not done, are either
   chastised with eternal punishment, or are set free by great exertions,
   as was said above, of penitence, and not by the daily grace of Christ.
   It remains then for us to admit that this saying of the Apostle is
   rightly applied only to the persons of saints, who day after day
   falling under this law, which we described, of sin not of crimes, are
   secure of their salvation and not precipitated into wicked deeds, but,
   as has often been said, are drawn away from the contemplation of God to
   the misery of bodily thoughts, and are often deprived of the blessing
   of that true bliss. For if they felt that by this law of their members
   they were bound daily to crimes, they would complain of the loss not of
   happiness but of innocence, and the Apostle Paul would not say: "O
   wretched man that I am," but "Impure," or "Wicked man that I am," and
   he would wish to be rid not of the body of this death, i.e., this
   mortal state, but of the crimes and misdeeds of this flesh. But because
   by reason of his state of human frailty he felt that he was captive,
   i.e., led away to carnal cares and anxieties which the law of sin and
   death causes, he groans over this law of sin under which against his
   will he had fallen, and at once has recourse to Christ and is saved by
   the present redemption of His grace. Whatever of anxiety therefore that
   law of sin, which naturally produces the thorns and thistles of mortal
   thoughts and cares, has caused to spring up in the ground of the
   Apostle's breast, that the law of grace at once plucks up. "For the
   law," says he, "of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath set me free
   from the law of sin and death." [1197]

  CHAPTER XVI.

    What is the body of sin.

   THIS then is that body of death from which we cannot escape, pent in
   which those who are perfect, who have tasted "how gracious the Lord
   is," [1198] daily feel with the prophet "how bad for himself and bitter
   it is for a man to depart from the Lord his God." [1199] This is the
   body of death which restrains us from the heavenly vision and drags us
   back to earthly things, which causes men while singing Psalms and
   kneeling in prayer to have their thoughts filled with human figures, or
   conversations, or business, or unnecessary actions. This is the body of
   death, owing to which those, who would emulate the sanctity of angels,
   and who long to cling continually to God, yet are unable to arrive at
   the perfection of this good, because the body of death stands in their
   way, but they do the evil that they would not, i.e., they are dragged
   down in their minds even to the things which have nothing to do with
   their advance and perfection in virtue. Finally that the blessed
   Apostle might clearly denote that he said this of saintly and perfect
   men, and those like himself, he in a way points with his finger to
   himself and at once proceeds: "And so I myself," i.e, I who say this,
   lay bare the secrets of my own not another's conscience. This mode of
   speech at any rate the Apostle is familiarly accustomed to use,
   whenever he wants to point specially to himself, as here: "I, Paul,
   myself beseech you by the mildness and modesty of Christ;" and again:
   "except that I myself was not burdensome to you;" and once more: "But
   be it so: I myself did not burden you;" and elsewhere: "I, Paul, myself
   say unto you: if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing;"
   and to the Romans: "For I could wish that I myself were Anathema from
   Christ for my brethren." [1200] But it cannot unreasonably be taken in
   this way, that "And so I myself" is expressly said with emphasis, i.e.,
   I whom you know to be an Apostle of Christ, whom you venerate with the
   utmost respect, whom you believe to be of the highest character and
   perfect, and one in whom Christ speaks, though with the mind I serve
   the law of God, yet with the flesh I confess that I serve the law of
   sin, i.e., by the occupations of my human condition am sometimes
   dragged down from heavenly to earthly things and the height of my mind
   is brought down to the level of care for humble matters. And by this
   law of sin I find that at every moment I am so taken captive that
   although I persist in my immovable longing around the law of God, yet
   in no way can I escape the power of this captivity, unless I always fly
   to the grace of the Saviour.

  CHAPTER XVII.

    How all the saints have confessed with truth that they were unclean and
    sinful.

   AND therefore with daily sighs all the saints grieve over this weakness
   of their nature and while they search into their shifting thoughts and
   the secrets and inmost recesses of their conscience, cry out in
   entreaty: "Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight
   shall no man living be justified;" and this: "Who will boast that he
   hath a chaste heart? or who will have confidence that he is pure from
   sin?" and again: "There is not a righteous man upon earth that doeth
   good and sinneth not;" and this also: "Who knoweth his faults?" [1201]
   And so they have recognized that man's righteousness is weak and
   imperfect and always needs God's mercy, so that one of those whose
   iniquities and sins God purged away with the live coal of His word sent
   from the altar, after that marvellous vision of God, after his view of
   the Seraphim on high and the revelation of heavenly mysteries, said:
   "Woe is me! for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of
   a people of unclean lips." [1202] And I fancy that perhaps even then he
   would not have felt the uncleanness of his lips, unless it had been
   given him to recognize the true and complete purity of perfection by
   the vision of God, at the sight of Whom he suddenly became aware of his
   own uncleanness, of which he had previously been ignorant. For when he
   says: "Woe is me! for I am a man of unclean lips," he shows that his
   confession that follows refers to his own lips, and not to the
   uncleanness of the people: "and I dwell in the midst of a people of
   unclean lips." But even when in his prayer he confesses the uncleanness
   of all sinners, he embraces in his general supplication not only the
   mass of the wicked but also of the good, saying: "Behold Thou art
   angry, and we have sinned: in them we have been always, and we shall be
   saved. We are all become as one unclean, and all our righteousnesses as
   filthy rags." [1203] What, I ask, could be clearer than this saying, in
   which the prophet includes not one only but all our righteousnesses
   and, looking round on all things that are considered unclean and
   disgusting, because he could find nothing in the life of men fouler or
   more unclean, chose to compare them to filthy rags. In vain then is the
   sharpness of a nagging objection raised against this perfectly clear
   truth, as a little while back you said: "If no one is without sin, then
   no one is holy; and if no one is holy, then no one will be saved."
   [1204] For the puzzle of this question can be solved by the prophet's
   testimony. "Behold," he says, "Thou art angry and we have sinned,"
   i.e., when Thou didst reject our pride of heart or our carelessness,
   and deprive us of Thine aid, at once the abyss of our sins swallowed us
   up, as if one should say to the bright substance of the sun: Behold
   thou hast set, and at once murky darkness covered us. And yet though he
   here says that the saints have sinned, and have not only sinned but
   also have always remained in their sins, he does not altogether despair
   of salvation but adds: "In them we have been always, and we shall be
   saved." This saying: "Behold Thou art angry and we have sinned," I will
   compare to that one of the Apostle's: "O wretched man that I am! Who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Again this that the
   prophet subjoins: "In them we have been always, and we shall be saved,"
   corresponds to the following words of the Apostle: "Thanks be to God
   through Jesus Christ our Lord." In the same way also this passage of
   the same prophet: "Woe is me! for I am a man of unclean lips and I
   dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips," seems to agree with
   the words quoted above: "O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me
   from the body of this death?" And what follows in the prophet: "And
   behold there flew to me one of the Seraphim, having in his hand a coal
   (or stone) which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he
   touched my mouth and said: Lo, with this I have touched thy lips, and
   thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged," [1205] is just
   what seems to have fallen from the mouth of Paul, who says: "Thanks be
   to God through Jesus Christ our Lord." You see then how all the saints
   with truth confess not so much in the person of the people as in their
   own that they are sinners, and yet by no means despair of their
   salvation, but look for full justification (which they do not hope that
   they cannot obtain by virtue of the state of human frailty) from the
   grace and mercy of the Lord.

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    That even good and holy men are not without sin.

   BUT that no one however holy is in this life free from trespasses and
   sin, we are told also by the teaching of the Saviour, who gave His
   disciples the form of the perfect prayer and among those other sublime
   and sacred commands, which as they were only given to the saints and
   perfect cannot apply to the wicked and unbelievers, He bade this to be
   inserted: "And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors."
   [1206] If then this is offered as a true prayer and by saints, as we
   ought without the shadow of a doubt to believe, who can be found so
   obstinate and impudent, so puffed up with the pride of the devil's own
   rage, as to maintain that he is without sin, and not only to think
   himself greater than apostles, but also to charge the Saviour Himself
   with ignorance or folly, as if He either did not know that some men
   could be free from debts, or was idly teaching those whom He knew to
   stand in no need of the remedy of that prayer? But since all the saints
   who altogether keep the commands of their King, say every day "Forgive
   us our debts," if they speak the truth there is indeed no one free from
   sin, but if they speak falsely, it is equally true that they are not
   free from the sin of falsehood. Wherefore also that most wise
   Ecclesiastes reviewing in his mind all the actions and purposes of men
   declares without any exception: "that there is not a righteous man upon
   earth, that doeth good and sinneth not," [1207] i.e., no one ever could
   or ever will be found on this earth so holy, so diligent, so earnest as
   to be able continually to cling to that true and unique good, and not
   day after day to feel that he is drawn aside from it and fails. But
   still though he maintains that he cannot be free from wrong doing, yet
   none the less we must not deny that he is righteous.

  CHAPTER XIX.

    How even in the hour of prayer it is almost impossible to avoid sin.

   WHOEVER then ascribes sinlessness to human nature must fight against no
   idle words but the witness and proof of his conscience which is on our
   side, and then only should maintain that he is without sin, when he
   finds that he is not torn away from this highest good: nay rather,
   whoever considering his own conscience, to say no more, finds that he
   has celebrated even one single service without the distraction of a
   single word or deed or thought, may say that he is without sin. Further
   because we admit that the discursive lightness of the human mind cannot
   get rid of these idle and empty things, we thus consequently confess
   with truth that we are not without sin. For with whatever care a man
   tries to keep his heart, he can never, owing to the resistance of the
   nature of the flesh, keep it according to the desire of his spirit. For
   however far the human mind may have advanced and progressed towards a
   finer purity of contemplation, so much the more will it see itself to
   be unclean, as it were in the mirror of its purity, because while the
   soul raises itself for a loftier vision and as it looks forth yearns
   for greater things than it performs, it is sure always to despise as
   inferior and worthless the things in which it is mixed up. Since a
   keener sight notices more; and a blameless life produces greater sorrow
   when found fault with; and amendment of life, and earnest striving
   after goodness multiplies groans and sighs. For no one can rest content
   with that stage to which he has advanced, and however much a man may be
   purified in mind, so much the more does he see himself to be foul, and
   find grounds for humiliation rather than for pride, and, however
   swiftly he may climb to greater heights, so much more does he see above
   him whither he is tending. Finally that chosen Apostle "whom Jesus
   loved," [1208] who lay on His bosom, uttered this saying as if from the
   heart of the Lord: "If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves
   and the truth is not in us." [1209] And so if when we say that we have
   no sin, we have not the truth, that is Christ, in us, what good do we
   do except to prove ourselves by this very, profession, criminals and
   wicked among sinners?

  CHAPTER XX.

    From whom we can learn the destruction of sin and perfection of goodness.

   LASTLY if you would like to investigate more thoroughly whether it is
   possible for human nature to attain sinlessness, from whom can we more
   clearly learn this than from those who "have crucified the flesh with
   its faults and lusts," and to whom "the world is really crucified"?
   [1210] Who though they have not only utterly eradicated all faults from
   their hearts, but also are trying to shut out even the thought and
   recollection of sin, yet still day after day faithfully maintain that
   they cannot even for a single hour be free from spot of sin.

  CHAPTER XXI.

    That although we acknowledge that we cannot be without sin, yet still we
    ought not to suspend ourselves from the Lord's Communion.

   YET we ought not to suspend ourselves from the Lord's Communion because
   we confess ourselves sinners, but should more and more eagerly hasten
   to it for the healing of our soul, and purifying of our spirit, and
   seek the rather a remedy for our wounds with humility of mind and
   faith, as considering ourselves unworthy to receive so great grace.
   Otherwise we cannot worthily receive the Communion even once a year, as
   some do, who live in monasteries and so regard the dignity and holiness
   and value of the heavenly sacraments, as to think that none but saints
   and spotless persons should venture to receive them, and not rather
   that they would make us saints and pure by taking them. And these
   thereby fall into greater presumption and arrogance than what they seem
   to themselves to avoid, because at the time when they do receive them,
   they consider that they are worthy to receive them. But it is much
   better to receive them every Sunday for the healing of our infirmities,
   with that humility of heart, whereby we believe and confess that we can
   never touch those holy mysteries worthily, than to be puffed up by a
   foolish persuasion of heart, and believe that at the year's end we are
   worthy to receive them. Wherefore that we may be able to grasp this and
   hold it fruitfully, let us the more earnestly implore the Lord's mercy
   to help us to perform this, which is learnt not like other human arts,
   by some previous verbal explanation, but rather by experience and
   action leading the way; and which also unless it is often considered
   and hammered out in the Conferences of spiritual persons, and anxiously
   sifted by daily experience and trial of it, will either become obsolete
   through carelessness or perish by idle forgetfulness.

                                 CONFERENCE 24.

CONFERENCE OF ABBOT ABRAHAM.

ON MORTIFICATION.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

    How we laid bare the secrets of our thoughts to Abbot Abraham.

   THIS twenty-fourth Conference of Abbot Abraham [1211] is by the favour
   of Christ produced, which concludes the traditions and decisions of all
   the Elders; and when by the aid of your prayers it has been finished,
   as the number mystically corresponds to that of the four and twenty
   Elders who are said in the holy Apocalypse [1212] to offer their crowns
   to the Lamb, we think that we shall have paid the debt of all our
   promises. And henceforth if these four and twenty Elders of ours have
   been crowned with any glory for the sake of their teaching, they shall
   with bowed heads offer it to the Lamb who was slain for the salvation
   of the world: for He it was Who vouschafed for the honour of His name
   to grant to them such exalted feelings and to us whatever words were
   needful to set forth such profound thoughts. And the merits of His gift
   must be referred to the Author of all good, to whom the more is owed,
   as the more is paid. Therefore with anxious confession we laid before
   this Abraham the impulse of our thoughts, whereby we were urged by
   daily perplexities of our mind to return to our country and revisit our
   kinsfolk. For from this the greatest reason for our desire sprang,
   because we remembered that our kinsfolk were endowed with such piety
   and goodness that we felt sure that they would never interfere with our
   purpose, and we constantly reflected, that we should gain more good out
   of their earnestness, and should be hampered by no cares about bodily
   matters, and no trouble in providing food, as they would gladly
   minister abundantly to the supply of all our wants, and besides this we
   were feeding our souls on the hope of empty joys, as we thought that we
   should gain the greatest good from the conversion [1213] of many, who
   were to be turned to the way of salvation by our example and
   instructions. Then besides this the very spot, where was the ancestral
   possession of our forefathers, and the delightful pleasantness of the
   neighbourhood was painted before our eyes, how pleasantly and suitably
   it stretched away to the desert, so that the recesses of the woods
   would not only delight the heart of a monk, but would also furnish him
   with a plentiful supply of food. [1214] And when we explained all this
   to the aforesaid old man, in a straightforward way, according to the
   faith of our conscience, and showed by our copious tears that we could
   no longer resist the violence of the impulse, unless the grace of God
   came to our rescue by the healing which he, could give, he waited for a
   long time in silence and at last sighed deeply and said:

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

    How the old man exposed our errors.

   THE feebleness of your ideas shows that you have not yet renounced
   worldly desires nor mortified your former lusts. For as the wandering
   character of your desires testifies to the sloth of your heart, this
   pilgrimage and absence from your kinsfolk, which you ought rather to
   endure with your heart, you do endure only with the flesh. For all
   these things would have been buried and altogether driven out of your
   hearts, if you had got hold of the right method of renunciation, and
   the main reason for the solitude in which we dwell. And so I see that
   you are labouring under that infirmity of sluggishness, which is thus
   described in Proverbs: "Every sluggard is always desiring something;"
   and again: "Desires kill the slothful." [1215] For in our case too
   these supplies of worldly conveniences, which you have described, would
   not be wanting, if we believed that they were appropriate to our
   calling, or thought that we could get out of those delights and
   pleasures as much profit as that which is gained from this squalor of
   the country and bodily affliction. Nor are we so deprived of the solace
   of our kinsfolk, that those who delight to support us with their
   substance should fail us, were it not that this saying of the Saviour
   meets us and excludes everything that contributes to the support of
   this flesh, as He says: "He who doth not leave (or hate) father and
   mother and children and brethren cannot be My disciple." [1216] But if
   we were altogether deprived of the protection of our parents, the
   services of the princes of this world would not be wanting, as they
   would most thankfully rejoice to minister to our necessities with
   prompt liberality. And supported by their bounty, we should be free
   from the care of preparing food, were it not that this curse of the
   prophet terribly frightened us. For "Cursed," he says, "is the man that
   putteth his hope in man;" and: "Put not your trust in princes." [1217]
   We should also at any rate place our cells on the banks of the river
   Nile and have water at our very doors, so as not to be obliged to carry
   it on our necks for four miles, were it not that the blessed Apostle
   rendered us indefatigable in enduring this labour, and cheered us by
   his words, saying: "Every one shall receive his own reward according to
   his labour." [1218] Nor are we ignorant that there are even in our
   country some pleasant recesses, where plenty of fruits, and pleasant
   gardens, and fertile ground would furnish the food we need with the
   slightest bodily efforts on our part, were it not that we were afraid
   lest that reproach might apply to us, which is directed against the
   rich man in the gospel: "Because thou hast received thy consolation in
   this life." [1219] But as we despise all these things and scorn them
   together with all the pleasures of this world, we delight only in this
   squalor, and prefer to all luxuries this dreadful and vast desert, and
   cannot compare any riches of a fertile soil to these barren sands, as
   we pursue no temporal gains of this body, but the eternal rewards of
   the spirit. For it is but little for a monk to have once made his
   renunciation, i.e., in the early days of his conversion to have
   disregarded the present world, unless he continues to renounce it
   daily. For to the very end of this life we must with the prophet say
   this: "And I have not desired the day of man, Thou knowest." [1220]
   Wherefore also the Lord says in the gospel: "If any man will come after
   Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me."

  CHAPTER III.

    Of the character of the districts which anchorites ought to seek.

   AND therefore by him who is exercising anxious care over the purity of
   his inner man, those districts should be sought, which do not by their
   fruitfulness and fertility invite his mind to the trouble of
   cultivating them, nor drive him forth from his fixed and immovable
   position in his cell, and force him to go forth to some work in the
   open air, and so, his thoughts being as it were poured forth openly,
   scatter to the winds all his concentration of mind and all the keenness
   of his vision of his aim. And this cannot be guarded against or seen by
   anyone at all however careful and watchful, except one who continually
   keeps his body and soul shut up and enclosed in walls, that, like a
   splendid fisherman, looking out for food for himself by the apostolic
   art, he may eagerly and without moving catch the swarms of thoughts
   swimming in the calm depths of his heart, and surveying with curious
   eye the depths as from a high rock, may sagaciously and cunningly
   decide what he ought to lure to himself by his saving hook, and what he
   can neglect and reject as bad and nasty fishes.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

    What sorts of work should be chosen by solitaries.

   EVERYONE therefore who constantly perseveres in this watchfulness will
   effectually fulfil what is very plainly expressed by the prophet
   Habakkuk: "I will stand upon my watch, and ascend upon the rock, and
   will look out to see what He shall say to me, and what I may answer to
   Him that reproveth me." [1222] And how difficult and tiresome this is,
   is very clearly shown by the experience of those who live in the desert
   of Calamus or Porphyrion. [1223] For though they are separated from all
   the cities and dwellings of men by a longer stretch of desert than the
   wilderness of Scete (since by penetrating seven or eight days' journey
   into the recesses of the vast wilderness, they scarcely arrive at their
   hiding places and cells) yet because there they are devoted to
   agriculture and not in the least confined to the cloister, whenever
   they come to these squalid districts in which we are living, or to
   Scete, they are annoyed by such harassing thoughts and such anxiety of
   mind that, as if they were beginners and men who had never given the
   slightest attention to the exercises of solitude, they cannot endure
   the life of the cells and the peace and quietness of them, and are at
   once driven forth and obliged to leave them, as if they were
   inexperienced and novices. For they have not learnt to still the
   motions of the inner man, and to quell the tempests of their thoughts
   by anxious care and persevering efforts, as, toiling day after day in
   work in the open air, they are moving about all day long in empty
   space, not only in the flesh but also in heart; and pour forth their
   thoughts openly as the body moves hither and thither. And therefore
   they do not notice the folly of their mind in longing for many things,
   nor can they put a check upon its vague discursiveness; and as they
   cannot bear sorrow of spirit they think that the fact of a continuance
   of silence is unendurable, and those who are never tired by hard work
   in the country, are beaten by silence and worn out by the length of
   their rest.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

    That anxiety of heart is made worse rather than better by restlessness of
    body.

   NOR is it wonderful if one who lives in a cell, having his thoughts
   collected together as it were in a narrow cloister, is oppressed by a
   multitude of anxieties, which break out with the man himself from the
   confinement of the dwelling, and at once dash here and there like wild
   horses. But while they are now roaming at large from their stalls, for
   the moment some short and sad solace is enjoyed: but when, after the
   body has returned to its own cell, the whole troop of thoughts retires
   again to its proper home, the habit of chronic licence gives rise to
   worse pangs. Those then who are unable and ignorant how to struggle
   against the promptings of their own fancies, when they are harassed in
   their cell, by accidie attacking their bosom more violently than usual,
   if they relax their strict rule and allow themselves the liberty of
   going out oftener, will arouse a worse plague against themselves by
   means of this which they fancy is a remedy: just as men fancy that they
   can check the violence of an inward fever by a draught of the coldest
   water, though it is a fact that by it its fire is inflamed rather than
   quenched, as a far worse attack follows after the momentary
   alleviation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

    A comparison showing how a monk ought to keep guard over his thoughts.

   WHEREFORE a monk's whole attention should thus be fixed on one point,
   and the rise and circle of all his thoughts be vigorously restricted to
   it; viz., to the recollection of God, as when a man, who is anxious to
   raise on high a vault of a round arch, must constantly draw a line
   round from its exact centre, and in accordance with the sure standard
   it gives discover by the laws of building all the evenness and
   roundness required. But if anyone tries to finish it without
   ascertaining its centre--though with the utmost confidence in his art
   and ability, it is impossible for him to keep the circumference even,
   without any error, or to find out simply by looking at it how much he
   has taken off by his mistake from the beauty of real roundness, unless
   he always has recourse to that test of truth and by its decision
   corrects the inner and outer edge of his work, and so finishes the
   large and lofty pile to the exact point. [1224] So also our mind,
   unless by working round the love of the Lord alone as an immovably
   fixed centre, through all the circumstances of our works and
   contrivances, it either fits or rejects the character of all our
   thoughts by the excellent compasses, if I may so say, of love, will
   never by excellent skill build up the structure of that spiritual
   edifice of which Paul is the architect, nor possess that beautiful
   house, which the blessed David desired in his heart to show to the Lord
   and said: "I have loved the beauty of Thine house and the place of the
   dwelling of Thy glory;" [1225] but will without foresight raise in his
   heart a house that is not beautiful, and that is unworthy of the Holy
   Ghost, one that will presently fall, and so will receive no glory from
   the reception of the blessed Inhabitant, but will be miserably
   destroyed by the fall of his building.

  CHAPTER VII.

    A question why the neighbourhood of our kinsfolk is considered to interfere
    with us, whereas it does not interfere in the case of those living in Egypt.

   GERMANUS: It is a very useful and needful rule that is given for the
   kind of works that can be done within the cells. For we have often
   proved the value of this not only by the example of your holiness,
   based on the imitation of the virtues of the apostles, but also by our
   own experience. But it is not sufficiently clear why we ought so
   thoroughly to avoid the neighbourhood of our kinsfolk, which you did
   not reject altogether. For if we see you, blamelessly walking in all
   the way of perfection, and not only dwelling in your own country but
   some of you having not even retired far from their own village, why
   should that which does not hurt you be considered bad for us?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

    The answer that all things are not suitable for all men.

   ABRAHAM: Sometimes we see bad precedents taken from good things. For if
   a man ventures to do the same thing as another, but not with the same
   mind and purpose, or not with equal goodness, he will immediately fall
   into the snares of deception and death through the very things from
   which others gain the fruit of eternal life: As that strong armed lad
   matched with the warlike giant in the combat would certainly have
   found, if he had been clad in the heavy armour of Saul fit only for
   men; and that by which one of stronger age would have laid low
   countless hosts of foes, would only have brought certain danger to the
   stripling, had he not with prudent discretion chosen the sort of
   weapons suitable to his youth, and armed himself against his foul foe
   not with breastplate and shield, with which he saw that others were
   equipped, but with those weapons with which he was able to fight.
   Wherefore it is right for each one of us first to consider carefully
   the measure of his powers and in accordance with its limits, to choose
   what system he pleases, because though all are good, yet all things
   cannot be fit for all men. For we do not assert that because the
   anchorite's life is good, it is therefore suited for everybody: for by
   many it is felt to be not only useless, but even injurious. Nor because
   we are right in taking up the system of the coenobium and the pious and
   praiseworthy care of the brethren, do we therefore consider that it
   ought to be followed by everybody. So also the fruits of the care of
   strangers are very plentiful, but this cannot be taken up by everybody
   without loss of patience. Further, the systems of your county and of
   this must first be weighed against each other; and then the powers of
   men gathered from the constant occurrence of their virtues or vices
   must be severally weighed in the opposite scales. For it may happen
   that what is difficult or impossible for a man of one nation in the
   case of others is somehow turned by ingrained habit into nature: just
   as some nations, separated by a wide difference of region, can bear
   tremendous force of cold or heat of the sun without any covering of the
   body, which certainly others who have no experience of that inclement
   sky, could not possibly endure, however strong they may be. So also do
   you who with the utmost efforts of mind and body are trying in this
   district to get the better of the nature of your country in many
   respects, diligently consider whether in those regions which, as report
   says, are frozen, and bound by the cold of excessive unbelief, you
   could endure this nakedness, if I may so term it. For to us the fact
   that our holy life is of long standing has almost naturally imparted
   this fortitude in our purpose, and if we see that you are our equals in
   virtue and constancy, you in like manner need not shun the
   neighbourhood of your kinsfolk and brethren.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

    That those need not fear the neighbourhood of their kinsfolk, who can
    emulate the mortification of Abbot Apollos.

   BUT that you may be able fairly to measure the amount of your strength
   by a certain test of strictness I will point out to you what was done
   by a certain old man; viz., Abbot Apollos [1226] that if your secret
   scrutiny of your heart decides that you are not behind this man in
   purpose and goodness, you may venture on remaining in your country and
   living near your kinsfolk without detriment to your purpose or injury
   to your mode of life, and be sure that neither the feeling of nearness
   nor your love for the district can interfere with the strictness of
   this humble lot, [1227] which not only your own will but the needs also
   of your pilgrimage enforce upon you in this country. When then his own
   brother had come to this old man, whom we have mentioned, in the dead
   of night, begging him to come out for a little while from his
   monastery, to help him to rescue an ox, which as he sadly complained
   had stuck in the mire of a swamp a little way off, because he could not
   possibly rescue it alone, Abbot Apollos stolidly replied to his
   entreaties: "Why did you not ask our younger brother who was nearer to
   you as you passed by than I?" and when the other, thinking that he had
   forgotten the death of his brother who had been long ago buried, and
   that he was almost weak in his mind from excessive abstinence and
   continual solitude, replied: "How could I summon one who died fifteen
   years ago?" Abbot Apollos said: "Don't you know that I too have been
   dead to this world for twenty years, and that I can't from my tomb in
   this cell give you any assistance in what belongs to the affairs of
   this present life? And Christ is so far from allowing me ever so little
   to relax my purpose of mortification on which I have entered, for
   extricating your ox, that He did not even permit the very shortest
   intermission of it for my father's funeral, which would have been
   undertaken much more readily properly and piously." And so do ye now
   search out the secrets of your breast and carefully consider whether
   you also can continually preserve such strictness of mind with regard
   to your kinsfolk, and when you find that you are like him in this
   mortification of soul, then at last you may know that in the same way
   the neighbourhood of your kinsfolk and brothers will not hurt you,
   when, I mean, you hold that though they are very close to you, you are
   dead to them, in such a way that you suffer neither them to be
   benefited by your assistance, nor yourselves to be relaxed by duties
   towards them.

  CHAPTER X.

    A question whether it is bad for a monk to have his wants supplied by his
    kinsfolk.

   GERMANUS: On this subject you have certainly left no room for any
   further uncertainty. For we are sure that we cannot possibly keep up
   our present wretched garb, or our daily going barefoot in their
   neighbourhood, and that there we should not even procure with the same
   labour what is necessary for our sustenance, as here we are actually
   obliged to fetch our water on our necks for three miles. For shame on
   our part as well as on theirs would not in the least allow us to do
   this before them. However how will it hurt our plan of life if we are
   altogether set free from anxiety on the score of preparing our food, by
   being supplied by them with all things, and so give ourselves up simply
   to reading and prayer, that by the removal of that labour with which we
   are now distracted we may devote ourselves more earnestly to spiritual
   interests alone?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

    The answer stating what Saint Antony laid down on this matter.

   ABRAHAM: I will not give you my own opinion against this, but that of
   the blessed Antony, whereby he confounded the laziness of a certain
   brother (overcome by this lukewarmness which you describe) in such a
   way as also to cut the knot of your subject. For when one came as I
   said to the aforesaid old man, and said that the Anchorite system was
   not at all to be admired, declaring that it required greater virtue for
   a man to practise what belongs to perfection living among men rather
   than in the desert, the blessed Antony asked where he lived himself,
   and when he said that he lived close to his relations, and boasted that
   by their provision he was set free from all care and anxiety of daily
   work, and gave himself up ceaselessly and solely to reading and prayer
   without any distraction of spirit, once more the blessed Antony said:
   "Tell me, my good friend, whether you grieve with their griefs and
   misfortunes, and in the same way rejoice in their good fortune?" He
   confessed that he shared in them both. To whom the old man: "You should
   know," said he, "that in the world to come also you will be judged in
   the lot of those with whom in this life you have been affected by
   sharing in their gain or loss, or joy or sorrow." And not satisfied
   with this statement the blessed Antony entered on a still wider field
   of discussion, saying: "This mode of life and this most lukewarm
   condition not only strike you with that damage of which I spoke (though
   you do not feel it now, when somehow you say in accordance with that
   saying in Proverbs: `They strike me but I am not grieved: and they
   mocked me but I knew it not;' or this that is said in the Prophet: `And
   strangers have devoured his strength, but he himself knew it not'
   [1228] ), because day after day they ceaselessly drag down your mind to
   earthly things, and change it in accordance with the variations of
   chance; but also because they defraud you of the fruits of your hands
   and the due reward of your own exertions, as they do not suffer you to
   be supported by what these supply, or to procure your daily food for
   yourself with your own hands, according to the rule of the blessed
   Apostle, as he when giving his last charge to the heads of the Church
   of Ephesus, asserts that though he was occupied with the sacred duties
   of preaching the gospel yet he provided not only for himself, but also
   for those who were prevented by necessary duties with regard to his
   ministry, saying: `Ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered
   to my necessities and to the necessities of those who were with me.'
   But to show that he did this as a pattern to be useful to us he says
   elsewhere: `We were not idle among you; neither did we eat any man's
   bread for nothing, but in labour and in toil we worked night and day
   lest we should be chargeable to any of you. Not as if we had not power;
   but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.'"

  CHAPTER XII.

    Of the value of work and the harm of idleness.

   AND so though we also might have the protection of our kinsfolk, yet we
   have preferred his abstinence to all riches, and have chosen to procure
   our daily bodily sustenance by our own exertions rather than rely on
   the sure provision made by our relations, having less inclination for
   idle meditation on holy Scripture of which you have spoken, and that
   fruitless attendance to reading than to this laborious poverty. And
   certainly we should most gladly pursue the former, if the authority of
   the apostles had taught us by their examples that it was better for us,
   or the rules of the Elders had laid it down for our good. But you must
   know that you are affected by this no less than by that harm of which I
   spoke above, because though your body may be sound and lusty, yet you
   are supported by another's contributions, a thing which properly
   belongs only to the feeble. For certainly the whole human race, except
   only that class of monks, who live in accordance with the Apostle's
   command by the daily labours of their own hands, looks for the charity
   of another's compassion. Wherefore it is clear that not only those who
   boast that they themselves are supported either by the wealth of their
   relations or the labours of their servants or the produce of their
   farms, but also the kings of this world are supported by charity. This
   at any rate is embraced in the definition of our predecessors, who have
   laid down that anything that is taken for the requirements of daily
   food which has not been procured and prepared by the labour of our own
   hands, ought to be referred to charity, as the Apostle teaches, who
   altogether forbids the help of another's bounty to the idle and says:
   "If a man does not work, neither let him eat." [1230] These words the
   blessed Antony used against some one, and instructed us also by the
   example of his teaching, to shun the pernicious allurements of our
   relations and of all who provide the needful charity for our food as
   well as the delights of a pleasant home, and to prefer to all the
   wealth of this world sandy wastes horrid with the barrenness of nature,
   and districts overwhelmed by living incrustations, and for that reason
   subject to no control or dominion of man, so that we should not only
   avoid the society of men for the sake of a pathless waste, but also
   that the character of a fruitful soil may never entice us to the
   distractions of cultivating it, whereby the mind would be recalled from
   the chief service of the heart, and rendered useless for spiritual
   aims.

  CHAPTER XIII.

    A story of a barber's payments, introduced for the sake of recognizing the
    devil's illusions.

   FOR as you hope that you can save others also, and are eager to return
   to your country with the hope of greater gain, hear also on this
   subject a story of Abbot Macarius, very neatly and prettily invented,
   which he also gave to a man in a tumult of similar desires, to cure him
   by a most appropriate story. "There was," said he, "in a certain city a
   very clever barber, who used to shave everybody for three pence and by
   getting this poor and wretched sum for his work, out of this same
   amount used to procure what was required for his daily food, and after
   having taken all care of his body, used every day to put a hundred
   pence into his pocket. But while he was diligently amassing this gain,
   he heard that in a city a long way off each man paid the barber a
   shilling as his pay. And when he found this out, `how long,' said he,
   `shall I be satisfied with this beggary, so as to get with my labour a
   pay of three pence, when by going thither I might amass riches by a
   large gain of shillings?' And so at once taking with him the implements
   of his art, and using up in the expense all that he had got together
   and saved during a long time, he made his way with great difficulty to
   that most lucrative city. And there on the day of his arrival, he
   received from everyone the pay for his labour in accordance with what
   he had heard, and at eventide seeing that he had gained a large number
   of shillings he went in delight to the butcher's to buy the food he
   wanted for his supper. And when he began to purchase it for a large sum
   of shillings he spent on a tiny bit of meat all the shillings that he
   had gained, and did not take home a surplus of even a single penny. And
   when he saw that his gains were thus used up every day so that he not
   only failed to put by anything but could scarcely get what he required
   for his daily food, he thought over the matter with himself and said:
   `I will go back to my city, and once more, seek those very moderate
   profits, from which, when all my bodily wants were satisfied, a daily
   surplus gave a growing sum to support my old age; which, though it
   seemed small and trifling, yet by being constantly increased was
   amounting to no slight sum. In fact that gain of coppers was more
   profitable to me than is this nominal one of shillings from which not
   only is there nothing over to be laid by, but the necessities of my
   daily food are scarcely met.'" And therefore it is better for us with
   unbroken continuance to aim at this very slender profit in the desert,
   from which no secular cares, no worldly distractions, no pride of
   vainglory and vanity can detract, and which the pressure of no daily
   wants can lessen (for "a small thing that the righteous hath is better
   than great riches of the ungodly" [1231] ) rather than to pursue those
   larger profits which even if they are procured by the most valuable
   conversion of many, are yet absorbed by the claims of secular life and
   the daily leakage of distractions. For, as Solomon says, "Better is a
   single handful with rest than both hands full with labour and vexation
   of mind." [1232] And in these allusions and inconveniences all that are
   at all weak are sure to be entangled, as while they are even doubtful
   of their own salvation, and themselves stand in need of the teaching
   and instruction of others, they are incited by the devil's tricks to
   convert and guide others, and as, even if they succeed in gaining any
   advantage from the conversion of some, they waste by their impatience
   and rude manners whatever they have gained. For that will happen to
   them which is described by the prophet Haggai: "And he that gathereth
   riches, putteth them into a bag with holes." [1233] For indeed a man
   puts his gains into a bag with holes, if he loses by want of self
   control and daily distractions of mind whatever he appears to gain by
   the conversion of others. And so it results that while they fancy that
   they can make larger profits by the instruction of others, they are
   actually deprived of their own improvement. For "There are who make
   themselves out rich though possessing nothing, and there are who humble
   themselves amid great riches;" and: "Better is a man who serves himself
   in a humble station than one who gains honour for himself and wanteth
   bread." [1234]

  CHAPTER XIV.

    A question how such wrong notions can creep into us.

   GERMANUS: Very aptly has your discussion shown the error of these
   illusions by this illustration: but we should like in the same way to
   be taught its origin and how to cure it, and we are equally anxious to
   learn how this deception has taken hold of us. For everybody must see
   that no one at all can apply remedies to ill health except one who has
   already diagnosed the actual origin of the disease.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

    The answer on the threefold movement of the soul.

   ABRAHAM: Of all faults there is one source and origin, but different
   names are assigned to the passions and corruptions in accordance with
   the character of that part, or member, if I may so call it, which has
   been injuriously affected in the soul: As is sometimes also shown by
   the case of bodily diseases, in which though the cause is one and the
   same, yet there is a division into different kinds of maladies in
   accordance with the nature of the member affected. For when the
   violence of a noxious moisture has seized on the body's citadel, i.e.,
   the head, it brings about a feeling of headache, but when it affects
   the ears or eyes, it passes into the malady of earache or ophthalmia:
   when it spreads to the joints and the extremities of the hands it is
   called the gout in the joints or hands; but when it descends to the
   extremities of the feet, its name is changed and it is termed podagra:
   and the noxious moisture which is originally one and the same is
   described by as many names as there are separate members which it
   affects. In the same way to pass from visible to invisible things, we
   should hold that the tendency to each fault exists in the parts and, if
   I may use the expression, members of our soul. And, as some very wise
   men have laid down that its powers are threefold, either what is
   logikon, i.e., reasonable, or qumikon, i.e., irascible, or epi
   qumhtikon, i.e., subject to desire, is sure to be troubled by some
   assault. When then the force of noxious passion takes possession of
   anyone by reason of these feelings, the name of the fault is given to
   it in accordance with the part affected. For if the plague of sin has
   infested its rational parts, it will produce the sins of vainglory,
   conceit, envy, pride, presumption, strife, heresy. If it has wounded
   the irascible feelings, it will give birth to rage, impatience,
   sulkiness, accidie, pusillanimity and cruelty. If it has affected that
   part which is subject to desire, it will be the parent of gluttony,
   fornication, covetousness, avarice, and noxious and earthly desires.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

    That the rational part of our soul is corrupt.

   AND therefore if you want to discover the source and origin of this
   fault, you must recognize that the rational part of your mind and soul
   is corrupt, that part namely from which the faults of presumption and
   vainglory for the most part spring. Further this first member, so to
   speak, of your soul must be healed by the judgment of a right
   discretion and the virtue of humility, as when it is injured, while you
   fancy that you can not only still scale the heights of perfection but
   actually teach others, and hold that you are capable and sufficient to
   instruct others, through the pride of vainglory you are carried away by
   these vain rovings, which your confession discloses. And these you will
   then be able to get rid of without difficulty, if you are established
   as I said in the humility of true discretion and learn with sorrow of
   heart how hard and difficult a thing it is for each of us to save his
   soul, and admit with the inmost feelings of your heart that you are not
   only far removed from that pride of teaching, but that you are actually
   still in need of the help of a teacher.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

    How the weaker part of the soul is the first to yield to the devil's
    temptations.

   YOU should then apply to this member or part of the soul which we have
   described as particularly wounded, the remedy of true humility: for as,
   so far as appears, it is weaker than the other powers of the soul in
   you, it is sure to be the first to yield to the assaults of the devil.
   As when some injuries come upon us, which are caused either by toil
   laid upon us or by a bad atmosphere, it is generally the case in the
   bodies of men that those which are the weaker are the first to give in
   and yield to those chances, and when the disease has more particularly
   laid hold of them, it affects the sound parts of the body also with the
   same mischief, so also, when the pestilent blast of sin breathes over
   us the soul of each one of us is sure to be tempted above all by that
   passion, in the case of which its feebler and weaker portion does not
   make so stubborn a resistance to the powerful attacks of the foe, and
   to run the risk of being taken captive by those, in the case of which a
   careless watch opens an easier way to betrayal. For so Balaam [1235]
   gathered that God's people could be by a sure method deceived, when he
   advised, that in that quarter, wherein he knew that the children of
   Israel were weak, the dangerous snares should be set for them, as he
   had no doubt that when a supply of women was offered to them, they
   would at once fall and be destroyed by fornication, because he was
   aware that the parts of their souls which were subject to desire were
   corrupted. So then the spiritual wickednesses tempt with crafty malice
   each one of us, by particularly laying insidious snares for those
   affections of the soul, in which they have seen that it is weak, as for
   instance, if they see that the reasonable parts of our soul are
   affected, they try to deceive us in the same way that the Scripture
   tells us that king Ahab was deceived by those Syrians, who said: "We
   know that the kings of Israel are merciful: And so let us put sackcloth
   upon our loins, and ropes round our heads, and go out to the king of
   Israel, and say to him: Thy servant Benhadad saith: I pray thee, let my
   soul live." And thereby he was affected by no true goodness, but by the
   empty praise of his clemency, and said: "If he still liveth, he is my
   brother;" and after this fashion they can deceive us also by the error
   of that reasonable part, and make us incur the displeasure of God owing
   to that from which we were hoping that we might gain a reward and
   receive the recompense of goodness, and to us too the same rebuke may
   be addressed: "Because thou hast let go from thy hand a man who was
   worthy of death, thy life shall be for his life, and thy people for his
   people." [1236] Or when the unclean spirit says: "I will go forth, and
   will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets," [1237] he
   certainly spread the nets of deception by means of the reasonable
   feeling which he knew to be exposed to his deadly wiles. And this also
   the same spirit expected in the case of our Lord, when he tempted Him
   in these three affections of the soul, wherein he knew that all mankind
   had been taken captive, but gained nothing by his crafty wiles. For he
   approached that portion of his mind which was subject to desire, when
   he said: "Command that these stones be made bread;" the part subject to
   wrath, when he tried to incite Him to seek the power of the present
   life and the kingdoms of this world; the reasonable part when he said:
   "If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down from hence." [1238] And
   in these his deception availed nothing for this reason because he found
   that there was nothing damaged in Him, in accordance with the
   supposition which he had formed from a false idea. Wherefore no part of
   His soul yielded when tempted by the wiles of the foe, "For lo," He
   saith, "the prince of this world cometh and shall find nothing in Me."

  CHAPTER XVIII.

    A question whether we should be drawn back to our country by a proper desire
    for greater silence.

   GERMANUS: Among other kinds of illusions and mistakes on our part,
   which by the vain promise of spiritual advantages have fired us with a
   longing for our country (as your holiness has discovered by the keen
   insight of your mind), this stands out as the principal reason, that
   sometimes we are beset by our brethren and cannot possibly continue in
   unbroken solitude and continual silence, as we should like. And by this
   the course and measure of our daily abstinence, which we always want to
   maintain undisturbed for the chastening of our body, is sure to be
   interfered with on the arrival of some of the brethren. And this we
   certainly feel would never happen in our own country, where it is
   impossible to find anyone, or scarcely anyone who adopts this manner of
   life.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

    The answer on the devil's illusion, because he promises us the peace of a
    vaster solitude.

   ABRAHAM: Never to be resorted to by men at all is a sign of an
   unreasonable and ill-considered strictness, or rather of the greatest
   coldness. For if a man walks in this way, on which he has entered, with
   too slow steps, and lives according to the former man, it is right that
   none--I say not of the saints--but of any men should visit him. But
   you, if you are inflamed with true and perfect love of our Lord, and
   follow God, who indeed is love, with entire fervour of spirit, are sure
   to be resorted to by men, to whatever inaccessible spot you may flee,
   and, in proportion as the ardour of divine love brings you nearer to
   God, so will a larger concourse of saintly brethren flock to you. For,
   as the Lord says, "A city set on an hill cannot be hid," [1240] because
   "them that love Me," saith the Lord, "will I honour, and they that
   despise Me shall be contemned." [1241] But you ought to know that this
   is the subtlest device of the devil, this is his best concealed
   pitfall, into which he precipitates some wretched and heedless persons,
   so that, while he is promising them greater things, he takes away the
   requisite advantages of their daily profit, by persuading them that
   more remote and vaster deserts should be sought, and by portraying them
   in their heart as if they were sown with marvellous delights. And
   further some unknown and non-existent spots, he feigns to be well-known
   and suitable and already given over to our power and able to be secured
   without any difficulty. The men also of that country he feigns to be
   docile and followers of the way of salvation, that, while he is
   promising richer fruits for the soul there, he may craftily destroy our
   present profits. For when owing to this vain hope each one separates
   himself from living together with the Elders and has been deprived of
   all those things that he idly imagined in his heart, he rises as it
   were from a most profound slumber, and when awake will find nothing of
   those things of which he had dreamed. And so as he is hampered by
   larger requirements for this life and inextricable snares, the devil
   will not even allow him to aspire to those things which he had once
   promised himself, and as he is liable no longer to those rare and
   spiritual visits of the brethren which he had formerly avoided, but to
   daily interruptions from worldly folk, he will never suffer him to
   return even to the moderate quiet and system of the anchorite's life.

  CHAPTER XX.

    How useful is relaxation on the arrival of brethren.

   THAT most refreshing interlude also of relaxation and courtesy, which
   sometimes is wont to intervene because of the arrival of brethren,
   although it may seem to us tiresome and what we ought to avoid, yet how
   useful it is and good for our bodies as well as our souls you must
   patiently hear in few words. It often happens I say not to novices and
   weak persons but even to those of the greatest experience and
   perfection, that unless the strain and tension of their mind is
   lessened by the relaxation of some changes, they fall either into
   coldness of spirit; or at any rate into a most dangerous state of
   bodily health. And therefore when there occur even frequent visits from
   the brethren they should not only be patiently put up with, but even
   gratefully welcomed by those who are wise and perfect; first because
   they stimulate us always to desire with greater eagerness the
   retirement of the desert (for somehow while they are thought to impede
   our progress, they really maintain it unwearied and unbroken, and if it
   was never hindered by any obstacles, it would not endure to the end
   with unswerving perseverance), next because they give us the
   opportunity of refreshing the body, together with the advantages of
   kindness, and at the same time with a most delightful relaxation of the
   body confer on us greater advantage than those which we should have
   gained by the weariness which results from abstinence. On which matter
   I will briefly give a most apt illustration handed down in an old
   story.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

    How the Evangelist John is said to have shown the value of relaxation.

   IT is said that the blessed John, while he was gently stroking a
   partridge with his hands suddenly saw a philosopher approaching him in
   the garb of a hunter, who was astonished that a man of so great fame
   and reputation should demean himself to such paltry and trivial
   amusements, and said: "Can you be that John, whose great and famous
   reputation attracted me also with the greatest desire for your
   acquaintance? Why then do you occupy yourself with such poor
   amusements?" To whom the blessed John: "What is it," said he, "that you
   are carrying in your hand?" The other replied: "a bow." "And why," said
   he, "do you not always carry it everywhere bent?" To whom the other
   replied: "It would not do, for the force of its stiffness would be
   relaxed by its being continually bent, and it would be lessened and
   destroyed, and when the time came for it to send stouter arrows after
   some beast, its stiffness would be lost by the excessive and continuous
   strain, and it would be impossible for the more powerful bolts to be
   shot." "And, my lad," said the blessed John, "do not let this slight
   and short relaxation of my mind disturb you, as unless it sometimes
   relieved and relaxed the rigour of its purpose by some recreation, the
   spirit would lose its spring owing to the unbroken strain, and would be
   unable when need required, implicitly to follow what was right." [1242]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

    A question how we ought to understand what the gospel says: "My yoke is easy
    and My burden is light."

   GERMANUS: As you have given us a remedy for all delusions, and by God's
   grace all the wiles of the devil by which we were harassed, have been
   exposed by your teaching, we beg that you will also explain to us this
   that is said in the gospel: "My yoke is easy, and My burden is light."
   [1243] For it seems tolerably opposed to that saying of the prophet
   where it is said: "For the sake of the words of Thy lips I kept hard
   ways;" while even the Apostle says: "All who will live godly in Christ
   suffer persecutions." [1244] But whatever is hard and fraught with
   persecutions cannot be easy and light.

   [1244] Ps. 16 (17):4; 2 Tim. 3:12.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

    The answer with the explanation of the saying.

   ABRAHAM: We can prove by the easy teaching of our own experience that
   our Lord and Saviour's saying is perfectly true, if we approach the way
   of perfection properly and in accordance with Christ's will, and
   mortifying all our desires, and cutting off injurious likings, not only
   allow nothing to remain with us of this world's goods (whereby our
   adversary would find at his pleasure opportunities of destroying and
   damaging us) but actually recognize that we are not our own masters,
   and truly make our own the Apostle's words: "I live, yet not I, but
   Christ liveth in me." [1245] For what can be burdensome, or hard to one
   who has embraced with his whole heart the yoke of Christ, who is
   established in true humility and ever fixes his eye on the Lord's
   sufferings and rejoices in all the wrongs that are offered to him,
   saying: "For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in
   reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ:
   for when I am weak, then am I strong"? [1246] By what loss of any
   common thing, I ask, will he be injured, who boasts of perfect
   renunciation, and voluntarily rejects for Christ's sake all the pomp of
   this world, and considers all and every of its desires as dung, so that
   he may gain Christ, and by continual meditation on this command of the
   gospel, scorns and gets rid of agitation at every loss: "For what shall
   it profit a man if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul? Or
   what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" [1247] For the loss of
   what will he be vexed, who recognizes that everything that can be taken
   away from others is not their own, and proclaims with unconquered
   valour: "We brought nothing into this world: it is certain that we
   cannot carry anything out"? [1248] By the needs of what want will his
   courage be overcome, who knows how to do without "scrip for the way,
   money for the purse," [1249] and, like the Apostle, glories "in many
   fasts, in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness"? [1250] What
   effort, or what hard command of an Elder can disturb the peace of his
   bosom, who has no will of his own, and not only patiently but even
   gratefully accepts what is commanded him, and after the example of our
   Saviour, seeks to do not his own will, but the Father's, as He says
   Himself to His Father: "Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt"?
   [1251] By what wrongs also, by what persecution will he be frightened,
   nay, what punishment can fail to be delightful to him, who always
   rejoices together with apostles in stripes, and longs to be counted
   worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ?

  CHAPTER XXIV.

    Why the Lord's yoke is felt grievous and His burden heavy.

   BUT the fact that to us on the contrary the yoke of Christ seems
   neither light nor easy, must be rightly ascribed to our perverseness,
   as we are cast down by unbelief and want of faith, and fight with
   foolish obstinacy against His command, or rather advice, who says: "If
   thou wilt be perfect, go sell (or get rid of) all that thou hast, and
   come follow Me," [1252] for we keep the substance of our worldly goods.
   And as the devil holds our soul fast in the toils of these, what
   remains but that, when he wants to sever us from spiritual delights, he
   should vex us by diminishing these and depriving us of them, contriving
   by his crafty wiles that when the sweetness of His yoke and lightness
   of His burden have become grievous to us through the evil of a corrupt
   desire, and when we are caught in the chains of that very property and
   substance, which we kept for our comfort and solace, he may always
   torment us with the scourges of worldly cares, extorting from us
   ourselves that wherewith we are tortured? For "Each one is bound by the
   cords of his own sins," and hears from the prophet: "Behold all you
   that kindle a fire, encompassed with flames, walk in the light of your
   fire, and in the flames which you have kindled." Since, as Solomon is
   witness, "Each man shall thereby be punished, whereby he has sinned."
   [1253] For the very pleasures which we enjoy become a torment to us,
   and the delights and enjoyments of this flesh, turn like executioners
   upon their originator, because one who is supported by his former
   wealth and property is sure not to admit perfect humility of heart, not
   entire mortification of dangerous pleasures. But where all these
   implements of goodness give their aid, there all the trials of this
   present life, and whatever losses the enemy can contrive, are endured
   not only with the utmost patience, but with real pleasure, and again
   when they are wanting so dangerous a pride springs up that we are
   actually wounded by the deadly strokes of impatience at the slightest
   reproach, and it may be said to us by the prophet Jeremiah: "And now
   what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the troubled water?
   And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the
   water of the river? Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy
   apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou and see that it is an evil and a
   bitter thing for thee to have left the Lord thy God, and that My fear
   is not with thee, saith the Lord." [1254] How then is it that the
   wondrous sweetness of the Lord's yoke is felt to be bitter, but because
   the bitterness of our dislike injures it? How is it that the exceeding
   lightness of the Divine burden becomes heavy, but because in our
   obstinate presumption we despise Him by whom it was borne, especially
   as Scripture itself plainly testifies to this very thing saying: "For
   if they would walk in right paths, they would certainly have found the
   paths of righteousness smooth"? [1255] It is plain, I say, that it is
   we, who make rough with the nasty and hard stones of our desires the
   right and smooth paths of the Lord; who most foolishly forsake the
   royal road made stony with the flints of apostles and prophets, and
   trodden down by the footsteps of all the saints and of the Lord
   Himself, and seek trackless and thorny places, and, blinded by the
   allurements of present delights, tear our way with torn legs and our
   wedding garment rent, through dark paths, overrun with the briars of
   sins, so as not only to be pierced by the sharp thorns of the brambles
   but actually laid low by the bites of deadly serpents and scorpions
   lurking there. For "there are thorns and thistles in wrong ways, but he
   that feareth the Lord shall keep himself from them." [1256] Of such
   also the Lord says elsewhere by the prophet: "My people have forgotten,
   sacrificing in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to
   walk in them in a way not trodden." [1257] For according to Solomon's
   saying: "The ways of those who do not work are strewn with thorns, but
   the ways of the lusty are trodden down." [1258] And thus wandering from
   the king's highway, they can never arrive at that metropolis, whither
   our course should ever be directed without swerving. And this also
   Ecclesiastes has pretty significantly expressed saying: "The labour of
   fools wearies those who know not how to go to the city;" viz., that
   "heavenly Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all." [1259] But whoever
   truly gives up this world and takes upon him Christ's yoke and learns
   of Him, and is trained in the daily practice of suffering wrong, for He
   is "meek and lowly of heart," [1260] will ever remain undisturbed by
   all temptations, and "all things will work together for good to him."
   [1261] For as the prophet Obadiah says the words of God are "good to
   him that walketh uprightly;" and again: "For the ways of the Lord are
   right, and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall
   fall in them." [1262]

  CHAPTER XXV.

    Of the good which an attack of temptation brings about.

   AND so by the struggle with temptation the kindly grace of the Saviour
   bestows on us larger rewards of praise than if it had taken away from
   us all need of conflict. For it is a mark of a loftier and grander
   virtue to remain ever unmoved when hemmed in by persecutions and
   trials, and to stand faithfully and courageously at the ramparts of
   God, and in the attacks of men, girt as it were with the arms of
   unconquered virtue, to triumph gloriously over impatience and somehow
   to gain strength out of weakness, for "strength is made perfect in
   weakness." "For behold I have made thee," saith the Lord, "a pillar of
   iron and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Judah, and
   the princes and the priests thereof, and all the people of the land.
   And they shall fight against thee and shall not prevail: for I am with
   thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord." [1263] Therefore according to
   the plain teaching of the Lord the king's highway is easy and smooth,
   though it may be felt as hard and rough: for those who piously and
   faithfully serve Him, when they have taken upon them the yoke of the
   Lord, and have learnt of Him, that He is meek and lowly of heart, at
   once somehow or other lay aside the burden of earthly passions, and
   find no labour but rest for their souls, by the gift of the Lord, as He
   Himself testifies by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: "Stand ye on the
   ways and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and
   walk ye in it: and you shall find refreshment for your souls." For to
   them at once "the crooked shall become straight and the rough ways
   plain;" and they shall "taste and see that the Lord is gracious,"
   [1264] and when they hear Christ proclaiming in the gospel: "Come unto
   Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you,"
   they will lay aside the burden of their sins, and realize what follows:
   "For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light." [1265] The way of the
   Lord then has refreshment if it is kept to according to His law. But it
   is we who by troublesome distractions bring sorrows and troubles upon
   ourselves, while we try even with the utmost exertion and difficulty to
   follow the crooked and perverse ways of this world. But when in this
   way we have made the Lord's yoke heavy and hard to us, we at once
   complain in a blasphemous spirit of the hardness and roughness of the
   yoke itself or of Christ who lays it upon us, in accordance with this
   passage: "The folly of man corrupteth his ways, but he blames God in
   his heart;" [1266] and as Haggai the prophet says, when we say that
   "the way of the Lord is not right" the reply is aptly made to us by the
   Lord: "Is not My way right? Are not your ways rather crooked?" [1267]
   And indeed if you will compare the sweet scented flower of virginity,
   and tender purity of chastity to the foul and fetid sloughs of lust,
   the calm and security of monks to the dangers and losses in which the
   men of this world are involved, the peace of our poverty to the gnawing
   vexations and anxious cares of riches, in which they are night and day
   consumed not without the utmost peril to life, then you will prove that
   the yoke of Christ is most easy and His burden most light.

  CHAPTER XXVI.

    How the promise of an hundredfold in this life is made to those whose
    renunciation is perfect.

   FURTHER also that recompense of reward, wherein the Lord promises an
   hundredfold in this life to those whose renunciation is perfect, and
   says: "And everyone that hath left house or brethren or sisters or
   father or mother or wife or children or lands for My name's sake, shall
   receive an hundredfold in the present time and shall inherit eternal
   life," [1268] is rightly and truly taken in the same sense without any
   disturbance of faith. For many taking occasion by this saying, insist
   with crass intelligence that these things will be given carnally in the
   millennium, though they must certainly admit that age, which they say
   will be after the resurrection cannot possibly be understood as
   present. It is then more credible and much clearer that one, who at the
   persuasion of Christ has made light of any worldly affections or goods,
   receives from the brethren and partners of his life, who are joined to
   him by a spiritual tie, even in this life a love which is an hundred
   times better: since it is certain that among parents and children and
   brothers, wives and relations, where either the tie is merely formed by
   intercourse, or the bond of union by the claims of relationship, the
   love is tolerably short lived and easily broken. Finally even good and
   duteous children when they have grown up, are sometimes shut out by
   their parents from their homes and property, and sometimes for a really
   good reason the tie of matrimony is severed, and a quarrelsome division
   destroys the property of brothers. Monks alone maintain a lasting union
   in intimacy, and possess all things in common, as they hold that
   everything that belongs to their brethren is their own, and that
   everything which is their own is their brethren's. If then the grace of
   our love is compared to those affections where the bond of union is a
   carnal love, certainly it is an hundred times sweeter and finer. There
   will indeed also be gained from conjugal continence a pleasure that is
   an hundred times greater than that which arises from the union of the
   sexes. And instead of that joy, which a man experiences from the
   possession of a single field or house, he will enjoy a delight in
   riches a hundred times greater, if he passes over to the adoption of
   sons of God, and possesses as his own all things which belong to the
   eternal Father, and asserts in heart and soul after the fashion of that
   true Son: "All things that the Father hath are mine;" [1269] and if no
   longer tried by that criminal anxiety in distractions and cares, but
   free from care and glad at heart he succeeds everywhere to his own,
   hearing daily the announcement made to him by the Apostle: "For all
   things are yours, whether the world, or things present, or things to
   come;" and by Solomon: "The faithful man has a whole world of riches."
   [1270] You have then that recompense of an hundredfold brought out by
   the greatness of the value, and the difference of the character that
   cannot be estimated. For if for a fixed weight of brass or iron or some
   still commoner metal, one had given in exchange the same weight only in
   gold, he would appear to have given much more than an hundredfold. And
   so when for the scorn of delights and earthly affections there is made
   a recompense of spiritual joy and the gladness of a most precious love,
   even if the actual amount be the same, yet it is an hundred times
   better and grander. And to make this plainer by frequent repetition: I
   used formerly to have a wife in the lustful passion of desire: I now
   have one in honourable sanctification and the true love of Christ. The
   woman is but one, but the value of the love has increased an
   hundredfold. But if instead of distrusting anger and wrath you have
   regard to constant gentleness and patience, instead of the stress of
   anxiety and trouble, peace and freedom from care, instead of the
   fruitless and criminal vexation of this world the salutary fruits of
   sorrow, instead of the vanity of temporal joy the richness of spiritual
   delights, you will see in the change of these feelings a recompense of
   an hundredfold. And if we compare with the short-lived and fleeting
   pleasure of each sin the benefits of the opposite virtues the increased
   delights will prove that these are an hundred times better. For in
   counting on your fingers you transfer the number of an hundred from the
   left hand to the right and though you seem to keep the same arrangement
   of the fingers yet there is a great increase in the amount of the
   quantity. [1271] For the result will be that we who seemed to bear the
   form of the goats on the left hand, will be removed and gain the reward
   of the sheep on the right hand. Now let us pass on to consider the
   nature of those things which Christ gives back to us in this world for
   our scorn of worldly advantages, more particularly according to the
   Gospel of Mark who says: "There is no man who hath left house or
   brethren or sisters or mother or children or lands for My sake and the
   gospel's sake, who shall not receive an hundred times as much now in
   this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and
   lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come life eternal."
   [1272] For he who for the sake of Christ's name disregards the love of
   a single father or mother or child, and gives himself over to the
   purest love of all who serve Christ, will receive an hundred times the
   amount of brethren and kinsfolk; since instead of but one he will begin
   to have so many fathers and brethren bound to him by a still more
   fervent and admirable affection. He also will be enriched with an
   increased possession of lands, who has given up a single house for the
   love of Christ, and possesses countless homes in monasteries as his
   own, to whatever part of the world he may retire, as to his own house.
   For how can he fail to receive an hundredfold, and, if it is not wrong
   to add somewhat to our Lord's words, more than an hundredfold, who
   gives up the faithless and compulsory service of ten or twenty slaves
   and relies on the spontaneous attendance of so many noble and free born
   men? And that this is so you could prove by your own experience, as
   since you have each left but one father and mother and home, you have
   gained without any effort or care, in any part of the world to which
   you have come, countless fathers and mothers and brethren, as well as
   houses and lands and most faithful servants, who receive you as their
   masters, and welcome, and respect, and take care of you with the utmost
   attention. But, I say that deservedly and confidently will the saints
   enjoy this service, if they have first submitted themselves and
   everything they have by a voluntary offering for the service of the
   brethren. For, as the Lord says, they will freely receive back that
   which they themselves have bestowed on others. But if a man has not
   first offered this with true humility to his companions, how can he
   calmly endure to have it offered to him by others, when he knows that
   he is burdened rather than helped by their services, because he prefers
   to receive attention from the brethren rather than to give it to them?
   But all these things he will receive not with careless slackness and a
   lazy delight, but, in accordance with the Lord's word, "with
   persecutions," i.e., with the pressure of this world, and terrible
   distress from his passions, because, as the wise man testifies: "He who
   is easy going and without trouble shall come to want." [1273] For not
   the slothful, or the careless, or the delicate, or the tender take the
   kingdom of heaven by force, but the violent. Who then are the violent?
   Surely they are those who show a splendid violence not to others, but
   to their own soul, who by a laudable force deprive it of all delights m
   things present, and are declared by the Lord's mouth to be splendid
   plunderers, and by rapine of this kind, violently seize upon the
   kingdom of heaven. For, as the Lord says, "The kingdom of heaven
   suffereth violence and the violent take it by force." [1274] Those are
   certainly worthy of praise as violent, who do violence to their own
   destruction, for, "A man," as it is written, "that is in sorrow
   laboureth for himself and does violence to his own destruction." [1275]
   For our destruction is delight in this present life, and to speak more
   definitely, the performance of our own likes and desires, as, if a man
   withdraws these from his soul and mortifies them, he straightway does
   glorious and valuable violence to his own destruction, provided that he
   refuses to it the pleasantest of its wishes which the Divine word often
   rebukes by the prophet, saying: "For in the days of your fast your own
   will is found;" and again: "If thou turn away thy foot from the
   Sabbath, to do thy will on My holy day, and glorify him, while thou
   dost not thy own ways, and thy own will is not found, to speak a word."
   And the great blessedness that is promised to him is at once added by
   the prophet. "Then," he says, "shalt thou be delighted in the Lord, and
   I will lift thee up above the high places of the earth, and will feed
   thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of the
   Lord hath spoken it." [1276] And therefore our Lord and Saviour, to
   give us an example of giving up our own wills, says: "I came not to do
   My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me;" and again: "Not as I
   will, but as Thou wilt." [1277] And this good quality those men in
   particular show who live in the coenobia and are governed by the rule
   of the Elders, who do nothing of their own choice, but their will
   depends upon the will of the Abbot. Finally to bring this discussion to
   a close, I ask you, do not those who faithfully serve Christ, most
   clearly receive grace an hundredfold in this, while for His name's sake
   they are honoured by the greatest princes, and though they do not look
   for the praise of men, yet become venerated in the trials of
   persecution whose humble condition would perhaps have been looked down
   upon even by common folk, either because of their obscure birth, or
   because of their condition as slaves, if they had continued in their
   life in the world? But because of the service of Christ no one will
   venture to raise a calumny against their state of nobility, or to fling
   in their teeth the obscurity of their origin. Nay rather, through the
   very opprobrium of a humble condition by which others are shamed and
   confounded, the servants of Christ are more splendidly ennobled, as we
   can clearly show by the case of Abbot John who lives in the desert
   which borders on the town of Lycus. For he sprang from obscure parents,
   but owing to the name of Christ has become so well known to almost all
   mankind that the very lords of creation, who hold the reins of this
   world and of empire, and are a terror to all powers and kings, venerate
   him as their lord, and from distant countries seek his advice, and
   entrust to his prayers and merits the crown of their empire, and the
   state of safety, and the fortunes of war. [1278]

   In such terms the blessed Abraham discoursed on the origin of and
   remedy for our illusion, and exposed to our eyes the crafty thoughts
   which the devil had originated and suggested, and kindled in us the
   desire of true mortification, wherewith we hope that many also may be
   inflamed, even though all these things have been written in a somewhat
   simple style. For though the dying embers of our words cover up the
   glowing thoughts of the greatest fathers, yet we hope that in the case
   of very many who try to remove the embers of our words and to fan into
   a flame the hidden thoughts, their coldness will be turned into heat.
   But, O holy brethren, I have not indeed been so puffed up by the spirit
   of presumption as to give forth to you this fire (which the Lord came
   to send upon the earth, and which He eagerly longs to kindle [1279] )
   in order that by the application of this warmth I might set on fire
   your purpose which is already at a white heat, but in order that your
   authority with your children might be greater, if in addition the
   precepts of the greatest and most ancient fathers support what you are
   teaching not by the dead sound of words but by your living example. It
   only remains that I who have been till now tossed about by a most
   dangerous tempest, should be wafted to the safe harbour of silence by
   the spiritual gales of your prayers.
