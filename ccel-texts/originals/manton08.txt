                            SEVERAL SERMONS UPON THE
                                  CXIX. PSALM.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CIV.

   Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies;
   for they are ever with me.--Ver. 98.

   I COME now to the second consideration, they are wiser than their
   enemies as to security against their attempts, and that enmity and
   opposition that they carry on against them; they are far more safe by
   walking under the covert of God's protection, than their enemies can
   possibly be, to have all manner of worldly advantages. I shall prove it
   by this argument, because they are more prepared and furnished as to
   all events. A godly wise man is careful to keep in with God; he is more
   prepared and furnished, can have a higher hope, more expectation of
   success, than others have; or if not, he is well enough provided for,
   though things fall out never so cross to his desires.

   1. As to success. Who hath made wiser provision, think you, he that
   hath made God his friend, or he that is borne up with worldly props and
   dependences? they that are guided by the Spirit of God, or they that
   are guided by Satan? those that make it their business to walk with God
   step by step, or those that not only forsake him, but provoke him to
   his face? those that break with men and keep in with God, or those that
   break with God? Surely a child of God hath more security from piety
   than his enemies can have by secular policy, whereby they think to
   overreach and ruin him. The safety of a child of God lieth in two
   things--(1.) God is his friend; (2.) As long as God hath work for him
   to do, he will maintain him and bear him out in it.

   [1.] God is his friend; and that must needs be a man's wisdom when he
   complies with the will of him upon whom he depends. All things do
   absolutely depend upon the providence of God; he hath wisdom, strength
   and dominion over all events. The wisdom of God is on his side, and
   therefore it is but the wisdom of men against him. If the difference
   only lay between men and men, the craft and policy of their enemies and
   their own craft and policy, the scales would soon break of their
   enemies' side, for they are wiser in their generation, Luke xvi. They
   have great abilities and great malice, which sharpens men's
   understandings; they have a large conscience, and more liberty to do
   what they will; so that a child of God is gone if it were to oppose
   craft with craft; and usually they carry their matters more subtilly,
   laying hidden snares and profound counsels; whereas the children of God
   carry it simply and plainly. But then there is a wise God to act for a
   foolish people, and sometimes God may give his people great abilities;
   as Joseph was wiser than his brethren, Moses wiser than the Egyptians,
   Daniel than all the magicians of Babylon. But yet usually parts and
   secular wisdom are given to the enemies. Only a child of God hath this
   point of wisdom above the enemies, he taketh in with the wise God,
   which is the ready and compendious way to success; whereas secular
   wisdom takes a long way about, and must work through many mediums and
   subordinate causes before the intended effect can be brought about: Ps.
   xxxvii. 12, 13, The wicked plotteth against the just.' God is the other
   party: The Lord shall laugh at him; for he seeth that his day is
   coming.' He doth not say the just counterbalance the wicked, or strains
   his wit to match his enemy with craft, but God hath a providence and
   love, ever waking on his behalf; therefore it lies not between policy
   and piety, but between men's craft and God's wisdom. Then he hath the
   power of God on his side, and therefore he is wiser than his enemies,
   he is of the stronger side: Gen. xvii. 1, I am God all-sufficient; walk
   before me and be thou perfect.' All warping comes from doubting of
   God's all-sufficiency, evidenced by our carnal fear, and our
   distrustful care what shall become of us and how we shall do to live.
   Certainly, if God be able, we need not doubt, or run to in direct
   courses. Again, he hath him of his side who hath dominion over all
   events. Carnal policy is full of jealousies; they know not what will
   succeed, they have no sure bottom to stand upon; they are not sure of
   events, when their business is never so well laid. But now a child of
   God is wiser, and hath much the more comfortable course, as well as
   successful; he can do his duty, and leave the event to God. When a
   business is never so well and cunningly laid, yet God loves to dispose
   of events, and to take the wise in their own craft,' Job v. 12, 13.
   They are outwitted, and they outreach themselves, that so Christ may,
   as it were, get upon the devil's shoulders, and even be beholden to his
   enemies. Never are they such fools as when they seem to say things
   wisely against God and his people. Carnal wisdom is the greatest folly:
   it brought Moses to the flags, but Pharaoh to the bottom of the sea.
   The devil was the first fool of all the creation, and ever since his
   first attempts against his God he hath been playing the fool for these
   thousands of years. The tempting our first parents seemed a masterpiece
   of wit, but it was indeed the ruin of his kingdom. So in the attempts
   of wicked men against his people, God still disposeth of the event
   contrary to their aim.

   [2.] As long as God hath work for him to do, he will maintain him and
   bear him out in the midst of all dangers; that is certain; as he did
   David in the very face of Saul. There is an invisible guard set upon
   plain-hearted and zealous Christians; every day they do as it were, by
   their pleading against the corruptions of wicked men, exasperate them;
   they are in the secret of God's presence, and are kept none know how;
   none so nigh to dangers, yet none so free from them; in the lion's
   mouth, yet preserved, as Christ lived in the midst of his enemies, yet
   they could not touch him till his hour was come, John xi. 8-10. Christ
   had work to do in Judea: Master,' say the disciples, the Jews of late
   sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again? And Jesus answered,
   Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day he
   stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world; but if a man
   walk in the night he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.' In
   the disciples' question is bewrayed the true genius of carnal fear. Oh,
   men say, why will you go run yourself into the mouth of danger? They
   think the discharge of duty will cost them their utter ruin: Master,
   the Jews sought to kill thee.' Now Christ's answer showeth that men
   should not choose their way according to their apprehensions of danger
   and safety, but as God cleareth a call to them; he answers by a
   similitude taken from God's order in the course of nature. God made the
   day for work, and the night for rest and sleep; now as long as men have
   daylight they will not stumble, but if they set forth in the night,
   then they would stumble. The meaning is, as long as a man hath a clear
   call from God (for a call from God is compared to the day), and can
   say, This is a duty God hath put upon me, he hath daylight, he shall
   not stumble; though he doth come and go in the face and teeth of
   enemies on God's cause, and plead against their corruptions and base
   miscarriages, he shall not stumble. Indeed, when a man is in the dark,
   and knows not what God's mind is, then he is ever and anon stumbling. A
   Christian is to study his duty rather than his danger, and then leave t
   he care of all events to God; he is in a safe course when he is in
   God's way, and shall not be interrupted till he have finished his work:
   Luke xiii. 31, 32, The Pharisees said unto him, Get thee out, and
   depart hence, for Herod will kill thee. And he said, Go tell that fox,
   Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the
   third day I shall be perfected.' If he cast himself into troubles, he
   is sure they are not sinfully procured; but men that run on danger
   without a calling may meet with many a snare, or he that doth not
   observe his call meet with more difficulties than ever he thought of: 1
   Peter iii. 13, And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of
   that which is good?' The best way to eschew trouble is to adhere
   closely to what is right in the sight of God; he can allay their fury,
   putting convictions upon their conscience. A man would think to stand
   nicely upon terms of duty is to run in harm's way; and there are none
   so much harmed, maligned, and opposed in the world as those that follow
   that which is good, as those that will have no fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness, but will reprove them rather; possibly
   they may hate and malign you if you keep to that which is good, but
   they cannot harm your consciences. God can allay the rage of men, by
   putting convictions upon their consciences, evidencing your sincerity;
   as the history saith, when the Arians persecuted the orthodox
   Christians, they durst not meddle with Paulinus out of reverence.
   Therefore who will harm you if you be followers of that which is good?

   2. In case things succeed ill with him, and contrary to his
   expectation, yet they are wiser than their enemies can be, because they
   have provided for the worst. Carnal policy is but wisdom in opinion for
   a time, not always, while they have matter to work upon in the world;
   but these always, in prosperity and adversity.

   [1.] Because he hath secured his great interest, which lies in the
   favour of God and in hopes of eternal life. God, by his commandment,
   hath taught him this wisdom, to make sure of the kingdom of God, and
   then a man is safe; whatever happens, nothing can befall him that doth
   endanger his hopes, or endamage his interest in Christ; if they kill
   him, they do but put him there where he would be; he hath secured his
   great interest; persecutors cannot reach the better part: Luke xii. 4,
   they kill the body, after that they can do no more.' A good man, let
   them do what they can, can come to no hurt; he is indeed like a die;
   cast him high or low, still he falls upon his square; he hath a bottom
   to stand upon, hopes to support him.

   [2.] Because he hath fitted his spirit for all kind of conditions. A
   man that is to go a long journey must prepare for all weathers; so a
   Christian must learn to be abased as well as to abound, Phil. iv. Now a
   mortified man hath the advantage of all the world; a man that is dead
   to worldly interests hath the advantage of all others for doing and
   suffering for God, and in noble and generous actions. It is our
   affections that increase our afflictions, that make us so base and
   pusillanimous: 1 Cor. vii. 31, Rejoice as if you rejoiced not, weep as
   though ye wept not.' If our hearts did not rejoice so much in the
   creature, if we were in a greater indifferency to worldly things, the
   loss and miscarriage of them would not surprise us with so great
   terror. A mortified man is wiser than other men, because he hath
   plucked out the root of all trouble, which is an inordinate affection;
   and then let his condition be never so bad, he is fortified. Temperance
   makes way for patience: 2 Peter i. 6, Add to temperance, patience.'
   Temperance, or a moderation in the enjoyment of all things, tends to
   patience in the loss of them. A man that possesseth them without love
   can lose them without grief. They may lessen his estate, but cannot
   lessen his comfort. Therefore this is the man that can pray always,
   rejoice evermore, in everything give thanks,' for giving and taking,
   for the word of God hath taught him this holy weanedness from worldly
   things.

   [3.] He can look to the end of all things, not only to the present, but
   the future: Heb. xi. 1, Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the
   evidence of things not seen.' He can see victories in a down fall; and
   this is a wisdom proper to faith, to see the overthrow of the church's
   enemies when they rise up and prosper. A natural man may look above his
   condition as long as he seeth any probability in second causes, but
   faith is the evidence of things not seen.' When there is no probable
   way, then it can look above them. Reason usually is short-sighted, it
   cannot see afar off,' 2 Peter i. 9; it cannot look be yond the cloud
   and veil of present discouragement. But now faith can see one contrary
   in another, see a good end in bad means, and those things that make
   against them to make for them; and what in itself is hurtful, is
   altogether tempered by God's hand, and to the greatest good, Rom. viii.
   28; Ps. xxxvii. 37, 38, Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright;
   for the end of that man is peace but the end of the wicked shall be cut
   off;' and Ps. lxxiii. 17, I went into the sanctuary, and there I
   understood their end.' Those that are governed by sense, will, and
   passion, cannot be wise, for they do not see to the end; but he that
   lives by faith looks not to appearances, but seeth the end; therefore
   this man can bear up with hope and courage in the midst of all
   difficulties and troubles.

   Use 1. Caution against two things--carnal fear and carnal policy.

   1. Against carnal fear. Many are troubled when they consider the power
   and cunning of the enemies of God's people. Ay! but you need not be
   dismayed when you do, in the simplicity of your hearts, give up
   yourselves to the direction of God's word; you need not fear all their
   craft; when they are confounded and broken to pieces by their own
   devices, you shall stand firm. It seemeth to be the greatest folly in
   the world to keep at a distance from the rising side; in time it will
   be found to be the greatest wisdom. You think they carry their matters
   with a great deal of cunning, whilst they slight God and tread the
   unquestionable interests of Christ under foot, and that the cause of
   God will never get up again. Since they reject the word of God, what
   wisdom have they? Jer. viii. 9. When you fail, will you believe the
   word of God, or the doubtful face of outward things? Be sure once you
   are in God's way, and then you cannot miscarry finally. Will not Christ
   uphold the ministry in despite of the devil and evil men? Have we not
   the word of God to secure these hopes for us? Therefore what need we
   fear what wicked wretches attempt against us? Doth not God love
   righteousness? Will he not take vengeance? And in their highest
   prosperity, may not we see their downfall? Therefore why should we be
   afraid?

   2. Then take heed of carnal policy; for we are made wiser than our
   enemies through the commandment. We must not oppose craft with craft,
   for so Satan will be too hard for us in the use of his own weapons.
   That is not wisdom to run to shifts, and to carnal and sinful devices.
   There is a wisdom that is necessary for the children of God: Mat. x.
   16, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be wise as
   serpents, simple as doves.' Ever it was so with God's people; they are
   sheep in the midst of wolves, destitute of all outward support: Be ye
   therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.' Carry yourselves
   prudently and holily in my service. That wisdom and knowledge which
   doth not agree with justice, but puts upon doing things that are
   unjust, that is craft, not wisdom. Now though Christ hath bid us be
   wise, yet he hath forbidden us to be crafty. When you run to carnal
   shifts, you think to be wiser than God. All the mischiefs of the
   present age have merely been occasioned by unbelief. We durst not trust
   God in his own way, but will run to carnal practices merely to prevent
   evil, and you see how we are entangled in all manner of confusion.
   Jeroboam would be wiser than God; God would have settled the kingdom
   upon him, but he ran to a way of his own, and that was his undoing.
   Take heed of this fleshly wisdom: 2 Cor. i. 12, Not in fleshly wisdom,
   but in simplicity and godly wisdom.' The more simple and plain a
   Christian walks according to the direct letter of the scripture, the
   more safe he is; but when he doth run to those baser courses, merely
   out of distrust to God, all things come to ruin. Carnal policy never
   succeeds well with the children of God; never did a Christian thrive by
   carnal policy, or using carnal fetches for carnal ends; God crosseth
   them. A man that will walk by the light of his own fire is sure to be
   led out of the way of peace and happiness. When they for sake the light
   of God's word and Spirit, and follow a false light, they run into
   sorrow and inconvenience; and therefore weaker Christians are sometimes
   safer than those of stronger parts, that lean to their own
   understandings and trust to carnal policy.

   Use 2. To prize the scriptures, because of this wisdom, that is to be
   gotten in them. A very poor creature that walks in the fear of God is
   wise to avoid the chiefest danger, to secure the greatest interest, to
   avoid hell beneath, Prov. xv. 24; that wisdom hath escaped the greatest
   danger, the wrath of God, and made sure of heaven, Christ, and
   salvation, his great interest. He that gives up himself to be governed
   by God's word, though never so plain and simple, will be found to be
   the wisest in the issue: Ps. cxix. 24, Thy testimonies are my delight
   and my counsellors.' When God's testimonies are the men of our counsel,
   this is that which will give true wisdom. All things in this world are
   mutable and uncertain, they continue not long; we cannot foresee all
   changes, therefore a wise man may be mistaken sometimes, and do things
   he could wish were never done if he had consulted with God. Therefore
   now be wise; this will tell you when to act and when to forbear, not to
   be over-wise nor over-foolish.

   Use 3. To get this wisdom from, the word of God that will make you
   wiser than your adversaries: Prov. iv. 7, Get wisdom, that is the
   principal thing, and with all thy gettings get understanding.' There
   are some maxims (if we would have this wisdom so as to be wiser than
   our enemies) and some graces.

   First, Some maxims:--

   1. Season the heart with this principle, that it concerns you to secure
   your interest in Christ rather than the world, Mat. vi. 34; Luke xiv.
   26.

   2. That we should not be solicitous about events so much as duty about
   dangers so much as sin, 1 Chron. xix. 13; 2 Tim. iv. 17, 18.

   3. That in a way of duty it is better to depend upon Christ's care over
   us, without using any carnal reaches to secure ourselves 1 Peter v. 7,
   iv. 19.

   4. All that befalls the people of God is either, good, or tends to
   good, Rom viii. 28.

   5. That when deliverance is more for our turn than bondage, yokes, and
   oppression, we shall be sure to have it. God hath engaged himself by
   covenant that he will withhold no good thing,' Ps. lxxxiv. 11.

   6 Close adherence to God, and constancy in obedience, is the surest way
   to present ease and future deliverance Ps. cxxv. 3.

   7. It is better to attend God's leisure than to get out of trouble by
   any carnal means of our own, Isa. xxxviii. 15.

   8. No man can be a loser by God, though he suffers never so much for
   him, Rom. viii. 18; 2 Cor. iv. 17.

   9. Then is our adversary wiser than we, when his opposition draws us to
   sin; then and then only are we foiled by our adversary.

   Secondly, There are some graces also make us wise

   1. To this wisdom faith is necessary. If we could but depend upon God
   in a good, plain, and downright course, we would not run to shifts, nor
   change ourselves into all shapes and colours, cameleon-like (unless it
   be white); but you would support yourselves with this, that he would
   maintain you and bear you out.

   2. Fear of God, which makes us tender of spirit, that we dare not
   offend God nor break a rule for all the world; he fears a commandment
   more than a thousand dangers: Prov. xiii. 13, He that fears the
   commandment shall be safe from fear of danger.' If a commandment stand
   in his way, he dares not go through; it is more than if all the terrors
   of the world stand in his way; he will endure all hazards rather than
   break through a command.

SERMON CV.

   I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are
   my meditation.--Ver. 99.

   DAVID had spoken of his affection to the word of God, and then
   mentioned one special ground thereof, which was the wisdom that he got
   thereby; now this wisdom is amplified, by comparing it with the wisdom
   of others. Three sorts of men he mentioneth--enemies, teachers,
   ancients. The enemies excel in policy, teachers in doctrine, and
   ancients in counsel; and yet by the word was David made wiser than all
   these. Malice sharpens the wit of enemies, and teacheth them the arts
   of opposition; teachers are furnished with learning; but ancients, they
   grow wise by experience: yet David, by the study of the word, excelled
   all these. In the text we may observe two things:--

   1. David's assertion concerning his profiting by the word of God, I
   have more understanding than all my teachers.

   2. The reason, taken from his diligent use of the means, for thy
   testimonies are my meditation.

   For the first of these, I have more understanding than all my
   teachers,' to clear the words:--

   1. It is certain that he speaks not this of his extraordinary
   revelations as a prophet, but of that wisdom which he got by ordinary
   means. The holy men of God in the Old Testament, considered as
   prophets, so they had extraordinary visions and revelations. Now David
   speaks of that kind of knowledge got by the ordinary means, not those
   special revelations made to the prophets; for he renders the reason of
   it, Thy testimonies are my meditation.'

   2. It is certain he speaks not this by way of boasting; for this is a
   psalm of instruction, not a history or narrative. Now the children of
   God would not commend their failings to the imitation of others, and
   this which David speaks is rendered as a reason of his respect; by the
   word he got wisdom above his teachers, enemies, and ancients.

   Briefly, the intent and use of this assertion will be known by
   considering the quality of these teachers here mentioned. You may look
   upon them either--(1.) As faulty or defective in their duty; (2.) As
   performing their duty. In both these notions David was wiser than they,
   or a man of a better understanding.

   1. If you look upon them under a diminishing notion; so some would
   understand it thus, that those which instructed him in human learning
   and civil discipline had not understanding as he that meditated in
   God's testimonies. If this were the sense, there is no boasting, but
   only comparing knowledge with knowledge, the knowledge of the word with
   the knowledge of ordinary sciences; and it gives us this lesson, that
   the great sages of the world that do excel in secular wisdom are but
   fools to a child of God; they know the secrets of nature, and he knows
   the God of nature; they dispute about the chiefest good, and he enjoys
   it; they know the use of natural things, and he knoweth the use of
   spiritual. This wisdom and skill in outward things, compared with the
   fear of God, is but vanity; and the wisest man must become a fool that
   he may be wise' with this kind of wisdom, 1 Cor. iii. 18.

   2. You may look upon them as corrupt and sinful. In those days of Saul,
   the teachers might be corrupt as well as other ranks and orders of men;
   and then it only implies this, that God gives greater understanding to
   his people than to their corrupt guides: Luke xi. 52, Woe unto you
   lawyers; for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in
   yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.' The expounders
   of the law were corrupt, and hindered others from entering into the
   kingdom of God. It is a great evil when the church of God is given up
   to such kind of guides. But now, in such a case, they that make
   conscience of God's ordinances, use private means with diligence, have
   more understanding than their teachers: Mat. xxiii. 2, 3, The scribes
   and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. Whatsoever they bid you observe, that
   observe and do; but do not ye after their works; for they say, and do
   not.' Though they were naught and corrupt themselves, yet if they bring
   God's message, it should not be slighted, because of the office and
   lawful authority with which they are invested, though not every way
   qualified for their station; and in this sense a child of God may be
   wiser than his teachers.

   3. We may look upon them as contenting themselves with the naked theory
   of God's law, without making conscience of practice; that they were
   such kind of guides that never tasted themselves what they commended to
   others, or practised what they taught; then I have more understanding
   than my teachers.' He that excels in practice hath the best
   understanding. Practical knowledge is to be preferred before
   speculative, as much as the end is to be preferred before the means;
   the end is more noble than the means. Now speculative knowledge is the
   means to the end: Ps. cxi. 10, A good understanding have all they that
   do his commandments.' Not only know what is to be done, but do what is
   to be known. As for others, whatever light they seem to have, they have
   not wisdom and understanding: Jer. viii. 9, Lo, they have rejected the
   word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them?' They were boasting of
   the knowledge of the law, yet there was no wisdom in them. A mean
   Christian, that fears God, is a man of more understanding than he that
   hath a great deal of head-light and in this sense may it be well said,
   the children of God are wiser than their teachers. Many times those
   that are unlearned rise up and take heaven by violence, when others, by
   all their literal and speculative knowledge, are thrust down to hell.

   Suppose it spoken no way in diminution to these teachers, but that they
   did their duty.

   4. Some comment thus; that David had more understanding than all his
   teachers who taught him the first rudiments of religion, that he
   transcended them by far, by God's blessing, in making further progress
   in this kind of knowledge. If this were the sense, it would teach us
   not always to keep to our milk and to the first principles of religion,
   but to wade further and further into these mysteries, Heb. v. 12, 13.
   We should go on still, and grow up to a greater fulness in knowledge
   according as we have more means and advantages. But this is not the
   sense, for he saith, than all my teachers.' Why then, secondly, take it
   for his godly teachers that were every way qualified; and it is no new
   thing for a scholar to exceed his master, and Christians of a private
   station many times to excel those that are in office. Look, as in
   secular things among the heathens, Aristotle was wiser than Plato his
   master, and opposed him in many things, and therefore is called an
   ass's colt, that as soon as he was full with the dam's milk, he kicks
   her; he forgot that he was his father. We should, if we can, exceed our
   teachers, but not despise them; and Daniel, chap. i. 20, was wiser in
   civil arts than all his teachers, so also it is true as to holy things.
   Jesus Christ at twelve years of age puzzled the doctors. Eli brought up
   Samuel in the fear of God, but he proved wiser than Eli; Paul, brought
   up at the feet of Gamaliel, Acts xxii. 3, proved a more notable
   instrument of God's glory; and Austin was taught by Ambrose, but grew
   afterwards more eminent than he. Thus David was wiser than his
   teachers, and yet they might be faithful and holy. Now he mentions this
   partly to commend the Lord's grace, Thou hast made me wiser than my
   teachers;' and partly to commend meditation in the word, the means by
   which he got it; not to boast of his own attainments, but to commend
   grace, and commend the means of grace to others.

   What may we observe from this assertion of David, I am wiser than my
   teachers'?

   Obs. 1. The freeness of God's grace in making a difference between men
   and men as to measures and degrees of knowledge: 1 Cor. iv. 7, Who made
   thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou hast not
   received?' Some have more and some less understanding, and all is as
   God gives out. There is not only a difference between men and men as to
   their great distinction of election and reprobation, but within the
   sphere of election as to measures of grace. God manifests himself to
   some more than to others; they are admitted to this favour, to see more
   than others into the mind of God, though they have the same teacher,
   God's Spirit; the same rule and direction, God's word; the same
   principles of grace; yet they have greater measures of knowledge: the
   reasons lie in God's bosom and grace. Now this should be noted, that
   those which excel should be kept humble, as being more indebted to
   grace than others are. and surely none should be proud because more in
   debt; and that those who are excelled might submit, and be contented to
   be outshined: John iii. 30, He must increase, but I must decrease.' It
   should be a rejoicing to them that God is likely to be glorified more
   by others; especially teachers should rejoice that God should give such
   a blessing to the ministry, that they which seem to be under them
   should see more than they. When those two quarrelling pronouns, meum et
   tuum, mine and thine, have no more use, as in heaven, then we shall
   fully rejoice in one anothers' gifts and graces, and what they enjoy it
   will be our comfort: as, in a choir of voices, one sings the treble,
   another the bass; they are refreshed, and every one delights not only
   in his own part and performance, but in the part of each other; all
   concurs to the harmony; so one hath this measure of grace, another
   another, and all concur to the glory of God.

   Obs. 2. Not only the freeness of God's grace in giving wisdom to one
   more than to another, but observe also the sovereignty of God's
   distribution. The treasures of grace are at his free disposing, and he
   will not be tied to any order; he gives to every one that measure of
   understanding which he sees fit. Indeed his ordinary course is to bless
   the teachers of his people with an increase of knowledge, for he hath
   promised a more especial presence with the public gift than with
   private: Mat. xxviii. 20, I am with you to the end of the world.' Yet
   many times private believers excel their godly teachers in wisdom and
   piety. Wisdom is not so tied to the teachers but that God is free to
   the giving as much, nay, more, to those that are taught. Though the
   general course is, in the ordinary way, that teachers should know more
   than the taught, yet God sometimes doth work extraordinarily, to show
   his prerogative, and absolute sovereignty; and things revealed to babes
   may be hid from the wise and prudent, to show that it is at his
   disposing, to hide and manifest as he pleaseth.

   Obs. 3. The equity and proportion that he observes in the dispensation
   of his sovereignty, for David ascribes it to God, but observes that
   this came to him as a blessing upon the use of means, For thy
   testimonies are my meditation.' God gives knowledge to whom he pleas
   eth, but those that meditate most thrive most.

   There are three sorts of meditation--(1.) Of observation; (2.) Of study
   and search; (3.) Of consideration or inculcative application; and all
   these conduce to make us wise.

   1. There is a meditation of observation, when a man compares the word
   and providence, and is still taking notice how such a promise is
   accomplished, such a threatening made good; this man will grow more
   wise and more understanding than others: Ps. cvii. 43, Whoso is wise,
   and will observe those things, even they shall understand the
   loving-kindness of the Lord.' That is, he that is comparing the
   prediction and event, God's proceedings either in justice or mercy
   according to his word, how he doth punish and reward his people, and
   what visible comments his works are upon his word, he hath a clearer
   discerning than others, and they will see more cause to adhere to God,
   and yield him more faithful obedience than others.

   2. There is the meditation of study and search, they that are inquiring
   into the word of God to find out his mind: Eph. v. 17, Be ye not
   unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.' They that
   exercise themselves in the word to find out his mind shall have more of
   his blessing than those that rest in hearing and reading: For with what
   measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and unto you that hear,
   shall more be given,' Mark iv. 24. It is spoken of measuring to God in
   ordinances; as we measure to God in the use of means, so the Lord will
   measure out to us in his blessing and the influences of his grace.

   3. There is a meditation of consideration, when we consider that which
   we read and hear, how it may be for use and practice, and of what
   moment it is for our eternal weal or woe. The scripture calls it
   consideration: 2 Tim. ii. 7, Consider what I say, and the Lord give
   thee understanding in all things;' Ps. l. 22, Consider this, ye that
   forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.'
   The more men consider things with application to their own soul, the
   more wise will they grow, and the more understanding in the things of
   God, and able to apply all for their own direction; he will see more
   than the teacher ever could express when he gives forth the general
   doctrine of faith and manners. But let any meditate upon it, and urge
   his own heart, and he shall find something the teacher thought not of;
   and this principally is the sense spoken of in this place. A man that
   urgeth his own heart with what is taught, when he hath a general
   doctrine applies it to his own soul, and reflects the light of it upon
   his own heart, meditates upon it by serious and inculcative thoughts,
   will ever find something either the teacher saw not, or seeing
   expressed not, see further into this truth than the teacher was aware
   of. The life and success of all means doth lie in this meditation.

   Obs. 4. I have more understanding than my teachers.' We learn this,
   that private means is a duty, and meditation must be joined with public
   hearing. Many content themselves with public ordinances, but make no
   conscience of private means, as secret prayer, and debating with
   themselves by serious inculcative thoughts returning upon their own
   heart. Oh! make conscience of this private duty. You may prosper and
   thrive more in a way of grace. When the apostle laid down the
   privileges of a justified estate, Rom. viii. 31, he concludes, Now what
   shall we say to these things?' implying we should urge our own heart
   upon every general doctrine, or rouse up ourselves with such a smart
   question, Heb. ii. 3, How shall we escape if we neglect so great
   salvation?'

   Obs. 5. We learn, again, that it is good to submit to God's
   institutions; though the persons employed in them be never so mean, yet
   if they be clothed with lawful authority, by a conscientious attending
   upon God's ordinance, we may get a great deal of wisdom more than the
   teacher ever had, as they set your thoughts awork. Surely, if teachers
   be corrupt, as they sit in Moses' chair, though they are corrupt, yet
   as far as they do God's message they are to be regarded. Certainly we
   are not to turn back upon one meaner gifted if godly, or be a
   discouragement to those that are weak, though they are not so able, and
   have not so strong a gift. God may make a mean teacher a means for the
   increasing of knowledge.

   Obs. 6. We learn the glory of all profiting; it must not be given to
   the instruments, but to God, for the scholar may become wiser than the
   teacher; that is, God may give more grace by an instrument than the
   instrument hath in himself, to show that all is of him, that it doth
   not lie in the teacher's gift. All profiting must be ascribed to God;
   therefore the glory of all must redound to him, to his grace: 1 Cor.
   xv. 10, By the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was
   bestowed upon me was not in vain: I laboured more abundantly than they
   all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.' If never so
   able, it is still from God.

   Secondly, The reason, I have more understanding than all my teachers:
   for thy testimonies are my meditation.'

   Point. That meditation is a great help towards gracious improvement.
   David grew in such a manner as that he did excel all his teachers, and
   he giveth this reason of it: For thy testimonies are my meditation.'
   The scripture calleth for this: 1 Tim. iv. 15, Meditate upon these
   things, give thyself wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to
   all. So consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in
   all things;' and Ps. l. 22, Consider this, ye that forget God, lest I
   tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver;' and Luke ii. 19,
   Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.' Here I
   might show--(1.) What this is; (2.) What a notable means this is for
   spiritual improvement and growth in knowledge; to debate things with
   himself, Who made him, and for what end he was made. But of this you
   may see at large, ver. 15.

SERMON CVI.

   I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.--Ver.
   100.

   MAN is a rational being, and should close with things more or less as
   they do perfect and polish his understanding. Now among all the
   inventions of mankind to remedy the defects of nature, not one of them
   can compare with the means which God offers for curing of the blindness
   and darkness of the mind which is introduced by the fall. Man hath
   found out grammar to rectify his speech, rhetoric to adorn it and make
   it more cogent and powerful in persuasion, logic to revive reason,
   medicine or physic to preserve the health of the body, politics for
   government of human societies, and for ordering our converse with
   others in the world, economics for prudent ordering of families, ethics
   for the tempering of each man's spirit, that it may live under the
   dominion of natural reason. But mark, for commerce and communion with
   God, wherein our happiness lies, there all the inventions of man are
   very short, and only the word of God can guide us, and furnish us with
   this wisdom; and because of this is the word so desirous [1] and
   precious to the saints. Oh, how they love the law of God!' for it is
   their wisdom. Well, David having showed how it prevailed with his own
   heart, Oh, how I love thy law!' for thereby I get spiritual wisdom and
   understanding; to draw in other men to love and study the word, and to
   make this motive strong and pressing upon them, he doth compare the
   wisdom that men may get by the word with other things that look like
   wisdom; he compares it with the sagacity of enemies, the speculation
   and knowledge of the teacher, and the prudence we get by age and
   experience.

   1. With the sagacity of enemies, whose wit was sharpened with their own
   malice. There he shows that a man that taketh counsel of the word to
   secure his great interest, by getting into the favour of God, and
   walketh by the plain rule of the word, without consulting with flesh
   and blood, hath the advantage of all other men, and will be found to be
   the wisest man at length. He compares this wisdom he got by the word
   with the speculations and knowledge of teachers. He that doth not
   content himself with the naked rules delivered by them, but labours
   with his own conscience to make them profitable to his own soul, he
   will see more by his own eyes as to the particular duties and
   concernments of the spiritual life than his teachers could ever direct
   him unto.

   2. He compares it here in the text with the wisdom of the ancients, or
   men of long experience. By the elders or ancients may be meant either
   men of former times, or aged men of the same time.

   [1.] Men of former times: Heb. xi. 2, By it the ancients or elders
   obtained a good report;' that is, the holy patriarchs of their time. If
   this be meant of men in former times, then thou hast made me wiser than
   the ancients recommends this observation to us, viz., the church of God
   is growing always, and one age sees more than an other. A dwarf upon a
   giant's shoulders may see further than he. The ancients had their
   measures of light, so hath the present age: Joel ii. 28-30, In the
   latter days'--meaning the times of the gospel, all that efflux of time
   which was between Christ's ascension and his second coming, is called
   the latter days'--I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your
   sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream
   dreams, and your young men shall see visions,' &c. The knowledge which
   younger ones shall get under the New Testament is expressed by visions,
   dreams, and prophecy. These three were the ways of God's revealing
   himself to the old prophets; therefore it implies that those very
   truths which the prophets and holy men of God had by visions, dreams,
   and prophecies, by such extra ordinary ways of revelation, will then be
   commonly known by preaching and catechising and other means of
   instruction in the church of God: and thus, I have more understanding
   than the ancients.' Succeeding ages may see more into the mind of God;
   therefore antiquity should not sway against truth, and former ages
   should not prescribe to succeeding, which grow up to a further latitude
   and increase in knowledge.

   [2.] Rather let us take it, I have more understanding than the
   ancients;' that is, than many old men of the same age. They that are
   slow and dull of conceit, yet by long use they grow wise; and having
   smarted often, they learn by their own harms to become circumspect. But
   here is the excellency of the word, that it made a young man wiser than
   those that are men of age and experience. Youths well studied in God's
   law may exceed men of great experience and knowledge in arts and
   sciences. True zeal and piety, and the defects of his age and want of
   experiences, are recompensed by the exactness of his rule that he takes
   to guide him; if he will but wholly subject and give up himself to the
   directions of this rule, he will not need much experience; he hath
   enough to guide him: I understand more than the ancients: because I
   keep thy precepts.' In which words you have--

   1 The benefit that we get by God's precepts, that is understanding.

   2. This benefit is amplified by comparing it with the understanding
   that is gotten by age and experience, I understand more than the
   ancients.

   3. The manner of obtaining this more excellent benefit, by a diligent
   heed and practice, I understand more than the ancients.' Why? Because I
   keep thy precepts. So that from hence three points are to be
   observed:--

   1. That understanding gotten by the precepts of the word is better than
   understanding gotten by long experience. I observe this, because David
   doth not speak this so much to commend his own proficiency, as to set
   forth the exactness of our rule and goodness of the word of God;
   therefore this point lies couched here.

   2. That young ones may sometimes have more of spiritual wisdom than
   those that are ancient. I observe that, because David instanceth in his
   own person, though young, that he exceeded many, not only of his
   equals, but of his seniors.

   3. The way to increase in spiritual understanding is to be studious in
   practical holiness. I observe this, because the reason rendered was his
   own diligent practice, I understand more than the ancients.' Why?
   Because I keep thy precepts.'

   Doct. 1. That understanding gotten by the precepts of the word is
   better than understanding gotten by long experience. It is better in
   four regards:--

   1. It is more exact. Our experience reacheth but to a few things, but
   the word of God reacheth to all cases that concern true happiness. The
   word is the result of God's wisdom, who is the Ancient of days,
   therefore exceeds the wisdom of the ancients, or experience of any man,
   or all men. God is more ancient than they, sees all things that have
   been, are, and shall be, at one view and sight; and therefore, if he
   will give us a rule, certainly that is more than all our experience.
   Experience will show us the evils of this world, and give us some rules
   to escape it; but the word of God tells us of evils in the next, and
   that with more persuasiveness and evidence than if one came from the
   dead, and had been wallowing in those devouring flames that had been
   kindled in the other world, Luke xvi. 30, 31. There is more exactness
   and completeness in this rule than possibly can be in experience: 2
   Tim. iii. 17, The word is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
   correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may
   be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.' By the man of
   God is meant the teacher; the prophets are called men of God, and the
   public teacher is the man of God. If there be enough to furnish the
   teacher to every good work, surely there is enough to furnish the
   practiser. There is enough to furnish the maw of God, who is to consult
   not only for his own private necessity, but the necessities of others.

   2. As it is a more exact, so a more sure way of learning wisdom,
   whereas experience is more uncertain. Many have much experience, yet
   have not a heart to see and to gather wisdom from what they feel: Deut.
   xxix. 2, 3, Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the
   land of Egypt. Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive,
   and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.' They saw it, that
   is, had experience of it, yet not a heart to improve it: Ps. xlix. 13,
   This their way is their folly, yet their posterity approve their
   sayings.' The father gets an estate; when gotten, he thinks to enjoy
   it; God takes him off; their posterity live by their carnal maxims, and
   do not profit by their experience. Though they stand upon the graves of
   many that made a great bustle in the world to compass their worldly
   ends, yet they are never the wiser for all this. Therefore it is a
   great advantage to have a stated fixed rule to our hands, to have a
   rule of wisdom and principles given us by God himself, wherewith to
   steer and guide our course.

   3. It is a safer and cheap way of learning, to learn by rule, than to
   come home by Weeping Gross, and to learn wisdom by our own smart.
   Experience is too expensive a way; and if we had nothing else to guide
   us, into how many thousand miseries should we run! how would a man's
   life be exposed to inevitable hazards and soul-dangers! And if by
   chance he should get out of the snare (which is uncertain), yet the
   taint of former practices will remain in him a long time; therefore it
   is God's mercy he will teach us by precept rather than by experience;
   that he doth not teach us, as Gideon taught the men of Succoth, by
   briars and thorns, but that we may learn wisdom at a cheaper rate. If
   we were only to know (as God saith of his people, Jer. ii. 19, Thine
   own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove
   thee') when we had smarted for it, this were an expensive costly way;
   but if we will hearken to God's precepts, all this smart and trouble
   and bitterness of affliction may be saved. Therefore the precepts of
   God are better.

   4. The way by age and experience is a long way, and so for a long time
   all a man's younger age must needs be miserable and foolish. Now here
   you may come betimes to be wise, by studying the word of God: Prov. i.
   22, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity, and ye fools
   hate knowledge?' It concerns a man not only to be wise at length, but
   to be wise betimes. The foolish virgins were wise too late, but never
   any were wise too soon. Therefore surely that is better which will make
   us wise betimes, as soon as we come to be exposed to dangers. In these
   respects he that applies himself to God's precepts will get more wisdom
   than he that gets wisdom by age and experience; he hath it in a shorter
   way, a safer way, a less expensive way, and in a more certain and
   exacter way.

   Use I. To reprove the folly of men that will not take God's directions,
   but will be trying experiments at their own cost; as Solomon gave out
   his heart to a critical search, he would find where happiness and
   comfort was, and at length was forced to come home by Weeping Cross, to
   the fear of God and keeping of his commandments. This is the whole of
   man, he had tried pleasure, profit, and all things. The prodigal would
   be running out of his father's house, and we all would be trying
   because we will not take God's word. God hath given his word here to
   man, we need not search elsewhere; and it is a thousand to one that,
   when you are trying, that ever you recover yourselves out of the snare.
   Here or there a man returns; I found them, saith Solomon, but there are
   very few; and therefore, as the prophet saith, Jer xxxi 32 How long
   wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter?' Why do you compass
   about? There is a shorter way to true happiness, if we had a heart to
   take it. Oh, but we must have our swing and our scope, and then come
   home by shame and sorrow: Mat xi. 28, Come to me, all ye that labour
   and are heavy laden.' Mark, they that come to Christ, come not only
   laden with their sins, but weary with vain pursuits. But this is the
   fashion of man, to be running about, to be wearying himself, and
   contract weariness and thirst, as the prophet speaks, Jer. ii. 13.

   Use 2. To recommend the study of the word. O Christians! hath provided
   for us better than the heathens, who were forced to hunt up and down to
   find a spark of wisdom here and there; it is all brought home, and
   suited to your hands in the word of God; there is more wisdom to be
   gotten there for the guiding of your affairs and course of life in
   order to true happiness than by age and long experience you can
   possibly reach. Two ways doth this appear:--

   1. Because the word doth sufficiently instruct us in our duty: Prov.
   ii. 9, Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
   equity; yea, every good path.' Then! when? When you give up yourselves
   to God's direction, and take the law from his mouth, and walk in the
   way that is pointed out by his word and Spirit; you shall have enough
   to direct you in all your ways.

   2. It doth warn us of all our dangers. It doth not only in the general
   call upon us to watch,' Mat. xiii. 37, and walk circumspectly,' Eph. v.
   15, but it discovers all those deceits particularly whereby we may be
   surprised, diverted, and turned out of the way. There are snares in
   prosperity, snares in adversity; temptations you meet with in praying,
   trading, eating, drinking, in your public undertakings, and in your
   private converse; it shows your danger in all your ways, before you
   feel the smart of them. Therefore give up yourselves to God's
   direction, reading, hearing, meditating, believing, and practising;
   read, hear it often, then the deceits of Satan will be laid open, and
   the snares of your own hearts. Christians! an exact rule is of little
   use if you do not consult it: Gal. vi. 16, Peace and mercy be upon all
   them that walk according to this rule;' that order their conversations
   exactly. The word signifies, that try their work as a carpenter doth by
   his square; they examine their actions by the word of God, what they
   are now a-doing, therefore consult with it often; then meditate of it,
   ponder it seriously: 2 Tim. ii. 7, Consider what I say, and the Lord
   give thee understanding in all things.' If we would have understanding
   by the word, there must be consideration. Man hath a discursive faculty
   to debate things with himself. Why! this is my duty. What would become
   of me if I step out of God's way? Here is danger and a snare; what if I
   should run into it now it is laid before me? And then believe it
   surely: Heb. iv. 2, The word profited not, not being mixed with faith
   in them that heard it.' Believe God upon his word without making trial.
   You hear much of living by sense and by faith; living by faith is when
   we bear up upon the bare word of God, and encourage ourselves in the
   Lord; but living by sense is a trying whether it be so or no; as they
   that will not believe hell shall feel hell, and they that will not
   believe the word of God shall smart for it: Heb. xi. 7, Noah, being
   warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an
   ark.' It may be there were no preparations to the accomplishment of the
   curse and judgment; the word threatened, it is a thing not seen, yet he
   prepared an ark. When a man is walking in an unjust course, all things
   prosper for a-while, the misery the word threatens is unseen. Ay! but
   if you would grow wiser by the word than men can by experience, you
   must look to the end of things: Ps. lxxiii. 17, I went into the
   sanctuary of God, then understood I their end.' And then practise it
   diligently. A young practiser hath more understanding than an ancient
   notionalist: Ps. cxi. 10, A good understanding have all they that do
   his commandments.' It is not they that are able to speak of things, and
   savour what the word requires, but they that do what they hear and
   discourse of, Gregory saith, we know no more than we practise, and we
   practise as we know; these two always go together. The word doth us no
   good unless there be a ready obedience; therefore this is wisdom, when
   we give up ourselves to God's direction, whatever it cost us in the
   world.

   Doct. 2. That young ones may have many times more of this wisdom than
   those that are ancient.

   Divers instances there are. Joseph was very young, sold into Egypt
   about seventeen years of age; and when he was in Egypt, Ps. cv. 22, He
   taught his senators wisdom,' speaking of the senators of Egypt. With
   how much modesty did he carry himself when his mistress laid that
   snare! Isaac was young, and permitted himself to be offered to God as a
   sacrifice. Samuel was wise betimes: 1 Sam. ii. 26, it is said, The
   child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord and also
   with men.' From his infancy he was dedicated to God, and God gives him
   wisdom to walk so that he was in favour with God and men; yea, God
   reveals himself to Samuel when he did not to Eli. David, when he was
   but fifteen years of age, fought with the lion and bear; and some while
   after that with Goliath, when he was a ruddy youth. Josiah, when he was
   but eight years old, administered the kingdom; before he was twelve,
   sets upon serious reformation. Jeremiah was sanctified from the womb,
   Jer. i. 5; and John the Baptist leaped in his mother's womb, Luke i.
   35. In the 32d of Job, the ancients, Job's friends, are spoken of
   pleading their cause; wise young Elihu brings wiser words and better
   arguments than those that came to comfort Job. Solomon asked wisdom of
   God when he was young. Daniel and his companions, those four children
   as they are called: Dan. i. 17, 18, it is said, The Lord filled them
   with wisdom above all the ancient Chaldeans.' And Timothy, the apostle
   speaks of his youth, and bids him flee youthful lusts;' he was young,
   yet very knowing, and set over the church of God. Our Lord Jesus at
   twelve years old puzzled the doctors. In ecclesiastical stories we read
   of one who at fifteen years of age died with great constancy for
   religion in the midst of sundry tortures. Ignatius pleads the cause of
   the bishop when he was but a very youth, but a man powerful in doctrine
   and of great wisdom; and therefore he saith, he would have them not
   look to his appearing youth, but to the age of his mind, to his wisdom
   before God. And he saith, there are many that have nothing to show for
   their age but wrinkles and grey hairs. So there are many young ones m
   whom there is an excellent spirit; and in all ages there are instances
   given of youth of whom it may be said that they are wise beyond their
   years.

   For the reasons, why many times young ones may have more wisdom than
   those that are aged: God doth so--

   1. That he might show the freedom and sovereignty of his grace. He is
   not bound to years, nor to the ordinary course of nature, but can work
   according to his own pleasure, and give a greater measure of knowledge
   and understanding to those that are young, and otherwise green, than he
   will to those that are of great age and more experience in the world.
   You have this reason rendered: Job xxxii. 7-9, I said, Days should
   speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.' There is the
   course: But there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the
   Almighty giveth them understanding. Great men are not always wise,
   neither do the aged understand judgment.' Though all men have reason
   and a spirit, yet the Spirit of God is a wind that blows where he
   lists. Those that exceed others in time, may come behind them in grace.
   He gives a greater measure many times of grace and knowledge, to show
   his freedom and sovereignty.

   2. Sometimes to manifest the power of his grace, both in the person
   that is endued with it, and the power of his grace upon others. As to
   the person himself in whom this wisdom is found, when they are young,
   the Lord doth show he can subdue them by his Spirit, and make their
   prejudices vanish, enlarge their understanding, and overrule their
   heart: 1 John ii. 14, I write to you, young men, because ye are strong,
   and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked
   one.' In that slippery age, when lusts are boisterous, temptations most
   violent, and they usually uncircumspect and headstrong, and give up
   themselves to an ungoverned license, yet then can God subdue their
   hearts, and make them stand out against the snares of the devil. And
   then with respect to others, when by the foolish he will confound the
   wisdom of the wise, and blast the pride of man, and cast down all
   conceit in external privileges, and give young ones a more excellent
   spirit than the aged, as the apostle intimates such a thing, 1 Cor. i.
   26, Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble
   are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to
   confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to
   confound the things that are mighty.' And our Lord: Mat. xi. 25, 26,
   Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them
   unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.'
   Usually God will do so, when he will punish the unfaithfulness of those
   that are in public place and office: The law shall perish from the
   priest, and counsel from the ancient.' God will not take the usual way
   and course, but will give his Spirit and graces of his Spirit to them,
   and deny it to those that should be builders.

   Now what use shall we make of this? There may be an abuse of such a
   point as this, and there may be a very good use.

   To prevent the abuse--

   1. This is not to be taken so but that there should be reverence shown
   to the aged, Job xxxii. 4-6. Elihu had waited till Job's friends had
   spoken, because they were elder than he. It is an abuse of men of a
   proud persuasion of their own knowledge and learning to despise the
   aged, especially when they also have a competent measure of the same
   spirit. The scripture speaks of Paul the aged;' certainly there is a
   reverence due to grey hairs. And it argues a great disorder when the
   staff of government is broken, and the established order is overturned;
   when a child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient,' Isa.
   iii. 5, and young men shall peak up to the despising of their elders,
   Deut. xxviii.

   2. This is not to be applied so as to prejudice the general case of
   consulting with the ancients, which was Rehoboam's sin. Though God
   sometimes giveth wisdom to young men, yet the usual course is that, Job
   xxxii. 7, I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should
   teach wisdom.' Certainly those that are old they are freer from
   passions, bettered by use and experience, and long continuance in
   study, have more advantages to add to their knowledge; therefore
   usually, though the bodily eyes be dim, the understanding may be most
   clear and sharp.

   Use 2. The use in general is twofold--that young men should not be
   discouraged nor despised.

   1. Not discouraged. We use to say Youth for strength and age for
   wisdom: but if they apply their hearts to religion and the study of
   God's will, and with knowledge join practice, they may profit, and so
   as they may be a means to shame those that are elder, while they come
   behind them in many gracious endowments. They are not to be
   discouraged, as if it were too soon for them to enter into a strict
   course, or grow eminent therein; for God may glorify himself in their
   sobriety, temperance, chastity, zeal, courage, and the setting their
   strong and eager spirits against sin is a mighty honour to God: Ps.
   viii. 2, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
   strength, because of thine enemies,' &c. The graces of God in young
   ones do mightily turn to the praise of his glorious grace, and God is
   admired in them, and it is an honour and comfort to you, also: Eph. i.
   12, In Christ before me:' it is a just upbraiding to elder people that
   lie longer in sin.

   2. Nor yet should youth be despised: 1 Tim. iv. 12, Let no man despise
   thy youth.' God's gifts should not be despised in any, nor stir up
   rancour. God may speak by them as he spoke by Samuel, and to Samuel
   when he spoke not to old Eli.

   Having premised this, let me come to apply it particularly, though
   briefly. It conduceth then--

   1. To the encouragement of youth to betake themselves to the ways of
   God. Oh, consider! let us begin with God betimes; do not spend your
   youth in vanity, but in a serious mortified course. This is your sharp
   and active time, when your spirits are fresh: therefore, if your watch
   is set right now, you may understand more than the ancients. Give up
   your hearts to a religious course; let not the devil feast upon the
   flower of your youth, and God be put off with the fragments and scraps
   of Satan's table. While you are young take in with God; it is a great
   honour to God, and it will be an honour and an advantage to you. Mat.
   xxi. 15, 16, when the children cry Hosanna to the Son of David,' and
   the Pharisees reproved him for it, Christ approves of it, saying, Have
   ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast
   perfected praise?' When young ones take kindly, it is a great blessing.
   Therefore is judgment hanging over this nation, that youth is so
   degenerated; whereas formerly they were addicted to religion, now they
   are addicted to all manner of lusts and vanity. Then it would be an
   honour and comfort to you; the sooner we begin with God, the more we
   glorify God, and the more praise to God: Eph. i. 12, That we should be
   to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.' They that get
   into Christ above [2] others, they glorify grace above others: Rom.
   xvi. 7, They were in Christ before me.' He that first gets into Christ,
   he hath the advantage of others; seniority in grace is a preferment, as
   well as in nature. And then it is a great advantage: Eccles. xii. 1,
   Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth.' When we begin betimes
   with God, we have more opportunity of serving and enjoying God than
   others have. A man should bear the yoke in his youth,' Lam. iii. If the
   bent of our inclinations were set right in our youth, it would prevent
   much, and hinder the growth of sin. Though a man cannot plant grace in
   his heart--that is the Lord's own work--yet it keeps sin in, and
   prevents inveterate custom, for they will grow upon us; and therefore
   it makes for the. encouragement of you that they should sooner begin
   with God.

   2. It makes for the encouragement of those that have the education of
   youth; as masters of families, parents, and the like. Do not say it is
   too soon for them to learn; no age is too soon for God: 2 Tim. iii. 15,
   Thou hast from thy infancy learned the scriptures.' When we suck in
   religion with our milk, it is a great advantage; those things we keep
   with us that we learn young: Prov. xxii. 6, Train up a child in the way
   he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.' When the
   new vessel is seasoned with this precious liquor, it will keep the
   taste; tender twigs are bent this way when they are as wax, capable of
   any impression.

   Use 3. Caution for young ones. If young men should obtain this benefit,
   to grow wiser than the ancients, notwithstanding this, yet they should
   learn to show reverence to the aged, Job xxxii. 4-6; and then to
   ascribe it to God. Saith he, ver. 8, There is a spirit in man, and the
   inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.' It is not the
   sharpness of our wit, but the inspiration of his grace; he is the
   author of all this wisdom that is wrought in us.

   Use 4. To humble the aged, that have not made conscience of their time
   and ways, and therefore are more blockish than many children: Isa. lxv.
   20, There shall be no more an infant of days, nor an old man that hath
   not filled his days;' old men that are ignorant of the mysteries of
   faith, after they have long sat under the word of God, and had many
   advantages to improve their youth: Heb. v. 12, When for the time ye
   ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be
   the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have
   need of milk, and not of strong meat.' In this sense God is said to
   take away the understanding of the aged; that is, by a just judgment
   for their unfruitfulness and unprofitableness under the means of grace.
   They that are much younger than you are wise in comparison of you, when
   they excel you for ripeness in wisdom, for solidness and settledness in
   manners, in a course of godliness. Those old men that draw near to the
   grave before they have considered either the end wherefore they came
   into the world, or the state into which they shall be translated when
   they go out of it, those are children of one hundred years old, that
   have nothing to reckon age by, but wrinkles and grey hairs.

   Doct. 3. That the way to increase in spiritual understanding is to be
   studious in practical holiness.

   The word, that will give you understanding, will keep you out of all
   snares, sufficiently direct you to true happiness. But how shall we get
   it? Refer it to practice; practise what you know, and you shall know
   more: it must needs be so:--

   1. Because these are such as have God's promise: John vii. 17, If any
   man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
   God, or whether I speak of myself.' They that make conscience of their
   ways, season their course in the fear of God, that take God's direction
   with them, God will tell them, they shall know what doctrine is of God.

   2. They have a greater clearness of mind and understanding, therefore
   must needs discern holy things. Why? Because they are freed from the
   clouds of lust and passion, which do insensibly blind and make them
   stay in generals: Mat. v. 8, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
   shall see God.' Saith Nazianzen, Where there is purity there is
   brightness; where there is a pure heart, there is a great deal more
   clearness in the understanding. Reason and fancy are dark, unless a man
   have a command over his passions and affections; over his passions, of
   anger, fear, grief; and over his affections, of love and joy, and
   appetite towards sensual delights; unless he be able to govern these
   things, he will never truly discern the mind of God for the seasoning
   his course in living a holy life, That of the apostle is notable, 2
   Peter i. 5, Add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to
   knowledge, temperance.' Unless they be able to govern their affections
   in the use of worldly delights, pleasures, and profits, they will never
   have this practical knowledge; and therefore the only way to know
   divine things, as Nazianzen well observes, is conscientiously to keep
   the commandments of God.' If you would know the will of God, do not
   spend your time in heaping up notions, but framing your heart to
   obedience, governing your affections by the fear of God, and suiting
   your hearts to the word of God. Alas! those that seek knowledge out of
   ambition, curiosity, and vain ostentation, and lie under the power of
   vile affections, get but very little true spiritual light; they may
   have the understanding of teachers, but not the understanding to season
   them, and guide them in their communion with God.

   3. The more we practise, the more religion is exemplified and made
   sensible, so that we come to understand more of the sweetness of it;
   and, on the other hand, the more of difficulty is in it when there is
   nothing but bare notions and naked apprehensions. There we have a
   double advantage, an exact rule, and more experience of the sweetness
   of religion: Prov. iii. 17, All her ways are ways of pleasantness.'
   When we practise what we know, then we come to know the sweetness of
   entertaining communion with the Lord; and they know more of the
   difficulty of religion, they know where their hearts are more averse,
   and more in danger: whereas others that soar aloft in notions, and idle
   and lofty speculations, have not this experience.

   4. They that practise, study things with more affection than others,
   mightily help the understanding. The more piety and zeal any man hath,
   the more will the Lord bless his studies. Paul profited in the Jewish
   religion above many of his equals. Why? Gal. i. 14, Being more
   exceedingly zealous of the tradition of my fathers.' A man that hath a
   zeal in anything will profit more than others; so he that hath a zeal
   for the things of God profits above others. A blunt iron, if red hot,
   will pierce through an inch board sooner than a cold tool, though never
   so sharp; so those that have blunt parts in comparison of others, yet
   if they have zeal and good affections, they will pierce deep into the
   mysteries of religion; they that have sharper parts, want the fire of
   zeal.

   5. The more fruitful any grace is, the more doth it abound with us; and
   therefore when your knowledge is fruitful you will find it increased by
   laying out your talents: Col. i. 10, Be fruitful in every good work,
   always increasing in the knowledge of God.' First he presseth knowledge
   in order to practice, then he presseth practice in order to knowledge.
   Saving knowledge is the cause of practice, and it is the effect of it.

   Use 1. Learn how much practice exceeds speculation, and whereby a man's
   understanding is to be valued. Who is to be accounted a spiritual
   understanding man? Not he that hath finer notions, but he that is most
   skilful, and ready to every good work.' Do not content yourselves with
   a few fine opinions well dressed and curiously set forth, for all this
   is nothing to practice. It must needs be so, for practice is the end of
   knowledge. Now the end is always more worthy than the means; all the
   means have their loveliness from their end, and all the means have
   their order and measure from their end; that is, we must so use the
   means that we may come to such an end. Well, then, knowledge is worthy
   for practice sake, and only to be sought after in order to practice;
   not to soar aloft, but we are to be wise to sobriety; nor as wanton
   fancies, such as affect conceits of wit, and empty frothy notions; all
   should be suited to practice.

   Use 2. Again, I might apply it, how ill they do that sever knowledge
   and a good conscience. When the age grew more knowing they were less
   moral in Seneca's time; as it was so with them, so it is with
   Christianity many times. It was the saying of one, When I compare
   former times with ours, times of ignorance, darkness, superstition,
   they had more zeal, we have more light; where there was less knowledge
   there was more practice. Now we have notions like a carbuncle, which
   seems at a distance to be all fire, though it is quite cold; so we seem
   to have high floating notions concerning godliness; the head is stored
   with these, but hearts empty of grace, hands idle, less circumspect,
   more careless and loose, fruitless in good works. It shows us the cause
   why many, that have great dexterity in wit and excellent gifts in other
   things, yet are very stupid and blockish in the things o God. There is
   now a decay of gifts and knowledge. Why? Because professors do riot
   refer all to practice; and then ungodliness and less practice provokes
   the Lord to withdraw the light. God punished the heathens with
   spiritual blindness, because they did not improve their knowledge; and
   we may justly fear it may prove so with us, who are all head, little
   heart; much in speculations, little, very little in practical holiness.

SERMON CVII.

   I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy
   word.--Ver. 101.

   THE great work of a fast-day is to put away the evil of our doings; as
   when a fire is kindled in a house, and begins to rage and burn fiercer,
   it concerns those that would stop the fury of it to remove the
   combustible matter. The fire of God's wrath hath been kindled amongst
   us, and is not yet quenched. I suppose none of you doubt your business
   is to remove the combustible matter, to put away your sins; this
   scripture will be of some use to you to that purpose.

   David had spoken of that wisdom which he had got by the word of God
   above enemies, teachers, ancients. It was not such a wisdom as
   consisted in speculation, but practice; not only such as did enable him
   to talk high, and set his tongue awork. No; it was such as did enable
   him to do things worthy of God, as did set his feet awork. Our feet are
   slow and heavy in God's ways, but very swift to that which is evil; and
   therefore herein did David's wisdom consist, to bridle himself, to
   refrain his feet, that he might not run headlong into all manner of
   evil; and not only so, but that he might be also more ready to that
   which is good: I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I
   might keep thy word.' Where--

   1. We have David's practice, I have refrained my feet from every evil
   way.

   2. His end or motive, that I might keep thy word; that he might be
   exact and punctual with God in a course of obedience.

   1. In his practice. You may note the seriousness of it, I refrained my
   feet.' By the feet are meant the affections: Eccles. v. 1, Keep thy
   foot when thou goest into the house of God.' Our affections, which are
   the vigorous bent of the soul, do engage us to practise, therefore
   fitly resembled by the feet, by which we walk to any place that we do
   desire, so that I refrained my feet;' the meaning is, I keep a close
   and strict hand over my affections, that they might not lead me to sin.
   Then you may note the extent of it. He doth not only say, I refrained
   from evil,' but universally, from every evil way.' But how could David
   say this in truth of heart, because of his offence in the matter of
   Uriah? Ans. This was the usual frame and temper of his soul, and the
   course of his life; and such kind of assertions concerning the saints
   are to be interpreted voce [3] et conatu, licet non semper eventu. This
   was his errand and drift, his purpose and endeavour, his usual course,
   though he had his failings.

   2. What was his motive and end in this? That I might keep thy word;'
   that I might be exact and punctual with God in a course of obedience,
   and adhere to his word uniformly, universally, impartially.

   Doct. He that would keep the word must refrain his feet; that is, stand
   at a great distance in heart and practice from all sin.

   For the illustration of the point observe--

   1. A Christian must do both; he must stand at a distance from sin, and
   he must keep the word. There is a negative and an affirmative part in
   every commandment, precepts and prohibitions; we need both the bridle
   and the spur; the bridle, to refrain the feet from sin; and the spur,
   to quicken us to walk closely with God, according to the direction of
   his holy word. A simple abstinence from sin, without exercising
   ourselves unto godliness, will not serve the turn: Ps. xxxiv. 15,
   Depart from evil, and do good.' So Ps. xxxvii. 27. There is a double
   principle in every renewed man, flesh and spirit, Gal. v. 17; and his
   work is to restrain the one, to keep in the flesh that would fain break
   out, and range abroad in unseemly actions; and to encourage and put
   forth the other, the spirit in its necessary operation, with vigour and
   life. There is a double estate laid before us, heaven and hell;
   therefore we are not only to forbear sin, which is walking to hell, but
   we must walk worthy of God in all well-pleasing, and be fruitful in
   good works, which is our way to heaven, Eph. ii. 10, Forbearing evil,
   and doing good.' The Pharisee's religion ran upon negatives: I am not
   an adulterer, an extortioner,' &c., Luke xviii. 11. Many are not
   vicious rather than godly, they keep themselves in a middle lukewarm
   estate; and though they be not defiled with foul sins, yet do not set
   themselves seriously to serve the Lord.

   2. Both must be done with the whole man, or regarded both in heart and
   practice. It is not enough to leave off evil, but to hate it, nor to do
   good, but we must do it with a love and an affection. Com pare three
   places: Isa. i. 16, Cease to do evil, learn to do well;' Amos v. 15,
   Hate the evil, love the good.' And it is expressed with a further
   emphasis, Rom. xii. 9, Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which
   is good.' These places compared together will show that the outward act
   is not only to be regarded, but the frame of the heart. There should
   not only be an abstinence from the act of sin, but mortifying of the
   love of it; for there are many that outwardly forbear sin, but yet do
   not inwardly hate it. On the other side, we are not only to do good,
   but there must be a love to good; for many may externally do good when
   the heart abhors it. And on. the other side, if there be a love to
   good, God passeth by many failings; it should not be a bare hatred, or
   a cold love, but such as hath life and vehemency in it, abhorring that
   which is evil, and cleaving to that which is good--the soul of Jonathan
   cleaved to David--it must be a knitting love. There is Haman's
   refraining, Esther v. 10, and David's refraining. It is said Haman
   refrained himself, when his heart boiled with rancour and malice
   against Mordecai; and there is David's refraining in the text, I
   refrained my heart from every evil way.' His heart is engaged, when the
   heart cleaves to him, not easily to separate.

   3. Both are regarded, and both with the whole man. Now the one is
   required in order to the other; we must refrain from evil that we may
   do good, and do good that we may refrain from evil; mortification and
   vivification do mutually help each other. The more lively grace is the
   more sin droopeth, the more lively sin is the more is the new nature
   oppressed. Without refraining our feet from evil there is no doing of
   good, for vivification is increased according to the degree of
   mortification: 1 Peter ii. 24, That we, being dead to sin, might be
   alive to righteousness.' As long as we are alive to sin, active and
   delighting in the commission thereof, we are dead to righteousness. But
   now, as the love and life of sin is weakened in our hearts, so is grace
   introduced, and we are quickened and carried on with more strength in
   holy duties; the strength and fervour of the soul is diverted, and runs
   in another channel; the same affections that are carried out to sin,
   the same current and stream of soul that ran out towards our selves,
   then is carried in a way of grace, the same affections, but carried out
   to other objects. And so on the other side, wherever there is an
   affection to good, there will be a cordial detestation to evil; the
   affection to the one will awaken and increase the hatred of the other;
   for still the soul draws that way which our affections carry them.

   4. As the one must be done in order to the other, so our care in the
   first place must be to avoid evil, or to stand at a distance from every
   known sin. He begins with that as necessary to the other; first, I
   refrained my feet,' and then, that I might keep thy law;' he was to be
   more exact in a course of obedience. In planting of grace God keeps
   this method, he roots up the weeds, and then plants us wholly with a
   right seed, and so far as we are active under God in the work, we first
   put off the old man with his deceitful lusts,' and then, put on the new
   man,' Eph. iv. 22. We put off the rags of sin before we put on the
   garments of salvation. The plants of righteousness will not thrive in
   an unhumbled, proud, impenitent heart; therefore God's first work is
   the destruction of sin, and then the introduction of grace. The heart
   is purified for faith, as well as purified by faith. First, It must be
   purified for faith, that being the work of the Spirit of God; for John
   v. 44, How can ye believe that seek honour one of another?' As long as
   any fleshly lust remains unmortified, be it ambition, vain glory,
   affecting honour, reputation, esteem in the world, the heart is not
   purified. Secondly, The heart is purified by faith, Acts xv. 9; more
   and more this corruption is wrought out. And then the heart is purified
   for fear: I will give a new heart,' Jer. xxxii. 40. And then purified
   by fear, as Job feared God, Job i. 1. So the heart is purified for love
   and by love; for love: Deut. xxx. 6, And the Lord will circumcise thine
   heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all
   thine heart and with all thy soul.' A believer is to be considered in
   the act of conversion and in the state of conversion; in the act of
   conversion, so first we turn from evil by a sound remorse: true grace
   is first planted, first purified for grace, then purified by grace: Job
   feared God, then eschewed evil. Preparing grace is implanted in us,
   then it hath an exercise upon us for the weakening of sin more and
   more.

   5. Keeping at a distance from evil; it must be as it is evil and
   contrary to the holy nature and will of God. I observe this, because
   David did not refrain his feet from evil upon any foreign and
   accidental reasons, for fear of men, or any sinister and by respect,
   but merely out of tender love and respect to the law of God, to testify
   his obedience to him: I refrained my feet from every evil way.' And
   what was his motive? That I might keep thy word.' A child of God hates
   sin, as it is contrary to his drift and purpose. If we do not love good
   for good's sake, it is not good we love, but some other thing that
   cleaves to it, the temporal benefit that we think will come thereby. So
   if we do not hate evil as evil, but because of the loss and detriment
   that attends the practice of it, it is not sin that we hate, but
   inconveniences. As Austin saith of the eternal reward, There are many
   non peccare metuunt, sed ardere--they are not afraid to sin, but are
   afraid to be damned. So a natural conscience may upon foreign and
   accidental reasons stand aloof from sin, as a dog may forbear a morsel
   for fear of the cudgel; convinced men may forbear sin out of horror of
   conscience, and not out of any serious dislike of heart against it.
   Briefly, there is custom, education, penalty of law, infamy, shame of
   the world, difficulty of compassing sin, shame in practising. These are
   but accidental reasons, these may make us refrain, they may breed a
   casual dislike, but not a natural hatred; for a gracious refraining
   must be upon a religious reason. David gives an account, not only of
   his practice, but his motive: I refrained my feet from every evil way.'
   And why? That I might keep thy word.'

   6. This refraining must be from every sinful course. The grace of
   justification will teach this, and the grace of sanctification; the
   grace of justification, that pardoneth all sin, will teach us to deny
   all, Titus ii. 12; and the grace of sanctification will teach us to
   deny not one, but all, for that introduceth a settled hatred against
   sin in the soul. Now hatred is pro`s ta` ge'ne, to the whole kind; he
   that hates one sin as sin, hates all sin, as Haman thought scorn to lay
   his hands upon Mordecai alone, but sought to destroy all the seed of
   the Jews, Esther iii. 6. So this hatred is universally carried out
   against all sin. Indeed they do not mortify any sin that do not mortify
   every sin; one lust remaining unmortified keeps the devil's interest
   afoot in the soul. Pharaoh, when the Israelites would have gone, would
   fain have a pawn of their return, their flocks, their herds, or their
   children, that they might be sure to come back again. So Satan, if a
   man be touched in conscience, and will bethink himself, and look after
   religion, if he can get but a pawn, a corner of the heart, one sin, he
   knows his interest is still kept. Herod did many things, but he had his
   Herodias, and that held him fast and sure to Satan. The young man had a
   sense of eternal life upon him, Mat. xix. 22, and he did many things,
   All these have I kept from my youth,' but he was worldly. There are
   certain tender parts in the soul that are loath to be touched; but now
   if we would be sincere with God, we must refrain from every evil way.
   Any one man entertained besides the husband, it breaks the marriage
   covenant; any one sin allowed in the soul, be it never so small, it.
   forfeits our privileges by grace.

   But now, because particulars are more effective, and do strike upon the
   soul with the more smart blow than generals, briefly consider:--

   1. We must refrain from every evil way; not only notorious sins, but
   those that are plausible and of more reputation in the world, that are
   not so rank in the nostrils of men, and expose us to such disgrace and
   dishonour. There are open sins that are found hateful, that have a
   turpitude in them, and bring shame: Gal. v. 19, e'rga tes sarko`s, the
   works of the flesh are manifest;' such as murder, adultery, gross
   oppression, these are rank weeds of an ill savour, that stink in
   nature's nostrils, and are accompanied with shame and disgrace. To
   refrain from these is little thanks, Luke xviii. 11. The Pharisee wipes
   his hand of these, I am not an adulterer,' &c. Ay! but he was proud,
   censorious, and covetous. There are pride, censoriousness,
   covetousness, and worldliness, cloaked sins that are not of such
   disgrace in the world, all these should be hated by you. Many times
   those sins that are majoris infamiae, of greater infamy, are not always
   majoris reatus, they do not leave the greatest guilt upon you. Un
   belief is not infamous in the world, neglect of the gospel of grace,
   want of love to Christ Jesus, these are great sins: and therefore you
   must not only abstain from notorious sins, but those which are more
   plausible, and are not of such ill fame in the world.

   2. You must abstain from sins outward and inward, Isa. lv. 7. The
   sinner must not only forsake his way, but his thought; by his way is
   meant his outward course and practice, but he must make conscience of
   his thoughts, and secret workings of heart. Practices may be over ruled
   by by-ends, but thoughts and desires, these are the genuine immediate
   motions and issues of the soul, that do come immediately out of the
   fountain, and are restrained only by grace.

   3. Sins profitable and pleasant, as well as those that have no such
   allurement and blandishment in them. There are many sins that have
   nothing of allurement in them, that are entertained only upon sin's
   account and evil custom, as rash swearing, blasphemy, malice and the
   like; but there other sins that allure and entice the soul by the
   promise of profit and pleasure, those two bastard goods that do make us
   often quit the good of honesty and duty. Now, you are to deny all
   ungodliness and worldly lusts,' Titus ii. 12; worldly lusts, whatever
   would endanger the soul, all inordinate inclinations that carry you out
   to these things of pleasing the flesh and gratifying worldly interests.

   4. In refraining the feet from every evil way, that is, from sins
   against either table, Rom. i. 18. Mark, God hath owned both tables, not
   only revealed his wrath against ungodliness, breaches of the first
   table; but against unrighteousness, breaches of the second table. Many
   indeed will not be unjust, intemperate, unkind to their neighbours; ay!
   but they express no affection to God by worshipping him in their
   hearts, by faith, fear, and love, or in their houses by constant prayer
   morning and evening, and secret and familiar in closet converses with
   God; they are guilty of ungodliness though not of unrighteousness. And
   there are many that would be much in worship, in praying, fasting, and
   hearing, but they forget their neighbours; they are unrighteous, they
   do not make conscience in their dealings with men, and in the duties of
   their relations are unfaithful, many times to the great dishonour of
   God; they do things heathens would boggle at.

   5. There are great sins and small sins. Many make not conscience of
   small offences, count these venial. Certainly he that would have a
   tender regard to God's law, no sin should seem little to him that is an
   offence to the great God. It is Satan's custom by small sins to draw us
   to greater, as the little sticks do set the great ones on fire, and a
   wisp of straw enkindles a block of wood; and by small sins we are
   enticed by Satan. The least sin allowed of is of a deadly and dangerous
   consequence: Mat. v. 19, Whosoever shall break the least of these
   commandments, and teach men so.' It is treason to coin a penny as well
   as a pound. To break the least of God's commandments, to make no
   conscience of them, because it is a small thing, argues a naughty
   heart. Bodkins may wound and stab as well as swords. Look, as we read
   of the prophet, he was devoured of lions, so we read of Herod, he was
   eaten up by lice. Small sins may be a very great mischief to the soul.
   Little sins are often the mother of great sins, and the grandmother of
   great punishments and of plagues from God; and therefore these lesser
   sins we must refrain from: I kept myself from every evil way.'

   6. We must not commit anything that is evil out of a good intention, if
   it be an evil, but stand at a distance from it. Do not turn aside to
   any crooked path upon any pretence soever. Some have a good action but
   a bad aim. Now these do, as it were, make God serve the devil; they do
   the action which God hath required, but their aim is that which
   gratifies Satan. There are others that have a good aim but a bad
   action. These make the devil serve God, as if God could not provide for
   his own glory well enough without their sin. Therefore, if it be an
   evil way, refrain it, though you think you may bring good out of it.
   Saul would be offering sacrifice, an unwarrantable action for him to
   invade the priestly office, 1 Sam. xiii. 13, 14, He was loath to go to
   battle until he had sacrificed, and would not tarry till Samuel came.
   What then? See what Samuel saith, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast
   not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee.'
   Here was a good aim, but a bad action, and you see how severe judgment
   fell upon him. I say, he forfeited his kingdom by doing an undue
   action, though for a good end. Uzzah he put forth his hand to stay the
   ark, which was an undue circumstance; he had a good aim in it, that the
   ark of God might not be shaken, that it might not fall and be shattered
   in pieces, and the mysteries of their religion prostituted: 2 Sam. vi.
   7, And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote
   him there for his error, and he died.' Many think to bear out
   themselves by good intentions that are drawn into an evil way; they
   hope to bring things to a better pass. It is dangerous to step out of
   God's way; God's ends can best be brought about by God's way. The
   judgments of the Lord upon these nations have been mainly for
   unwarrantable actions upon good intentions; and though usually we have
   committed one sin to help another, yet there hath been a pretence of a
   good intention, a good aim.

   7. We are not only to avoid such sins as seem to lie remote from our
   temper and course of our business and interest, but our own special
   sins; those sins which suit better with our condition, constitution,
   calling, employment: Ps. xviii. 23, I was upright before thee, and kept
   myself from mine iniquity.' Every man hath his iniquity; as every man
   hath his particular temper, so he hath his particular sins, and if he
   belong to God he hath his particular graces. The saints have their
   particular graces; Timothy for abstinence and temperance, Job for
   patience, Abraham for faith, therefore styled the father of the
   faithful; Moses was eminent for meekness. So there are particular sins;
   men are passionate, worldly, voluptuous, ambitious, and as the channel
   is cut, so corrupt nature finds a vent and passage: Isa. liii. 6, All
   we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own
   way.' We are all out of the way, but every man hath a particular way of
   sin. Look, as in the natural body, every man hath all the faculties of
   a man, yet some this faculty more vigorous and lively than other, some
   for memory, judgment, invention, quickness of wit, so it is as to
   particular sins. Now these should be most resisted and most opposed by
   us. The scripture requires of us, Mat. v. 19, To cut off our right
   hand, and pluck out our right eye;' these, if they be not watched, will
   run into scandal; our particular sins make us dishonour God, dishonour
   our profession, and become a reproach to the gospel. It is notable,
   when our Saviour dissuaded from giving scandal, Mat. xviii. 8, 9, he
   revives those sentences of cutting off the right hand and plucking out
   the right eye. These sins will make you a dishonour to the gospel if
   you do not watch over them.

   8. There are the sins of the times wherein we live, vitium seculi.
   Indeed it is hard to keep our ground in a great flood; when a stream is
   strong it is ready to carry us away; but he that would be punctual with
   God should keep from the sins of the times. Peter dissembled with the
   Jews, and the godly Jews fell a-dissembling of their religion, insomuch
   that Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation, Gal. ii. 13.
   When sin seems to be authorised by a general practice, it concerns you
   to stand at a distance, to have nothing to do there. Noah was an
   upright man, feared God, and served him in a corrupt age, Gen. vi. 9.
   They are dead fishes that are carried away with the stream. We are not
   to walk kata` te`n aiona, according to the course of this world,' Eph.
   ii. 2, but to walk according to the rule,' Gal. vi. 16. In many ages
   there are certain sins, until light disprove them, and the Lord clears
   up his will, that men run into, and are carried away by violence of the
   stream, while the stream runs that way in their age. But this will be
   no excuse, you are to be upright, and not carried away by vitium
   seculi, the evil way of the times.

   9. We are not only to refrain our feet from evil, but from all the
   occasions and appearances of evil; and not to stand so much as within
   the scent of a temptation; as crows and ravens, when they are beaten
   away from the carrion, will stand within the scent. We are to stand at
   a great distance from all that seems to tend to sin, not only from
   evil, but the appearance of it, 1 Thes. v. 22. Sin should be so hateful
   to us, that the very picture of it should be abhorred. Many times some
   sins are the occasion of others, as covetousness is occasioned by
   distrust there certainly we are to avoid occasions as well as sins
   themselves. Ay! but if the thing be lawful, and we know our weakness,
   we should not easily ride into the devil's quarters, and run into the
   mouth of temptation. Look, as Solomon in that particular sin adviseth
   the young man, Prov. v. 8, Remove thy way far from her, and come not
   nigh the door of her house.' He would not have the young man venture
   upon the occasion. And God's strictness to the Nazarite is very
   notable, Num. vi. 3, 4, as he was to drink no wine or strong drink, so
   no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, nor drink any liquor of
   grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried; and afterwards he was not so
   much as to eat either the husk or kernel of the grape. Thus God would
   have us stand at a distance. This was a typical figure, to show at how
   great a distance we should stand from sin, and refrain ourselves from
   all evil; as the apostle saith, Hate the garments spotted with the
   flesh,' Jude 23, an allusion to those that touched an unclean thing.
   Bushing upon snares and occasions of evil, we hazard the surprisal of
   our souls. As Caesar said of his wife, Oportet Caesaris uxorem non
   solum castam esse, &c.--she should not only be chaste, but free from
   all suspicion; so God will have his people to be void of suspicion, and
   to be clear and innocent from all kind of transgressions. Thus you see
   how we are to refrain from every evil way.

   The reasons of this are two--(1.) Because sins will weaken our graces;
   (2.) They will weaken our comfort; both which are necessary to the
   keeping of God's law. Therefore, if we would keep the law, and be
   punctual and close with God in a course of obedience, we must stand at
   a great distance in heart and practice from all sin.

   1. Sins will weaken our graces. There are several graces necessary to
   the keeping of God's law, as faith, fear, love, hope. You know, at
   conversion God puts a vital principle into us, that is diversified and
   called by these several names. These graces are planted in us as
   principles of operation, and as these decay, our acts of obedience will
   be more or less; a sickly faith can produce but weak operations; as if
   the root wither and decay, the branches will not long flourish. So when
   our fear and reverence of God is lessened, as it is by every act of
   sin, the spiritual life will not be carried on with that exactness and
   care. So when our love waxeth cold, we will not be so diligent and
   serious, for these are the principles of operations, Rev. iii. 3. When
   they left their first love, they left their first works. If there be a
   decay and diminution of our graces, then there will be an intercession
   of acts and operations; these graces will suffer a shrewd loss; they
   are qualities, and therefore capable of increase and remission, being
   more or less. As love may wax cold, Mat. xxiv. 26; fear may be greater
   or less; so faith; though there be some seed of grace, remains to
   preserve the interest of the soul, yet things may be ready to die and
   faint. How do they decay? By sins. Gal. v. 17. These things are
   contrary--flesh and spirit; that is, always warring upon one another
   and weakening one another; and here lies the Christian's advantage, to
   observe which is up and which is down. By every act of deliberate sin
   the flesh is strengthened and grace weakened; these are up and down in
   a renewed heart; therefore it is good to see which prevails, that you
   may not weaken your strength. If you gratify the flesh, you hearten
   your enemy, and strengthen your clog, and so grace languisheth.

   2. It weakens our comfort. Comfort is necessary to make us lively and
   cheerful in God's service. The Lord knows we drive on heavily when we
   have not that peace of conscience, serenity of mind, and want the
   comforts of God's Spirit. The more our hearts are enlarged the more we
   run the way of God's commandments, Ps. cxix. 32. What is an enlarged
   heart? Chiefly by joy and comfort; it is joy that enlargeth the heart.
   Now sin weakens this joy, this comfort which is our strength. When Adam
   sinned, his soul was filled with horror, Gen. iii. 10; and David, when
   he had been tampering with sin, lost his comfort: Ps. li. 8, Make me to
   hear of joy and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may
   rejoice;' and ver. 12, Restore to me the joy of thy salvation.' He that
   pricks himself with a needle or sharp thing must needs feel pain; so
   whosoever gives way to sin. certainly will have trouble of soul,
   confusion, grief, fear, sorrow, and loseth his sense of salvation for a
   time, and sins away his peace. Always the more exact our walking, the
   more is our peace of conscience: 2 Cor. i. 12, This is our rejoicing,
   the testimony of our conscience,' &c. Well, then, if we would be
   punctual with God, we see how much it concerns us to stand at a
   distance from every evil way.

   Use 1. To show how far they are from a course of obedience that live
   under a full power of their sins. Never think you seek after that which
   is good while your evil scent remains with you, and your former evils
   are in life and strength to this very day. All those that wallow in
   brutish sins of drunkenness and adultery, so those that are guilty of
   common swearing, Sabbath-breaking, and such like gross sins, these have
   good thoughts of themselves, they have sincerity towards God; but such
   have a spot that is not the spot of God's people. Twice there is a
   caution interposed that such should not be deceived, 1 Cor. vi. 9; Eph.
   vi. 6. You will say, Where lies the danger of any deceit? The worst are
   apt to deceive their own hearts. There is a world of these deceivings
   in the hearts of men; the best of saints have fallen into as great
   sins. They think these are but petty slips and human infirmities, and
   God's patience will suffer all; grace will pardon all at length, and no
   man is perfect; therefore they have some hopes to even those that are
   drunkards, adulterers, and abusers of themselves with man kind; though
   their sins be as Sodom, those that fall into the grossest sins; they
   are apt to be deceived. Be not deceived; these things are not
   consistent with grace.

   2. It shows how far they are from the temper of God's children that are
   not punctual with God in a course of obedience, that hate one kind of
   evil, not another. Many hate prodigality, yet not covetousness; hate
   covetousness, and are given up to sensuality; hate an epicure, and such
   a one as squanders away his estate, think as evil of him as can be, but
   not hard hearts, such as shut up their bowels, and do no good in their
   places j and some hate sensuality, but not pride, but cherish that;
   there is some sweet bit under his tongue, as Zophar speaks, Job xx. 12.
   Christians! though we can subdue no sin as we should, yet we are to
   resist every sin, and especially to bend all the force and strength of
   your souls against your sins, that sin which is most apt to prevail
   with you: this is a sign of uprightness, Ps. xviii. 23. And therefore,
   if you would know whether you have given up yourselves to walk with
   God, to keep his word, what labouring hath there been with your own
   hearts? what pains have you taken to set against your own sins? are you
   most jealous of it, pray most against it, often turn the edge of the
   word upon it? are you observing the decays, or do you keep it under the
   tongue? Reason with yourselves upon the world to come; is it reserved
   corruption or remaining corruption? Have you never been dealing with
   your hearts to suppress such a corrupt inclination as you have been
   often foiled with?

   Use 2. To press those that would be exact with God, to stand at a
   distance in heart and practice from every known sin; whatever urging
   and solicitations you have within yourselves, though it would break
   out, yet have you refrained. To this end let me commend two graces and
   two duties. The two graces are love to God and his word, and fear to
   God and his word.

   For the graces:--

   1. A love to God, a love to the word of God. A love to God: Ps. xcvii.
   10, Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.' It is as natural and as kindly
   to the new nature to hate the chiefest evil, as it is to love the
   chiefest good. Do you talk of love and communion with God, and never
   exercise yourselves in refraining your feet from every evil way?
   Certainly if you have any love to God, you will hate that which God
   hates; for idem velle et nolle, to will and nill the same things, that
   is true friendship; therefore if God be your friend, you will hate as
   he hates, that which makes a breach between you and God, and makes you
   grow shy of God, and lose your familiarity with him. As love to God, so
   love to his word: Ps. cxix. 113, I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I
   love.' Certainly if a man hath a love to the law, he will not only hate
   sin in practice, but vain thoughts, what tends to breaking the law in
   his thoughts, any lesser contrariety, contradiction, or defiance of
   God's law; for our hatred is engaged by love. Well, get this love, set
   it a-work, improve it by reason (for every affection is fed by
   discourses of the mind). All sins are set a-work by some discourse, so
   graces are set a-work by discoursings of our minds. Now set this love
   a-work. Oh! shall I, that have tasted so much of the love of God, or
   that do pretend to love God and Christ, and enjoy communion with him,
   yield to follow sin? Ezra ix. 13, What I after such a deliverance as
   this, should we again break thy commandment?' When God hath delivered
   us, not only out of Babylon, but, you may say, out of hell, how should
   we set love a-work? The great instance of God's love was the giving his
   Son: 1 John iv. 9, 10, Herein is love,' &c. Now, then, if God hate and
   resist sin, reason and argue from this love: What! shall God give his
   Son for me, and I not spare a lust for God? When God did not stand upon
   his Son, that was so dear and precious to him, shall I stand upon my
   sin? What! shall Christ die for me, to ransom me from hell? is this my
   kindness to my friend? Cyprian brings in Satan pleading thus, as
   vaunting against Christ: I never spilt one drop of blood, my back was
   never mangled with whips and scourges, I never had a heaven to bestow
   upon them; yet among all thy beneficiaries, show me any so busy,
   painful, diligent, exact in thy service, as these are in mine. Thou
   hast shed thy blood, and endured a painful and an accursed death for
   them; yet they are not so dutiful to thee as to me. You see whereto
   this tends; and shall Christ do so much for us, and we not deny our
   lusts for him? Surely if we have any sense of the love of Christ Jesus,
   it will work this hatred, this abhorrency and refraining ourselves from
   every evil way. Thus set love a-work.

   2. Another grace is a fear of God and his word. A fear of God: Prov.
   viii. 13, The fear of the Lord is to depart from evil;' Job i. 1, Job
   feared God, and eschewed evil.' Surely a fear of God will make you
   refrain yourselves from every evil way. And not only so, but a fear of
   his word, that is useful: Prov. xiii. 12, He that feareth a commandment
   shall be rewarded.' It is not said he that fears a judgment, but he
   that fears a commandment. If the word stands in his way, it is more
   than if all the inconveniences in the world stand in his way. This also
   should be improved by holy reasoning and discourse. You may reason as
   Joseph: The Lord seeth me, and how can I do this wickedness and sin
   against God?' Gen. xxxix. 9. Shall I break the Lord's laws before his
   face? What! when my heavenly father hath forbidden me? The sons of
   Jonadab the son of Rechab, Jer. xxxiv. 5, 6, they were afraid to drink
   wine when the prophet brought pots before them. No, we dare not; our
   father hath commanded us the contrary. Their father was dead, and could
   not take cognisance of their actions, to call them to account for
   breaking the rule of the institution; but there was an awe upon them.
   But our Father's eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth.
   Therefore when you are tempted to sin and folly, say, I dare not; God
   hath commanded me in his word to the contrary. Set fear a-work; here is
   a commandment stands in my way; the great God he sees all things, and
   will one day call us to an account.

   The two duties into which these graces do run and issue themselves are
   watchfulness and resistance. Watchfulness; we are poor creatures, in
   the midst of snares, very easily may miscarry, partly through our
   constitution; there is flesh as well as spirit, and the flesh doth
   always stir, and not lie idle. Old sins, that seemed to be laid asleep,
   may easily waken again. The devil suits the bait to the season and
   affections we are under, as angels furnish their hook with a proper
   bait. Oh! saith Bernard, here are fears, there snares; that which
   pleases is apt to tempt me, that which frightens is apt to terrify me.
   What should a poor creature do? Be watchful, stand upon your guard,
   that you be not surprised by the craft of Satan, that you may not
   swallow the hook when he sets the bait to your appetite. And then
   powerful resistance of evil, that sin may not prevail, and we more and
   more drawn off from God. Do not yield a little; smaller sins make way
   for greater; when the gap is once open, it is wider and wider; if sin
   be not stifled at first, it will increase.

SERMON CVIII.

   I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.--Ver.
   102.

   IN the former verse he had spoken of his vigilancy against evil, as the
   result of that wisdom which he got by the word; now he speaketh of his
   constant adherence to God's direction. Here you may take notice of two
   things--(1.) David's exactness and constancy in obedience, I have not
   departed from thy judgments. (2.) The reason of it, for thou hast
   taught me.

   Branch 1. By misphalim, judgments, is meant God's law, for thereby he
   will judge the world. And the word departed not intimateth both his
   exactness and constancy; his exactness, that he did not go an
   hair's-breadth from his direction: Deut. v. 32, Ye shall observe to do
   what the Lord your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to
   the right hand or to the left.' And his constancy is employed in it;
   for then we are said to depart from God and his law when we fall off
   from him in judgment and practice, Jer. xxxii. 40.

   Branch 2. God's institution and continual instincts. The Septuagint,
   enomothe'tesa's me; and thence the vulgar, Legem posuisti mihi--thou
   hast given me that law; and so the reason would be drawn from God's
   authority; but rather it is meant of his internal illumination and
   constant direction. Observe--

   1. A man that would show love to the word must show it by a constant
   and exact adherence to the directions thereof, whatever temptations he
   meet with to the contrary. David produceth this as one evidence of that
   affection in the first verse of this section or part: Oh, how I love
   thy law!' I shall show you--

   1. What temptations there are to the contrary.

   2. What reason there is to be exact and constant. First, What
   temptations to the contrary.

   1. From the natural instability of our own hearts; nothing is so
   changeable as man. We have certain heats for the present, but we soon
   cool again; and when temptations arise, are carried off from God, and
   that exactness and care that we were wont to show in our obedience to
   him. What was said of Reuben is true of every man in some degree, Gen.
   xlix. 4, Unstable as water.' It is carried hither and thither, in
   various and uncertain motions. So are we up and down, off and on,
   ebbing and flowing, not steadfast in any good frame; some times seen to
   have strong motions towards God and holiness, but anon grow cold and
   careless, or as a bird is now upon the top of a tree, by and by upon
   the under branches, and then upon the ground. Such a different posture
   or spirit may every one observe in himself, and some times in the same
   duty. God is always the same, and so are his ways; they have the same
   loveliness which they had before, but we are not; always the same. The
   rock standeth where it did, but the waters flow to and again. The least
   blast of a temptation maketh us break off our course. Now this natural
   levity of spirit is a great hindrance to us. We do not always see with
   the same eyes, nor have we the same degree of affection. You did run
   well, who hindered you?' Gal. v. 7. There may be a ready forwardness,
   and yet a great defection afterwards. This uncertainty is not only at
   first, before, we are settled by grace, or have any sound acquaintance
   with God's ways. Then it is most, James i. 8. But after conversion it
   remaineth with us in part. Those measures of affection and zeal which
   we once obtained are not constant with us, but suffer some notable
   decay, and our edge is often taken off and blunted. Especially our
   first love is not of long standing, and our after-carriage not
   answerable to our promising beginnings. Now, there is no satisfying
   reason for this change, why we should make a halt, and grow remiss and
   lag in the profession of godliness, and leave off our first works;
   nothing but our changeableness of spirit.

   2. From the furious oppositions and malice of Satan and his
   instruments.

   [1.] Satan pursueth after men that would cleave to God's ways, as
   Pharaoh did after the Israelites; either to bring them back again, or
   to weary them and vex them, and make their present course uncomfortable
   to them. Now, the violent assault of multiplied temptations is apt to
   make us stagger and depart from that good course that we have
   propounded to ourselves; as the Israelites were running back to Egypt
   because of the inconveniences of the wilderness. But it should not be
   so; a Christian should stand his ground, Whom resist, steadfast in the
   faith; knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your
   brethren that are in the world,' 1 Peter v. 9. They that make
   conscience of their duty, and are most set to serve and honour God,
   must reckon upon the hottest battle, and sorest conflict from Satan, to
   hinder or discourage them therein: he watcheth all advantages, and is
   still in action against them. Now this should not shake us, or loosen
   our adherence to the truths of the gospel; for so it is with every one
   that goeth to heaven: he must be watching, praying, striving. Yielding
   is not the way to be quiet, but resisting; if you yield to him in the
   least, he will carry you farther and farther, till he hath left thee
   under a stupefied or terrified conscience: stupefied till thou hast
   lost all thy tenderness. A stone at the top of a hill, when it
   beginneth to roll down, ceaseth not till it come to the bottom. Thou
   thinkest it is but yielding a little, and so by degrees art carried on,
   till thou hast sinned away all thy profession, and all principles of
   conscience, by the secret witchery of his temptations: and of the other
   side, terrified, till thy peace, comfort, and sweet sense of God's love
   be gone; and thou brought under the black horrors of a dreadful
   despair. Therefore a stout and peremptory resistance is the only means
   of safety. Consider, your case is not singular, your lot is no harder
   than the rest of God's children therefore do not depart from God.

   [2.] Satan's instruments may rage against us, and yet we must not
   depart: Ps. xliv. 17, 18, All this is come upon us, yet have we not
   forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant: our
   heart is not turned back, neither hath our steps declined from thy
   way.' All this! What? Scorn, disgrace, bloody, cruel, reproved,
   maligned, butchered, yet steadfast with God in the profession of the
   faith. Hazards and troubles are no excuse; this is but a time to show
   our love to God, our duty to God is the same still.

   3. From the example of others, especially who are of esteem for
   godliness. Example hath a mighty force upon men. Man is a ductile
   creature; like sheep, they run for company; not what we ought to do,
   but what others do. There are three reasons--of natural corruption, the
   flesh, the devil. But first, example of others: Eph. ii. 2, In time
   past ye walked according to the course of this world.' The universal
   corrupt course and custom of those among whom we live is a great snare.
   Te follow a multitude to do evil is a strong excitement, but no
   sufficient excuse, especially of good men. They that are gracious may
   stagger strangely in reeling times, and be overtaken with dangerous
   mistakes. Now their sins authorise others, and draw them into the
   snare: Gal. ii. 12, Carried away with their dissimulation.' A strong
   stream or current impetuously doth carry all things away with it. They
   take all for current that they do, without examining their actions, and
   so run away from the rule by their errors.

   4. From the providence of God, which may seem to be against those that
   are exact right, or the sure way pointed out to us in his word, two
   ways:--

   [1.] In the manifold disappointments as to his favouring a good cause;
   their endeavours blasted, many troubles befall them. God's people are
   often put to trials by God himself, to try the sincerity of their love.
   Blind Bartimeus rebuked by the disciples: Mark x. 48, Many charged him
   that he should hold his peace, but he cried the more a great deal, Thou
   Son of David, have mercy upon me.' And so Christ to the woman of
   Canaan, Mat. xv. 22-27, puts her off. And are not we put to such trials
   in these latter times? When we own him, God seemeth to put us off;
   providence appeareth with a doubtful face. They that take to the better
   part may be reduced to great straits; therefore sometimes it may happen
   to the righteous according to the work of the wicked, and to the wicked
   according to the work of the righteous,' Eccles. viii. 4. So variously
   doth God dispense external good and evil, and may seem to frown upon
   those that are faithful now; yet we should not depart from his
   judgments: Job xiii. 14, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him.'
   We should wrestle through many disappointments here, or hereafter God
   will not own us.

   [2.] By giving success to a wrong party, that layeth claim to him, to
   his favour in an evil way, and interpret when his providence seems to
   be an approbation of an evil course. It is a great temptation. God's
   choicest servants have been staggered by it; yet it is but a
   temptation: Ps. l. 21, I kept silence, and thou thoughtest that I was
   altogether such an one as thyself.' God may hold his hand, though they
   strangely transform him in their thoughts, and entitle their actions to
   his patronage. God trieth you: Deut. xiii. 2, 3, The Lord your God
   proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God, with all your
   heart and with all your soul.' God's word is so clear and satisfactory,
   that by a righteous judgment he may permit it, to try our steadfastness
   and obedience, not as chaff, but as solid grain. But must we not regard
   providences? Yes, but not interpret them against the word, but with it.
   It is comfortable to see the word backed with a providence, Rom. ii.
   18; Heb. ii. 2; and Hosea vii. 12; when the word is made good, and they
   feel that which they would not believe. Not interpret it against the
   word. Providence is never against the word; it is an exact comment upon
   it, if we had eyes to see it; and when we see it altogether we shall
   find it so. But now we view it by pieces, and so mistake: Rom. viii.
   28, For we know that all things work together for good to them that
   love God, to them who are called according to purpose;' Ps. lxxiii. 17,
   Until I went into the sanctuary, then understood I their ends.' When we
   look to the end of things, all hazards are over.

   Secondly, The reasons why we must be exact and constant, not
   withstanding these temptations. I will name but two, implied in the two
   words of the text, Thy judgments'--(1.) It is God's word; (2.) God's
   word is judgment.

   1. It is God's direction, who cannot deceive or be deceived; you may
   venture your soul's temporal and eternal estate, and all upon it, upon
   God's bare word; for it is impossible for him to lie in his promises,
   Heb. vi. 18, or to be deceived in his directions. The word of the Lord
   is a pure rule: 1 John ii. 27, The unction teacheth you all things, and
   is truth, and is no lie.' There is no erring while we walk by this
   direction, the Spirit of God teaching us by his word; and in deed this
   is the effect of that great faith, to believe God upon his bare word,
   to believe what he hath spoken is true, and to act accordingly. If this
   were rooted in our hearts, we should not be so unstable, so easily
   foiled by Satan, discouraged by the oppositions of evil men, or live by
   example, but by rule, and would interpret the providence of God to the
   advantage, and not the prejudice of obedience: Whom resist, steadfast
   in the faith,' 1 Peter v. 9. Adhere to the truth of the word: I know
   here is my direction, and in the issue will be my safety and happiness.
   But either we do not believe this is God's word, or do not urge the
   heart with God's authority and veracity, and therefore we are up and
   down. But now, when we determine this is God's word, and so receive it,
   1 Thes. ii. 13, When ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us,
   ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word
   of God.' And then it is my rule; whatever it cost me. There you urge
   the heart with the authority of God, Mat. xvi. 24: a resolute giving up
   ourselves to God's direction, and to receive the law from his mouth.
   And it is a certain rule, whatever cross accidents fall out, it should
   be received with such certainty and absolute authority as nothing
   should move us. So assured of it, that if an angel should preach any
   other doctrine, let him be accursed,' Gal. i. 8; 2 Tim. iii. 16; and 2
   Peter i. 2. When it is believed to be the Lord's mind, it is a sure
   ground for faith to rest upon; it is not a doctrine found out by the
   wit of man, no private invention of others, but God's inspiration. God
   hath wisdom to direct me the safest way, and goodness and faithfulness
   enough not to mislead me: Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will
   he teach sinners in the way,' Ps. xxv. 8. It is not the devices of
   their heads that wrote it, but the public mind of God. And saith the
   apostle, Knowing this first;' this is the first and supreme principle:
   he had said, ver. 19, that we should consult with the word for
   direction and comfort before we can get any saving light or true
   comfort.

   2 It is judgments. Every man's doom is contained in the word, and if
   you can but stay a little, you shall see it verified by sensible and
   plain experiences. Do but wait and observe how God maketh good his
   promises, and accomplished his threatenings, and you will see no cause
   to depart; you will find you have done right in the issue, and that
   close obedience is the only way of safety and happiness here and
   hereafter. David did so as to his own case: Ps. xviii. 21, I have kept
   the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.' And
   was he a loser by it? No; God hath recompensed me according to the
   cleanness of my hands.' On the other side, those that depart from God
   are destroyed; his word will be made good against them: Ps. cxix. 119,
   Thou puttest away the wicked of the earth like dross.'

   Use 1. Direction to us both in public and private cases. Be sure you
   follow such ways as God's word doth allow, for otherwise it is not
   constancy, but obstinacy; and then whatever troubles and
   discouragements you meet with, this will be a comfort to you, that you
   are in God's way.

   First, As to your private case, be not discouraged by the instability
   of your heart and the temptations of Satan. You will be up and down
   with God; but observe these two rules:--

   1. It is necessary to watch against your first declinings, lest by
   little and little the heart be stolen away from God. When you lose your
   savour of holy things, lessen your diligence, and are not so exact and
   watchful, you begin to depart from God. The gap once made in the
   conscience groweth wider and wider every day. The first declinings are
   a cause of all the rest; remitting your watch and spiritual fervour, by
   degrees you do not walk with such a straight foot: he that looketh to
   the house to keep it tight and in constant repair, prevents the fall of
   it.

   2. If through our infirmity we miscarry at any time, we must not
   persist in a wrong course, but reclaim speedily, not depart wickedly,
   Ps. xviii. 21, not lie in the dirt when we have caught a fall. There is
   a departing out of infirmity, and a departing wickedly. A candle
   sucketh light if presently kindled again; the longer we lie in our sins
   the worse; the more care, the more speedy, the more likely to succeed,
   when there is any breach between us and God; not lie in it.

   Secondly, As to public actions. We live in changeable times, but it is
   well that we have a sure rule; this may stablish your hearts. If
   governed by sense and interest, with what a gracious face shall we
   appear to the world? Though you meet with troubles for being exact and
   punctual as to principles of conscience, and many disappointments from
   God, yet in the issue that will be found to be the best course for you
   and yours. Now, when you see your duty, for which you must consult both
   with word and Spirit, take heed of two things:--

   1. Unbelief: Heb. iii. 12, Take heed lest there be in any of you an
   evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.' The cause of
   apostasy is unbelief; they do not look upon God's directions as
   judgments. Men that look to the present face of things cannot see
   things to come, and so miscarry. Hezekiah, in the midst of dangers and
   difficulties, was steady to God: 2 Kings xviii. 5, 6, He trusted in the
   Lord God of Israel: he clave to the Lord, and departed not from
   following him, but kept his commandments, which the Lord commanded
   Moses.' Every duty hath a sanction, invested with promises and
   threatenings; therefore, as there needeth obedience to make conscience
   of the precept, so faith to believe the sanction, which doth enliven
   the duty, and keep our hearts under the awe of it.

   2. Mortification; for till there be an indifferency to all events in
   temporal things, we shall ever be departing and turning off from God;
   sometimes allured out of our obedience, sometimes affrighted out of it;
   therefore, till dead to worldly accidents and interests, we are easily
   turned out of the way: Heb. xii. 13, Lest that which is lame be turned
   out of the way;' that which is lame, feeble, and fearful. Good men may
   be carried away thus, as Peter. Too weak and inconstant are the best of
   men; the least blast of temptation will make them leave off the course
   of well-doing, and, without respect had to conscience or credit, openly
   desert it. For fear of man's offence Peter slipped from his duty. Fear
   of losing applause, or incurring hatred with men; maketh us venture on
   God's dishonour; unmodified lusts make us more tender of ourselves than
   of God.

   Second point. That divine teaching causeth constancy; for therefore
   David saith, I departed not, for thou hast taught me.' Here--

   1. What it is to be taught of God; it is often spoken of in scripture:
   Isa. liv. 13, All thy children shall be taught of the Lord'; John vi.
   45, All taught of God.' Now God teacheth outwardly by his word, but
   inwardly by his Spirit; these two must not be severed. Our hearing is
   necessary: Eph. iv. 21, If so be ye have heard him, and have been
   taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus;' the ordinary means of hearing
   him preached, and set forth in the gospel and public ministry, and by
   that means doth Christ make use of it to teach us by his Spirit. So
   John vi. 45, Heard and learned of the Father;' it doth not seclude a
   teaching ministry in the gospel; but it is said, 1 Thes. iv. 9, Ye
   yourselves are taught of God to love one another;' and 1 John ii. 27,
   But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you; and ye
   need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you
   of all things, and is truth, and is no lie; and even as it hath taught
   you, ye shall abide in him.' It is a rhetorical insinuation, the
   negative to be understood comparatively; man's teaching is nothing to
   what you have already by the Spirit. On the other side, much more doth
   it not exclude the Spirit, upon whom the efficacy dependeth. God
   teacheth by men, but the effect is from his grace: Mark xvi. 20, They
   went forth preaching the word, the Lord working with them;' 1 Cor. iii.
   6, Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God giveth the increase.' The
   internal efficacy worketh by external means: Docet Spiritus Sanctus,
   sed per verbum, saith Ferus, docent apostoli; sed per co-operationem
   Spiritus Sancti--God worketh in and by the means.

   2. Inwardly God teacheth two ways--(1.) By common illumination; (2.)
   Special operation.

   1. Common illumination, barely enlightening the mind to know or
   understand what he propoundeth by his messengers. So Rom. i. 20, God
   showed it to the heathen, For the invisible things of him from the
   creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
   that are made, even his eternal power and godhead; so that they are
   without excuse.'

   2. But then, by way of special operation, effectually inclining the
   will to embrace and prosecute duties so known: Jer. xxxi. 33, I will
   put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.' This
   way of teaching is always effectual and persuasive. Now in this sense
   they are taught of God, that they do not only get an ear to hear, but a
   heart to understand, learn, and practise.

   Secondly, Why this teaching is the ground of constancy.

   1. They that are thus taught of God see things more clearly than others
   do: God is the most excellent teacher. One man seeth a thing by
   candlelight, another by daylight; he seeth most clearly that seeth by
   noonday. The light of the Spirit doth clearly manifest things, both
   object and faculty. The unction teacheth us all things, 1 John ii. 20,
   2 Cor. iii. 18.--a distinct, clear, abiding light. Carnal men are
   blind, 2 Peter i. 9. How sharp-sighted soever in other things, yet
   blind; they do not see so as to affect their hearts.

   2. They know things more surely, and with certainty of demonstration;
   whereas others have but dubious conjectures, and loose and wavering
   opinions about the things of God: John vi. 69, We believe, and are sure
   that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God;' John xvii. 8,
   Known surely that I came out from thee.' The many temptations and
   assaults we meet with need such a certain apprehension.

   3. This teaching is so efficacious and powerful, as that the effect
   followeth: Ps. lxxxvi. 11, Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy
   truth;' 1 Cor. ii. 4. It is a lovely teaching, causing us to cleave to
   what is taught.

   4. God reneweth this teaching, and is always at hand to guide us, and
   give counsel to us, which is cause of our standing. We need this
   continual teaching to keep us mindful, that we may not forget things
   known. The Spirit puts us in remembrance, because of the decay of
   fervency, and dulness of spirit that groweth upon us; therefore are
   truths revived to keep us fresh and lively, that we may not neglect our
   duty. Because of incogitancy and heedlessness we mistake our way, and
   are apt to run into sin in the time of trial and temptation. Therefore
   we need a monitor on all occasions, Isa. xxx. 31, that we may not be
   carried away with the corrupt bent of our own hearts. Well, then, this
   abiding in us is the cause of perseverance, 1 John ii. 27.

   Use. To show the reason of men's fickleness and inconstancy, both in
   opinion and practice. He that is led by man unto man, both as to
   opinion and practice, may be led off by man again, when we take up
   truth upon tradition and human recommendation. Oh! seek it of God: Isa.
   xlviii. 17, I am the Lord your God, that teacheth you to profit.' Not
   our own ability, but the light of the Holy Ghost; wait upon God, learn
   something of him every day, and give God all the glory.

SERMON CIX.

   How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my
   mouth.--Ver. 103.

   IN this verse you have another evidence of David's affection to the
   word, and that is the incomparable delight which he found therein, as
   being suitable to his taste and spiritual appetite. This pleasure and
   delight he found in the word is propounded--(1.) By way of
   interrogation or admiration, How sweet are thy words unto my taste!' As
   if he said, So sweet that I am not able to express it. (2.) By way of
   comparison, Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.' To external sense
   nothing is sweeter than honey; honey is not so sweet to the mouth and
   palate as the word of God is to the soul. It is usual to express the
   affections of the mind by words proper to the bodily senses, as taste
   is put here for delight, and elsewhere eating is put for believing and
   digesting the truth: Thy word was sweet, and I did eat it,' Jer. xv.
   16. Again, in all kind of writers, both profane and sacred, it is usual
   to compare the excellency of speech to honey. The poet describes an
   eloquent man, that his speech flowed from him sweeter than honey. And
   the like we may observe in scripture: Prov. xvi. 24, Pleasant words are
   as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.' He means
   words of wisdom, such words as come from a pure heart; now these are
   sweeter than honey. So the spouse; because of her gracious doctrine, it
   is said, Cant. iv. 11, Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb:'
   and Ps. xix. 10, More to be desired are they than gold; yea, than much
   fine gold: sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.' For profit, he
   esteemed them more than gold; for pleasure, more than honey or the
   honeycomb. And David saith here, Thy words are sweet unto my taste.' He
   doth not say in general, They are sweet unto the taste, but sweet unto
   my taste. Holy men, that have much communion with God, such as David
   was, they that have his Spirit, find this delight in the word of God;
   nothing so sweet, or so full of pleasure to the soul. Two points:--

   1. That there is such a thing as spiritual taste.

   2. That to a spiritual taste the word of God is sweeter than all
   pleasures and delights whatsoever.

   Doct. 1. That there is such a thing as spiritual taste.

   I shall show that it is, and what it is; the use of it, and what is
   requisite to it.

   First, It appears that there is such a thing; the soul hath its senses
   as well as the body. We do not only know, but feel things to be either
   hurtful or comfortable to us; so the new nature doth not only know it,
   but doth seem to feel it, that some things are hurtful, and others are
   comfortable to it; and hence the apostle's expression, Heb. v. 14, Such
   have their senses exercised, to discern both good and evil.'
   Christians, if there be such a thing as spiritual life, certainly there
   must be spiritual sense; for all life is accompanied with a sense of
   what is good or evil for that life, and the higher the life the greater
   the sense. Beasts feel more than a plant when hurt is done to them,
   because they have a nobler life, and a man than a beast; and the life
   of o-race being above the life of reason, there is a higher sense
   joined with it and therefore the pain and pleasure of that life is
   greater than the pain or pleasure of any other life; for spiritual
   things, as they are greater in themselves, so they do more affect us
   than bodily: A wounded conscience, who can bear it?' Prov. xviii. 14.
   What a sense doth the evil of the spiritual life leave upon the soul!
   And then for the comforts of the spiritual life, the joys and pleasures
   of it are unspeakable and glorious, 1 Peter i. 8, such joy as no tongue
   or words can sufficiently express. A taste of the first-fruits of
   glory, how sweet is it! Briefly, let me tell you there are three
   internal senses spoken of in scripture--seeing, tasting, and feeling.
   Sight implies faith: John viii. 56, Abraham rejoiced to see my day;'
   and Heb. xi. 27, By faith Moses saw him that was invisible.' There is a
   seeing not only with the eyes of the body, but with the eyes of the
   mind, things that cannot be seen with the outward sense: Abraham saw my
   day,' at so great a distance. As there is sight, so also taste; which,
   if we refer it to good, is nothing else but spiritual experience of the
   sweetness of God in Christ, and the benefits which flow from communion
   with him: Ps. xxxiv. 8, Oh, come, taste and see that the Lord is
   gracious.' Do not only come and see, but come and taste. The third
   sense is feeling or touch; that relates to the power of grace: Phil.
   iii. 10, That I might know him, and the power of his resurrection,' &c.
   There is a sense that a Christian hath of the power of grace and of
   Christ upon his soul; so 2 Tim. iii. 5, Having a form of godliness, but
   denying the power thereof.' When men resist the force and virtue of
   that religion which they profess, then they are said to deny the power
   of those principles. Well, then, there are spiritual senses.

   Now, that we might know what they are, let me show--

   1. How these spiritual senses differ from the external.

   2. That in some sense they differ from the understanding.

   1. These spiritual senses differ from the external sense; that I shall
   prove by three arguments:--

   [1.] Because in those things that are liable to external sense, a man
   may have an outward sense of them when he hath not an inward.

   [2.] There are certain things that cannot be discerned by external
   senses, yet a Christian may have a feeling of them by internal sense.

   [3.] The outward senses sometimes set the inward senses awork.

   [1.] Because in those things which are liable to external sense, a man
   may have an outward sense of them when he hath not an inward, as in
   seeing, tasting, touching.

   In seeing: Deut. xxix. 2, compared with ver. 4, Ye have seen all that
   the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt; and yet the Lord
   hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to
   hear unto this day.' They saw, yet had not a heart to see; they saw
   those wonders with the eyes of their body; they had a sense out ward
   and natural, but not a sense inward and spiritual.

   So for taste; there is a taste of God's goodness in the creature; all
   taste it by their outward senses: Ps. cxlv. 9, The Lord is good to all,
   and his tender mercies are over all his works.' The wicked are not
   excepted from his taste; for the creatures are as useful for the
   preservation of their lives, as the lives of others. They do not mind
   God's love in it, and so do rather taste the creature, than God's
   goodness in the creature; but the child of God tasteth his love
   therein. The fly finds no honey in the flower, but the bee doth. A
   fleshly palate relisheth only the gross pleasure of the creature, not
   that refined delight which a spiritual palate hath, who hath a double
   sweetness; it doth not only receive the creature for its natural use,
   but it tastes God, and feels the love of God in the conscience as well
   as the warmth of the creature in his bowels.

   So for feeling: Jer. iii. 25, We lie down in our shame, and our
   confusion covereth us; for we have sinned against the Lord our God.'
   Men may feel the blows of his providence, and be sensible of the
   natural inconvenience, yet they have not a spiritual feeling so as to
   be affected with God's displeasure, and have a kindly impression left
   upon the soul, that may make them return to God.

   [2.] It differs from the outward senses, because they can by a
   spiritual sense discern that which cannot be discerned by the outward
   sense; as in that place, Heb. xi. 27, By faith Moses saw him that was
   invisible;' see the invisible God, and are as much affected with his
   eye and presence as if he were before the eyes of the body, as others
   are awed by the presence of a worldly potentate; this is matter of
   internal sense. So for taste; they have meat which the world knows not
   of, invisible comforts, John iv. 37. They have hidden manna to feed
   upon, and are as deeply affected with a sense of God's love, and hopes
   of eternal life, as others are with all outward dainties. Then as to
   feeling; many things the outward sense cannot discern; sometimes they
   feel spiritual agonies, heartbreakings: when all is well and sound
   without, a man would wonder what they should be troubled about, that
   abound in wealth and all worldly comforts and accommodations. They have
   an inward feeling, they feel that which worldly men feel not; when they
   are afflicted in their spirits, carnal comforts can work nothing upon
   them; when they are afflicted outwardly, spiritual comforts ease their
   heart. And as they feel soul agonies and soul comforts, so they feel
   the operations of the spiritual life; they have a feeling of the power
   of the Spirit working in them; they live, and know that they live, Now
   no man knows that he lives but by sense; therefore if a child of God
   knows he lives, he hath internal sense as well as external. We know we
   live naturally by natural sense, and we know we live spiritually by
   spiritual sense: Gal. ii. 20, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in
   me;' he lived, and knew that he lived. They have a life which they feel
   within themselves, the operations and motions of the spiritual life;
   they feel its impulsions to duty, its abhorrences from sin; tendency of
   soul to God, and spiritual supports; and they feel the stirrings of the
   old nature, workings of heart towards sin and vanity, which the out
   ward senses cannot discover.

   [3.] The outward senses sometimes set the inward senses awork. The
   sweetness of those good things which are liable to sense, puts us in
   mind of the sweetness of better things; as the prodigal's husks put him
   in mind of the bread in his father's house; or as the priests of
   Mercury among the heathen, when they were eating figs, they were to
   cry, Truth is sweet, because the god whom they worshipped was sup posed
   to be the inventor of arts, and the discoverer of truth. So Christians,
   when by the outward taste they find anything sweet, the inward sense is
   set awork, and they have a more lively feeling of spiritual comforts;
   as David, honey is sweet, but the word of God was sweeter than honey to
   him, or the honeycomb.' Thus Christ, when he was eating bread, Blessed
   is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God,' Luke xiv. 15; and
   they that have Christ's spirit, they act suitably.

   2. This sense differs from a bare and simple act of the understanding.
   Why? For a man may know things that he doth not feel. Simple
   apprehension is one thing, and an impression another. An apprehension
   of the sharpness of pain is not a feeling of the sharpness of pain.
   Jesus Christ had a full apprehension of his sufferings all his
   life-long, but felt them not until his agonies, therefore he said, John
   xii. 27, Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?' We have
   notions of good and evil, when we neither taste the one nor the other.
   It is one thing to know sin to be the greatest evil, and another thing
   to feel it to be so; to know the excellency of Christ's love, and to
   taste the sweetness of it, this doth not only constitute a difference
   between a renewed and carnal man, but sometimes between a renewed man
   and himself.

   [1.] Between renewed men and carnal men; they know the same truths, yet
   have not the same affections. A carnal man may talk of truths according
   to godliness, and may dispute of them, and hold opinions about them,
   but doth not taste them; so he does but know the grace of God in
   conceit, not in truth and reality, as the expression is, Col. i. 6. As
   a man only that hath read of honey may have a fancy and imagination of
   the sweetness of it, but he that tastes it knows it in truth and in
   effect; they know the grace. of God, and the happiness of being in
   communion with God, by the light of nature, in conceit, but not in
   reality; but the other they taste it: If so be you have tasted that the
   Lord is gracious,' 1 Peter ii. 3. There is an impression of sweetness
   left upon the soul, and real experience of the goodness of God in
   Christ, so as to make them affect him with all their hearts, to choose
   him for their portion, and to make his will their only rule, and obey
   and serve him, whatever it cost them. They have such a taste of this
   sweetness, as doth engage their hearts to a close and constant
   adherence to Christ. Carnal men have only a naked knowledge of these
   things, weak and ineffectual notions and apprehensions about them; and
   if the sublimity, reasonableness and suitableness of these truths to
   soul necessities cause any taste, it is but slight, slender, and
   insufficient. So indeed temporaries and hypocrites are said to taste
   the heavenly gift, the good word of God, and powers of the world to
   come,' Heb. vi. 4. They have some languishing apprehensions, but they
   do not so taste them as to relish and feed upon them. They do not
   relish Christ himself, but only some benefit which they hope to get by
   him upon slight and easy terms; have not such experience and sweetness
   of God in Christ, as that their souls should constantly cleave to him.
   It may be their fancy may be pleased a little in a supposition and
   possibility of salvation by Christ, or in some general thought of those
   large promises and great offers which God makes in the gospel, not as
   it enforceth duty and subjection to God; well, then, it differs from a
   bare understanding of the goodness of God's ways.

   2. This constitutes a difference sometimes between a renewed man and
   himself, as to some things; his inward senses are not always alike
   quick and lively; he is still like-minded as he was, but yet not alike
   affected; his sight is not so clear, nor taste so acute, nor his
   feeling so tender; though he hath the same thoughts of things he had
   before, yet his spiritual sense is benumbed, and is not at all times
   affected alike, while he keeps his spiritual eye clear from the clouds
   of lust and passion; he is otherwise affected with things to come than
   he is when his eye is blinded with inordinate passion and love to
   present things; and while he keeps his taste, how sweet and welcome is
   this to his soul, the remembrance of Christ, and salvation by him! And
   so, while he keeps his heart tender, he is sensible of the least
   stirring of sin, and is humbled for it; and the least impulsion of
   grace, to be thankful for it. Those instructions, reproofs,
   consolations, which at some times either wound or revive their spirits,
   at other times do not move them at all; their senses are benumbed, not
   kept fresh and lively. And thus in the general I have proved that there
   is such a thing as spiritual taste.

   Secondly, What is this spiritual sense? It is an impression left upon
   our hearts, which gives us an ability to relish and savour spiritual
   things; but it cannot be known by description so much as by these two
   questions:--

   1. The use of it, what doth this taste serve for?

   2. What are the requisites that we may have such a taste and relish of
   divine and spiritual things?

   1. What doth this taste serve for? There is a threefold use of them:--

   [1.]. To discern things good and wholesome from things noxious and
   hurtful to the soul; that is the use of spiritual sense in general, to
   discern things good and evil, Heb. v. 14; Job vi. 30, Is there iniquity
   in my tongue? Cannot my taste discern perverse things?' God hath given
   all sensitive creatures a taste, whereby they may distinguish between
   things pleasant or bitter, sweet or sour, wholesome or unwholesome,
   savoury or unsavoury, that they may choose what is convenient to
   nature; so the new creature hath a taste to know things, things
   contrary to the new nature, and things that will keep it in life: Job
   xii. 11, Doth not the ear try words, and the mouth taste his meat?' or,
   as it is more plain, Job xxxiv. 3, For the ear trieth words, as the
   mouth tasteth meat.' Spiritual taste distinguisheth between what is
   salubrious and profitable to us, that which is the pure word, milk
   agreeable to the new nature; and what is frothy, garnished out with the
   pomp of eloquence, it is tasteless to a gracious soul, if it suiteth
   not with the interests of the new nature: they have a faculty within
   them, whereby they distinguish between men's inventions and God's
   message. A man of spiritual taste, when reason is restored to its use,
   he comes to a doctrine, and many times smells the man; saith he, this
   is not the breast-milk that must nourish me, the pure milk of the word
   by which I must grow in strength and stature; and if he finds anything
   of God, he owns God; he discerns what is human and what is divine.

   [2.] The use of this taste is also to refresh and comfort the soul m
   the sweetness of spiritual things: Cant. ii. 3, I sat down under his
   shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste;' the
   taste of Christ's fruit in the comforts of redemption; the fruit that
   grows there is sweet and pleasant to the new nature. When the love of
   God to sinners in Christ is not only heard but believed, not only
   believed but tasted, it ravisheth and transports the soul with sweet
   delight and content, that excels all the pleasures of the world.

   [3.] It serves for this use, to preserve the vitality of grace, that
   is, to keep it alive and in action. Omnis vita gustu ducitur--every
   life hath its food, and the food must be tasted. This grace quickeneth
   us to look after that food; it keeps the new creature free for its
   operations, helps it to grow: 1 Peter ii. 3, As new-born babes desire
   the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby; if so be ye
   have tasted that the Lord is gracious.' The truths of the gospel are as
   necessary and natural for the cherishing and strengthening the
   spiritual life as the milk of the mother is to the new-born babe, and
   taste is necessary that we may relish it. They that have a taste have
   an appetite, and they delight in the word more than in any other thing;
   whereas those that have no taste or appetite, grow not up to any
   strength, they thrive not.

   2. What is requisite to cause this taste? (1.) Something about the
   object; (2.) Something about the faculty.

   [1.] Something about the object, which is the word of God. Eating, or
   taking into the mouth, that is necessary before tasting; for the tongue
   is the instrument of taste; the outward part of the tongue that serves
   for meats, the inward part, towards the root, for drink. So for this
   spiritual taste there is required eating, or taking in the object,
   therefore we read often of eating the word of God: Jer. xv. 16, Thy
   word was sweet, and I did eat it;' and Ezek. iii. 3, we read of eating
   the roll; it is interpreted spiritually, I did eat it;' then follows
   his taste, it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.' So Rev. x. 10, I
   took the little book and ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as
   honey.' There was somewhat of prophetical vision in these things, but
   generally it is carried not an outward and literal eating, but a
   spiritual taste, relishing the sweetness of it. Well, then, the word
   must not only be read and heard, but eaten. What is this spiritual
   eating of the word? Three things are in it, and all make way for this
   taste. (1.) Sound belief; (2.) Serious consideration; (3.) Close
   application. He that would have a taste of spiritual things, these
   three things are necessary.

   (1.) That there be a sound belief of it. Men have not taste, because
   they have not faith; we cannot be affected with what we do not believe:
   Heb. iv. 2, The word profited not, not being mixed with faith in them
   that heard it.' What is the reason men have no taste in the doctrine of
   God, and in the free offers of his grace? It is not mingled with faith,
   and then it wants one necessary ingredient towards this taste. So 1
   Thes. ii. 13, Ye received the word of God, which effectually worketh
   also in you that believe.' If you would have spiritual sense, faith
   makes way for it: we must take the word as the word of God. When we
   read in feigned stories of enchanted castles and golden mountains, they
   affect us not, because we know they are but witty fictions, pleasant
   fables, or idle dreams; and such atheism and unbelief lies in the
   hearts of men against the very scriptures, and therefore the apostle
   seeks to obviate and take off this:. 2 Peter i. 16, We have not
   followed cunningly devised fables;' intimating there is such a thought
   in man's heart. Certainly if men did believe the mystery, that is
   without controversy great, that God hath indeed sent his Son to redeem
   the world, and would indeed bestow heaven and eternal happiness upon
   them, they would have a greater taste; but they hear of these things as
   a dream of mountains of gold, or rubies falling from the clouds. If
   they did believe these glorious things of eternity, their hearts would
   be ravished with them.

   (2.) As faith is necessary, so serious consideration, by which we
   concoct truths, and chew them, and work them upon the heart, that
   -causeth this sweetness; by knocking on the flint the sparks fly out:
   those ponderous and deep inculcative thoughts of divine and heavenly
   things make us taste a sweetness in them. When we look slightly and
   superficially into the word, no wonder we do not find this comfort and
   sweetness; but when we dig deeply into the mines of the word, and work
   out truths by serious thoughts, and search for wisdom, when we come to
   see truth with our own eyes in its full nature, order, and dependence,
   this is that which gets this taste: Prov. xxiv. 13, 14, My son, eat
   thou honey, because it is good, and the honeycomb, which is sweet to
   thy taste. So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul, when thou
   hast found it.' When men are serious, look into the nature, and see all
   truths in their order and dependence, then they will be like honey and
   the honeycomb; this makes way for this sweet taste.

   (3.) There is necessary to this taste close application; for the nearer
   and closer things touch one another, the greater their efficacy; so the
   more close you set the word home upon your own hearts, the more it
   works: Job v. 27, Know it for thy good;' break out thy portion of the
   bread of life, look upon these promises and offers of grace as
   including thee, these commands speaking to thee, and these threatenings
   as concerning thee; look upon it not only as God's message in common,
   but urge it upon thy soul: Jer. xv. 16, It was unto me the rejoicing of
   my heart.' There must be a particular application of these things.
   These things are necessary to this taste with respect to the object; as
   there must be eating, a taking into the mouth, if we would taste, so
   there must be a digesting or working upon the word, by sound belief,
   serious consideration, close application.

   [2.] As to this taste, there is somewhat necessary as to the soul or
   faculty; we must have a palate qualified for these delicates. Now there
   is a double qualification necessary to this taste--a hungry conscience
   and mortified affections.

   (1.) A hungry conscience. Without this, a man hath a secret loathing of
   this spiritual food, his taste is benumbed; but to a hungry conscience
   the word is sweet, when he is kept in a constant hungering after Christ
   and his grace: Prov. xxvii. 7, The full soul loatheth the honeycomb,
   but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.' Cordials, they are
   nauseous things to a full stomach; oh but how reviving, comfortable,
   and sweet are they to a poor broken heart! The first time that we got
   this taste, it was when we were under the stings of a guilty
   conscience, then God came and tendered his grace to us in Christ; he
   sent a messenger, one of a thousand, to tell us he hath found a ransom,
   and that we shall be delivered from going down into the pit; that he
   will spare us, and do us good in Christ Jesus, then the man's flesh
   recovers again like a child's, Job xxxiii. 25. When men have felt the
   stings of the second death, and God comes with a sentence of life and
   peace by Christ, how sweet is it then! Now, though we have not always a
   wounded conscience, yet we must always have a tender conscience, always
   sensible of the need of gospel support; we came to this first relish of
   the doctrine of eternal life and salvation by Christ when we lay under
   the sentence of eternal death.

   (2.) The heart must be purged from carnal affections; for until we lose
   our fleshly savour we cannot have this spiritual taste: Rom. viii. 5,
   They that are after the flesh, do savour the things of the flesh;' the
   word may be translated so. A carnal heart relishes nothing but carnal
   things, worldly pleasures, worldly delights; now this doth exceedingly
   deaden your spiritual taste. Spiritual taste is a delicate thing,
   therefore the heart must be purged from fleshly lusts; for when fleshly
   lusts bear sway, and you relish the garlic and onions and fleshpots of
   Egypt, your affections will carry you elsewhere, to the vanities of the
   world, and contentments of the flesh. Look, as sick men have lost their
   taste, and that which is sweet seems sour and ungrateful to a
   distempered appetite, so a carnal appetite hath not this taste from the
   word of God; to a carnal heart it is no more savoury than the white of
   an egg; yea, it is as gall to them, but now to others it is exceeding
   sweet, it is their joy, the life of their souls. Well, then, you see
   what is this spiritual taste, that relish which a renewed soul hath for
   spiritual comforts.

   Use. To persuade you to get this taste; and when once you have got it,
   take heed you do not lose it.

   1. It concerns you very much to get this taste; take these arguments:--

   [1.] It is a good evidence of the new nature; it is a sign you have
   gotten that other heart, that new spirit, which must have new comfort,
   new supports: 1 Peter ii. 3, 4, As new-born babes you desire the
   sincere milk of the work; if so be you have tasted that the Lord is
   gracious.' Hereby we may know the new man, by his appetite and savour.
   Life is known by this, as much as by any one thing else.

   [2.] This will give you a more assured knowledge of the truth and worth
   of spiritual and heavenly things, whereas otherwise we shall but talk
   of them by rote, until we experiment the comfort and sweetness of them
   in our own souls; then we will see there is more than notions in
   promises, the word of God is not a well-devised fable and golden dream,
   for our taste will be our confirmation. The greatest demonstration is
   from the senses, 1 John v. 10, the believer hath a testimony of the
   truth of religion within himself, in his own heart. Oh! it is a great
   advantage to have our remedy there where our danger lies, in the heart;
   where atheism and disbelief lurks, to have spiritual sense there: when
   you have a real experience of them, then Satan cannot have such
   advantage, and atheistical and unbelieving thoughts such advantage, for
   you have felt the benefit of spiritual things. It is a great advantage
   against temptation, when you have had a sense, when you do not only
   know by hearsay and guess that the word is sweet, but you have had a
   taste, as a man that hath been at the fire knows it warms; when we
   cannot only say with him, We have heard the kings of Israel are
   merciful kings,' but, with the men of Samaria, We have seen him
   ourselves.'

   [3.] The life of grace mightily depends upon it; all your liveliness in
   grace depends upon this taste, therefore get it. When you have no
   taste, you lose your appetite; and when you lose your appetite, you
   lose your strength; and when you lose your strength, all goes to ruin
   in the soul; sin' prevails, and deadness increaseth upon the soul. All
   the strength, comfort, and vitality of your lives depend upon your
   taste.

   [4.] It is this taste that will make you more useful to others. That
   which we have seen, heard, and tasted, that we commend to others. A
   report of a report and tradition, it may be or not; that is a cold
   thing, this is not a valid testimony. Ay! but when you can speak of
   that which you have felt and tasted, your eyes have seen, and hands
   handled of the word of life,' 1 John i. 1; when it is matter of sense,
   then we can speak boldly and affectionately, as the apostle, 2 Cor. i.
   4, That we might comfort them which are in trouble by the comfort
   wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.' When we ourselves are
   comforted of God, and that which we speak is the result of our own
   experience, it makes us more useful in our Christian converse. The
   prophet Ezekiel was to eat his own prophecies, and St John to eat the
   book; the meaning is, they must digest it. What we communicate to
   others, we must digest it ourselves, that, finding it sweet, we may
   speak the more effectually for God.

   2. Do not lose this taste. Oh! it is a sad thing to lose these
   spiritual senses. Hypocrites, their taste doth lightly come and lightly
   go; they have a little vanishing sweetness now and then, but it is soon
   gone; it. is a sad thing to lose our spiritual taste. It may be lost in
   a great measure; sometimes a Christian hath it, and sometimes he hath
   it not, at least not in such a degree as formerly. Experience shows it
   may be lost too too often; all the business will be to discern the
   first tendencies of this evil when we begin to lose our taste and
   spiritual senses. This may be discerned with respect to the threefold
   object of this taste--heavenly gift, the good word of God, and powers
   of the world to come.

   [1.] Heavenly gift, that is Christ Jesus. When we do not so highly
   value the love of God in Christ, and prize his blood, and the precious
   effects of it; when we do not so earnestly beg pardon of sin, and
   hunger and thirst after his righteousness; when we have not that former
   earnestness and strength of desire to enjoy Christ. Time was when thou
   thoughtest no terms too dear for him, when thy heart made hard pursuit
   after him; but now thou art grown cold and careless, and so pass him by
   lightly, as a full stomach with meat, with which it is cloyed; when you
   are not so earnest and zealous for Christ, it is a sign you have lost
   your taste.

   [2.] Your tasting of the good word of God. When you slight the word,
   either in not reading, hearing, meditating in it so frequently as you
   were wont to do. Oh, time was when you could say, No honey or honeycomb
   so sweet as this to my poor soul! Ps. xix. 10; when you could hardly
   call off your thoughts. Now you are more infrequent in these godly
   exercises, or else, if conversant about it, not with that life and that
   affection; in a more customary manner you can read of the love of God
   and sufferings of Christ Jesus, without any love to him again; can read
   the promises, and they seem to be but like dry chips and withered
   flowers, and not yield that marrow and fatness to you. You can read the
   promises of eternal life, and have not that joy, thankfulness, and
   blessing of God. You could hardly contain yourselves before, but cry
   out, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   blessed be God that hath visited and redeemed his people.' Now your
   affections are more flat and cold, and have not that relish in holy
   conference, sweetness in hearing, and that contentment of soul in
   meditating.

   [3.] You may lose your taste in the powers of the world to come, when
   you grow more mindless of God, and eternal blessedness, when you have
   not such fresh and warm thoughts as you were wont to have; when your
   desires, hopes, expectations of the life to come is abated, you have
   not that lively hope, 1 Peter iii. 3, to quicken you for the attaining
   of eternal blessedness. While this taste is fresh upon the hearts of
   Christians, they are for heaven, for God, carried on with vigour and
   strength in the way of holiness; but when your hearts are carried out
   to worldly vanity, and you relish more the honour, applause, fulness of
   estate, worldly increase, and you are grown more cold in heavenly
   things, you have lost this taste of the powers of the world to come,
   Heb. vi. 4.

   The causes of this. One is, want of a due esteem, not an esteem in an
   idea, naked or abstract notion from those thoughts out of a temptation.
   No man is so unreasonable, but, if he be a little enlightened with
   Christianity, will say, the favour of God is better than all things.
   Ay! but want of that practical esteem, when they can forfeit this taste
   for every trifle and flesh-pleasing vanity; or when they carelessly
   look after him, are indifferent as to communion with God, and think it
   not much whether they are accepted of God, yea or no; or manifest
   himself to you in Christ, when the comforts of the Spirit are things
   you can spare, and the consolations of God seem to be small, it is all
   one to you whether you have experiences from God in duty or no, your
   souls are satisfied; this is a cause of decaying. Then negligence in
   duties; pray lazily, hear carelessly, not meditate often. Inordinate
   savour of carnal pleasure, that is another cause. What is the reason
   the temporary seems to be so affected? He loseth his taste altogether;
   carnal things have the first possession of his heart, and being
   confirmed there by long use and custom, being so suitable to us, and so
   long rooted in us, and we have such a vanishing glance of things to
   come, this will work out that taste, the love, the sense we have of
   better things. Godly men, when they turn out to the contentments of the
   flesh, they lose their taste, it becomes dead. This is a considerable
   loss as to the vitality of your graces; for without a taste of good or
   evil, we shall neither eschew the evil, nor follow that which is good,
   with that serious constancy and diligence that is necessary. A man that
   hath tasted of the poison of asps, and the bitterness of the gall and
   wormwood that is in sin, will be afraid of it, Rom. vi. 21. So a man
   that hath tasted of the sweetness of communion with God in Christ, he
   is quickened and carried on with life, courage, and constancy. That is
   a dreadful place, Heb. vi. 4, 5; the loss of their taste is a degree to
   final apostasy. Oh, how many lose their taste, their relish of Christ,
   the good word of God, the powers of the life to come, and are fallen
   foully, some forward into error, some backward into a licentious
   course, so that it is impossible to recover themselves by repentance!

SERMON CX.

   Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false
   way.--Ver. 104.

   IN the former verse, the man of God had spoken of the pleasure that was
   to be had by the word, now of the profit of it. There is a great deal
   of pleasure to spiritual sense; if we could once get our appetite, we
   should find a world of sweetness in it; and there is as much profit as
   pleasure. As the pleasure is spiritual, so also is the profit to be
   measured by spiritual considerations. To escape the snares of the
   devil, and the dangers that waylay us in our passage to heaven, is a?
   great advantage. Now the word doth not only warn us of our danger, but
   where it is received in the love of it, breedeth a hatred of all these
   things that may lead us into it: Through thy precepts I get
   understanding: therefore I hate every false way.'

   In which sentence, the prophet seems to invert the order set down, ver.
   101. He had said, I refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
   keep thy word,' where the avoiding of evil is made the means of
   profiting by the word. Here his profiting by the word is made the cause
   of avoiding evil. In the one verse you have an account of his beginning
   with God, in the other of his progress.

   In this verse there is--

   1. The benefit he received by the word, and that is sound and saving
   knowledge.

   2. The fruit and effect which this knowledge produceth in his heart,
   therefore I hate every false way.

   Mark, first, The firmness of this effect, I hate. He doth not say I
   abstain, but I hate.

   Secondly, The note of universality, every.

   Thirdly, The object, false way. It is not said evil way, but false way;
   or, as it is in the original, every path of lying and falsehood.'

   Falsehood is either in point of opinion or practice. If you take it in
   the first sense, for falsehood in opinion, or error in judgment, or
   false doctrine, or false worship, this sentence holds good. Those that
   get understanding by the word are established against error; and not
   only established against error, or against the embracing or profession
   of it, but they hate it.

   1. They are established. All error cometh from ignorance, or else
   judicial blindness.

   [1.] From ignorance, or unacquaintedness with the word of God; so
   Christ said to the Sadducees, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures,'
   Mat. xxii. 29. When men study not the word, which is the rule of truth,
   no wonder if they lie open to every fancy; they take up things hand
   over head, and by a fond credulity are led away by every suggestion
   presented to them. So it is said, 2 Peter iii. 16, that the unstable
   and unlearned wrest the scriptures to their own destruction.' By the
   unlearned, is meant not those that are unskilful in human literature,
   though that be a great help; but those that are unskilful in the word
   of righteousness, poor deluded souls that lie under a great
   uncertainty.

   [2.] Judicial blindness. For men that have great parts, and a
   presumption of their own wit, are given up to be blinded by their own
   lusts; and though they know the scriptures, yet they wrest them to
   speak according to the sense of their carnal interest, 1 Thes. ii. 12.
   And so they see not what they see, being given up to the witchery and
   enchantment of error: Gal. iii. 1, O foolish Galatians! who hath
   bewitched you?' So that all false ways proceed from the want of reason
   and the pride of reason. The one is the cause of the simple's erring,
   who believeth every word; the other of those that are knowing, and are
   otherwise of great parts, but they make their wit their idol, and so
   would be wise above the scriptures, or else are swayed by their own
   lusts. They do not fix themselves in the power, love, and practice of
   truths revealed in the scriptures, and so are given up to hellish
   delusions. Now, in this sense, I might speak with great profit of these
   words, especially now when so many errors are broached, and all the
   errors of Christianity come abreast to assault it at once; and such
   changeable times as produce several interests, whereby men are blinded,
   and such levity in the professors of religion. Why, then, study the
   word with a teachable heart; that is, renouncing your own wit, and
   giving up yourselves to God's direction, and practise what is plain,
   without being swayed with the profits and pleasures of the world, and
   you may come to know what is the mind of God. Men think all is
   uncertain in religion, and are apt to say with Pilate, What is truth?'
   John xviii. 38. No; the scriptures are not obscure, but our hearts are
   dark and blind with worldly lusts. Otherwise the counsel is plain, and
   you might say with David, Through thy precepts I get understanding;
   therefore I hate every false way.'

   (1.) Where the Spirit of God doth affect men with an earnest desire of
   knowledge, and so affect them as to desire to know the will of God, for
   no other reason but that they may avoid what is displeasing to God, and
   do what is pleasing in his sight; and therefore hear, pray read,
   meditate, and study the holy scriptures; they are sure to be right for
   the main.

   (2.) Not only avoid the belief and profession of falsehood, but hate
   it: I hate every false way.' Not the persons, but pity them: Phil. iii.
   19, I tell you weeping.' It should be the grief of our hearts to see
   them misled; but as for the error, hate it, whatever is not agree able
   to the rule of truth, or dissenteth from the purity of the word. There
   is too great a coldness and indifferency about the things of religion,
   as if truth were not to be stood upon. Carnal men hate the truth: Ps.
   l. 17, They hate instruction, and cast my laws behind their backs.'
   Truly we have much more reason to hate error, without which we cannot
   be safe, it is so catching with our natures.

   2. In point of practice, and so every falsehood may be applied--

   [1.] To craft, or carnal wisdom. I hate fraud and deceit; true
   understanding makes us hate false wisdom. A simple, honest conversation
   suits best with Christians: 2 Cor. i. 12, In simplicity and godly
   sincerity we have had our conversation in the world.'

   [2.] Carnal or worldly vanities, and flattering or fallacious
   pleasures, these entice us with a fair outside, and promise a great
   deal of happiness and comfort to us; but when we neglect better things,
   and run after them, they deceive us in the issue. They are called
   deceitful riches,' Mark iv. 19. And beauty' is said to be deceitful,'
   Prov. xxxi. 30. And those that run after these things are said to run
   after lying vanities,' Jonah ii. 8; those that fail when we hope to
   enjoy them.

   3. I take it more generally for all sin. Sinful ways are false ways,
   and will surely deceive those that expect good from them or walk in
   them: Heb. iii. 13, Deceitfulness of sin;' and deceitful lusts,' Eph.
   iv. 22; and sin hath deceived me, and slew me,' saith Paul, Rom. vii.
   11. Sin is false and deceitful many ways--

   [1.] It presents itself in another dress than its own, proposing evil
   under the name of good, calling light darkness, and darkness light,
   Isa. v. 20, or shadows of good for that which is really good, gilded
   trash for perfect gold.

   [2.] As it promiseth happiness and impunity which it never performeth
   or maketh good, Deut. xxix. 19, 20; and so the poor sinner is led as an
   ox to the slaughter, Prov. vii. 22, 23. And we do not see the danger of
   it till it be too late to help it, and it appeareth in its own colours
   in the foulness of the act and the smartness of the punishment. Esau,
   when he had sold the birthright, bewailed it with tears when it was too
   late, Heb. xii. 16, 17. The foolish virgins tarried till the door was
   shut, Mat. xxv. 11, 12. It is good to have our eyes in our head, to see
   a plague when we may prevent it, Prov. xxii. 3. The foulness of the act
   terrifieth, as it did Judas when he betrayed his master, Mat. xxvii. 4.
   Their hearts give evidence against them, Rom. ii. 15 Excusing or
   accusing one another;' as Cain, Gen. iv. 14, My punishment is greater
   than I can bear.' The unclean person shall mourn at the last, when his
   flesh and his body shall be consumed,' Prov. v. 11. Adam and Eve were
   sensible too late, when their eyes were opened.

   Doct. By the word of God we get that true, sound wisdom which maketh us
   to hate every false way.

   Four things are implied in the point and in the text:--

   1. A hatred of sin.

   2. The universality of this hatred, every false way.

   3. That this is a part and fruit of wisdom, I get understanding,
   therefore I hate.

   4. This wisdom and understanding is gotten by God's precepts.

   First, That it is our duty to hate sin. It is not enough to reform our
   practice, or to abstain from the act, or to avoid the occasions that
   may lead to it, but it must be hated: Ps. xcvii. 10, Ye that love the
   Lord, hate evil.' He doth not say forbear it, but hate it. Love to the
   chiefest good is fitly accompanied with hatred of the chiefest evil.
   God, he is our chiefest good: you love the Lord, and you must also hate
   evil. The one is as natural to grace as the other; for the new nature
   hath its slight and aversation, as well as its choice and prosecution.
   As it inclines us to choose God for our portion, and to pursue after
   things that lead to God, so it hath a disposition to make us avoid that
   which is evil. There are things hurtful to the new nature as well as
   any other being; now hatred is to arm us against it. In short, this
   hatred is required--

   1. Because this is the true principle of resistance against sin. Until
   a man hate sin, he is never truly set against it; as a man is never
   thoroughly gained to that which is good until he loves holiness for
   holiness' sake. His affections may be bribed with other considerations,
   but then he is rooted in holiness when he loves holiness for its own
   sake. So a man that is not resolved against sin, that will not hate it
   for its own sake, may be frighted out of sin for a fit, or by the
   interposings of conscience put out of humour, but his heart falls in
   again with his old lusts, until there be an envy and detestation of
   sin; but when it comes to this hatred, then temptations cannot easily
   overcome--examples draw not, nor difficulties compel us to that which
   is evil Persuasions and allurements formerly were of great force;
   straightway they followed; but when the bent is another way, they are
   not so easily drawn by force and examples, which seem to have such
   cogency. Before men did easily swim with the stream, but here is a
   counter motion when they hate that which is evil. This is the fence of
   the soul, and draws us to an indignation, Hosea xiv. 8.

   2. Partly because this is a true distinctive evidence between those
   that are good and those that are evil. Many may forbear sin that yet do
   not hate it; they forbear it out of restraint, out of fear of
   punishment, shame, worldly ends, yet they regard iniquity in their
   hearts,' Ps. lxvi. 18; as a dog loves the bone, yet fears the blows.
   God judgeth not as man; man is blameless, he abstains from sin, but God
   hateth sin. Man judgeth according to the action, but God judgeth
   according to the frame of the heart, 1 Sam. xvi. 7; for he is able to
   look to the inward springs, and poise our spirits. So on the other
   side, good men may slip into an evil action, but their hearts are
   against it; it is the evil which they hate, Rom. vii. 15. They may be
   foiled, but their hearts are bent another way.

   But what is this hatred of sin?

   1. It implies a universal repugnancy in every part of a man against
   sin, not only in his reason and conscience, but will and affections.
   There is not a wicked man, but in many cases his conscience bids him do
   otherwise; ay! but a renewed man, his heart inclines him to do
   otherwise; his heart is set against sin, and taken up with the things
   of God: Rom. vii. 22, I delight in the law of God according to the
   inner man.' It is in the whole inward man, which consists of many parts
   and faculties. Briefly, then, it notes the opposition, not from
   enlightened conscience only, but from the bent of the renewed heart.
   Reason and conscience will take God's part, and quarrel with sins, else
   wicked men could not be self-condemned.

   2. Hatred; it is a fixed rooted enmity. Many a man may fall out with
   sin upon some occasion, but he hath not an irreconcilable enmity
   against it. The transient motions of the soul are things quite distinct
   from a permanent principle that abides in a renewed heart; he hath that
   same seed of God remaining in him,' 1 John iii. 9. A habit notes a
   habitual aversation. A brabble many times falls out between us and sin
   upon several occasions, when it hath sensibly done us wrong, destroyed
   our peace, blasted our names, or brought temporal inconvenience upon
   us. In time of judgment and fears, and present troubles and dangers,
   men think of bewailing their sins and returning to God. but they fall
   out and fall in again; this is anger, not hatred; like the rising of
   the heart against a drawn sword, when it is flashed in our faces,
   whereas afterwards we can take it up without any such commotion of
   spirit.

   3. Hatred; it is an active enmity, warring upon sin by serious and
   constant endeavours, manifested by watching, striving, groaning;
   watching before the temptation comes, resisting in the temptation,
   groaning under it, and bemoaning ourselves after the temptation hath
   prevailed over us.

   [1.] There is a constant jealousy and watchfulness before the
   temptation comes. They that hate sin will keep at a distance from what
   ever is displeasing unto God: Prov. xxviii. 14, Happy is the man that
   feareth alway.' A hard heart, that knows not the evil of sin, rusheth
   on to things according to the present inclination. Ay! but a man that
   hath a hatred against sin, that hath felt the evil of it in his
   conscience, that hath been scorched in the flames of a true conviction,
   will not come near the fire. A broken heart is shy and fearful,
   therefore he weighs his thoughts, words, and actions, and takes notice
   of the first appearance of any temptation; they know sin is always
   present, soon stirred, and therefore live in a holy jealousy. Certainly
   they that walk up and down heedlessly in the midst of so many snares
   and temptations wherewith we are waylaid in our passage to heaven, they
   have not this active enmity against sin, and therefore hatred is seen
   by watching.

   [2.] It is seen by striving, or serious resistance in the temptation. A
   Christian is not always to be measured by the success, but by conflict;
   he fights it out: Rom. vii. 15, The evil which I hate, that do I.'
   Though they be foiled by sin, yet they hate it. An enemy may be
   overcome, yet he retains his spite and malice. Sin doth not freely
   carry it in the heart, neither is the act completely willing: Gal. v.
   17, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh;
   for,' saith he, the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
   against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that
   ye cannot do the things that ye would;' that is, you cannot sin with
   such proneness and full consent and bent of heart as others; they have
   a principle of opposition, a rooted enmity in their souls against sin.

   [3.] By a bitter grief after the temptation; as Peter, when he had
   fallen foully, he went out and wept bitterly,' Mat. xxvi. 75. They do
   not lie in sin, but recover themselves by a kindly remorse; it is the
   grief of their souls that they have fallen into God's displeasure,
   grieved his Spirit, and hazarded their communion with him. Oh! sin is
   grievous to a gracious heart, and this makes them groan and complain to
   God, O wretched man!' &c.

   4. It is such an enmity against sin as aims at the utter extermination
   and expulsion of it, that endeavoureth to destroy it both root and
   branch. Hatred is all for mischief; annihilation, that is that which
   hatred aims at. Anger worketh trouble, but hatred mischief. It is an
   implacable affection, that continues to the death, that will not be
   appeased till the thing which we hate be abolished. So where there is
   this hatred of sin, it follows sin close till it hath gotten the life
   of it. As by the grace of justification they have obtained such favour
   with God, ne damnet, it shall not damn; by the grace of sanctification,
   ne regnet, sin shall not reign; and still they are aspiring and looking
   after the grace of glorification, ne sit, that sin may no longer be;
   therefore they are longing and groaning under the relics of corruption:
   Rom. vii. 24, O wretched man!' &c. Many scratch the face of sin, but
   they do not seek to root it up, to destroy the body of death; it is
   their constant grief that anything of sin is left in the heart, as
   enemies are not satisfied till they have the blood of each other. Where
   there is hatred it is not enough to stop the spreading, weaken the
   power of sin, but labouring to destroy the being of sin; as David said
   of his enemies, I pursued them till they were destroyed;' so when we
   set against sin with an aim not to give over till we have the life of
   it; or as God said concerning the Canaanites, Deut. vii. 23, I will
   destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed;' so
   doth a renewed heart war against sin, that he may leave neither root
   nor fruit within them.

   Use. If this be to hate sin, how few can say with David, I hate every
   false way'! how few are of David's temper! Some love sin with all their
   heart, that hide it as a sweet morsel under their tongue,' Job xx. 12.
   The love of sin, that is the life of it; it dies when it begins to be
   hated; but when you have a love to it, it lives in the soul and
   prevails over us. And as they testify their love of sin, so they
   misplace their hatred. What do they hate? Not sin, but the word that
   discovers it. They hate the light, because their deeds are evil,' John
   iii. 20. They do not hate sin, but God's messengers that plead against
   it: 1 Kings xxii. 8, I hate him,' saith Ahab concerning Micaiah, for he
   doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.' They hate the faithful
   brother that reproves them; he is hated because he will not hate his
   brother, to see sin upon him. They hate the magistrate that would
   reform, the faithful Christian that condemns them by his exact walking:
   John xv. 19, Because I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
   world hateth you.' They hate God's image in his people, and cannot
   endure to be condemned by the light that shines out from their
   conversations. Godly men are objects reviving guilt, therefore they
   hate them. Thus shamefully are a man's affections transposed; we love
   where we should hate, and hate where we should love. And then if we
   come to the other sort of men, a degree above these, many are
   frightened out of their sins by slavish fear, but yet their hearts are
   in league with them still; and as they get out of the stocks of
   conscience they enlarge themselves in all manner of carnal liberty:
   these are not changed, but awed; sin is not mortified, but only lurks
   to watch a safe opportunity when it may discover itself with more
   advantage.

SERMON CXI.

   Therefore I hate every false way.--Ver. 104.

   THE second proposition is the universality of this hatred, every false
   way. They that hate sin must hate all sin.

   1. This doth necessarily follow upon the former; for if we hate sin
   especially as sin, for the intrinsic evil that is in it, not upon
   foreign accidental reasons, then we will hate all sin, for hatred is
   eis ta` ge'ne, to the whole kind; as Haman, when he hated the Jews, he
   thought scorn to lay his hand only on Mordecai, but would have
   destroyed all the Jews, Esther v. 6. It is but a casual dislike, and
   not a hatred. Certainly if we hate sin as sin, we shall hate all sin.
   The same reasons that incline us to hate one sin will incline us to
   hate all. Why! what is it to hate sin as sin? As it is a violation of
   God's law, as it is a contempt of God's authority, a breach of
   spiritual friendship, it grieves the Spirit; these are the reasons to
   incline us to hate one as well as another. Well, then, private
   reservation and indulgences, or setting up a toleration in our own
   hearts, will not stand with the hatred of all sin. Some sins may shame
   and trouble us more, but all are alike contrary to the will of God;
   therefore if we hate them upon reasons of duty to God, we should hate
   them universally, every false way.'

   2. Every sin is hateful to God, therefore every sin should be hateful
   to us. The reason of this is, we should hate what he hates, and love
   what he loves. There is a perfect friendship between God and those in
   covenant with him. Now that is true friendship, to will and nill the
   same thing; it is built upon likeness, and suitableness of disposition.
   This argument is urged by the Holy Ghost: Prov. viii. 13, The fear of
   the Lord is to hate evil; pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and
   the fro ward mouth, do I hate.' This is friendship with God, to hate
   what God hates: I hate it, therefore they hate it. Sins of thought are
   intended by pride and arrogance, for that puts us upon vain musings and
   imaginations; and sins of word by the froward mouth; and sins of action
   by the evil way, outward practice. All this God hates, so should we:
   Rev. ii. 6, Thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also
   hate.' If we be in the same covenant with God, we will have the same
   love, the same hatred. Nay, as we have the same nature with God, the
   saints are made partakers of the divine nature,' 2 Peter i. 4. The
   divine nature shows itself by suitable dispositions.

   3. From our covenant relation with God, which implies an entire
   surrender of soul, which is without any reservation. When you give up
   yourselves to God, he will have all. If you say, God be merciful to me,
   and spare me in this, then you forfeit all the blessings of the
   covenant. God will have all or none; therefore all sin, without
   exception, must be hated by us, for otherwise God is not our chief
   good: if anything be loved besides him, or against his will, it is love
   above him. One man allowed besides the husband is a violation of the
   marriage covenant; so one sin allowed in the heart breaks all the
   covenant between God and us: James ii. 10, If a man keep the whole law,
   and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.' That sentence is not
   a legal sentence belonging to the covenant of works; that were a
   mistake of it: it is not only true in the sense of the covenant of
   works, one sin undoes us for ever, but it is true in the evangelical
   covenant. Thus one sin allowed with full consent of heart makes void
   the gospel covenant, as one article not consented to disannuls the
   whole treaty and agreement between us and God. It is not consistent
   with sincerity that we should bring down the gospel covenant, to allow
   any one sin.

   4. From the damage and mischief that it doth to our souls. One sin
   keeps up the devil's interest; it is like a nest egg, left there to
   draw a new temptation. You continue his empire in you; this is his
   great design, to keep a part. Conscience begins to work, they must have
   something; all then that he pleads for is but a part, and he knows that
   will bring the whole; as Pharaoh would have a pawn, either their
   flocks, herds, or children, that this might bring them back again. One
   sin reserved gives Satan an interest; one leak in the ship, though all
   the rest be stopped, if that be neglected, will sink it in time.

   Use. Let us lay this branch also to heart. There is something usually
   wherein we would be excused and expect favour. We all have a tender
   part of our soul, and loathe it should be touched; some vain fashions,
   customs, or ways, and outgoings of soul, which we are unwilling to
   leave, though we have often smarted for them. Consider, it is not
   consistent with your obedience and your love to God, nor with the power
   of grace in your hearts, to allow any false way. Herod did many things,
   yet perished for all that. A man may do many things that are good, upon
   sin's account, When you allow any one thing, it is only to hide and
   feed your lusts with greater pretence; so many religious things may be
   fuel of lusts, as well as carnal comforts. It is not for the interest
   of the flesh or indwelling corruption that men should have no religion;
   sin cannot be served in such a cleanly way, unless there be something
   done in compliance with God's will, under some disguise, or conformity
   to the will of God. Say then, Shall I do and suffer so many things in
   vain? Bring your hearts thus to hate every false way.

   Thirdly, This is a part and fruit of true wisdom.

   1. That this is a chief part of wisdom and understanding, to hate every
   false way, appears from Job xxviii. 28, The fear of the Lord, that is
   wisdom; and to depart from evil, that is understanding.' So much as we
   hate sin, so much of spiritual wisdom and spiritual understanding.
   Certainly to hate sin is wisdom; I prove it from the nature of sin. All
   disobedience is the greatest folly that can be in the world; and
   therefore, if to sin be to do foolishly, to hate sin is to be wise; and
   not to have understanding certainly is a fruit of folly, for a man to
   do that which will condemn himself, if ever he comes to himself. Now,
   when a man comes to himself, as when he dies or repents, oh! how will
   his heart condemn and reproach him for the vanity of his worldly
   course, when he is filled with his own ways! Especially repentance,
   that is a coming to ourselves. As a man when he hath slept out his
   drunkenness and excess, and begins to look back upon his follies
   committed under that distemper; such is repentance, it is an
   after-wisdom, and therefore it argues that there was an imprudence and
   inconsideration of the things we repent of, and therefore we condemn
   ourselves. That is folly which gratifies those that are our utter
   enemies. Now sin it gratifies the devil, which seeks our ruin: he goes
   about, seeking whom he may devour,' 1 Peter v. 8. You please him that
   seeks your utter destruction; and will you grieve God and please the
   devil? That is folly which brings no disadvantage upon him whom you
   disobey, but upon you it brings the greatest mischief imaginable. God
   is not hurt by your sins; he is above our injury: Prov. ix. 12, If thou
   be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; but if thou scornest, thou
   alone shalt bear it.' There is no hurt done to God; all the hurt is to
   our own souls: Prov. viii. 36, He that sinneth against me, wrongs his
   own soul; and he that hateth me, loveth death.' Every sinner is his own
   murderer and his own destroyer. All those arrows we shoot up against
   heaven, they fall down with more violence upon our own heads. That is
   folly for a man to hazard a jewel for a trifle, to stake his soul, and
   heaven, and eternal happiness, against a little flesh-pleasing and
   carnal satisfaction: Jonah ii. 8, They that observe lying vanities
   forsake their own mercies.' Poor fugacious comforts, lying vanities, to
   follow after, and forsake their own mercy; that is, all that happiness
   which might have been their own. A sinner is a mad gamester, that
   throws away the kingdom of heaven at every cast for a little momentary
   short delight and vain contentment. That is folly to break with him
   upon whom our all depends, our life, being, comfort, happiness; so doth
   sin make us break with God: Isa. lix. 2, Your iniquities have separated
   between you and your God.' Well, then, if sin be to do foolishly, to
   depart from sin, this is wisdom, this is understanding. Certainly he
   that provides against the greatest mischief doth escape the greatest
   danger; he is the wise man, and not he that provides against temporal
   inconveniences only, as poverty and disgrace. He that escapes sin,
   escapes hell, the wrath of God, the extremest misery that can light
   upon a poor creature: Prov. xv. 24, The way of the wise is above, to
   avoid hell beneath;' and therefore it is a high point of wisdom to hate
   sin.

   2. As it is a high point of understanding, so it is a fruit and effect
   of understanding. According to the degree of understanding that we
   have, so will our hatred of sin be; for he saith, Through thy precepts
   I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way. To prove this by
   two reasons:--

   [1.] Our affections follow our apprehensions. There is no way to come
   to the heart but by the mind, by the understanding. Look, as there is
   no way to come to the bowels to purge our distempers that are there but
   by the mouth, stomach, and other passages that lead to the bowels, so
   there is no way to come to the heart and affections but by the
   understanding. Knowledge begets all other affections, those which
   belong to choice and pursuit, or those that belong to slight or
   aversation. Those that belong to choice and pursuit, desire, delight.
   There is no desire of that which is unknown; so in those things that
   belong to slight and aversation, those affections, be it grief or shame
   for sin already committed, or fear or hatred that sin may not be
   committed. Grief or shame: Jer. xxxi. 19, After I was instructed, I
   smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did
   bear the reproach of my youth.' It is light which humbles, and the soul
   is affected according to the sight it hath of things; or go to those
   affections which serve to prevent the commission of sin, as hatred and
   fear. Hatred in the text; a good understanding goes before, a thorough
   hatred will follow.

   [2.] Second reason; that when the mind is fraught with truths, and
   gotten a good stock of knowledge by God's precepts, then it will be
   checking and urging the soul to caution against sin; and therefore the
   more understanding you yet by God's precepts, the more are you warned
   and put in mind of things: Ps. cxix. II, I have hid thy word in mine
   heart, that I might not sin against thee.' When the word hath laid up
   in the heart a good stock of knowledge, there will be one thought or
   other that will be rising up and defying all temptations wherewith you
   are assaulted: Eph. vi. 17, Take unto you the helmet of salvation and
   the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.' In the spiritual
   conflict we need weapons not only defensive but offensive; not only the
   shield of faith, but the sword of the Spirit, that we may destroy and
   slay sin, and withstand temptation, and chase away Satan from us. What
   is this sword of the Spirit? The word of God. The more seasonable
   relief the more fresh thoughts you have to withstand temptations which
   are apt to come in upon you: Prov. vi. 21, 22, Bind them upon thine
   heart: when thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it
   shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.' This
   will always be urging him to duty, and warning him of his danger.

   A word of use. (1.) Get understanding; (2.) Never count yourselves to
   understand anything but as you increase in hatred of sin.

   1. Get understanding. Partly--(1.) Because there are many false ways
   you will never discern without much understanding. There are many false
   ways that are palliated and represented under the show of good, and we
   are easily ensnared unless we have light to choose our way: 1 Cor. ii.
   8, Had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.'
   A man will be carried on with a great deal of life and activity in a
   way contrary to God: Acts xxvi. 9, I verily thought with myself that I
   ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.' Oh!
   the tyranny and madness of an erring conscience and an ignorant zealot!
   What a ready prey is a man to Satan, and is carried headlong to
   destroying courses, when a man hath more zeal and earnestness of spirit
   than knowledge to guide him! How will he stumble and dash upon things
   that are very contrary to the will of God. (2.) If they can discern
   them, they shall not have a heart and skill to remedy them without
   understanding. We shall not have a heart, for light will be urging,
   calling upon us, minding us of our duty, warning us of danger; whereas
   otherwise we shall go on tamely, like an ox to the slaughter, and like
   a fool to the correction of the stocks. We shall not have this restless
   importunity of conscience, which is a great restraint of sin; and then
   we shall not have the skill, for all is misapplied and misconceived by
   an ignorant spirit, for the whole business of his religion is making
   cordials instead of purges, and potions instead of antidotes, catching
   at promises when threatenings belong to him, lulling his soul asleep
   with new strains of grace, when he should awaken himself to duty.

   2. Never count yourselves to have profited in anything till your hearts
   are awakened into a further hatred of sin. Christians! they are but
   notions; it is not saving knowledge unless it be in order to practice;
   men have no understanding that have not this active and rooted enmity
   against sin: Ps. cxi. 10, A good understanding have all that they do
   his commandments;' they that hate sin more, and are more weary of
   corruption. He is made wiser by the word that is made better by it. It
   is not the talker against, but the hater of iniquity that is the wise
   man. If wisdom enters upon the heart, and breaks out in our practice,
   by that is our thriving in knowledge to be measured: 1 John ii. 3,
   Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.'

   This was God's scope in giving the word, not to make trial of men's
   wits, who could most sharply conceive, or of their memories, who could
   most faithfully retain, or of their eloquence, who could most nimbly
   discourse; but of the sincerity of the heart, who could most obediently
   submit to the will of God. Jer. xxii. 16, when he had spoke of hating
   of sin, and doing good, Was not this to know me? saith the Lord.' This
   is to know God to hate sin. Outward things were not made for sight
   only, but for use, as herbs, plants, and stars. So our reason, and the
   scriptures the Lord hath given us; it is not only for sight, but for
   use, that we may be wise to salvation; not that we may please our
   selves with acute notions about the things of God, but seriously set
   our hearts to practise.

   The fourth thing in this general point is, that this wisdom and
   understanding is gotten by God's precepts. Mark, I hate every false
   way.' Why? Because by thy precepts I get understanding.' Where have we
   it? By studying God's word,' Rom. iii. 20, By the law is the knowledge
   of sin.' How is the knowledge of sin by the law? Three ways: according
   to the nature of the sin, according to who is the sinner, and according
   to the guilt and dreadful estate of them that lie in a state of sin. So
   the knowledge of sin, that is, the nature of it, and where it lives,
   and where it reigns, and what will be the effects of it, all this
   knowledge is by the law.

   1. By the law is the knowledge of sin, quoad naturam peccati. There are
   many things we should never know but by the law of God, though we have
   some general notions of good and evil. Rom. vii. 7, saith the apostle,
   I had not known sin but by the law; for I had not known lust, except
   the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.' Those first stirrings and
   secret lingerings of heart and inclinations to that which is cross to
   the will of God, that they go before all consent of will, and all
   delight, these things we could never discern by the light of nature.

   2. Quoad subjectum, what is the sinner, and who is guilty of it? So
   Rom. vii. 9, I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment
   came, sin revived, and I died.' He saw his lost, miserable, undone
   condition by the law of God. The acts of sin are discovered by the word
   of God; it discovers the thoughts and intents of the heart, Heb. iv.
   12, and state of sin; our natural face, the condition wherein we are,
   is to be seen in this glass.

   3. Quoad realum et magnitudinem peccati, what will be the effects of
   it? Rom. v. 20, The law entered, that the offence might abound.'
   Therefore the law was given, that it might work a deep sense of the
   evil consequents of sin, and what wrath man was bound over to for
   violating the righteous law. The law represents the heinous nature of
   sin as it is anomi'a, a transgression of the law, as it strikes at
   God's being or at God's authority, seeks to jostle him out of the
   throne; as it contradicts his sovereignty, and plucks the sceptre out
   of his hand and the crown from his head, and makes men to say, Who is
   lord over us?' As if we had nothing to guide us but our own lusts. The
   word of God discovers this pride of heart, and then the manifold
   mischiefs of sin are discovered; we get this understanding by the word.
   It is better to know these mischiefs of sin by the threatenings of the
   word, than by our own bitter experience. It is sin that separates from
   God, and renders us incapable of all blessings.

   Use 1. Study yourselves, and take a view of the case and state of your
   souls by the glass of the word; see what you gain by every reading,
   hearing, every time you converse with him, what is given out to
   convince you of sin, or awaken your soul against sin.

   Use 2. When you consult with the word, beg the light of the Spirit,
   which is only lively and efficacious. The apostle speaks of knowing
   things in the evidence and demonstration of the Spirit and of power,' 1
   Cor. ii. 4. There is the same demonstration of the Spirit. There is a
   manifest difference between the evidence of reason and arguments held
   out from a natural understanding, and between the illumination or the
   demonstration of the Spirit. There are many that may have a full
   knowledge of the letter and the sense of the words, as they lie open to
   the evidence of reason, yet be without the light and power of those
   truths, for that is a fruit of the demonstration of the Spirit, the
   lively light of the Holy Ghost that goes along with the word.

SERMON CXII.

   Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.--Ver. 105.

   THE present world, as much as it suits with our carnal nature, it is
   but like a howling wilderness with respect to Canaan, in which there
   are many crooked paths and dangerous precipices, yea, many privy snares
   and secret ambushes laid for us by the devil and his instruments; so
   that unless we have a faithful guide, a clear, full, and sure
   direction, we shall certainly miscarry, and every day run into the
   mouth of a thousand mischiefs. Now God, out of his abundant mercy, hath
   given us a light, a rule to walk by, to set us clear from these rocks
   and precipices, and to guide us safe to true happiness. And what is
   this light? It is his word; so David acknowledged in this verse, thy
   word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

   Here you may observe--(1.) The double notion by which the direction of
   the word is set forth. (2.) You have the object, or the matter wherein
   we are directed; that also is expressed by a double notion, It is a
   lamp to my feet, and a light to my path.' Let me explain these a
   little.

   1. The two notions whereby the direction is expressed, it is a light,
   that is a more general expression; the other is more particular, it is
   a lamp, possibly with allusion to the lamp of the sanctuary. The use of
   a lamp is to light in the night, and the light shines in the day. The
   word of God is both a light and lamp; it is of use to us by day and
   night, in all conditions, in adversity, in prosperity, in all the
   conditions we pass through in this world. Chrysostom hath an
   observation, but I doubt a little too curious, o no'mos lu'knos
   onoma'zetai, o Kri'stos ui'os [4] tes dikaiosu'nes, saith he--The law
   shineth in narrow limits, within small bounds, therefore that is called
   a lamp; but Christ, in the gospel, is called a son [5] of
   righteousness.

   2. Let us come to the term by which the object is expressed, path and
   feet. By path is meant our general choice and course of life; the law
   will direct to that; not only so, but it is a light to our feet, that
   is, will direct us in every step, in every particular action.

   Doct. That the word of God is a clear and a full rule to direct us in
   all the conditions and affairs of the present life.

   It is a clear rule, for it is called a lamp; and it is a full rule, for
   it is a lamp not only for our path, but for our feet. I shall speak of
   both severally, that it is a lamp and a light.

   First, It is a clear rule, and therefore called a light, and that in
   three regards:--

   1. By reason of its direction, as it shows us the right way to our
   desired end. He that would come to his journey's end needs a way, and
   needs a light to see and find it out. Our end is eternal life, and that
   to be enjoyed in heaven: Prov. vi. 23, The commandment is a lamp, and
   the law is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.' God
   hath stated the way that leads to eternal happiness by his wisdom and
   justice, and revealed it in the scriptures. See that place, Ps. xliii.
   3, Oh, send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me, let them
   bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.' We should have
   wandered up and down in various uncertainties, and have neither pitched
   upon the right end nor way, but have lost ourselves in a maze of
   perplexities, if God had not sent forth his light and truth. Austin
   reckons up two hundred and eighty-eight opinions about the chiefest
   good. Men are seeking out many inventions, looking here and there to
   find happiness, but God hath showed the true way.

   2. It is a light in regard of conviction, as it convinceth of all
   errors and mistakes both in judgment and practice--Verum est index sui
   et obliqui. In this respect it is said, Eph. v. 13, because of this
   convincing light that is in the word, All things that are reproved, are
   made manifest by the light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is
   light.' It discovereth to us our sins as well as our duties; light doth
   manifest itself, and make all other things manifest. Now this
   convictive power of the world is double by way of prevention, and by
   way of reproof.

   [1.] By way of prevention. The word of God shows us our danger, pits,
   precipices, and stumbling-blocks that lie in our way to heaven; it
   shows us both our food and our poison, and therefore he that walks
   according to the direction of the word is prevented from falling into a
   great deal of mischief: 1 John ii. 10, 11, He that abideth in the
   light, there is none occasion of stumbling in him: but he that hateth
   his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not
   whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.' The
   meaning of that place is this, he that walks according to the light of
   scripture, and lives in obedience thereto, avoids stumbling; but he
   that is blinded by his own passion, he wants his light, knows not
   whither he goes, neither in what way he goes--respectu viae, et
   respectu termini. What will be the end of his going? He mistakes the
   way, sins for duties, and good for evil; or he mistakes the end,
   thinking he is going to heaven, when he is in the highway to hell.

   [2.] By way of humiliation and reproof, it discovers our sins to us in
   their own colours, so as to affect the heart, yea, our secret sins,
   which could not be found out by any other light: 1 Cor. xiv. 24, When
   he that believeth not, or is unlearned, comes in, he is convinced of
   all, he is judged of all.' The light of the word it brings a sinner
   upon his face, makes him fall down, acknowledging the majesty of God in
   his word. God's word it hath his signature upon it, it is like himself,
   and bewrayeth its author by its convictive power and majesty. So it is
   notable, Heb. iv. 12, 13, The word of God is quick and powerful, &c.,
   and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.' Mark what
   he had said of the word. He proves the proper ties of the word by the
   properties of God; that God searcheth all things, God's word is like
   himself.

   3. It is light in regard of comfort: Eccles. xi. 7, Truly the light is
   sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun;'
   especially to those that have been shut up in darkness, and kept in a
   dungeon. Oh, it is a pleasant thing to behold the light again! So is
   the word of God light in this sense, to relieve us in all the dark and
   gloomy passages of the present life.

   [1.] In outward darkness. When all outward comforts fail, and have
   spent their allowance, the comforts of the word are left; there is
   enough to support and strengthen our hearts in waiting upon God: Ps.
   xxiii. 4, When I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
   fear no evil; for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort
   me.' The staff and rod they are instruments of a shepherd, and Christ
   is our spiritual shepherd, so that this staff and rod are his word and
   Spirit, they are the instruments of the spiritual shepherd; and this
   comforts us when we are in the shadow of death; in our crosses, in
   confusions and difficulties, when we have nothing else left but the
   promises, this is a reviving to the soul.

   [2.] It is a comfort and refreshing to us in spiritual troubles, that
   arise from the guilt of sin, and want of the sense of God's love: Isa.
   1. 10, Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice
   of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? Let him
   trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.' What shall he
   do? Shall he compass himself about in his own sparks? Oh, how miserable
   are we then! No; but let him depend upon God according to his promise.
   The word of God is a great part of his name; let him stay his heart
   upon the word of God, when he walketh in darkness, and seeth no light.

   Now, that the word of God is such a light, such a sure and clear
   direction, I shall--(1.) Give a direct proof of it from scripture; (2.)
   Some types of it; (3.) Prove it by experience; (4.) By reason.

   1. For the proof from scripture, you have the notions of the text. So
   Prov. vi. 23, The commandment is a lamp, and the law is light.' It is
   that which keeps us from stumbling. So 2 Peter i. 19, We have also a
   more sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as
   unto a light that shineth in a dark place.' The world is a dark place.
   Ay! but now here is a light that shines in a dark place, and that is
   the Holy Scripture, the sure word of prophecy;' it showeth us our way
   to heaven, and prevents us from stumbling into hell.

   2. To prove it by types. Two types I shall mention; one is, Israel
   being directed by the pillar of a cloud; the other is, the lamp of the
   sanctuary.

   [1.] The type of Israel's being directed by the pillar of the cloud by
   day, the pillar of fire by night, till they came into the land of
   Canaan, Exod. xiii. 21. Still they moved up and down, hither and
   thither, as the pillar of cloud and pillar of fire went before them.
   Thus our whole course is to be ordered by God's direction. See how this
   type is expressed, Neh. ix. 19, The pillar of the cloud departed not
   from them by day to lead them in the way, neither the pillar of fire by
   night to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.' Mark,
   when they were in the wilderness, the pillar of cloud and fire showed
   them the way where they were to go; this is an emblem of the safe
   conduct the church may expect from Christ Jesus in all ages; God's
   pillar departed not from them by night nor day. So while we are
   travelling in the wilderness of this our pilgrimage, his word and
   Spirit is continued to us. When they entered into Canaan, that was a
   type of heaven, then this pillar of cloud was removed. It is notable,
   Josh, xiv., when Israel passed over Jordan, we do not read the pillar
   went before them, but the ark of God was carried before them. So when
   the church comes to heaven, the resting-place, then this conduct
   ceaseth; the word hath no more use. Jesus Christ, as the great
   shepherd, leads his flock into their everlasting fold.

   [2.] The other type was the lamp of the sanctuary; we read of that,
   Exod. xxvii. 20, 21. There was a great lamp hung upon the veil, to
   distinguish the holy of holies from the other part of the tabernacle,
   and was fed with pure oil-olive, and this lamp was prepared and trimmed
   up by the priest daily. Now what did this lamp signify? Mark the
   application. This pure olive-oil signified God's pure word; without the
   mixture of human traditions; this hung up in the veil, shined in the
   church, and every day it was prepared, furnished, set forth by them
   that are called thereunto, for the use of the faithful.

   3. Let me prove it by experience, that the word is such a sure
   direction.

   [1.] Because natural men have a sense of it, and upon that account fear
   it. See John iii. 20, 21, Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light,
   neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.'
   Natural men will not come to the word, they fear it as discovering, and
   therefore never feel it as refreshing. Evil-doers hate the light; they
   are afraid of the word lest it should convince them, and discover them
   to themselves; therefore they stand off, and shun all means of closing
   with it; there is such conviction in the oar, [6] a secret jealousy of
   the searching power that is in the word of God.

   [2.] Godly men do find a great deal of comfort and satisfaction from
   this light as to all the doubts and fears of the soul: Ps. xix. 8, The
   statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of
   the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.' All their scruples vanish;
   here is an apt and fit doctrine accommodated to the heart of man. A man
   hath never true and rational delight till he is fully satisfied in
   point of religion, till he can have rest for his soul, and commodious
   notions of God. Now, if you would have rest for your souls, Jer. vi.
   16, here it is, the children of God find it. There is a fair compliance
   in this doctrine with all those natural principles and ingrafted
   notions within us concerning God and his will; they find satisfaction
   in it to conscience, though not to fond curiosity; the one is
   necessary, the other dangerous and unprofitable. Christians! there is a
   great deal of difference between these two, satisfying conscience and
   satisfying curiosity, as much as between quenching the thirst of a
   sober man and satisfying the lust and appetite of a drunkard. Here is
   enough to satisfy conscience, a fair accommodation of excellent truths
   to a reasonable nature, truths becoming God, truths suiting with the
   heart of man, and therefore here they find it to be light, that is a
   sure direction. The wicked feel the discovery of it, and the saints
   feel the impression of it.

   [3.] We have this external and outward experience to assure us of our
   rule and light that shines in the word of God, because those that go
   against this light and direction do sensibly miscarry, and are sure to
   split themselves upon some rock or other. Our first parent, Adam, when
   he hearkened to the voice of the serpent rather than the voice of the
   Lord, destroyed himself and all his posterity. As long as he obeyed the
   word of God, he remained in a blessed estate in paradise, but when he
   gave heed to other counsels, he was cast out of paradise, and rendered
   liable to many sorrows, yea, eternal death. So all that walk in the
   imagination of their own hearts, and have not light from the word, they
   presently run themselves into sundry mischiefs. The young prophet is an
   instance of this, 1 Kings xiii. 21. To go to particular instances would
   be innumerable, every day's experience will furnish us with enough of
   this; they that will not take the light of God's word, stumble upon
   dark mountains, for God hath owned his word to a tittle, owned both the
   tables: Rom. i. 18, The wrath of God is revealed from heaven,' &c.;
   from heaven, by the effects of his wrath. If men be ungodly and
   unrighteous, they are punished; nay, not only in the general, but in
   particular: Heb. ii. 2, For if the word spoken by angels were
   steadfast'--why?--for every transgression and disobedience received a
   just recompense of reward.' By every transgression he means a sin of
   omission; by every disobedience, a sin of commission. And as he will do
   so for sins against the law, so sins against the gospel; that place
   where the gospel was first propounded smarted for the neglect of it: 1
   Thes. ii. 16, Wrath is come upon them to the uttermost,' for despising
   the gospel. And still God secures the certainty of our direction by new
   judgments; those that will go contrary to the word, turn aside to paths
   of their own, they perish in their devices.

   4. Let me prove it by reasons that certainly the word must needs be
   light, that is, a clear and sure direction. I prove it from the author,
   the instruments, and penmen, and from the ends why God hath given the
   word.

   [1.] From the author of it, it is God's word. Everything that comes
   from God hath some resemblance of his majesty: God is light, and in him
   there is no darkness at all,' 1 John i. 5. His word is light. If God
   would give us anything to direct us, it must needs be clear and sure,
   it must have light. As at first God gave reason to direct man: John i.
   4, That life was the light of men;' as it came from God, before it was
   weakened by the fall, it was a full direction, it discovered its
   author; and now since the fall, still it discovers its author.
   Conscience, which remains with us, it is called the candle of the
   Lord,' Prov. xx. 27. From a glorious sun now it is dwindled to a
   candle, yet it is called the candle of the Lord; it is a candle lighted
   by God himself. The understanding and conscience that is privy to our
   most secret motions, thoughts, and actions; though it may be maimed and
   lessened by sin, it is sensible of some distinction between good and
   evil, and acts God's part in the soul, sometimes condemning, sometimes
   approving, accusing and excusing by turns, Rom. ii. 15. But, alas! if
   we were only left to this light, we should be for ever miserable. The
   light of reason is too short for us now, and there is a double reason;
   partly, because our chief good and last end being altered by sin, we
   shall strangely mistake things, if we weigh them in the balance of the
   flesh, which we seek to please. Now our chief good is altered, or
   rather we are apt to mistake it; all our business is to please the
   flesh, and to gratify lust and appetite, Ps. xlix. 12. Therefore go to
   a man led by carnal and unsanctified reason, he shall put light for
   darkness, and darkness for light; good for evil, and evil for good,'
   Isa. v. 20. He shall confound the names and natures of things, so
   miserably grope in the dark, and not find out the way to true
   happiness, either stumbling, dashing his foot against a stone, or
   wander out of the way in a maze of a thousand uncertainties; therefore
   it is a blessed thing not to be left to this candle of reason, the
   light within us, for that will not guide us, but God heath drawn a
   straight line for us to heaven, which if we follow we cannot miss.
   Again, partly because man's condition since the fall is such that he
   needs a supernatural remedy; before he can be happy, he needs a
   redeemer. Now the gift of a redeemer depending upon the free grace of
   God, cannot be found out by natural light, for that can only judge of
   things necessary, and not of such things as depend upon the arbitrary
   love of God, therefore this light cannot guide, John iii. 16. Well,
   then, because the candle of the Lord that is within us is not enough to
   direct us, God hath set up a lamp in the sanctuary to give us light,
   and to guide us in the pursuit of true happiness, and that is the
   scripture. Now, if they have God for their author, surely they must
   needs be clear and full, for nothing indited by his Spirit can be dark,
   confused, and inconveniently expressed, either with respect to the
   things revealed, or to the persons to whom this revelation is made. For
   if God should speak darkly (here is my argument), especially in
   necessary things, it is either because God could not speak otherwise,
   or would not. The former is direct blasphemy; he that made the eye,
   cannot he see? and he that made the mouth, cannot he speak plainly and
   intelligibly to his people, so as to be understood by them? And the
   latter cannot be said, that God would not, for that is contrary to his
   goodness and love to mankind: Ps. xxv. 8, Good and upright is the Lord;
   therefore will he teach sinners in the way.' If this be true, that God
   is a just good God, he will teach us plainly; the Psalmist infers it,
   he is just, and will not lead us wrong; he is an upright God, and he is
   a good God; and therefore, though we have fallen from the state of our
   creation, though the candle of the Lord burn dim in our hearts since
   the fall, yet he is a good God, therefore he will show us the way. Now
   it is not to be imagined that there should not be light in the word of
   God, that that should be dark, confused, and unintelligible; that the
   most powerful and wise monarch, and most loving of all, that he should
   write a book to teach men the way to heaven, and do it so cloudily,
   that we cannot tell what to make of it. Therefore if God be the author,
   this book must be true; here must be light, a clear and sure direction
   to guide us in all our ways.

   [2.] I prove it by reason again, from the instruments used in this
   work. Shall I take those words for my groundwork? 2 Peter i. 21, For
   the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of
   God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;' that is, it is not the
   fancies or dictates of men, but the word of God; for they were holy
   men, and holy men guided by the Holy Ghost, and so guided as that they
   were moved, borne up by the special motion of the Spirit. Let me reason
   thus: those that God hath employed to deliver his mind to the world,
   look either to the prophets of the Old Testament or apostles of the
   New, and you will find them to be holy men, burning with zeal for God
   and love to souls; and it is not to be imagined that they would deliver
   God's mind so darkly that nobody could understand their meaning.
   Christians they were, not men that were to act a part of their own upon
   the stage of the world, not men that aimed at ostentation of wisdom and
   curiosity of science; but they were holy men, they were free from
   ambition and envy, and other such vile affections, which are wont to
   make writers to affect obscurity; therefore in all simplicity of style,
   plainness of heart, and faithfulness to their message, they minded
   their master's honour and the people's good; they renounced pomp of
   words and lofty speculations, minded that people might understand the
   mind of God published lay them. As they were holy men, so they were
   acted by the Spirit of God. Now the Spirit of God is not a spirit of
   darkness but a spirit of light, which gives understanding to all men,
   therefore they spake luminously and clearly. Nay, they were not only
   acted by the Spirit, but they were borne up by the Spirit, carried by
   the Holy Ghost while they were employed in this work, publishing the
   mind of God to the church; they were carried beyond the line of their
   natural spirits, by an extraordinary impulse infallibly borne up, so
   that they could not err and miscarry. Now from such holy men that were
   not swayed by ambition and private aims, so guided, so acted by the
   Spirit, what can be expected but what is sure, clear, and plain?

   [3.] I argue and reason again from the end of God in giving us the
   scriptures; all which doth clearly infer that here is a sure and plain
   direction that will lead you to heaven. There is a fourfold end
   wherefore God hath given us the scriptures:--

   (1.) That by this means heavenly doctrine might Be kept free from
   corruption, that men might not obtrude articles of faith upon us and
   fancies of their own brain, that heavenly doctrine might be put into a
   stated course and kept pure from corruption. When mankind sat in
   darkness and in the shadow of death, it was necessary that one way or
   other they should have light, that God by some way or other would
   reveal his mind to them, either by word of mouth or by writing. Now God
   did it by oracles and extraordinary messages at first, while there were
   but few truths revealed, and such as did not much burden the memory,
   and while men were long-lived, and so could a great while avouch their
   message from God, and while they were of great simplicity, and the
   church was confined to a few men, to a few families, within a small
   compass of ground, not liable to those miseries and changes now in
   latter days. Before Christ came it was fit God should send his
   messengers; but now in these latter days, when he hath spoken to us by
   his Son, Heb. i. 1, it is fit the rule of faith should be closed up. It
   is not for the honour of the Son of God that after him should come any
   extraordinary nuncio or ambassador from heaven, as if he had not fully
   discovered his Father's mind. Well, then, therefore God hath put all
   his messages into writing for the use of after-ages, and for this end
   that there might be some public standard for trying of things by. Now
   God's end would not be accomplished if this writing were not clear.
   Here is the argument, the world would be left at great uncertainties,
   far more than in old time, and so this end for preserving truth for the
   use and direction of the church would be wholly lost. Well, then, if
   God will make a writing serve instead of extraordinary messages, which
   brought their own evidence with them, certainly he will not put it into
   words liable to mistake, but that are intelligible. Wisdom saith, Prov.
   viii. 9, They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to
   them that find knowledge.' Certainly they that come in simplicity of
   heart, with a mind to learn God's will, not to cavil, they may know.

   (2.) God's end in setting forth the scripture was that it might be read
   of all ages and of all sexes, as the book of the law was to be read in
   the congregation before the men, women, little ones, and strangers,
   Deut. xxi.; from day to day it was read in the synagogue, Acts xv. 21;
   and God would have them teach their children, Deut. vi. 6; and Timothy
   is commended for reading the scriptures from his youth, 2 Tim. iii. 5.
   And the apostles do express themselves to be debtors both to the wise
   and unwise, to Greeks and barbarians,' Rom. i. 14, to speak wisdom to
   the wise and plainness to the simple; and St John he writes to children
   and young men and fathers, 1 John ii. 13. Well, then, here is my
   argument, if God would write a book to be read by men, women, children,
   all sorts, surely it is that all might understand, not that they might
   repeat it by rote, and toss the words of it in their mouths as parrots
   do words they understand not; surely, then, they are compiled to profit
   all.

   (3.) God's end in giving the word was for converting of men, or leaving
   them without excuse. Now take either end, and it shows there must be a
   plain direction. If for converting of men, then it must be so plain
   that it may be understood by them, for there is nothing gets to the
   heart but by the understanding: After I was instructed I smote upon my
   thigh.' And all influences are conveyed by light, and if God gains any
   heart it is by teaching and by light. Or if it were for leaving them
   without excuse, it must be by a clear revealing of his will, otherwise
   they might pretend obscurity. The apostle pleads this, 2 Cor. iv. 2-4;
   saith the apostle, there is such plain truth in the gospel that every
   man's conscience may take it up if he will; and if they cannot see the
   majesty of God in this doctrine they are blinded by Satan; the fault is
   not in gospel light, but in their own eyes; they cannot complain of
   God, but of themselves.

   (4.) The end is, that it might be a rule of faith and manners by which
   all doctrines are to be tried. A rule of faith: Isa. viii. 20, To the
   law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it
   is because there is no light in them.' And Acts xvii. 11, They received
   the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily,
   whether these things were so.' So to be a rule of manners: Gal. vi. 16,
   As many as walk according to this rule,' &c. There are many actions
   which God requireth of us that expose us to great difficulty and
   hazard. Now, before the heart be gained to them, we had need have a
   plain proof that it is the will of God; for who will venture his all
   unless he have a clear warrant, that knows whither he goes, and whither
   to look for amends, if he suffer the loss of all things? Thus there is
   light in the word.

   Secondly, But now it is a full direction, for David speaks it of his
   feet and path.

   1. In general observe this: it is not a light to our brains to fill us
   with empty notions, but a light to our feet to regulate our practice
   and to guide our actions, Jer. vi. 16. He doth not say, hearken after
   the true religion, but walk therein. For a man to study the scripture
   only to satisfy curiosity, only to know what is right and good, and not
   follow it with all his heart, is but to make a rod for his own back,
   and doth but cause his own condemnation to be sore and terrible, Luke
   xii. 47. To be able to dispute for truth and not lie under the power of
   it, to avoid heresy and live in vice, will never bring him to heaven,
   Gal. vi. 16. It is not them that are able to talk of it, but to walk
   according to this rule;' not to play with it, but to work with it.
   Knowledge and practice must be joined together; they do never well
   asunder, but excellent together.

   2. In our practice.

   [1.] Our path, our general choice. A man that consults with God's word,
   The Lord will teach him the way that he shall choose,' Ps. xxv. 12.
   Everything appointed to an end must have all things absolutely
   necessary to that end, else it is not perfect in its kind; though
   perfect to guide us to eternal life; therefore it must contain all
   things that belong or conduce to that end. It is not a rule given us to
   be rich or safe, but to be eternally happy.

   [2.] As it is a light to our path, so to our feet. How? In the
   particular actions that we perform, and in the particular conditions
   that we pass through.

   (1.) In the particular actions that we perform. Every action we go
   about must be guided by the word. Why? Because obedience in particular
   actions we are most apt to miscarry in. Many are wise in generals, but
   in particulars they quite mistake their way. We have general notions
   that we must be holy; ay! but we are not holy in all mariner of
   conversation,' 1 Peter i. 15. In every creek and turning of our lives,
   in all our actions of eating, drinking, sleeping, and waking, we are to
   be mindful and respect the command of God in all these. No path of a
   Christian's conversation but ought to savour of grace and holiness; not
   only his religious, but his common and civil actions. Every action is a
   step to heaven or hell, for this life is compared to a walk, and in a
   walk every step brings us onward in our way. Briefly, in every act,
   either sin or grace interposeth, therefore we had need look to every
   step, and still to walk according to rule.

   (2 ) It guides us in all the conditions that we pass through. In every
   age; here is milk for the weak, and strong meat for men of ripe age. In
   every calling, from the king to the lowest beggar. In every state of
   life, adversity, prosperity, still here is light for you.

   There are two parties whose interest it is to decry the clearness of
   scripture, papists and libertines. Papists, they are afraid to stand to
   this trial, they would bring all to the judgment of the church;
   therefore, it is for their interest that the scriptures were not a
   clear, safe, and a full direction. Libertines, they decry the clearness
   of scripture upon several grounds. Those that plead for a boundless
   toleration, what is their great argument? Nothing is certain in
   religion. If the word be a clear rule, then, &c.

SERMON CXIII.

   The word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.--Ver. 105.

   HERE I shall answer five objections that are made by cavillers.

   Object 1. First, If it be so clear a light, why do men so often mistake
   that have the scriptures, and consult with them? yea, why is there such
   differences among good men?

   Ans. I answer, in general, there is light in the scriptures, but there
   is darkness in men that are conversant about them. The object may be
   well represented when the faculty is not well disposed. There are
   defects in them to whom this discovery is made; though they have light,
   yet they want eyes. The sun giveth light enough, though blind men
   cannot see it; the word doth whatsoever is necessary on its own part.
   To the beholding of anything by the outward sense, there must not only
   be light to make the object conspicuous, but also a faculty of seeing
   in the eye; blind men cannot see at noonday, nor the sharpest-sighted
   at midnight. There is light in the scriptures surely, for God would not
   deal hypocritically with us that are his people; if he hath given us a
   rule, he would not wrap it up in darkness, so as we should not know his
   meaning; so that the defect is in us. This in general.

   But, secondly, there are many causes of men's mistake.

   1. Some come to the word with a presumption of their own wit, and
   leaning upon their own understanding, as if that should discover the
   whole counsel of God, and these God never undertook to teach: Ps. xxv.
   9, The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his
   way.' Those that, in a humble sense of their own nothingness, depend
   upon his direction, them will he teach: James i. 21, Receive with
   meekness the ingrafted word of God.' We have caution given us, and
   admonitions against pride and arrogance and self-dependence, Prov. iii.
   3-6.

   2. Many bring their prejudicate opinions along with them, and are
   biassed and prepossessed before they come to the word of God, and so do
   not so much take up the sense which the scriptures offer, as seek to
   impose their own sense on them, and regulate the scriptures to their
   own hearts, not regulating their hearts and principles and senses
   according to the word of God. Optimus ille lector est, saith Hilary,
   qui dictorum intelligentiam expectat, &c. That mind which is
   preoccupied with evil opinions, and enslaved to preconceived
   conclusions, they do not take anything from the word, but impose
   something upon it which God never revealed there. If the weights be
   equal, yet if the balance be not equipendent, wrong may be done. They
   come with an idol in their own hearts, Ezek. xiv. 2, as those that
   would ask counsel of the Lord, that were resolved beforehand, Jer.
   xlii. While we look through the spectacles of our own fancies and
   preconceptions, the mind, poisoned with error, seemeth to see what we
   see not.

   3. Some search the scriptures not out of any love to the truth, or to
   know the mind of God, but to oppose it rather, and so seek a pretence
   from thence to justify their private faction in way of opposition
   against God. The devil gets scripture to wrest it to his own purpose,
   Mat. iv. 6. They read not to be better, but to cavil, and put a greater
   varnish upon the devil's cause, as Julian did search the scriptures to
   pick an advantage against the true religion, and scoff at them that
   professed it; and Herod inquired after the place where Jesus was born,
   not to adore him, but to kill him, Mat. ii. 8. Our great rule is, John
   xvii. 17, Sanctify them by thy truth; thy word is truth.' When you come
   to study the scriptures, to be the better for them, and not to cavil,
   then you are in the way to find profit from them.

   4. Some come to the word leavened with some carnal affections, and so
   their hearts are blinded by their lusts and passion: 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4,
   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the God
   of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.' There
   is evidence enough in the truth, but their hearts are wedded to their
   sins, and so cannot see it; they are ambitious, and seek after honour
   and worldly greatness; and the whole bent and scope of the scripture
   being against their design, they can never have a perfect understanding
   of it; their hearts are full of avarice, earthly-mindedness, and some
   other beloved sin that they cherish, which doth defile all that they
   touch, even the very word of God. Hag. ii. 13, A man that was unclean
   by a dead body, whatsoever he touched was also unclean, even holy
   things; and, Titus i. 15, To the impure all things are impure;' and so
   by the just judgment of God are blinded and hardened in their own
   prejudices, for the light they have hindereth them from discerning the
   truth.

   5. Some content themselves with some superficial apprehensions, and do
   not dig deep in the mines of knowledge, and therefore no wonder they
   mistake in many things: Prov. ii. 4, 5, If thou seekest her as silver,
   and searchest for her as for hid treasures, then shalt thou understand
   the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.' No excellent
   things are to be had without pain and industry and search; certainly
   the knowledge of God's word must cost us great pains.

   6. Where men are right in the main, and give diligence to know God's
   mind, there will be mistakes in lesser things. All have not parts
   alike, and gifts and graces alike, and therefore there is some variety
   of opinions and interpretations of scripture among the godly wise.
   Every man is not so happy to be so well studied, nor hath not that
   ability to understand, nor so furnished with acquired helps of arts and
   tongues, nor such a degree of the Spirit. There is a difference in age,
   growth, and experience among good men; some are babes, and some grown
   in years in Christianity, Phil. iii. 15. Grace is bewrayed in
   knowledge, as well as in holiness.

   Object. 2. If there be such a light in the scriptures, what need is
   thereof the Spirit?

   Ans. I answer--The scriptures are the means of light, the Spirit is the
   author of light, both together enlighten the eyes, Ps. xix. 8. These
   two must be taken in conjunction, not in exclusion. To pretend to the
   Spirit and neglect the scriptures, makes way for error and fond
   conceits: Isa. viii. 20, To the law and to the testimony, if they speak
   not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.'
   Light is not contrary to light; so to study the scriptures, and neglect
   the Spirit, who searcheth out the deep things of God,' 1 Cor. ii. 11,
   leaveth us in darkness about God's mind. The object to be known is
   fixed in the scriptures, but the faculty that knoweth must be
   enlightened by the Spirit. There is a literal understanding of the
   scriptures and a spiritual understanding, 1 Cor. ii. 14. Now, as to the
   spiritual understanding of them, there needs the Spirit, for the
   natural man cannot understand the things of the Spirit;' so that here
   is a fair correspondence between the word and the Spirit.

   Object. 3. If the scriptures be so plain, what need of the ministry?

   Ans. 1. I answer--It is God's institution, and we must submit to it,
   though we could see no reason for it. That it is God's institution is
   plain, for he hath set some in the church, not only apostles and
   prophets, but pastors and teachers, to apply scriptures to us; and, 1
   Cor. i. 21, It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them
   that believe.' If there were no reason but this, because it is God's
   institution, we should submit to it.

   2. The use of the ministry is to explain and vindicate truth. Men
   darken counsel with words, and render plain things obscure by their
   litigations and unprofitable debates. Now they are set for the defence
   of the truth, eis apolo'gian, Phil. i. 7. And the ministry must be
   antecho'menos, Titus i. 9, Able to convince the gainsayers;' good at
   holding and drawing; it is the human help for weak understandings. The
   eunuch was reading, and could not tell what to make of it, then God
   sent him an interpreter, Acts viii. Now God's help should not be
   despised; when he will employ men to solve doubts, to guide us in our
   way to heaven, we should thankfully accept of it, rather than quarrel
   at the institution.

   3. They are of use to apply generals to particular cases, and to teach
   us how to deduce genuine inferences from those truths laid down in the
   scriptures. Mal. ii. 7, in this sense it is said, The priest's lips
   should preserve knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth;
   for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.' God hath appointed this
   office to some, to solve the doubts that do arise about particular
   exigencies and cases, and to make out the mind of God to his people,
   otherwise they need go no farther than the tables and books of Moses to
   seek the law; but God hath appointed some in the church that are
   skilled in consequences and deductions, to raise matter therefrom, so
   that it is a minister's work to open and explain scripture.

   4. There is a use of the ministry to keep doctrines still afoot in the
   church, and to keep us in remembrance. Ministers are the Lord's
   remembrancers; it is a great part of their office to mind people of
   their duty. The word is a light, but it must be set in the candlestick
   of the church; they are to hold out the light for our direction and
   guidance.

   5. There is a peculiar blessing and efficacy to a Christian from their
   calling: Mat. xxviii. 20, Lo, I am with you to the end of the world.'

   Object. 4. It is said, 2 Peter iii. 16, that there are some things hard
   to be understood, therefore how should it be a clear rule to us? There
   upon many take occasion to tax the scriptures of obscurity, and cry out
   that nothing is certain in religion, and so hinder and discourage men
   from the study of the word.

   Ans. 1. I answer--The apostle saith there are dusno'eta, some things
   hard to be understood, but doth not say there are ano'eta, things that
   cannot be understood; not there are things impossible to be understood,
   but there is some difficulty in them, to exercise our diligence, to
   subdue our pride, for the humbling of us, for the prevention of the
   contempt of things easy and plain, that are soon despised, to excite us
   to prayer for knowledge, to avoid satiety in this holy banquet.

   2. The second thing that I answer is this; he doth not say there are
   polla`, but ti'na; many things, but some. Though there are some things
   propounded which are difficult, to exercise our diligence, yet other
   things are plainly delivered, to invite our search. Multa sunt aperta
   et manifesta (saith Austin) unde aperiuntur, &c. Though there are some
   things obscure, there are many things will help to clear them, and
   whatsoever is necessary to salvation is clear. There are some things
   hidden like spots in the moon and stones in the earth, things that
   serve for plenitude of knowledge and curiosity. He saith these things
   are hid, but now things necessary to salvation are made obvious to us;
   as water and bread, they are not hard to come by, but gold and silver
   is hid in the bowels of the earth; and therefore though there be some
   things hard to be understood, he doth not say they are not to be
   understood. Now the question between us and the papists is not, whether
   some things in the scripture be obscure, but whether they be so obscure
   as that people ought not to read them, or cannot with any profit, and
   that there can be no certainty thence deduced? As to the defining
   things controverted in matters necessary to salvation, we say there are
   some things hard to be understood, to keep us humble, to quicken us to
   pray for the Spirit, yet for the most part God's mind is plain and easy
   to be understood by them that humbly depend upon Christ teaching in the
   use of the appointed means.

   Object. 5. Another objection is from experience; a poor Christian
   complaineth, as Job xix. 8, He hath set darkness in my path that I
   cannot pass.' They would fain know the mind of God in some particular
   cases, but they cannot see it.

   Ans. I answer--This darkness of ours should not be urged to the
   disparagement of the word. We are under many doubts, we are divided
   between light and interest, we puzzle and grope, and would reconcile
   the light of the scriptures and our interests together, but this should
   not disparage the word. The scriptures complain of our darkness, not of
   its own, and the saints always say, Lord, do not make a plainer law;
   but open our eyes, in the 18th verse of this psalm; this is
   Chrysostom's gloss upon that place. When a man walketh in the way of
   his own heart, his way may be darkness, and he may stumble, and know
   not whither he goeth. But you that give up yourselves sincerely to the
   directions of his word, he will make your path clear and plain before
   you; that is, when you seek nothing but God's glory, and your own
   eternal salvation for your end, and come with a humble meek mind to
   seek God's counsel, being free from the preoccupations of
   self-conceits, being resolved to follow God's directions whatever they
   be, and use that diligence which is necessary; you will not be long
   kept in the dark.

   Use 1.--[1.] To inform us how to answer this question, how to know
   whether the scriptures be the word of God. It shows itself, and
   evidenceth itself to be so; for it is a light that discovers itself,
   and all things else, without any other testimony. When the sun is up,
   there needs no witness and proof that it is light. Let the least child
   bring a candle into a room, and as it discovers other things, so it
   discovers itself. So the word of God is that which discovers itself to
   us, yea, it hath a self-evidencing light.

   [2.] If the word be a light, it informs us, then, there is none that
   are above the scriptures. There is a fond conceit that men take up,
   that the scriptures are for novices and young beginners, not for strong
   Christians. David was no novice, yet he saith, Thy word is a light.'
   And Daniel was no novice, yet he got understanding by the prophecy of
   the prophet Jeremiah, Dan. ix. 2. Timothy was no novice, who was to
   give attendance to reading, and exhortation, and doctrine,' 1 Tim. iv.
   13. Aye! but what is meant by that place, 2 Peter i. 19? We have a more
   sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto
   a light that shineth in a dark place.' From thence many gather that as
   soon as Christ is revealed in us, we should not look after the
   scriptures, for it is said, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise
   in your hearts.' Some understand this place of the light of glory, and
   others of the light of the gospel; you do well to take heed to the Old
   Testament light, till you have the New Testament light, which is most
   agreeable to the mind of God. For my part, I pitch upon the former, and
   shall understand it of the dawning of eternity, or Christ's second
   coming, which is called in scripture a day which shall then begin and
   never be ended, after which there is no night, nor any other day, but a
   blessed eternity; and sometimes it is called the day,' 2 Tim. iv. 8,
   and that day,' 1 Thes. v.4; and Christ is called the bright morning
   star,' Rev. xxii. 16, and the glorious [7] shall shine like the morning
   stars,' Dan. xii. 3, and Rev. ii. 28. Our happiness is expressed by a
   day-star; so that the meaning is, take heed unto this word until the
   day of eternity dawn upon you, till you come to the light of glory,
   till you have a greater light than that of the gospel.

   Now, I rather pitch upon this interpretation, because they to whom the
   apostle wrote were converted Jews, and did not only own the Old
   Testament, but had already received the gospel light, the day-star was
   risen upon their hearts, so that he bids them take heed to the sure
   word of prophecy, till the light of glory was revealed to them. I know
   there are some divines understand it of a more clear and plentiful
   knowledge of the gospel, who take prophecy to be the scriptures of the
   Old Testament that they were to take heed to, till the gospel light did
   arise upon them; and the times of the Old Testament were called night,
   Rom. xiii. 12, but now the gospel time is called day. But if it be
   understood thus, then some say that the law must be cast off when the
   gospel appeared to them, because it is said, until the day.' Those
   divines explain themselves safely enough herein, for, say they, until
   doth not always note terminum temporis, the end of time, but
   continuationem actus, the continuation of the act, until the time, and
   afterwards, as it is spoken in other scriptures, their sin shall not be
   blotted out till they die,' that is never; but for the former reason
   that I have given before, I think it is meant of the light of glory.

   Use 2. Reproof.--[1.] Of those that walk in the midst of this light,
   and yet perceive no more of the things of God, than if they were in
   darkness, these lose the benefit which God vouchsafeth to them: John i.
   5, The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it
   not;' and John iii. 19, The light is come into the world, and men loved
   darkness rather than light.' It had been better for them they had never
   heard of the scriptures, and that God had never set up such a lamp in
   the church. These men believe the word of God is a light and a lamp,
   yet never take care of, nor give heed to it; they are careless, and
   never measure their actions according to this rule.

   [2.] It reproves those that set up another rule, and look for an
   infallible interpreter.

   (1.) Those that set up reason instead of the word of God. Alas! this is
   an imperfect rule; these men would bring down all things before the
   tribunal of their own reason; these are not disciples of Christ, but
   masters; they will not be taught by the directions of the word, but by
   their own dark hearts. I have told you the candle of the Lord did burn
   bright within us; but alas! now it is weakened by sin, it is an
   imperfect irrational thing, we can never be saved by it.

   (2.) Others are guided by their passions and lusts; this is their
   direction and their lamp; this will surely lead them to utter darkness:
   If you live after the flesh, you shall die,' Rom. viii. 13.

   (3.) Some take the counsel and example of others, this will leave them
   comfortless, and make them fall into the snare.

   (4.) Some go to witches in straits, as the prophet reproves such, Isa.
   viii. 19, 20, Should not a people seek unto their God?'

   (5.) Others expect new revelations from heaven to counsel them; they
   would converse with angels now God hath spoken to us by his Son: Gal.
   i. 8, If an angel from heaven should bring another gospel than that
   which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.'

   Use 3. Caution to enterprise nothing but what you have a warrant for
   out of the word of God. When you are going about any action, say, Where
   is my warrant? If I do it upon my own brain, I must stand to my own
   hazard; and all the evil that comes upon me, it is the fruit of my own
   counsel. Num. xxvii. 21, the priest was to ask counsel of the Lord, who
   shall go out, and who shall go in; and 1 Sam. xxiii. 9. 10. To do
   things with a doubting conscience, with an uncertainty, whether it be
   good or bad, it is a sin; for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin;'
   still seek your direction from the word.

   Use 4.--[1.] It exhorts us to bless God, and be thankful for this
   light: Isa. ix. 2, The people that sat in darkness saw great light.'.
   There is the same difference between the church and other places, as
   there was between Egypt and Goshen, Exod. x. 23. Here is light, and in
   other places thick darkness. What a mercy it is that we have present
   direction, a light to guide us here in grace, that will bring us to
   glory. Give thanks to God for so great a benefit.

   [2.] Walk according to the directions of the word; walk in the light,'
   Eph. v. 8; believe it, Heb. iv. 2, the true and infallible truth that
   came out of God's mouth; and then apply it; say, This truth which is
   spoken is spoken to me, Mat. xiii. 37, and urge thy heart with the
   duties of it; this was spoken for our learning, be persuaded of this
   truth, and so walk and so do, and you shall not find any miscarriage, 1
   Cor. xv. 58. Here is my warrant and my direction, I will keep to it,
   though it expose me to many hazards and straits, I know it will be made
   up at last, it will not be lost labour to do what God biddeth thee to
   do.

SERMON CXIV.

   I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous
   judgments.--Ver. 106.

   IN the former verse David had commended the word for a sure direction;
   it is a light and a lamp. How so? Not only by God's designation and
   appointment, but by David's choice, It was a light to my feet, and a
   lamp to my steps.' Now, in this verse, he speaks of his firmness and
   constancy to that choice; I have taken thy word for my guidance and
   direction, and there he did resolve to stick. His constancy was
   grounded upon a vow, or upon a promissory oath, which he saw no cause
   to retract or repent of: I have sworn, and I will perform it,' &c.

   In which words you may observe--

   1. The strength of David's resolution and purpose, expressed in his
   oath; not I must, or I will keep, but I have sworn, &c.

   2. The matter of this purpose or oath, and that was to keep God's
   judgments.

   3. One great motive and reason that inclined him so to do, in the word,
   thy righteous judgments; the marvellous equity that was to be observed
   in the things commanded by God.

   4. The conscience that lay upon him of observing this oath, I will
   perform it. As if he had said, I saw a great deal of reason to make the
   promise so solemnly to God, and I see no reason at all to retract it.

   Four points I shall observe:--

   1. That it is not only lawful, but good and profitable, to bind our
   selves to our duty by a vow, solemnly declared purpose, and holy oath;
   so David, I have sworn.

   2. That this help of an oath or vow should be used in a matter lawful,
   weighty, and necessary, I have sworn,' saith David; but what hath he
   sworn? To keep thy righteous judgments. A great duty which God had
   enjoined him in his covenant.

   3. Those that are entered into the bond of a holy oath must religiously
   observe and perform what they have sworn to God: I have sworn, and I
   will perform.

   4. That we may perform our oaths, and lie under a sense and conscience
   of our engagements to God, it is good that they should be often revived
   and renewed upon us; for so doth David here recognise his oath, I have
   sworn that, &c.

   Doct. 1. That it concerns us sometimes to bind ourselves to God, and
   the duty that we owe to him, by an oath.

   1. That it is lawful so to do appears from God's injunction, and the
   practice of the saints.

   [1.] From God's injunction. He hath commanded us to accept of the
   gospel covenant, and not barely so, but to submit unto the seals and
   rites by which it is confirmed, which submission of ours implieth an
   oath made to God. Baptism is our sacramentum militare, sacramental vow,
   our oath of allegiance to God; and therefore it is called, 1 Peter iii.
   21, epero'tema. The answer of a good conscience towards God,' an answer
   upon God's demands in the covenant. God does, as it were, in the
   covenant of grace, put us to the question, Will you renounce all your
   sins, and all the vanities you have doted upon? And we answer to God,
   enter into a solemn oath, that we will renounce sin, that we will
   accept of Christ as our Saviour, and will walk before him in all holy
   obedience. Among the Romans, when any soldier was pressed for war, he
   took an oath to serve his captain faithfully, and not to forsake him,
   and then he was called miles per sacramentum, a soldier by sacrifice or
   by oath; and sometimes one took an oath for all the rest, and the
   others only said, The same oath he took, the same do I; and these were
   called milites per conjurationem, et milites evocati. Thus every
   Christian is a professed soldier of Christ; he hath sworn to become the
   Lord's, to cleave faithfully to him; and this oath, that it may not be
   forgotten, is renewed at the Lord's supper, where again we solemnly
   engage, by the public rites that are there used, to stand to our
   covenant. We do not only come and take God's enfeoffment, take a pledge
   out of God's hands, to be assured of the privileges of the covenant,
   but we bind ourselves to perform the duty thereof; for as the blood of
   the beast. Exod. xxiv. 7, 8, that was offered in the sacrifice, which
   is called there the blood of the covenant, was sprinkled not only upon
   the altar, to show that God was engaged to bless, but sprinkled half
   upon the people, to show they were engaged to obey; there was a
   confirmation of that promise made to God, All that the Lord hath
   commanded us, that will we do.' Well, now, if God thought such a course
   necessary and profitable for us, certainly we may upon occasion use the
   like means for our confirmation, for our strengthening in the work of
   obedience. That there is such a vow expressed or implied in every
   prayer may be easily made good in the whole tenor of our Christianity;
   therefore certainly it is lawful so to do, to make our duty more urgent
   and explicit upon our souls, by solemn vow and serious oath of
   dedication of ourselves to God's use and service.

   [2.] The practice of the saints, who have publicly and privately
   engaged themselves to God, do show the lawfulness of it. Public
   instances: 2 Chron. xv. 12-14, They entered into a covenant to seek the
   Lord God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and they
   sware unto the Lord,' &c. So in Josiah's time: 2 Chron. xxxiv. 31, And
   the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the Lord to
   walk after the Lord, and keep his commandments,' &c. So Neh. x. 29,
   They entered into an oath to walk in God's laws.' And for private
   oaths, we have David's instance here in the text; and Job xxxi. 1, I
   made covenant with mine eyes.' He had bound himself by a holy vow and
   purpose to guard his senses, and take heed his heart did not take fire
   by the gazing of his eye, that it was not inflamed with lust and sin.

   2. That it is convenient so to do.

   [1.] To answer God's love and condescension to us in the covenant. God
   thinks he can never be bound fast enough to us, and therefore
   interposeth by an oath. An oath is properly conversant about a doubtful
   matter, of which there is some question or scruple, which cannot
   otherwise be decided; then the law saith, he should give his oath to
   his neighbour. Why then doth the Lord swear? Is there any doubtfulness
   in his promises? No; the apostle saith, Heb. vi. 18, the Lord swears,
   being willing over and above to give the heirs of promise ample
   satisfaction. Now for God, that cannot lie, and whose word is above all
   assurance, to stoop to us, and put himself to an oath, certainly this
   should work upon our hearts, and draw from us some answerable return on
   our part, there being great and visible danger of our breaking with
   God, none of God's breaking with us; therefore, that we may not play
   fast and loose with him, we should come under this engagement to him of
   vow and public promise to God.

   [2.] To testify our affection to his service, we should put ourselves
   under the most high and sacred bonds that can be found out. Many have
   some slight and wandering motions towards God, and cold purposes of
   serving him, which soon vanish, and come to nothing; but now it argueth
   the heart is more thoroughly bent and set towards God, and that we have
   a deep sense of our duty, when we seriously confirm our purpose by a
   vow and holy oath. There are divers sorts of men in the world, some
   that are of that spirit as to break all bonds, cast away all cords, and
   think they can never be loose enough in point of religion, Ps. ii. 3.
   They seek to deface and blot out of their conscience the natural sense
   which they have of religion and of their duty to God, and so give up
   themselves headlong to all manner of impiety. There are others have
   some cold approbation of the way of God, and which manifests itself by
   some faint, weak, and wavering purposes, and slight attempts upon
   religion, but are soon discouraged, and never come to a fixed
   resolution, or serious dedication or surrender of themselves to the
   Lord's use. Now, a gracious heart thinks it can never be bound fast
   enough to God, therefore doth not only approve the ways of God, or
   desire to walk therein, but issues forth a purpose, a practical decree
   m his soul. Besides the approbation of conscience, there is a desire of
   heart, _and this desire backed with a purpose, and this promise backed
   with an oath, which is the highest way of obligation; and thus doth he
   dedicate himself to the Lord and his service, in the strictest way of
   expressing his consent, for an oath binds more than a promise.

   3. It is very profitable so to do, because of our backwardness,
   laziness, and fickleness.

   [1.] Because of our backwardness; we need to thrust forth the heart
   into the ways of obedience, for we hang off from God. Though we are his
   by every kind of right and title, yet we are very slow of heart to do
   his will, and therefore an oath is profitable to increase the sense of
   our duty; a threefold cord is not easily br6ken. Now there is a triple
   tie and bond upon a man.

   (1.) There is God's natural right that he hath over us and to our
   service, the sovereignty and dominion that he hath over us. We are not
   free as to obedience before the oath, but are bound by creation; for
   God hath created us, not only as he created other things, ultimately
   and terminatively, but immediately, for his service. All things were
   created for his glory, so that ultimately they are for his use; but the
   proper end and use wherefore man was created was for the immediate
   service of God. He that planteth a vine expecteth fruit from it. By
   continual preservation; he giveth us maintenance, and therefore justly
   expecteth service. By redemption, as having bought us with a dear
   price, 1 Cor. vi. 20. From all which there resulteth a natural duty
   which we owe to him as our sovereign, and he may command us what he
   will.

   (2.) There is the bond of voluntary consent, that our duty may be more
   active and urging upon our hearts. God doth not only inter pose his own
   authority and command us to keep his laws diligently, Ps. cxix. 4, but
   requires a consent on the creature's part. All the treaties and tenders
   of grace are made to draw us to this consent, that we may voluntarily
   and by the inclination of our own hearts present our selves before the
   Lord, and yield up ourselves to his service, Rom. vi. 13.

   (3.) Besides this there is the bond of an oath, which is the strictest
   way of voluntary resolution and highest engagement that a man can make;
   therefore when the heart is so backward, and hangs off from God and
   duties we owe to him, it is good to declare our assent in the most
   solemn way. That the saints have made use of purposes thus solemnly
   declared in case of backwardness appears in scripture. David, when his
   heart was shy of God's presence, and had sinned away his liberty and
   peace, and so could not endure to come to God, what course doth he
   take? He issues forth a practical decree in his soul, and binds his
   heart by a fixed purpose that he would come to God, Ps. xxxii. 5. So
   Acts xi. 23; he exhorteth them with full purpose of heart to draw nigh
   to God; it should be the fixed resolution of the soul. And Jer. xxx.
   21, Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the
   Lord.' We should lay the strongest bonds and engagements we possibly
   can, whereby God's authority may be backed, and his right confirmed, by
   the most solemn assent that we can make.

   [2.] In regard of our fickleness and inconstancy; we are slippery, off
   and on with God: A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways,'
   James i. 8. We have unsettled hearts, and when we meet with temptations
   from without we shall soon give up at the first assault, and so be now
   for God, anon for Satan; therefore this is a lawful and sanctified
   means to help us to constancy. Indeed, before we come to this fixed
   settled purpose we lie open to temptation; and when our first heats are
   spent we tire and wax weary in the Lord's service, therefore we had
   need make the most sacred engagements to God, that we may keep to God
   and persist in our duty. Now a solemn oath seems to be the most
   serviceable for this use. Why? For it implies a severe and dreadful
   imprecation. In an oath God is not only invoked as a witness but as a
   judge. We appeal to his omnisciency for the sincerity of our hearts in
   making promise, and to his vindictive power as a judge if we shall act
   contrary to what we have sworn. Saith Plutarch, Every oath implies a
   curse, or a desire of vengeance, in case of the breach of that oath;
   therefore it is said, Neh. x. 29, They entered into a curse to walk in
   God's law;' that is, a curse in case of disobedience. And this was
   supposed to be the meaning of that rite by which they were wont to
   confirm their covenants. Jer. xxxiv. 18, when the calf was cut in twain
   they did as it were devote themselves thus to be cut in twain and torn
   in pieces, and to be destroyed as that creature was, if they violated
   the covenant thus solemnly sworn; and though this imprecation or
   execration should not be expressed, yet every promissory oath
   necessarily implies a curse in case of unfaithfulness. Well, now, this
   is a good means to keep us constant when we have bound ourselves to God
   upon such strict terms; therefore some derive o'rkos from ei'rgo, to
   hedge, because it is as a hedge to keep us within the compass of our
   duty, and confirm our hearts in that which is good. Well, then, because
   of our fickleness it is not enough to leave the soul to the mere bonds
   of duty, but confirm our resolution by an oath. I may illustrate this
   by that passage, when Hooper the blessed martyr was at the stake, and
   the officers came to fasten him to it, saith he, Let me alone; God that
   hath called me hither, he will keep me from stirring; and yet, because
   I am but flesh and blood, I am willing; tie me fast, lest I stir. So we
   may say in this case, though the authority of God commanding his right
   in us and sovereignty over us is reason enough to enforce the duty we
   owe to him, and bind the heart and sway the conscience, yet because of
   the weakness of our hearts we should make this bond the more urging
   upon us by a solemn consent, thus ratified and confirmed by the
   solemnity of an oath, vow, or promise made to God.

   [3.] It will be very profitable because of our laziness; by resolution
   we are quickened to more seriousness and diligence. When a man hath the
   bond of an oath upon him, then he will make a business of religion,
   whereas otherwise he will make but a sport and a thing he only regards
   by the by. Oh! but when his heart is fixed this is the thing he will
   look after, Ps. xxvii. 4. When our heart is set upon a thing we follow
   it close; and when it is so set upon a thing as that we have bound
   ourselves by the strictest bonds we can lay upon our heart, it will
   engage us more seriously.

   Doct. 2. That this help of an oath or holy vow should be used in a
   matter lawful, weighty, necessary.

   1. In a matter lawful. There is a vow and covenanting in that which is
   evil; as those that bound themselves with a curse that they would not
   eat nor drink until they had killed Paul,' Acts xxiii. 12. And many
   will make a vow and promise with themselves that they will never
   forgive their neighbour such an offence. Arid we read of a covenant
   made with death and hell: whether it be meant of the king of Babylon or
   no, as he is called death and hell by the prophet, some evil covenant
   is intended thereby; and thus a vow is made the bond of iniquity, and
   must be broken rather than kept, or indeed it must not be made. To vow
   that which is sinful, this is like the hire of a whore, or the price of
   a dog offered to the Lord for a vow, Deut. xxiii. 18.

   2. It must be in a matter weighty, necessary, and acceptable unto God.
   There are two things come under our vow and oath:--

   [1.] That which is our necessary work, religious obedience to God in
   the way of his commandment; for this is not a rash and unnecessary vow,
   but that we were sworn to in baptism; this is that which David
   promiseth here, I have sworn, and I will perform it, to keep thy
   righteous judgments.' And this is the vow which Jacob made, though
   there was something of a particularity he adds to it, Gen. xxviii. 20,
   21; but the substance of it was this, If the Lord will be with me, and
   keep me in this way that I go, then shall the Lord be my God.' There
   are many that will vow and promise trifles, and so infringe their own
   Christian liberty, and needlessly bind themselves in chains of their
   own making, where God hath left them free. This help is for the weighty
   things of Christianity, not for by-matters. Those monkish by-laws have
   filled the world with superstition, not with religion, while they have
   been only conversant about some indifferent things, as pilgrimages,
   abstinences from meats and marriages, wherein they place the height of
   Christian perfection.

   [2.] Helps to obedience. Such things as we shall find to be helps, and
   do conduce to the removal of impediments, such should come under a vow
   and solemn promise to God: Job xxxi. 1, I made a covenant with my
   eyes;' that was a help to the preserving of his chastity, that he would
   not allow himself to gaze, to take a view of the beauty of others. And
   the apostle, when it was for the glory of God, makes a vow or kind of
   solemn promise that he would take no maintenance in Achaia, 2 Cor. xi,
   10; he solemnly binds himself, that he might not hinder the progress of
   the gospel. So when we find our heart ready to betray us by this or
   that evil occasion, we may in this case inter pose a vow and promise,
   but then with this caution, that we do not unreasonably destroy our
   Christian liberty, and so occasion a snare to our souls, and that we do
   not think this to be a perfect cure of these distempers, while we
   neglect the main things; as many will make a vow to play no more at
   such a game, or drink no more at such a house, or use such a creature,
   or come into such a particular company, and so place all their religion
   in these things; this is but like cutting off the branches when the
   root remains, or stopping one hole in a leaky or ruinous ship and
   vessel, when everywhere it is ready to let in water upon us, and to be
   broken in pieces. Therefore when you rest in those by-matters, without
   resolving to cleave to God in a course of obedience, it but like
   mending a hole in the wall of a house when the whole building is on
   fire, or troubling ourselves with a sore finger when we are languishing
   of a consumption; it is but stopping this or that particular sin when
   the whole soul lies under the power and slavery of the kingdom of
   Satan.

   Object. But here is a doubt may arise, How can I promise to keep God's
   law, since it is not in my power to do it exactly? it is impossible.

   Ans. I. When David saith, I have sworn,' &c., he speaks not from a
   presumption of his own strength, but only declareth the sense of his
   duty, and useth his oath as a sanctified means to bind his heart to
   God; and therefore it is not to exclude the power of God's grace, or to
   presume of his own strength: God's assistance is best expected in God's
   way.

   2. Such vows and promises they are always to be interpreted to be made
   in the sense of the covenant of grace, for no particular voluntary or
   accessory covenant of ours can take away the general covenant wherein
   we stand engaged to God, but rather it must be included in it.
   Therefore when David saith, I will keep thy righteous judgments,' he
   means according to the sense of the covenant of grace, that is,
   expecting help for duties and pardon for failings.

   [1.] As expecting help from God, for so the new covenant gives strength
   to observe what it requires. Lex jubet, evangelium juvat--the law
   enforceth duty, the covenant of grace helps us to perform the duty
   required of us. The gospel it is a ministration of the Spirit,' 2 Cor.
   iii. 8, and therefore promissory oaths, according to the sense of the
   new covenant, are made with a confidence upon the Lord's strength and
   assistance.

   [2.] Seeking pardon for his failings. Infirmities may stand with the
   covenant of grace, provided we crave mercy and recover ourselves by
   repentance, and so make no final breach with God; therefore this is a
   keeping according to the measure of grace received, and as human
   frailty will permit.

   Briefly, then, when are sins to be looked upon as infirmities, and not
   as perjuries and breach of covenant?

   Ans. When we would not voluntarily yield to the least sin; but in case
   of great sin, we grow more watchful, more humble, more holy; when our
   falls are such as David's when he had fallen foully: Ps. lvi. 6, Now
   thou shalt make me to know wisdom.' When upon our failings we are more
   ashamed of ourselves, more afraid of our weakness, more earnest to
   renew our former resolutions, more careful to wait upon God for grace
   to perform what he hath required of us, more watchful, more
   circumspect; when we begin to grow wise by our own smarting, in such
   cases an oath is not broken. Look, as every failing of the wife doth
   not dissolve the marriage covenant, so every failing on our part doth
   not dissolve the covenant between God and us; and therefore, though
   there will be some infirmities, but yet when we are careful to sue out
   our pardon in the name of Christ Jesus, and you shall by your failings
   be more watchful, circumspect, then we keep the covenant in a gospel
   sense.

   Doct. 3. That when we have sworn obedience to God, we must religiously
   perform and observe what we have sworn to God.

   So Ps. lxxvi. 11, Vow and pay unto the Lord.' When we come under the
   bond of a vow, we must be careful to make payment; it is a binding upon
   the heart. See how it is expressed, Num. xxx. 2, If a man vow a vow
   unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall
   not break his word.' When we have bound ourselves with a bond, that is,
   when we have increased our bonds (for the ingeminating words in the
   Hebrew doth exceedingly increase the sense). When a man is bound upon a
   bond he should not play fast and loose with God, but be very careful to
   perform what he hath sworn. God, on his part, hath sworn to the
   covenant, and he is constant in all his promises, and he certainly
   expects the like constancy from us, especially when we are so deeply
   bound, not only by his laws and obligation of his mercies, but by the
   solemn consent of our own vows. We have bound ourselves, then, to keep
   them, whether we will or no. Now, what reasons are there why we must
   perform?

   1. The same motives that inclined us at first to take our oath should
   persuade us to keep it whatever falls out. After trial we shall see no
   cause to repent of our resolution, for God is ever the same that he
   was, and his commands are ever the same in all his righteous judgments,
   holy, just, good, profitable to the creature. Christians! if we meet
   with any change in our outward condition, any new impediments,
   oppositions, and discouragements that we were not aware of when we
   first entered into our oath, it was our rashness, for we should sit
   down and count the charges, we should allow for it. The first article
   of the new covenant was that we should deny ourselves, Mat. xvi. 24;
   and after vows we should not make inquiry, but before, Prov. xx. 25.
   When we are bound we must take our lot and hazard, and whatever comes
   we must perform them to God.

   2. Because our oath is a further aggravation of our sin, therefore
   better never swear than not to keep it: Eccles. v. 5, Better it is that
   thou shouldest not vow, than vow and not pay.' God is mocked by an oath
   and a covenant when it is not observed. A man that refuseth to be
   listed doth not meet with the like punishment as he that runs from his
   colours; so he that never came under the oath of God, doth not sin so
   much as he that hath sworn to his covenant. That which is but simple
   fornication in the Gentiles, in Christians it is adultery, breach of
   vow. Indeed, in things that are absolutely and indispensably necessary
   to salvation, we are bound to consent. Ay! but when a consent thus
   solemnly made is broken, it aggravates the sin; but when we shall be
   like the man in the Gospel that was possessed with the devil, whom no
   chains could hold fast, when neither the bond of duty, nor the bonds of
   our own oaths and engagements will hold us, but we break all cords, the
   greater is our rebellion and disobedience to God.

   3. Therefore must we perform the obedience that we have sworn to God,
   because God hath ever been a severe and just avenger of breach of
   covenants. By way of argument, à minori ad majus, those made with man;
   and therefore certainly he will avenge his covenant so solemnly made
   with himself, and everywhere in scripture you will find it is
   propounded as a sure mark of vengeance. When one man hath sworn to
   another, and hath called upon the most high God to confirm that
   covenant that he makes with him, if there be a failure, a trespass,
   though it be in point of omission, God hath avenged that covenant. An
   instance for this you have Amos i. 9, For three transgressions of
   Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof;
   because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered
   not the brotherly covenant.' Tyrus and Judah they were in covenant one
   with another, a mutual league offensive and defensive that were
   solemnly sworn. Now though God had many causes of his vengeance, and
   many quarrels with Tyrus because of their idolatries, but chiefly
   because of breach of covenant, they forgat the friendship that was
   between the children of Israel and Judah, and did not assist the people
   of Judah as they should, and were bound to do, but suffered them to be
   led into captivity, and spoiled by the Edomites and other nations. So
   for a sin of commission; it is spoken of as a mark of sore vengeance:
   Ps. lv. 20, He hath put forth his hand against such as be at peace with
   him; he hath broken his covenant.' In those federal transactions and
   oaths that pass between man and man, God takes himself to be specially
   interested, and will see that the breach of them be severely punished.
   The next step is, not only between equals, but when a covenant hath
   been made with servants and poor underlings, and would not set them
   free at the year of jubilee, see how severely God threatens them, Jer.
   xxxiv. 16-18, for the breach of it; nay a covenant made with enemies,
   Ezek. xvii. 18, 19. Nay, carry it one gradation higher, though the
   covenant were extorted by fraud, as the covenant made with the
   Gibeonites, Josh. ix. ID, 20. They were part of the Canaanites, and God
   severely enjoined the Israelites that they should cut off all those
   nations; yet when they craftily got them into covenant, when this
   people were wronged by Saul, the Lord takes notice of it, 2 Sam. xxi.
   1-3. See how God judgeth for them; there were three years' famine and
   pestilence, which was not appeased until Saul's sons were hanged before
   the sun. Now the Lord hath ever been such a severe avenger of an oath
   between man and man, between his people and their servants, between his
   people and their enemies, and when extorted from them, certainly in
   such a solemn covenant as he hath made between us and himself, and that
   in things absolutely necessary, in things enjoined before the covenant
   was made, it is not safe to break with God. Ananias, when he vowed a,
   thing to the Lord, though he was free before, God strikes him dead. It
   is not free with us, whether we will obey, yea or nay, what is enjoined
   upon us; therefore when we will break with God, what shall we expect
   but that he should avenge the quarrel of his covenant?
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXV.

   I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous
   judgments.--Ver. 106.

   DOCT. 4. I now come to the fourth point, that our oath of obedience to
   God should be often revived and renewed upon us.

   David recognises and takes notice of the oath wherein he was bound to
   God, and here he renews it again, I will perform it.' It should be
   so:--

   1. Because we are apt to forget, and not have such a lively sense of a
   thing long since done, so that we either break the oath, or perform our
   duty very negligently. Our old baptismal covenant we are apt to forget
   it, especially by being under the bond of it in innocency, and
   dedicated to God by the act of another, viz., our parents. The apostle
   instanceth in those that were baptized in grown years, 2 Peter i. 9; he
   intimates they were apt to forget they were purged from their old
   sins.' I suppose it relates to baptism in that clause, forgotten his
   baptismal vow and obligation of renouncing his sin, and giving himself
   to the service of the Lord; and therefore there should be a purpose to
   revive it upon our heart, and the obligation should ever and anon be
   made new and fresh to quicken us to our duty.

   2. This forgetfulness it will cost us dear, it will be an occasion of
   many and great troubles. Jacob had forgotten his vows of building an
   altar at Bethel; God quickens him to his duty by sharp affliction: Gen.
   xxxv. 1, Arise, go up to Bethel,' &c. God was fain to quicken him with
   a scourge. Samson, when his vow was broken, how many dangers is he
   thrown into? taken, and bound, and made a sport of by the Philistines.
   God will rub up the memories of his servants by some sharp and severe
   dispensations of his providence, when they are not sensible of their
   vow and faith plighted to God. Never forget your obligation to God:
   Deut. iv. 23, Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of
   the Lord your God.'

   Quest. But when should we renew our covenant, or our oath of allegiance
   to God?

   1. Partly when we stand in need of some special favour from God, or
   when we draw nigh to him in some special duty; as Jacob, when God
   manifested himself to him, and he had communion with him at Bethel,
   then he vowed a vow, Gen. xxviii. 21. So Num. xxi. 2, Israel vowed a
   vow to the Lord when they were in some distress; and Ps. lxvi. 14, I
   will pay the vows of my distress, which I made when I was in trouble.'

   2. Again, after some special mercy, when under some love pang of
   spiritual rejoicing, and we have a deep sense of God's love to us, or a
   new pledge of his love to us either in spiritual or temporal benefits,
   and our soul melted out towards God in acts of spiritual rejoicing: Ps.
   cxvi. 8, 9, For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
   tears, and my feet from falling: I will walk before the Lord in the
   land of the living.' And when God breaks the force and power of
   enemies, when he makes the wrath of man turn to his praise, then Ps.
   lxxvi. 11, Vow and pay unto the Lord your God.' Those pagan mariners
   they made their vows to God when the Lord delivered them from the
   storm, Jonah i. 16.

   3. When all things go to ruin, when the state of religion is collapsed,
   either in a nation or in our hearts, after some notable breaches of
   covenant by a people, or by a person, and we have warped from God, seem
   to have wrested ourselves out of his arms, then to bind ourselves to
   him again, and to renew our vows; for upon this occasion doth Josiah
   enter into covenant with God, and cause the people to stand to the
   oath,' 2 Chron. xxxiv.

   4. When we are to draw nigh to God in the use of the seals of the new
   covenant, when a man is to revive his own right in the covenant of
   grace; so when we are to draw nigh to God in the Lord's Supper, which
   is the New Testament in Christ's blood, which is the seal of the
   covenant, then we should solemnly bind ourselves to the duty of it, and
   swear to the Lord anew.

   Use. To press you with all earnestness to enter into covenant with God,
   and then to keep it and make it good; to be sensible of the vow of God
   upon you, and to keep firm in the bond of the holy oath.

   First, To enter into solemn obligation to God, a purpose of holy and
   close walking with God. I shall press you hereunto:--

   1. God's laws are holy, just, and good, therefore certainly we should
   not be backward to swear to him; because we cannot bring ourselves
   seriously to give up ourselves to the Lord, they are righteous
   judgments. Suppose you could be free, yet subjection to God were to be
   chosen before liberty; therefore, when Christ invites us to take his
   yoke upon ourselves, he doth not so much urge his authority, All things
   are given to me of my Father,' therefore come to me; but he urgeth the
   sweetness of obedience, and the pleasure we may find in coming to him:
   Mat. xi. 29, My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.' If a man were
   free to choose whether he would be for God or no, yet the perfection or
   well-being of the reasonable nature being so much concerned in
   obedience to God, you should choose those laws before liberty. What
   doth the Lord require of you? To be holy, just, temperate, often
   praying, and praising his name; and are these things hard? A man is not
   a man if he do not yield to these things, Titus ii. 12. All our duties
   are comprised in those three adverbs, soberly, righteously, godly.' By
   being sober, a man delights himself; and by being just and righteous, a
   man delights others: without this, the world would be but like a den of
   thieves; and by being godly, he doth delight God. If we had only leave
   to love God and serve him, much more when we have a command to serve
   him, to be often in communion with him, it is the happiest life in the
   world. There is a great deal of pleasure, sweetness, and rational
   contentment doth accompany the exercise of these three graces,
   sobriety, righteousness, godliness.

   2. We are already obliged by God's command, so that whether you resolve
   or no, you are bound. There are some things that are left free in our
   own power before the vow passeth upon us; as, Acts v. 4, Was it not in
   thy power?' Ay! but there are other things that are not in our power.
   God's right over the creature is valid, whether he consent to it or no;
   as the natural relation doth infer and enforce duty without consent.
   This is the difference between voluntary and natural relations. Look,
   as a father is a father, whether the child own him or no in that
   quality and relation, and without his consent; a father as a father
   hath a right to command the child. But there are duties that depend
   upon our consent, as in the choice of a husband or master. So here is a
   natural relation between God and us, he our creator, we his creatures,
   he our superior, and we his inferiors, by reason of his authority and
   eternal right; and God may urge this, I am the Lord,' though he do not
   urge that, I am the Lord thy God.' Sometimes, I am the Lord,' Lev.
   xviii. 5, his own sovereignty; sometimes, The Lord thy God,' ver. 2;
   which argues our choice and consent to choose him for our God;
   therefore thou art not free.

   3. Actual consent and resolution on our part is required, that the
   sense of our duty may be more explicit upon our heart: 2 Chron. xxx. 8,
   Yield yourselves to the Lord.' In the original, Give the Lord the hand;
   that is, strike hands with him, enter into covenant with him, say,
   Lord, I will be for thee, and thou for me; choose him for your portion,
   and give up yourselves to be the Lord's people: Rom. xii. 1, Present
   your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
   your reasonable service.' He alludes to the eucharistical sacrifices.
   All our offerings must not be sin-offerings, but thank-offerings; so
   present yourselves. Under the law, a man he brought his thank-offering,
   and laid his hand upon it, Lord, I am thine.' It was implied in your
   baptism, and it is but reason that you should own your baptismal vow
   when you come to years of discretion. A bargain that is made for an
   heir during his nonage, it is confirmed by him when he comes to age.
   You were dedicated to God's service when you were young, and knew not
   what you did; now when you come to choose your own way, and at years of
   discretion, you should stand to what was done in your name to God;
   therefore there must be a serious and solemn consent of your heart.

   4. It is for your profit to choose the strictest engagements; not only
   to approve the ways of God, but purpose; not only purpose, but put it
   into a promise or declared resolution; and not only resolve, but bind
   this resolution by an oath. Why? For you have more reason to expect
   God's assistance this way than any other, because this is the appointed
   means practised by all the people of God when they expected the grace
   of the covenant. Surely God's blessing is best expected in his own way,
   and the greatest engagement to God the more apt to hold us to our duty
   than a looser engagement.

   5. Consider the necessity as well as the profit.

   [1.] Laziness is the cause of our backwardness and hanging off from
   God. We are loath to come to God, are off and on, hang between heaven
   and hell; we have many loose and wavering thoughts, until we come to a
   firm purpose and determination; but that engageth the heart--Jer. xxx.
   21, Who is this that engageth his heart to draw nigh to me?'--when you
   lay a command upon yourselves. We are weak and wavering in our purposes
   and wishes, but it puts an end to this when we come once to a full and
   firm purpose: Acts xi. 23, He exhorted them all, that, with purpose of
   heart, they would cleave unto the Lord.' Austin, in his Confessions,
   tells us how he would dally with God, and how long he struck [8] in the
   new birth, until he was resolved, until he bound himself firmly to
   shake off all his carnal courses, and mind the business of religion.

   [2.] Because of our fickleness, and the strength of temptations that
   will draw us off from God. He that is not resolved cannot be constant:
   James i. 8, The double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.'
   Christians! when an unconstant and rebelling heart meets with
   temptation without, all our wishes and cold purposes will come to
   nothing, but we shall give out at the first assault, and be unstable in
   all our ways; but when we are firmly and habitually resolved, then
   Satan is discouraged. While we are thinking and deliberating what we
   shall do, the devil hath some hope of us, we lie open to temptation;
   but when he seeth the bent of the heart is fixed and settled, and we
   have firmly bound ourselves to God, his hopes are gone. He that is in a
   wavering condition is easily overborne when temptation comes, but a
   fixed man is safe. Papers, feathers, and things that lie loose upon the
   ground, are tossed up and down by every blast and puff of wind, but
   those things that are fastened to the ground, though the wind blows
   never so strongly, they remain. Many set out towards the ways of
   salvation, but are discouraged, and turn back again to a course of sin;
   but when you solemnly give up yourselves to God, then you will not have
   so many temptations as before. Look, as Naomi was ever dissuading Ruth
   that she should not be a companion with her in her sorrows, but go back
   to her own country; but when she saw she was resolved, and steadfastly
   minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her, Ruth i. 18. Or
   let me take another instance, Acts xxi. 14. The disciples were
   persuading Paul that he should not go to Jerusalem, though they did
   even break his heart, they could not break his purpose; but when they
   saw that he was so set that he went bound in the spirit, then they
   said, The will of the Lord be done.' Thus will tempters be discouraged
   from importuning and setting upon us to draw us off from God, when once
   our bent is fixed. By resolution we are quickened to more seriousness
   and diligence, for when once we come under the bond of the holy oath,
   the awe of an oath will still be upon us, and quicken us to more
   diligence and seriousness, to make a business of religion, whereas
   otherwise we make but a recreation and sport of it, and but a business
   by the by: Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing have I desired of the Lord; that
   will I seek after.' When we have laid firm bonds upon ourselves, this
   makes us awe-ful, serious, and resolute in a course of obedience.

   Thus it directeth us to resolve. For the manner of entering:--

   1. It must be a resolution of heart rather than of the tongue: Jer.
   xxx. 21, Who is this that engageth his heart to seek the Lord?' Acts
   xi. 23, He exhorted them, that, with purpose of heart, they would
   cleave unto the Lord.' Resolutions are not determined by the tenor of
   our language so much as by the bent of the heart; therefore empty
   promises signify nothing, unless they be the result of our very souls,
   and not only of a natural conscience. Deut. v. 29, the people did not
   dissemble certainly when the Lord appeared to them by the sound of a
   trumpet and those mighty earthquakes; but saith the Lord, Oh, that
   there were such a heart in them to fear me always!' That there were a
   heart, and such a heart; that is, that this were not merely the result
   of an awakened conscience, but the resolution of a renewed heart. So
   Ps. lxxviii. 37, Their heart was not right with him, neither were they
   steadfast in his covenant.' Surely they did not dissemble in their
   distress, but their heart was not right with him; that is, it was not a
   sanctified heart, it was only the dictate of an awakened conscience for
   the present.

   2. When you thus engage yourselves to God, let it not be a weak,
   broken, but full resolution; cold wishes are easily overcome by the
   love of the world and a half purpose: Acts xxvi. 28, Almost thou
   persuadest me to be a Christian.' Carnal men, although they are not
   converted, yet they have a kind of half turn, almost, but not
   altogether. Upon a lively sermon, or in sickness, they have their
   purposes and wishes; but it is not a full strong bent of heart, and
   love must be a serious bent: 1 Chron. xxii. 19, Now set your heart and
   your soul to seek the Lord your God.'

   3. It must not be a wish, but a serious resolution, such as is advised,
   all difficulties well weighed. In a fit and pang of devotion men will
   resolve for God, but it will never hold: Josh. xxiv. 19, Ye cannot
   serve the Lord, for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God, he will not
   forgive your transgressions nor your sins;' and therefore you must
   reckon what it is to serve this holy God; you must sit down and count
   the charges, what it is likely to cost you, that this dedication of
   yourselves to God may be grounded upon serious consideration. Do you
   know what lust of the flesh you must renounce, what interest of yours
   you must lay at his feet?

   4. It must be a thorough, absolute, and perfect resolution, whatever it
   cost, as he that sold all for the pearl of price, Mat. xiii. 46. A
   marriage even made may be broken off; some will take up religion by way
   of essay, to try how they like it, as men go to sea for pleasure, but
   will not launch so far into the deep but that they may be sure easily
   to get to shore again; but a man for a voyage resolves upon all
   weathers. So, whatever disappointment, here is my business, thus will I
   do; and though he should kill me, yet will I trust in him,' Job xiii.
   15.

   5. It must be a resolution for the present, not for the future; for all
   resolutions for the future are false: Ps. xxvii. 8, When thou saidst,
   Seek ye my face;' like a quick echo, My heart answered, Thy face, Lord,
   will I seek.' And we must resolve so to engage presently, for what we
   do for hereafter it is but a cheat we put upon ourselves, merely to
   elude the workings of heart, to avoid the present impulse.

   6. It must be a resolution according to the covenant of grace, in a
   sense of our insufficiency and dependence upon Christ, not in a
   confidence of our own strength. Peter went forth in a confidence of his
   own resolution, and how soon did he miscarry! Therefore we must resolve
   in the strength of God: Ps. cxix. 8, I will keep thy precepts; O
   forsake me not utterly.' If God forsake, all will come to nothing. Thus
   we should solemnly dedicate ourselves to his use and service.

   Secondly, Having entered into such a solemn engagement to be the
   Lord's, keep this covenant and oath made with God. For motives:--

   1. From the nature of such a solemn engagement; it hath more in it than
   a single promise. There is in every solemn dedication or vowing of
   ourselves to God an attestation or calling upon God to take witness,
   and there is an imprecation. An attestation, a calling God to witness
   of our serious intentions to perform, and will you call God to be
   witness to a lie? And an imprecation, a calling upon God to punish us
   if we do the contrary; therefore, being entered into the bond of such a
   holy oath, how should we tremble to break it! For lie that renews his
   oath of allegiance to God, he doth as it were dare God to do his worst,
   for you thereby wish some heavy plague to fall upon your heads if you
   do not fulfil the duty of your oath; that is, he that eats and drinks
   the body and blood of Christ unworthily, he is guilty of damnation,
   guilty of the Lord's blood, because these solemn rites do not only
   confirm the promises, but confirm the threatening; and there is implied
   not only an invocation of blessing, but an imprecation upon ourselves;
   that is, if you do not fulfil the duty of the covenant, you offer
   yourselves as it were to God's curse.

   2. Consider the tenderness of God's people in case of any oath or
   solemn promise, though it concerned their duty to man. Josh. ix. 19,
   20, it is spoken of the league with the Gibeonites, We have sworn unto
   them by the Lord God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them,
   lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.'
   They looked upon it as horrible impiety to break an oath. Now much more
   doth this hold in our engagements to God. Shall we not look upon it as
   a horrid impiety to break a solemn oath so solemnly renewed, and our
   faith so solemnly plighted? Every sin of ours is made the more heinous
   because of this oath.

   3. Remember the great quarrel that God hath against the Christian world
   and all the professors of his name is about his covenant and oath
   taken. What is the reason God doth visit Christendom with famines,
   pestilences, inundations, and wars? Because they do not stand to the
   oath of God that is upon them. Every professor of the name of Christ,
   he is supposed to be in covenant with God: Heb. x. 29, Of how much
   sorer punishment shall he be thought worthy, who hath counted the blood
   of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing?' All
   visible professors of Christianity are under a covenant with God, to
   take God for their God, and to live as his people; now because of their
   looseness and profaneness, they do not stand to their engagement,
   therefore so many plagues are upon them: Lev. xxvi. 25, I will bring a
   sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant;' that is,
   because they did not perform the duties sworn to him.

SERMON CXVI.

   I am afflicted very much: quicken me, Lord, according unto thy
   word.--Ver. 107.

   HERE we have--(1.) A representation of his case and condition, I am
   afflicted; his condition was calamitous, and here is the degree of it,
   very much. (2.) His prayer, quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy
   word; wherein we have the nature of his request, quicken me, O Lord;
   then the argument, according unto thy word.

   For the first, I am afflicted;' it may be understood of outward
   pressures, or soul troubles. From thence note--

   Doct. God's people are liable to sad and sore afflictions here in the
   world.

   He doth not so fondly and delicately bring up his children but that he
   exerciseth them with sharp afflictions. David, a man dear to God, much
   in communion with him, ever and anon you hear him complaining of
   trouble. It is the church's name, Isa. liv. 11, O thou afflicted, and
   tossed with tempest, and not comforted.' God's people are sometimes
   afflicted in the outward, sometimes in the inward man. In the outward
   man, either by enemies, the more because they are godly: 2 Tim. iii.
   12, All they that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer
   persecution.' They must not dream of worldly ease, and think to go to
   heaven upon a bed of roses, but sometimes their way is strewed with
   thorns, and they have fiery trials: 1 Peter iv. 12, Think it not
   strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some
   strange thing happened unto you;' no more than you would to see a
   shower of rain fall, or a cloudy day succeed a fair: we would laugh at
   one that should be troubled to see a shower fall. So some times by
   sickness under God's immediate hand. In the 3d epistle of John, the
   apostle saith of Gaius, I wish that thou mayest prosper, and be in
   health, even as thy soul prospereth.' It seems he had a healthful soul
   in a very sickly crazy body. And Paul's thorn in the flesh notes some
   racking pain, stone or gout, which he alludes to thrusting up a stake
   in the body of slaves. The inward man, that hath its affliction too,
   anguish, sorrow of heart, sometimes by reason of God's desertion.
   Christ Jesus drunk of this cup: Mat. xxvii. 46, My God, my God, why
   hast thou forsaken me?' And the cup goes round; his people pledge him
   in this bitter cup, and often complain of a withdrawing God, that they
   cannot find God as they were wont formerly. Many times perplexing lusts
   and prevalency of sore distempers: O wretched man,' &c., Rom. vii. 24,
   so Paul groans; and sometimes from temptations and assaults from Satan:
   Luke xxii. 31, 32, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you
   as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.' Christ
   did not pray to exempt him from it, but to preserve him in it.

   If you ask why God's children are thus afflicted, I answer--It is not
   heaven we now enjoy.

   1. We are not in our eternal rest, therefore here we must be exercised,
   tried, afflicted. The world is a middle place between heaven and hell,
   therefore hath somewhat of both; their principles and actions are
   mixed, so their condition is mixed, intermixed with sorrows and joys,
   until they come there where they shall rest from all their labours. So
   it must be.

   2. God doth it to purge out sin: Isa. xxvii. 9, By this shall the
   iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his
   sin.' Gold is cast into the fire. Why? To have its dross consumed. Corn
   is beaten with the flail. Why? To be severed from its chaff, husks, and
   straw; and iron is filed to get off its rust; so this is the fruit of
   all--the taking away sin. Afflictions are a necessary cure for sin:
   John xv. 2, Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may
   bring forth more fruit.' Look, as in a vine there are certain
   superfluous luxuriant leaves and branches that grow up with the fruit,
   and hindereth the increase of it, which the vine-dresser pares off, not
   to destroy the vine, but to cultivate and manure it, so it is with no
   ill intent; so corruption grows up with our graces, and hindereth us
   that we cannot bear fruit, when we are in a flourishing condition;
   therefore these need to be purged away.

   3. God doth it to humble us. This was that which God aimed at in all
   his afflictive dispensations towards the people of Israel, Deut. viii.
   2. God's eminent servants need affliction to humble them. David had
   many things to puff him up, his royal dignity, the gift of prophecy,
   familiarity with God, great opulency, many victories, pride of life,
   &c.; and he needed many afflictions to keep him humble, Ps. cxxxii. 1.
   Paul, he was apt to be lifted up with abundance of revelations,
   therefore God humbled him with a thorn in the flesh,' 2 Cor. xii. 7.

   Use 1. If we he out of affliction, let us provide for a time of
   exercise. David, a saint, is afflicted. God's bosom-friends may feel
   his hand sore upon them. David, a king, is afflicted; those in the
   highest station have their incident cares and troubles. David, an Old
   Testament believer, saith, I am afflicted.' I observe this, because God
   then dispensed himself to his people in and by temporal promises, and
   yet even then they had great mixtures of trouble, to show that which
   they had in the world was not all they had to expect from God. The
   promises now in the New Testament, now life and immortality is brought
   to light, they run to us in another strain, not of temporal, but
   spiritual things; therefore we must expect our portion of sorrow before
   we go to heaven. Be not of such a woman-like nature, and so delicately
   brought up, as never to see evil days; for aught I see, we are entering
   upon our trial. The strain of our ministry is mainly consolatory
   usually, but there comes a time of expense and laying out, when such
   comforts are to be laid up in our heart, therefore let us be provided.

   Use 2. If we be for the present under affliction, let us bear it with
   patience, observing how God's ends are accomplished. It is smart and
   grievous now, Heb. xii. 11, but it will be salutary and healthful; it
   will yield to you righteousness, and that righteousness will yield you
   peace--give the peaceable fruit of righteousness. If God will take away
   the fuel of our sin, empty us of our pride, self-conceit, weaken the
   security of the flesh, let us be content, only let us take heed that
   the time of mortifying sin be not the time of discovering sin, and that
   we do not trespass the more. To be sinning and suffering is the case of
   the damned. Take heed you do not sin in your suffering; especially take
   heed of those sins that are proper to affliction. Fainting: If thou
   faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is but small.' Distrust of
   God's providence: I shall one day perish by the hands of Saul.' Despair
   of God's promises: I said I am cut off,' &c. Then you lose the benefit
   of God's family discipline when you yield to these sins. But see how it
   drives you out of the way of hell, for affliction is a gentle
   remembrance of hell; for look, as those whose garments were singed, as
   when they threw the three children into the furnace, their own garments
   were singed by the force of the flame, they knew what it was to be
   thrown into the pit; so the Lord in effect doth tell you what will be
   in hell; this is a gentle remembrance, stand farther off, that ye may
   not be condemned with the world, 1 Cor. xi. 32. Arid then, how it
   quickens you to look after heavenly things; for when the out ward man
   decays, then look to things not seen, 2 Cor. iv. 17; when you are
   fitted more and more for your change, when you grow more humble,
   mortified, as stories are hewn and squared for the building.

   Let us come to the degree, I am afflicted very much; the Septuagint
   renders it, etapeino'theo e'os spho'dra, I am afflicted very sore.'

   Doct. The afflictions of God's people may not only be many, but very
   sore and heavy.

   So David here, and Ps. lxxi. 20, Thou hast showed me great and sore
   troubles.' Why many?

   1. Many and strong lusts are to be subdued, and we need great
   afflictions to subdue many and great corruptions. Some stains are not
   easily washed out, but need much rubbing. When pride is deeply rooted
   in the heart, God brings down even to the grave, that a man goes up and
   down like a walking ghost, and like a skeleton or dry bones. There is
   such an one described, Job xxxiii. 17 with 22; and why? To bring down
   pride in his heart? The physic must be according to the distemper; if
   the distemper be more rooted, the physic must be more strong: Ps. cvii.
   11, 12, Because they rebelled against the word of the Lord, and
   contemned the counsel of the Most High, therefore he brought down their
   heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.' When
   people begin to grow high and stomachful, contemptuous against God and
   his ordinances, then God brings them into sore distresses, to break
   their pride and stoutness of heart.

   2. That God may have the more experience and trial of his people. In
   daily and little afflictions there is no trial of their courage, faith,
   patience, and submission, and all other graces. The trial of faith is
   in extremity. Graces are exercised to the life, when we are even at the
   point of death: 2 Cor. i. 9, We had the sentence of death in ourselves,
   that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God, which raiseth the
   dead.' So patience, it is not tried but by sharp affliction; therefore
   the apostle saith, Let patience have its perfect work,' James i. 4. So
   Christian courage and resolution, that is tried in deep affliction,
   when we are slain all the day long,' Heb. xi. 35, 36; Rom. viii. 37, In
   all these things we are more than conquerors.' The strength of a man's
   back is not tried by a small weight, but by a heavy burden, how much he
   can bear; so the sharper the affliction, the greater the trial.

   3. That they may have the more experience of God, for the sharper the
   affliction the sweeter their comfort, and the more glorious their
   deliverance: Ps. lxxi. 20, Thou which hast showed me great and sore
   troubles, thou shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from
   the depths of the earth.' God's power in raising them up is more seen:
   2 Cor. i. 10, Who delivered me from so great a death.'

   Use 1. If we be under sore troubles--

   1. Let us not faint; remember it is no more than we have deserved. God
   will not afflict a man above his deserts; he cannot complain of wrong,
   Ezra ix. 13. It is never more, it may be less; when our afflictions are
   great, our deserts are far greater: Isa. xl. 1, Comfort ye, comfort ye,
   my people, saith your God.' Why? For she hath received of the Lord's
   hand double for all her sins.' God saith double; he relents presently.

   2. Consider the degree of affliction; it is not measured out by
   yourselves, but measured out by a wise God; though afflicted very much
   and very sore, the measure it is ordered by God, as well as the kind of
   it. If it were measured out by ourselves, it would be too light, it
   would be too gentle; the patient must not be trusted in searching his
   own wounds; and if it were left to our enemies, they would know no
   bounds: Zech. i. 15, I was but a little displeased, and they helped
   forward the affliction.' But it is left to the wise, just, and gracious
   God and Father; he tempers the cup in his own hand; and therefore when
   the affliction is grown sore and strong, it comes not only from a wise
   God, but a tender Father, that best knows what is good for us. Job
   xxxiv. 23, that is a notable place, For he will not lay upon man more
   than right, that he should enter into judgment with God;' that is, the
   party afflicted hath no just complaint against God, can take no
   exception against God's proceedings, for he perfectly understands our
   need, and understands our strength. God perfectly understands our need:
   1 Peter i. 6, If need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold
   temptations.' And understands our strength: 1 Cor. x. 13, Faithful is
   he, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.' Many
   parents do not correct their children in measure, being ignorant of
   their nature and disposition. Many physicians mistake their patients'
   constitution, therefore the physic may work too strongly and too
   violently for them; but God understands our need and our strength, and
   so suits all his remedies accordingly.

   Use 2. To reprove those fond complaints that are extorted from us in
   deep and pressing afflictions; as if--

   1. Sometimes, there was never any so afflicted as I am. God's people
   have been sore troubled: Lam. i. 12, Is it nothing to you, all ye that
   pass by? Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,
   wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me.' Yes, others have been afflicted
   in the same kind and degree, if not worse: 1 Peter v. 9, All these
   things are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.' You
   think it is such as the like hath never been known or heard of, for
   every man's own pain seemeth most grievous: Lam. iii. 1, I am the man
   that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.' Other prophets
   foretold them, I see them executed. The best of God's people have their
   measures of hardships; you are not singular, do not stand alone. This
   is one of Satan's deceits. Satan will suggest this to a child of God,
   that he may question his Father's affection, lose the comfort of his
   adoption, and put yourselves out of the number of God's children. Your
   lot is not harder than the rest of God's children; all that are in the
   world have the same trials, troubles, pressing evils upon their hearts
   now and then.

   2. Another you find complaining, taxing God of unfaithfulness, as if he
   would break trust, and lay upon you more than you are able to bear, and
   you deceive yourselves; for if you cannot bear your present burden, you
   would bear none, you do not improve Christ's strength: Phil. iv. 13, I
   can do all things through Christ which strengthened me.' Christ doth
   not help us in such a degree, or one trouble, and no more, but in all.

   3. Another we find complain, I am cut off; God will be merciful and
   gracious no more, Ps. lxxvii. 8, 9, &c.; he hath forsaken me and
   forgotten me. God's children have been brought thus low, yet have been
   raised, as the church: Ps. cxviii. 18, Lord, thou hast chastened me
   sore, yet hast not given me over unto death.' Within a little while he
   will show this was but our infirmity; this would stop these idle
   complaints by which we give vent to our daily impatience.

   We have seen David's case, but what doth he do? He goes to God about
   comfort and relief, I am afflicted very sore: O Lord, quicken me,
   according to thy word.' There observe--

   1. That he prays, and makes his addresses to God.

   2. For what he prays.

   Doct. First, That he prays. Observe, affliction should put us upon
   prayer and serious address to God. Thus God's people are wont to do:
   Isa. xxvi. 16, Lord, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out
   a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.' They that have neglected
   God at other times, will be dealing with him then, and this God
   expects: Hosea v. 15, I will go and return to my place, till they
   acknowledge their offence, and seek my face; in their affliction they
   will seek me early.' It will be the first thing they will do, the
   greatest thing they will take care of; as that which we most care for,
   most is thought of in the morning. Nay, it is that which God enjoins:
   Ps. l. 15, Call upon me in the time of trouble.' Some might hang off
   when God's rod is upon their backs, or be discouraged by the bitter
   sense of a trouble; therefore God doth not only give us leave, but
   commands us to call upon him. This is the special season when this duty
   is performed with life and vigour: Is any man afflicted? let him pray,'
   James v. 13. Let him thus give vent to his trouble, it doth mightily
   ease the heart. An oven stopped up is the hotter within; the more we
   keep down grief, and do not unburden ourselves, the more it presseth
   upon the heart. Wind imprisoned in the bowels of the earth makes a
   terrible shaking there till it gets vent; so till our sorrow gets a
   vent it rends and tears the heart. The throne of grace was appointed
   for such a time, Heb. iv. 16; when need comes, then it is a time to
   improve our interest, to put promises in suit; when God seems to be an
   enemy to us, when, to appearance, he executes the curse of the old
   covenant, oh! then we should work through all discouragements, then we
   should hold God to his second grant and charter, and come to his throne
   of grace, and keep him there.

   For the reasons:--

   1. God is the party with whom we have to do; whencesoever the trouble
   doth arise, there is his hand and his counsel in it; therefore it is
   best dealing with him about it, in all afflictions, public or private:
   Amos iii. 6, Is there evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?'
   Let men but awaken their reason and conscience, who is it that is at
   the upper end of causes, that casts our lot upon such troublesome and
   distracted times? So in private afflictions, David owned God's hand;
   Shimei had mocked him, but he looks higher; the Lord hath bid him
   curse. So Job; he doth not say the Chaldean and Sabean hath taken away,
   but the Lord hath taken, Job i. 21. Afflictions have a higher cause
   than men ordinarily look at; they do not come out of the dust, but come
   from God. See what inference Eliphaz draws from this principle, Job v.
   8, I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause;' that
   is, I would go and deal with him about it; it was Eliphaz's advice to
   Job, and it is seasonable to us all.

   2. It is God only that can help us and relieve us, either by giving
   support under the trouble, or removing it from us; so saith David, Ps.
   lvii. 2, I will cry unto God most high, unto God that performeth all
   things for me.' A believer looks for all things from God; when all
   things go well with him, God is his best friend; when all things go ill
   with him, God is his only friend; he runs to none so often as to God.
   Now upon these principles we go to God; but for what end? Let us see
   what we go to God for.

   [1.] That we may know his mind in all his providences. The affliction
   hath some errand and message to us, something to deliver us from God;
   now we need to ask of God to know his mind: Micah vi. 9, Hear the rod,
   and who hath appointed it.' We should not only be sensible of the
   smart, but look to the cause; therefore, if we would know the cause,
   let us go and expostulate with God about it; as Joab, when Absalom set
   his corn-field on fire; he sent for him once and twice, but he comes
   not, until he sets his corn-field on fire, and then he comes and
   expostulates with him, Who hath done this?' 2 Sam. xiv. 30, 31. So when
   we make bold, and will not come to God, nor take notice of his
   messages, God comes and lets out his wrath upon our comforts and
   conveniences; now let us deal with God about it; wherefore is all this?

   [2.] That we may have strength to bear it. Alas! we can bear or do
   little of ourselves, for that doing refers to bearing: Phil iv. 13, I
   can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me;' that is, I can
   suffer want, need, hunger, thirst, nakedness, and run through all
   conditions, through Christ that strengtheneth me.' Now you must ask it
   of God: James i. 5, If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of God.' It
   is wisdom to bear affliction, if he would wisely carry himself under
   the rod; that he may not discover his folly, he must ask this strength
   and grace of God.

   [3.] Wisdom to improve our chastisements, that we may have the benefit
   and fruit of them: Isa. xlviii. 17, I am the Lord thy God, which
   teacheth thee to profit;' that is, to profit by afflictions, to reap
   the fruit of them. So Job xxxiii. 16, He openeth the ears of men, and
   sealeth their instruction.' God, by a powerful work upon the heart,
   impresseth their duty upon them, that they may see wherefore it is that
   he hath afflicted them.

   [4.] We go to God for deliverance and freedom from the trouble: Ps.
   xxxiv. 19, Many are the troubles of the righteous, but out of them all
   the Lord will deliver them.' It is God's prerogative to set us free. We
   break prison when we attempt to escape merely by our own means;
   therefore either we shall have no deliverance, or no kindly one. God
   hath delivered, doth deliver, and we trust will deliver. This must be
   sought out of God; God helping together with your prayers, 2 Cor. i.
   10, 11. Prayer must fetch it out from God, or it is no kindly
   deliverance. Well, then, in our affliction, we need to be often with
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXVII.

   Quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy word.--Ver. 107.

   USE 1. To reprove the stupidness and carelessness of them that neglect
   God in their troubles: Dan. ix. 13, All this evil is come upon us, yet
   made we not our prayer before the Lord our God.' A very senseless
   slight spirit, that when they are under the blows of God's heavy hand,
   they will not be much in calling upon God; this is contrary to God's
   injunction, who expects now with earnestness they will seek him. God
   reckons upon it; he could not hear from them before, but now they will
   pray hard, and will make up their former negligence. When God sends a
   tempest after you, as on Jonah, yet will you keep off from him? It is
   contrary to the practice of the saints; in their chastisements,
   troubles, and afflictions, they are much with God, opening their hearts
   to him. Nay, it is worse than hypocrites, for they will have their
   pangs of devotion at such a time, Job xxvii. 10, 11. In short, you lose
   the comfort of your affliction. Seasons of affliction are happy seasons
   if they prove praying seasons; when they bring you nearer to God, it is
   a sign God is not wholly gone, but hath left somewhat behind him, when
   the heart is drawn into him. This is the blessing of every condition,
   when it brings God nearer to you, and you are more acquainted with him
   than before.

   Use 2. Then it takes off the discouragements of poor disconsolate ones,
   who mis-expound his providence when they think afflictions put us from
   God rather than call us to him. Oh no! it is not to drive you from him,
   but to draw you to him. Do not think God hath no mercy for thee,
   because he leaves thee to such pressures, wants, and crosses. This is
   the way to acquaint yourselves with God, yea, though you have been
   hitherto strangers to him; he hath invited you to call upon him in time
   of trouble, he is willing to have you upon any terms. A man will say,
   You come to me in your necessities; God delights to hear from you, and
   is glad any occasion will bring you into his presence; and therefore be
   much with God.

   Secondly, I observe, when this affliction was sore and pressing, yet
   then he hath a heart to pray, I am afflicted very sore, O Lord, quicken
   me.'

   Doct. We must not give over prayer, though our afflictions be never so
   great and heavy. Why? Because--

   1. Nothing is too hard for God; he hath ways of his own to save and
   preserve his people when we are at a loss. This was the glory of
   Abraham's faith, that he accounted God was able to raise up Isaac from
   the dead, Heb. xi. 19. Difficult cases are fit for God to deal in, to
   show his divine power. When means have spent their allowance, then is
   it time to try what God can do: Ps. cxlii. 4, 5, I looked on my right
   hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge
   failed me; no man cared for my soul. I cried unto thee, O Lord; I said,
   Thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the living.' When all
   things fail, God faileth not.

   2. We must still pray. Faith must express something above sense, or
   else living by faith and living by sense cannot be distinguished. In
   desperate cases then is the glory of faith seen: Job xiii. 15, Though
   he should kill me, yet I will trust in him.' In defiance of all
   discouragement, we should come and profess our dependence upon God.

   Use. To condemn those that despond, and give over all treaty with God,
   as soon as any difficulty doth arise; whereas this should sharpen
   prayer, rather than discourage us. This is man's temper, when troubles
   are little and small, then to neglect God; when great, then to distrust
   God. A little headache will not send us to the physician, nor the
   scratch of a pin to the chirurgeon; so if our troubles be little, they
   do not move us to seek after God, but we are secure and careless; but
   when our troubles are smart, sore, and pressing, then we are
   discouraged, and give over all hopes; so hard a matter is it to bring
   man to God, to keep an even frame, neither to slight the hand of God,
   nor to faint under it, as we have direction to avoid both extremes,
   Heb. xii. 5, to cherish a due sense of our troubles, with a regular
   confidence in God.

   That he prays you have seen. Now what he prays for. He doth not say
   deliver me, but quicken me.

   Doct. Strength and support under afflictions is a great blessing, to be
   sought from God, and acknowledged as a favour, as well as deliverance.

   1. You shall see this is promised as a favour: Isa. xl. 31, They that
   wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength;' that is, shall not
   faint nor be weary, but mount up as it were with wings as eagles; they
   shall have a new supply of grace, enabling them to bear and hold out
   till the deliverance cometh. They that wait upon the Lord do not always
   see the end of their troubles, but are quickened, comforted, and
   strengthened in them; they shall renew their strength.

   2. This is accepted by the saints with thanksgiving, and valued by them
   as a special answer of prayer; they value it more than temporal
   deliverance itself many times; as 2 Cor. xii. 9, 10, Paul prays for the
   removal of the thorn in the flesh thrice, when God only gives him this
   answer, My grace is sufficient for thee;' saith Paul then, I will
   rejoice in mine infirmities,' so I might have strength and support in
   grievous weaknesses, reproaches, and afflictions, whatever they be. So
   Ps. cxxxviii. 3, In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me, and
   strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.' That is noted as a special
   answer of prayer. How did he hear him? With strength in my soul. Though
   he did not give him deliverance, he gave him -sup port, so that was
   acknowledged as a very great mercy.

   3. There are many cases wherein we cannot expect temporal deliverance,
   then we must only go for quickening and support; when by a lingering
   disease we are drawing down to the chambers of death, and our outward
   strength is clean spent and gone, then have we sup port; that is a
   great mercy: Ps. lxxiii. 26, when strength fail and heart fail, God is
   the strength of my heart, and portion for ever;' that is, to have his
   heart quickened by God in the languishing of a mortal disease. So 2
   Cor. iv. 16, Though our outward man perish, yet our inward man is
   renewed day by day.' There are many troubles that cannot be avoided,
   and therefore we are then to be earnest with God for spiritual
   strength.

   Use. Well, then, you see upon what occasion we should go for grace
   rather than for temporal deliverance. We should pray from the new
   nature; not deliver me, but quicken me; and if the Lord should suspend
   deliverance, why, that will be our strength in time of trouble: Ps.
   xxxvii. 39, The salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; he is their
   strength in the time of trouble.'

   But more particularly, let us take notice of this request: Quicken me,'
   saith he.

   Doct. Quickening grace must be asked of God.

   1. What is quickening?

   2. Why asked of God?

   First, What is this quickening? Quickening in scripture is put for two
   things:--

   1. For regeneration, or the first infusion of the life of grace; as
   Eph. ii. 5, And you that were dead in trespasses and sins hath he
   quickened;' that is, infused life, or making to live a new life.

   2. It is put for the renewed excitations of God's grace, God's
   breathing upon his own work. God, that begins life in our souls,
   carries on this life, and actuates it. Now this kind of quickening is
   twofold spoken of in this psalm; there is quickening in duties, and
   quickening in afflictions. Quickening in duties, that is opposite to
   deadness of spirit; quickening in affliction, that is opposite to
   faintness.

   [1.] Quickening in duties, that is opposite to that deadness of spirit
   which creeps upon us now and then, and is occasioned either by our
   negligence or by our carnal liberty, that deadness of spirit that doth
   hinder the activity of grace.

   (1.) By out negligence and slothfulness in the spiritual life, when we
   do not stir up ourselves: Isa. lxiv. 7, There is none that stirreth up
   himself to take hold on thee;' when men grow careless and neglectful in
   their souls. An instrument, though never so well in tune, yet if hung
   up and laid by, soon grows out of order; so when our hearts are
   neglected, when they are not under a constant exercise of grace, a
   deadness creeps upon us. Wells are sweeter for the draining. Our graces
   they are more fresh and lively the more they are kept a-work, otherwise
   they lose their vitality. A key rusts that is seldom turned in the
   lock, and therefore negligence is a cause of this deadness: 2 Tim. i.
   6, Stir up the gift that is in thee.' We must blow up the ashes. There
   needs blowing if we would keep in the fire; we grow dead and lukewarm,
   and cold in the spiritual life, for want of exercise.

   (2.) This deadness is occasioned by carnal liberty: Ps. cxix. 37, Turn
   away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou me in thy way.'
   When we have been too busy about the vanities of the world, or
   pleasures of the flesh, when we have given contentment to the flesh,
   and been intermeddling with worldly cares and delights, it brings a
   brawn and deadness upon the heart: Luke xxi. 34, Take heed that your
   hearts be not overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the
   cares of this world,' &c. I say, by this the soul is distempered, and
   rendered inapt for God. Christians! this is a disease very incident to
   the saints, this deadness that creeps upon them. We have not such
   lively stirrings, nor a like influence of grace; we have not those
   earnest and lively motions we were wont to have in prayer. Now God he
   quickeneth us. How? By exciting the operative graces, as faith, love,
   hope, and fear, when these are kept pregnant and lively, as we read of
   lively hope,' 1 Peter i. 3. There is living faith and lively faith, and
   living fear and lively fear of God, and living hope and lively hope.
   All graces God makes them lively and vivacious, that they may put forth
   their -operations the more readily. Well, this is quickening in duties.

   [2.] There is quickening in afflictions, and so it is opposed to
   fainting, that fainting which is occasioned by too deep a sense of
   present troubles, or by unbelief, or distrust of God and his promises,
   and the supplies of his grace. Oh! when troubles press upon us very
   sore, our hearts are like a bird, dead in the nest, overcome, so that
   we have no spirit, life, nor aptness for God's service: My soul
   droopeth for very heaviness;' we have lost our life and our courage for
   God.

   Well, how doth God quicken us? By reviving our suffering graces, as our
   hope of eternal life and eternal glory, patience and faith, and so puts
   life into us again, that we may go on cheerfully in our service. By
   infusion of new comforts. He revives the spirit of his contrite ones;
   so the prophet saith, Isa. lvii. 15. He doth revive our spirits again
   when they are dead and sunk under our troubles. Oh! it is very
   necessary for this: Ps. lxxx. 18, Quicken us, and we will call upon thy
   name.' Discomfort and discouragement they weaken our hands; until the
   Lord cheers us again we have no life in prayer. By two things
   especially doth God quicken us in affliction--by reviving the sense of
   his love, and by reviving the hopes of glory. By reviving the sense of
   his love: Rom. v. 5, The love of God is shed abroad,' like a fragrant
   ointment that doth revive us, when we are even ready o give up the
   ghost; Ps. lxxxv. 6, Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may
   rejoice in thee?' I say, when he restores the sense of his love after
   great and pressing sorrow, then he is said to quicken. So when he doth
   renew upon us the hopes of glory: Rom. v. 2, 3, We rejoice in hope of
   the glory of God.' Well, you see what this quickening is.

   Secondly, This quickening must be asked of God.

   1. Because it is his prerogative to govern the heart of man, especially
   -to quicken us. God will be owned as the fountain of all life: 1 Tim.
   vi. 13, I charge thee in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things.'
   It is God that quickeneth all things. All the life that is in the
   creature, all the life that is in new creatures, it comes from God; it
   is he that giveth us life at first, and he must keep in this life in
   the soul, and restore it. The meanest worm, all the life it hath, it
   hath from God. When John would prove the Godhead of Christ, he brings
   this argument, John i. 4, In him is life.' There is not a gnat but
   receives this benefit from Christ as God. He hath the life of all
   things, and this life is the light of men; much more the noble creature
   man hath this life from God; much more the new creature; greater
   operation of spiritual life, more depends upon his influence; and
   therefore, if we would be quickened, and carried out with any life and
   strength, we must go to God for it.

   2. God as our judge, he must be treated with about it, for he smites us
   with deadness; therefore till he takes off his sentence, we cannot get
   rid of this distemper; it is one of God's spiritual plagues, which must
   be removed before we can hope for any liveliness, and any activity of
   grace again. Under the law, God punished sins more sensibly; as
   unhallowed addresses, he punished them with death. Under the gospel, he
   punisheth sins with deadness of heart. When they seem careless in the
   worshipping of God, they have a blow and breach, as he smote Uzzah and
   Nadab and Abihu dead in the place; and now he smites with deadness,
   Rev. iii. 7. He hath the key of David, that openeth and no man
   shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth;' without his permission we
   can never recover our former lively estate again, for there is a
   judicial sentence passed upon us.

   Use. To press us to be often with God for quickening, that we may
   obtain this benefit. I have spoken of it at large upon another verse;
   if you would have this benefit, rouse up yourselves: Isa. lxiv. 7,
   There is none that stirreth up himself;' and 2 Tim. i. 6, Stir up the
   gift that is in thee.' A man hath a faculty to work upon his own heart,
   to commune and reason with himself; and we are bidden to strengthen the
   things that are ready to die,' Rev. iii. 2. When things are dying and
   fainting in the soul, we are to strengthen ourselves; therefore, if we
   would have God to quicken us, thus must we do, chide the heart for its
   deadness in duty; we can be lively enough in a way of sin; chide the
   heart for its deadness in affliction: Ps. xlii., Why art thou cast
   down, my soul? still trust in God.' And after you have done this, then
   look up, and expect this grace from God in and through Christ Jesus. It
   is said, John x. 10, I am come that they may have life, and have it
   more abundantly.' Jesus Christ, he came not only that we might have
   life enough to keep body and soul together, but that we might not only
   be living but lively, full of life, strength, and cheerfulness in the
   service of God. He is come into the world for this end and purpose:
   expect it through Christ, who hath purchased it for us. And then plead
   with God about it, according to his promise, Ah! Lord, according to thy
   word; hast thou not said, I will quicken a dead heart? When thou art
   broken and tossed with affliction, remember it is the high and lofty
   one that hath said he will revive the heart of the contrite ones,' Isa.
   lvii. 15; and plead thus with God, Ah! Lord, dost not thou delight in a
   cheerful spirit? Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may
   rejoice in thee?' Ps. lxxxv. 6. And then humble yourselves for the
   cause of the distemper. What is the matter? how comes this deadness
   upon me? Isa. lxiii. 17, Why hast thou caused us to err from thy ways,
   and hardened our heart from thy fear?' Inquire what is the cause of
   this deadness that grows upon me, that you may humble yourselves under
   the mighty hand of God.

   The argument only is behind, according to thy word. David, when he begs
   for quickening, he is encouraged so to do by a promise. The question
   is, where this promise should be? Some think it was that general
   promise of the law, If thou do these things, thou shalt live in them,'
   Lev. xviii. 5; and that from thence David drew this particular
   conclusion, that God would give life to his people. But rather it was
   some other promise, some word of God he had to bear him out in this
   request. We see he hath made many promises to us of sanctifying our
   affliction: Isa. xxvii. 9, The fruit of all shall be the taking away of
   sin;' of bettering and improving us by it, Heb. ii. 11; of moderating
   our affliction; that he will stay his rough wind in the day of the
   east-wind,' Isa. xxvii. 8; that he will lay no more upon us than he
   will enable us to bear,' 1 Cor. x. 13. He hath promised he will
   moderate our affliction, so that we shall not be tempted above our
   strength. He hath promised he will deliver us from it, that the rod of
   the wicked shall not always rest on the back of the righteous?' Ps.
   cxxv. 3; that he will be with us in it, and never fail us, Heb. xiii.
   5. Now, I argue thus: if the people of God could stay their hearts upon
   God's word when they had but such obscure hints to work upon, that we
   do not know where the promise lies, ah! how should our hearts be stayed
   upon God when we have so many promises! When the scriptures are
   enlarged for the comfort and enlarging of our faith, surely we should
   say now as Paul, when he got a word, Acts xxvii. 25, I believe God;' I
   may expect God will do thus for me, when his word speaks it everywhere.
   Then you may expostulate with God: I have thy word for it, Lord; as
   she, when she showed him the jewel, ring, and staff, Whose are these?
   So we may cast in God his promises: Whose are these according to thy
   word? And mark, David, that was punctual with God, I have sworn, and I
   will perform it; and quicken me according to thy word.' Sincere hearts
   may plead promises with God: Isa. xxxviii, 3, Lord, remember I have
   walked before thee with an upright heart.' These may look up and wait
   upon God for deliverance.

SERMON CXVIII.

   Accept, I beseech thee, the free-will-offerings of my mouth, O Lord,
   and teach me thy judgments.--Ver. 108.

   IN this verse two things are asked of God--God's acceptance; then,
   secondly, instruction.

   First, He begs acceptation. Therein take notice--(1.) Of the matter,
   object, or thing that he would have to be accepted, the
   free-will-offerings of my mouth. (2.) The manner of asking this
   acceptation, accept, I beseech thee, O Lord. In the former, you may
   observe the general nature of the thing, and then the particular kind;
   they were free will-offerings; and yet more express, they were
   free-will-offerings of his hands; not legal sacrifices, but spiritual
   services, free-will offerings of his mouth, implying praises. Our
   praises of God are called the calves of our lips,' Hosea xiv. 2,
   rendered there by the Septuagint, the fruit of our lips,' and
   accordingly translated by the apostle, Heb. xiii. 15, The fruit of our
   lips, giving thanks to his name.' He was in deep affliction, wandering
   up and down the desert; he was disabled to offer up to God any other
   sacrifice, therefore he desires God would accept the
   free-will-offerings of his mouth; he had nothing else to bring him.

   Secondly, He begs of God instruction in his way, teach me thy
   judgments. By misphalim, judgments,' are meant both God's statutes and
   God's providences. If you take them in the former sense, for God's
   statutes, so he begs grace to excite, direct, and assist him in a
   course of sincere obedience to God, practically to walk according to
   God's will. If you understand it in the latter sense, only for the
   accomplishment of what God had spoken in his word, for God's
   providence, for his corrective dispensation, Teach me,' he begs
   understanding and profiting by them.

   I shall begin with his first request, which offereth four
   observations:--

   1. That God's people have their spiritual offerings.

   2. That these spiritual offerings must be free-will-offerings.

   3. That these free-will-offerings are graciously accepted by God.

   4. That this gracious acceptance must be earnestly sought and valued as
   a great blessing, I beseech thee accept,' &c.

   Doct. 1. First, That God's people have their spiritual offerings. I
   shall give the sense of this point in five propositions.

   1. That all God's people are made priests to God, for every offering
   supposeth a priest; so it is said, Rev. i. 6, that Christ Jesus hath
   made us kings and priests.' All Christians, they have a communion with
   Christ in all his offices; whatever Christ was, that certainly they are
   in some measure and degree. Now, Christ was king, priest, and prophet;
   and so is every Christian, in a spiritual sense, a king, priest, and
   prophet; for they have their anointing, their unction from the Holy
   One, and he communicates with them in his offices. So also do they
   resemble the priesthood under the law. In 1 Peter ii. 5, they are
   called a holy priesthood to offer sacrifices to God;' and 1 Peter ii.
   9, they are called a royal priesthood.' They are a holy priesthood,
   like the sons of Aaron, who were separated from the people, to minister
   before the Lord; and they are a royal priesthood, in conformity to the
   priesthood of Melchisedec, who was king of Salem, and also priest of
   the most high God.' There is a mighty conformity between what is done
   by every Christian and the solemnities and rites used by the priests
   under the law. The priests of the law were separated from the rest of
   the people: so are all God's people from the rest of the world. The
   priests of the law were to be anointed with holy oil, Exod. xxviii. 41;
   so all Christians they receive an unction from the Holy One,' 1 John
   ii. 20. By the holy oil was figured the Holy Spirit, which was the
   unction of the Holy One, by which they are made fit and ready to
   perform those duties which are acceptable to God. After the priest was
   thus generally prepared by the anointing to their services, before they
   went to offer, they were to wash in the great laver which stood in the
   sanctuary door, Exod. xxix. 4; Lev. viii. 4, 5. So every Christian is
   to be washed in the great laver of regeneration, Titus iii. 5. And when
   they are regenerated, born again, purged and cleansed from their sins,
   then they are priests to offer sacrifices to God; for till this be
   done, none of their offerings are acceptable to him: for they that are
   in the flesh cannot please God,' Rom. viii. 8; and the sacrifices of
   the wicked are an abomination unto the Lord,' Prov. xv. 8. Thus you see
   in all these correspondences, and in many more, Christians they are
   priests. What the priests of the law were to God, that is every
   Christian now to God, to offer spiritual sacrifices by Christ Jesus our
   Lord.

   2. They have their offerings. The great work of the priest was to offer
   sacrifice, and this is our employment, to offer sacrifices to God. What
   sacrifices do we offer now in the time of the gospel? Not
   sin-offerings, but thank-offerings. A sin-offering can be offered but
   once: Heb. x. 14, By one offering Jesus Christ hath perfected for ever
   them that are sanctified.' And there needs no more of that kind; that
   was but to be once offered, Heb. vii. 27; and therefore there remains
   nothing more to be done by us but the offering of thank-offerings, and
   this is to be done continually: Heb. xiii. 15, By him therefore let us
   offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of
   our lips, giving thanks to his name.'

   3. These offerings must be spiritual thank-offerings. Under the law the
   thank-offering was that of a beast, but now under the gospel we offer
   spiritual sacrifices; therefore the apostle saith. 1 Peter ii. 5, Ye
   are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up
   spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.' The sacrifice
   must suit with the nature of the priesthood. The priesthood is
   spiritual, and not after the law of a carnal commandment, and not by an
   external consecration, but the inward anointing of the Holy Ghost. And
   herein we differ from the priests of the law, because the very nature
   and substance of our worship is more pleasing to God than the nature of
   theirs; for moral worship is better and more suited to the nature of
   God than ceremonial: God is a spirit, and will be worshipped in
   spirit,' John iv. 24. And therefore, when ceremonial worship was in
   force, they that rested in external ceremonies, and did not look to the
   spiritual intent and signification of them, were not accepted by God;
   though the ceremony was performed with never so much pomp, though they
   came with their flocks and herds, yet praying to God, and praising God
   with a willing mind, which was the soul of their offering, was that
   alone which was acceptable to God; therefore it is said, Ps. lxix. 30,
   31, I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him
   with thanksgiving: this also shall please the Lord better than an ox or
   bullock that hath horns and hoofs;' that is, which is perfect and exact
   according to the institutions of the law, for there was to be no
   blemish in the sacrifice of the law; yet calling upon the name of God,
   and praising him, is better than the service performed with the
   exactest conformity to legal rites: Ps. l. 13-15, Will I eat the flesh
   of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God thanksgiving, and
   pay thy vows unto the Most High, and call upon me in the day of
   trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.' The Lord
   draws them off from ceremonies to the spiritual service; it is more
   becoming the nature of God, and it is more reasonable service. The
   offering of a beast hath not so much of God's nature, nor of man's
   nature in it, only God would keep it up for a while; therefore now
   these are the great offerings.

   4. The two great sacrifices required of us, prayer and praise; there
   are many others, but they are implied in these. To instance, under the
   gospel there is this thank-offering, presenting ourselves to the Lord,
   dedicating ourselves to the Lord's use and service: Rom. xii. 1, I
   beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
   bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your
   reasonable service' 2 Cor. viii. 5, They first gave their own selves to
   the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.' And then there is alms: Heb.
   xiii. 16, To do good and communicate forget not, for with such
   sacrifices God is well pleased.' And when the Philippians had made
   contribution to Paul's necessities, he saith it was a sacrifice of a
   sweet-smelling savour unto God,' Phil. iv. 18. Ay! but now both these
   are included in the other two, namely, as they are evidences of our
   thankfulness to God, and the sense of his love and favour which we have
   received by Christ. The great and usual offerings are the fruit of our
   lips.' the calves of our lips,' here called the free-will-offerings of
   our mouth,' prayer and praise. That prayer is a sacrifice, see Ps.
   cxli. 2, Let my prayer be set before thee as incense, and the lifting
   up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.' The daily offering was
   accompanied with incense, and he mentions the evening sacrifice,
   because then was a more perfect atonement for the day, therefore when
   the evening sacrifice came, it was to be understood they were perfectly
   reconciled to God. And then that praise is a sacrifice, see Ps. liv. 6,
   I will freely sacrifice unto thee; I will praise thy name, O Lord, for
   it is good.' And in that other place where the Lord rejects the flesh
   of bulls and blood of goats, praise is substituted, Will I eat the
   flesh of bulls and blood of goats?' No: Ps. l. 14, Offer to me
   thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most High.' So Ps. cxvi. 17,
   18. So that prayers and praises are the oblations which we offer unto
   God under the gospel, either acknowledgments for former mercies, or
   petitions for future deliverances. These are the two duties which
   contain the substance of the ceremonies under the law, and are daily
   and constantly to be performed by us.

   5. Whatever was figured in the old sacrifices, it must be spiritually
   performed in the duty of prayer and praise. In those legal rites, there
   was an evangelical equity, or something that was moral and spiritual
   for us still to observe.

   As, first, in prayer, truth was the inward part of the sacrifice, for
   the mere external oblation was of no significancy with God. There were
   three things wherein it symbolizeth with prayer; in prayer there is
   required brokenness of heart, owning of Christ, renewing covenant with
   God.

   [1.] One thing that was required in sacrifices was brokenness of heart;
   for when a man came to present his beast before the Lord, he was to
   consider this beast was to be slain and burnt with fire; and to
   consider, All this was my case; I might have been consumed with his
   wrath, and be burnt with fire; and so come with a compunctionate
   spirit, with brokenness of heart, to bemoan his case before the Lord;
   therefore it is said, Ps. li. 17, The sacrifices of God are a broken
   spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.'
   This is required in every one that comes to prayer, brokenness of
   heart; that is, a sensibleness of his want of those good things for
   which he comes, and his inability to supply himself with anything
   without God; nay, his ill-deservings, how justly he might be denied of
   God, and cursed by all manner of plagues; how he hath forfeited all
   manner of blessings; this must be at the bottom.

   [2.] The sacrifices implied an eying of the Redeemer, by virtue of
   whose oblation and intercession we are accepted with God; for every one
   that came with his sacrifice was to lay his hand upon the head of the
   beast, to put his sins there, to show Christ bore the iniquity of us
   all; and in every prayer we make, there is this evangelical equity, by
   virtue of the old sacrifice remaining upon us, that we should eye the
   Redeemer, even Christ Jesus, our Lord, Who hath given himself for us,
   an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour,' Eph.
   v. 2. He is the expiatory sacrifice, and therefore in all our
   supplicatory or gratulatory offerings to God we must still look to him.
   The word, an offering, relates to things destitute of life that were
   dedicated to God, as flour, oil, frankincense; that which was signified
   thereby was accomplished in Christ. And for the other word, sacrifice,
   gave him self as an offering and sacrifice; the beasts whose blood was
   shed, those things which had life in them, were called a real sacrifice
   offered to God to appease his justice. Thus Christ Jesus was given as a
   sacrifice, to obtain all manner of blessings for us. We should look
   upon God as an all-sufficient fountain of grace, and the author of
   every good gift, depending upon him for his goodness and bounty for
   Christ's

   [3.] In sacrifices there was implied a renewing of covenant; so the
   Lord saith, Ps. l. 5, Gather my saints together, that have made a
   covenant with me by sacrifice.' As they did dedicate the beast offered
   to God, so was the worshipper to dedicate himself to God. Now we must
   renew this dedication of ourselves to the Lord's service; all this was
   morally in the sacrifices, and is to be done every day in our future
   prayers, with brokenness of heart, eying our Redeemer, casting our
   whole dependence upon him, and in a sense of his love dedicating and
   devoting ourselves to God.

   Secondly, For the other duty, of thanksgiving and praise for mercies
   received. Every point and passage of his undeserved favour to be owned,
   and praise thereof to be given to God, and still to look on all done
   not for our sakes, but for the sake of Christ Jesus. You read under the
   law, Lev. iii. 3, when the thank-offering was brought to God, it was to
   be laid upon the top of the burnt-offering. First they were to bring
   the burnt-offering, and offer that to God, then to lay upon it the
   peace or thank-offering, to show that first we must be reconciled to
   God, and by virtue of that all mercies descend and come down upon us;
   and then upon this solemn occasion they were to give up themselves anew
   to the Lord. So the apostle presseth this, Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you,
   brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
   sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
   service.' And this is one part of the offering of our lips, namely,
   when we come solemnly by virtue of every mercy received, and promise
   obedience anew and afresh to God. To apply this--(1.) Are you priests?
   (2.) Do you offer sacrifices of prayer and praise to God continually?

   [1.] Are you priests unto God? Are you priests by separation? Hath God
   called you out from amongst men? Ps. iv. 3, The Lord hath set apart the
   man that is godly for himself.' Hath God called you off from sin to
   holiness, from self to Christ, from the creature to God? for these are
   the three things wherein conversion consists. From the creature to God,
   as our last end; from self to Christ, as the only means to come to God;
   and from sin to holiness, as the only way to get an interest in Christ.
   Are you called off from the common course of living, wherein most men
   are involved, that you may live and act for God? Are you priests by
   unction? Are you anointed by the Spirit as to gifts and graces, and
   qualified and made meet for this holy ministration unto God? Christ
   hath purchased gifts in some measure for his people; for as we were
   maimed in Adam, not only as to graces but also as to gifts, so is our
   restitution by Christ, that the plaster may be as broad as the sore. We
   have necessary gifts given us by virtue of his ascension, whereby we
   may lay open our state and case to God. Indeed, all God's people have
   not a like measure of gifts, and carnal men may come behind in no gift,
   therefore have you the grace of prayer: Zech. xii. 10, I will pour upon
   them the Spirit of grace and supplication.' Have you a heart qualified
   by grace, made meet to converse with God? the tendency and disposition
   of your souls that carrieth you to God? grace that seeks a vent and
   utterance in prayer and holy converses with God? and are you priests by
   purgation? Every priest was to be washed in the great laver; are you
   washed and purged from sin, that you may serve God acceptably? Mal.
   iii. 3, first they must be purified, then offer unto the Lord an
   offering in righteousness. God will not take a gift out of a carnal
   man's hand; and therefore you should look to this, that you be purified
   and purged.

   [2.] Do you offer spiritual sacrifices to God, of prayer and praise?

   (1.) Prayer, a duty very kindly to the saints. It is natural to them;
   it is, as it were, the sphere of their activity, the Spirit discovers
   himself to men in prayer. As soon as they are converted to God they
   will fall a-praying, and be dealing with God often in this kind;
   therefore the children of God are described by this, as a duty wherein
   they are most exercised: Zeph. iii. 10, My suppliants;' and Ps. xxiv.
   6, This is a generation of them that seek thee;' to show this is a
   vital act, a usual and constant expressing of the new nature that is
   put into them. Surely they that love God will be always seeking him,
   and a broken heart, sensible of its condition, can never want an errand
   to the throne of grace. You are to offer sacrifices as they did under
   the law. Now under the law there was a daily sacrifice, every morning
   they were to offer a lamb without spot, Num. xxviii. 3, to show that
   every morning they should come and sue out their pardon by Christ, and
   every evening to look to the Messiah, the lamb of God, that takes away
   the sins of the world; that was the intent of the type. Now I reason
   thus: certainly we have as much need as they; we are sinners as well as
   that people which lived under that dispensation; therefore every
   morning we must look to the lamb of God. Nay, we have more reason, for
   they could not clearly discern the meaning of that type; but now all
   things are open, we can behold the lamb of God, therefore must be often
   with God, suing out our pardon' in the name of Christ.

   (2.) The sacrifice of praise. It is notable when the apostle had spoken
   of Christ as a sin-offering he mentions this as the main thing in the
   gospel: Heb. xiii. 15, By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
   praise to God continually.' Praise, it ought continually, frequently,
   and upon all occasions to be offered to God, for this is a more noble
   duty than prayer. Self-love may put us upon prayer, but love to God
   puts us upon praise and thanksgiving; we pray because we need God, and
   we praise because we love him. In prayer we become beggars, that God
   would bestow something upon us; but in praise we come, according to
   poor creatures, to bestow something upon God, even to give him the
   glory due to his name, and tell him what he hath done for our poor
   souls. This is the most noble among all the parts of Christian worship.
   We have more cause to give thanks than to pray, for we have many things
   more to praise God for than to pray to him for. There are many favours
   which go before all thought of desert, and many favours still bestowed
   upon us beyond what we can either ask or think.

   Doct. 2. Secondly, These spiritual offerings must be
   free-will-offerings to God. This expression is often spoken of in the
   law, Lev. xxii. 18; Num. xxix. 39; 2 Chron. xxxi. 14; Amos iv. 5. What
   are these free-will-offerings? They are distinguished from God's stated
   worship, and distinguished from that service which fell under a vow.
   Besides the stated peace-offerings there were certain sacrifices
   performed upon certain occasions to testify God's general goodness, and
   upon receipts of some special mercy; and you will find these sacrifices
   to be expressly distinguished from such services as men bound
   themselves to by vow, Lev. vii. 16. What is there that answers now to
   these free-will-offerings? Certainly this is not spoken to this use,
   that a man should devise any part of worship of his own head, whatever
   pretence of zeal he hath; but they serve to teach us two things:--

   1. They are to teach us how ready we should be to take all occasions of
   thankfulness and spiritual worship; for besides their vowed services
   and instituted services they had daily sacrifices and set feasts
   commanded by God; they had their free- will-offerings offered to God in
   thankfulness for some special blessing received or deliverance from
   danger.

   2. It shows with what voluntariness and cheerfulness we should go about
   God's worship in the gospel, and what a free disposition of heart there
   should be, and edge upon our affections in all things that we offer to
   God. And in this latter sense I shall speak, that our offerings to God,
   prayer and praise, should be free-will-offerings, come from us not like
   water out of a still forced by the fire, but like water out of a
   fountain, with native freeness, readily and freely.

   [1.] God loves a cheerful giver; constrained service is of no value and
   respect with him. Under the law, when sacrifice of beasts was in
   fashion, wherefore did God choose the purest and fattest of everything
   offered to him, but as a testimony of a willing mind? And still he
   looks to the affections rather than the action. God weighs the spirit,
   Prov. xvi. 2. When God comes to put them into the balance of the
   sanctuary, what doth he weigh? External circumstances of duty, or the
   pomp and appearance wherein men go? No; but he considers with what kind
   of heart it is done; and the love of sin, God takes notice of that, as
   well as the practice of sin. So in our duties, God takes notice of the
   love, the inclination of our souls, as well as the outward service;
   therefore our offerings must be free and voluntary.

   [2.] God deserves it, he doth us good with all his heart, and all his
   givings come to us from his love. Why did he give Christ for us and to
   us? He loved us.' Why gave he him for us?' God so loved the world,'
   John iii. 16. Why doth he give Christ to us? Eph. ii. 4, 5, God, who is
   rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we
   were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.' That which
   moved God to bestow his saving grace upon us was his great love, and
   all the good we receive from him. Why, mercy pleaseth him: I will
   rejoice over them to do them good.' If he deliver us out of any danger,
   he hath loved us from the grave,' Isa. xxxviii. 7. Now love should
   season all our services to God.

   [3.] Where a day of grace hath passed upon our hearts, so it will be;
   the soul will come off readily and freely to the duties God hath
   required of us: Ps. ex. 3, Thy people shall be a willing people in the
   day of thy power.' We are naturally backward, slow of heart to do
   anything that is good, hang off from God, will not be subject to him;
   but when the day of his power passeth upon us, then we are a willing
   people, we are more delighted in communion with God, less averse from
   him, the bent of our hearts is altered, and the stream of our
   affections is turned another way. and our converses with God are more
   delightful, and we are as earnest in serving God as before we were in
   serving sin.

   Use. To press us to serve God with a perfect heart and with a willing
   mind, 1 Chron. xxix. 9. Thus when we give God any spiritual sacrifice,
   when we pray to or praise him, we should do it willingly, not
   customarily, or by constraint, or for by-ends, nor by the compulsion of
   a natural conscience; and when we feel, as we shall now and then, any
   tediousness and irksomeness in prayer, we should quicken ourselves by
   this motive: Christ Jesus, who was our sin-offering, he willingly
   offered up himself upon the service of our salvation. I might urge
   other arguments, as the nobleness of our service, the greatness of our
   reward, the many sweet experiences we shall gain in our converse with
   God; but this should be as the reason of reasons, and instead of all.
   Christ Jesus did not grudgingly go about the work of our salvation, but
   willingly offered himself: Ps. xl. 8, I delight to do thy will, O my
   God; yea, thy law is within my heart.' When God would have no more
   legal sin-offerings, but the great sin-offering of the gospel was to be
   produced and brought forth in the view of the world, Lo, I come; in the
   volume of the book it is written of me.' Now our thank-offering should
   be carried on with the same willingness. Christ will be served now out
   of gratitude, and therefore his love should constrain us. Surely if we
   believe this great mystery of Christ, that he did willingly offer
   himself upon the service of our souls, and if we have any faith in him,
   faith will work by love,' Gal. v. 6. The soul may reason and discourse
   thus with itself, Do I believe Christ Jesus did thus willingly give
   himself for my soul? how can I be backward in God's service and hang
   off from him? Oh! let me live to Christ, who loved me, and gave himself
   for me,' Gal. ii. 20. What! shall I be more backward to do for God than
   Christ was to die for me, to go to the throne of grace than Christ
   Jesus was to go to the cross? Can I hang him off from such pleasing
   noble service, when Jesus Christ my Lord refused not the hard work of
   my redemption? If his will was in it, certainly so should be yours.

   Doct. 3. The third point, that these free- will-offerings are accepted
   with God. They shall come with rams,' speaking of the conversion of the
   Gentiles in terms proper to the old legal dispensation, and they shall
   come with acceptance,' Isa. lx. 7; and Mal. iii. 4, Then shall the
   offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord.' Upon what
   grounds, and what way our acceptance with God is brought about? Our
   works in themselves cannot please God, they are accepted not as merits,
   but as testimonies of thankfulness.

   1. Our persons are by Christ reconciled to God, and in worship he
   delights. This is the proper importance of laying the peace-offering
   upon the top of the burnt-offering, Lev. iii. 10.

   2. Our infirmities are covered with his righteousness; for Christ is
   the propitiation, the mercy-seat that interposeth between the law and
   God's gracious audience. We come to the throne of grace when we come to
   God in and by him, Heb. iv. 16.

   3. By his intercession our duties are commended to God; as Aaron was to
   stand before the Lord with his plate upon his forehead, where in was
   writ, Holiness to the Lord.' Why? That he might bear the iniquity of
   the people, that they might be accepted of the Lord.' All our
   acceptance comes from Christ's intercession; and alas! our prayers and
   praises are unsavoury eructations, belches of the flesh, as they come
   from us; a great deal of infirmity we mingle with them, we mingle
   brimstone with our incense and sweet spices, therefore provoke the Lord
   to abhor and despise us; but there is an angel stands by the altar that
   perfumes all our prayers and praises. How should this encourage us
   against the slightings of the world and discouragements of our own
   hearts, and to look after the testimony of our acceptance with God!

   Doct. 4. The fourth point, that this gracious acceptance must be sought
   and valued as a great blessing: Ps. xix. 14, Let the words of my mouth
   and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord.'
   And it must be valued as a great blessing, if we consider either who
   the Lord is, or what we are, or what it is we go to him for. If we
   consider who the Lord is, God all-sufficient, that standeth in no need
   of what we can do, that cannot be profited by us; he is of so great a
   majesty, that his honour is rather lessened than greatened by any thing
   we can do; the great author of all blessings, all our offerings come
   from himself first: Of thine own have we given thee.' And if we
   consider what we are, poor, impotent, sinful creatures, will God take,
   an offering at our hands? And if we consider what we do, nothing but
   imperfection; there is more of us in it, of our fleshly part, in
   anything we do, yet that these things should be accepted with God.

SERMON CXIX.

   My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.--Ver.
   109.

   IN this verse and the next, David asserts his integrity against two
   sorts of temptations and ways of assault--the violence and craft of his
   enemies. Their violence in this verse, my soul is in my hand; and their
   craft in the next verse, they laid snares for me. And yet still his
   heart is upright with God.

   In this verse observe--(1.) David's condition, my soul is continually
   in my hand. (2.) His constancy and perseverance, notwithstanding that
   condition, yet do I not forget thy law.

   First, Let me speak of the condition he was now in, in that expression,
   My soul is continually in my hand.' The soul in the hand is a phrase
   often used in scripture; it is said of Jephthah, Judges xii. 3, I put
   my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon.' So
   Job xiii. 14, Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life
   in my hand?' And when David went to encounter Goliath, 1 Sam. xix. 5,
   it is said, He put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine.' In
   exposing ourselves to any hazard and dangers in any great attempt, it
   is called the putting of our life in our hand. And the witch of Endor,
   when she ventured against a law to please Saul, and so had exposed her
   life, this form of speech is used concerning her, 1 Sam. xxviii. 21, I
   have put my life in my hand.' Briefly, then, by soul is meant life, and
   this is said to be in his hand; I go in danger of my life day by day;
   as if he should say, I have my soul ready divorced when God calls for
   it. It not only notes liableness to danger, but resolution and courage
   to encounter it. In a sense, we always carry our souls in our hands;
   our life hangs by a single thread, which is soon fretted asunder, and
   therefore we should every day be praying that it may not be taken from
   us, as the souls of wicked men are, Job xxvii. 8; Luke xii. 20, but
   yielded up, and resigned to God. But more especially is the expression
   verified when we walk in the midst of dangers and in a thousand deaths:
   My soul is in my hand;' that is, I am exposed to dangers that threaten
   my life every day.

   Secondly, Here is his affection to God's word, notwithstanding this
   condition, Yet do I not forget thy law.' There is a twofold remembrance
   of things--notional and affective; and so there is a twofold
   forgetfulness:--

   1. Notional. We forget the word, when the notion of things writ ten
   therein has either wholly or in part vanished out of our minds.

   2. Affectively. We are said to forget the word of God when, though we
   still retain the notion, yet we are not answerably affected, do not act
   according thereunto, and this is that which is understood here, I do
   not forget thy law.' Law is taken generally for any part of the word of
   God, and implies the word of promise, as well as the word of command.
   As for instance:--

   [1.] If we interpret it of the promise, the sense will be this: I do
   not forget thy law; that is, I take no discouragements from my dangers
   to let fall my trust, as if there were no providence, no God to take
   care of those that walk closely with him. Heb. xii. 5, when they
   fainted, they are said to have forgotten the consolation which spake
   unto them as unto children.

   [2.] If we interpret this word law' of the commandments and directions
   of the word, and so I do not forget it; that is either by way of
   omission, I do not slacken my diligence in thy service for all this; or
   by way of commission, I do not act contrary to conscience; and the
   effect of the whole verse is this: Though I walk in the midst of
   dangers and a thousand deaths continually, yet at such a time, when a
   man would think he should not stand upon nice points, even then he
   should keep up a dear and tender respect to God's law. And he doth the
   rather express himself thus, I do not forget it, because great
   temptations blind and divert the mind from the thought of our duty. Our
   minds are so surprised with the dangers before us, that God's law is
   quite forgotten as a thing out of mind, and we act as if we had no such
   comfort and direction given us. The points are two:--

   1. That such things may befall God's children that they may carry their
   lives in their hands from day to day.

   2. When we carry our lives in our hands, no kind of danger should make
   us warp and turn aside from the direction of God's word.

   Doct. 1. That such things may befall God's children that they may carry
   their lives in their hands from day to day.

   That this is often the lot of God's people, we may prove: 1 Cor. xv.
   31, I protest, by our rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord,
   I die daily.' How can that be, I die daily, since we die but once? The
   meaning is, I go still in danger of my life. Such times may come when
   we run hazards for Christ every day, so that in the morning we do not
   know what may fall out before night: 2 Cor. xi. 23, In deaths often;'
   that is, in danger of death. So 1 Peter iv. 19, Let those that suffer
   according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him
   in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.' Let them commit their
   souls, that is, their lives; the soul is sometimes put for life, for
   life spiritual or life eternal, but there it is put for life natural;
   so let them commit their souls to God, that is, in times of danger and
   hazard. Let them go on in well-doing cheerfully, and though there be no
   visible means of safety and defence, let them commit their lives to God
   in well-doing; when they carry their lives in their own hands, let them
   be careful to put them into the hands of God. Let God do what he
   pleaseth, for he is a faithful Creator; that is, as once he created
   them out of nothing, so he is able to preserve them when there is
   nothing visible, nothing to trust to. Often this may be the case of
   God's people, that they carry their lives in their hands from day to
   day. That you may take the force of the expression, consider when the
   people of God are in the midst of their enemies, then they carry their
   lives in their hands: Mat. x. 16, Behold I send you forth as sheep in
   the midst of wolves;' when they are among men no better affected to
   them than wolves to sheep, and when men have them in their power, and
   there is no outward restraint of laws and government; for whatever
   enmity they have or act against them, laws and government are a great
   restraint; as Gen. xxvii. 41, The days of mourning for my father are at
   hand, then will I slay my brother Jacob.' Till Isaac was dead, there
   was a check upon him; but sometimes it is in the power of their hands
   to do them mischief: Micah ii. 1, They practise iniquity, because it is
   in the power of their hand.' When men are ill affected, no restraint
   upon them, no impediment in their way, yea, when they begin to
   persecute and rage against the servants of God, and we know not when
   our turn comes, then we are said to have our lives in our hand; as Rom.
   viii. 36, For thy sake are we killed all the day long;' that is, some
   of that body killed, now one picked up, then another; in these cases
   they are said to carry their lives in their hands, when they are in the
   power of men that have no principle of tenderness to us, no restraint
   upon them, these begin to vex, molest, and trouble the Church.

   For the reasons why God permits it so, that his people should carry
   their lives in their hands.

   1. God doth it to check security, to which we are very subject. We are
   apt to forget changes; if we have but a little breathing from trouble,
   we promise ourselves perpetual exemption therefrom; as Ps. xxx. 6, My
   mountain stands strong, I shall never be moved.' When we have got a
   carnal pillow under our heads to rest upon, it is hard to keep from
   sleep, and dreaming of temporal felicity to be perpetuated to us; then
   we forget by whom we live, and by whose goodness we subsist; yea, this
   may be when trials are very near: the disciples slept when their master
   was ready to be surprised and they scattered, Mat. xxvi. 40; when we
   are in the greatest dangers, and matters which most concern us are at
   hand. Now, to prevent this security, God draws away this pillow from
   under our heads, and suffers us to be waylaid with dangers and troubles
   everywhere, that we might carry our lives in our hands, for this makes
   us sensible of our present condition in the world, and that we subsist
   upon God's goodness and providence every moment.

   2. To wean us from creature confidences and carnal dependences: 2 Cor.
   i. 9, We received the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should
   not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead.' Paul, that
   went up and down everywhere to hunt the devil out of his territories,
   and to alarm the carnal sleepy world, this Paul was very prone to trust
   in himself; a man that was whipped, imprisoned, stoned, opposed
   everywhere by unreasonable men, what had he to trust to but God's
   providence? And yet he needs to be brought to this, to take his life in
   his hands, that he might learn to trust in God that raiseth from the
   dead. The best are prone to trust in themselves, and to lean to a
   temporal, visible interest. We would fain have it by any means,
   therefore sometimes we take a sinful course to get it. Well, now, God,
   to cure his people of this distemper, breaks every prop and stay which
   they are apt to lean upon, breaks down the hedge, the fence is removed,
   and lays them open to dangers continually, so that from day to day they
   are forced to seek their preservation from him.

   3. To check their worldliness. We are very apt to dote upon present
   things, and to dream of honours and great places in the world, and seek
   great things for ourselves, when we should be preparing for bitter
   sufferings. As the two sons of Zebedee employed their mother to speak
   to Christ; being near of kin to him, she comes in a cunning manner,
   under pretence to worship him, and propounds a general question to him;
   she does not at first propose the particular, but says in general, I
   have a certain thing to request of thee.' And what was her request?
   That one of my sons may sit on thy right hand, and the other on the
   left, in thy kingdom.' Saith Christ, To sit on my right hand and on my
   left is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is
   prepared of my father.' Mark, out of this story you learn how apt
   Christ's own disciples are to dote upon worldly honour and greatness.
   The sons of Zebedee, James and John, those two worthy disciples, employ
   their mother to; Christ in such a message; they were dreaming of
   earthly kingdoms and worldly honour that should be shared between them,
   notwithstanding Christ taught them rather to prepare for crosses in
   this world. Do but reflect the light of this upon your own hearts. Do
   we think we are better than those apostles? and that it is an easy
   thing to shut the love of the world, and the honour thereof, out of our
   hearts, since they were so enchanted with the witchery of it? Therefore
   Christ tells them, Mat. xx. 22, Alas! poor creatures, ye know not what
   ye ask: can you pledge me in my cup, and be baptized with the baptism
   that I am baptized with?' We know not what we do when we are hunting
   after high places in the world; we are to pledge Christ in his bitter
   cup before our advancement come. Nay, to prove this is not only the
   worldling's disease, but it is very incident to the choicest of God's
   people; for after Christ had suffered and rose again, the apostles were
   not dispossessed of this humour, but still did dream of worldly ease
   and honour, therefore they come to Christ with this question, Acts i.
   6, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?'
   meaning, in the Jewish sense, break the Roman yoke, and give them power
   and dominion over the nations, hoping for a great share to themselves
   when this work was done. Thus you see human weakness and the love of
   worldly honour bewrays itself in Christ's own disciples. One instance
   more, in Jer. xlv. 5, of Baruch, Seekest thou great things for thyself?
   seek them not.' Baruch, he was Jeremiah's scribe, had written his
   prophecy, and believed it, that dreadful roll, written it over, yet he
   was seeking some great thing for himself. The best are apt to think
   they shall shift well enough for themselves in the world; therefore
   saith Jeremiah, For thou to have thoughts of honour and credit, and a
   peaceful and prosperous estate, when all is going to rack and ruin,
   never dream upon such a matter. Now judge whether there be not great
   cause that God should bring his people to such a condition that they
   should carry their life in their hands from day to day, that he might
   cure them of this distemper.

   4. That they may value eternal life the more, which they would not do
   if they had a stable condition here in the world. After death there
   will be a life out of all danger, and a life that is not in our hands,
   but in the hands of God; none can take that life from us which God
   keepeth in heaven. Now that they might look after this life, and value
   and prize it the more, they are exposed to hazards and dangers here.
   The apostle saith, 1 Cor. xv. 19, If in this life only we have hope in
   Christ, we are of all men most miserable.' When they find the present
   life encumbered with so many sorrows, and exposed to so many dangers,
   then they conclude surely there is a better and safer estate for the
   people of God elsewhere in heaven. God's people cannot be of all men
   most miserable; there is another life; they have hopes in Christ, and
   for other things; therefore they long for it, and look for it: Heb.
   xiii. 14, Here we have no abiding city, but we seek one to come.' All
   things are liable to uncertainties and apparent troubles, that we might
   look after that estate where the sheep of Christ shall be safely lodged
   in their eternal fold. Now God by their condition doth, as it were, say
   to them, as Micah ii. 10, Arise, this is not your rest.' Your stable
   comforts, your everlasting enjoyments are not here; here all our
   comforts are in our hands, ready to deliver them up from day to day.

   5. God doth by his righteous providence cause it to be so, that his
   people carry their life in their, hands, to try their affections to him
   and his word. When we sail with a full stream of prosperity, we may be
   of God's side and party upon foreign and accidental reasons. Now God
   will see if we love Christ for his own sake, and his ways as they are
   his ways when separated from any temporal interest, yea, when exposed
   to scorn, disgrace, and trouble. It is easy to be good when it costs us
   nothing, and the wind blows in our backs rather than in our faces, the
   state of affairs is for us rather than against us. Halcyon times and
   times of rest are times of breeding the church, but stormy times are
   times of trying the church: 1 Peter iv. 12, Be loved, think it not
   strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some
   strange thing happened unto you.' God will put us into his furnace,
   there will a fiery trial come, to see if we have the same affection to
   truth when it is safe to own it, and when it is dangerous to own it,
   when it is hated and maligned in the world. Few professors can abide
   God's trial: Zech. xiii. 9, I will bring the third part through the
   fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as
   gold is tried.' When two parts fall away, there is a third part refined
   and tried by trials. When the generality proves dross, or chaff, or
   stubble in the furnace, there is some good metal preserved, to shine
   brighter, for trial as their zeal is increased and their grace kept
   more lively, and their faith and dependence upon a continual exercise.
   God will try whether we can live upon invisible supports, and go on
   cheerfully in the performance of our duty in the midst of all
   difficulty, without these outward encouragements. They are proved that
   they may be improved.

   6. God doth cause such things to befall his people, to show his power
   both in their preservation and in overruling all those cross
   providences for their good.

   [1.] His power in their preservation; when they have no temporal
   interests to back them, God will show he can preserve his people: Ps.
   xcvii. 1, The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice, let the multitude
   of isles be glad thereof.' It is well that the Lord reigns, else how
   could his people stand? The Lord reigns, and the multitude of isles
   they have a share in the joy and benefit. One benefit that we have by
   his reign is this, ver. 10, compared with ver. 1, he preserveth the
   souls of his saints; that is, their lives; he delivereth them out of
   the hand of the wicked. There is an overruling, a secret and in visible
   providence, by which they are kept and hidden as in a pavilion, so they
   have often experience of wonderful preservation in the midst of all
   their troubles.

   [2.] God shows his power for overruling all these accidents for the
   increase and benefit of his church and people. When the believers were
   scattered, and driven up and down, when exposed to hazards and
   inconveniences, it is said, Acts xi. 21, The hand of the Lord was with
   them; and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord.' God can
   make their loss turn to their increase. Christ often gets up upon the
   devil's shoulders, and is beholden more to his enemies than to his
   friends in this sense, because that which would seem to stop his
   course, and to obscure his glory, doth advance it so much the more:
   Phil. i. 12, The things which happened unto me, have fallen out rather
   unto the furtherance of the gospel.' The gospel was not extinguished by
   Paul's imprisonment, but propagated. I say, Paul's sufferings were as
   necessary as Paul's preaching, that the truth might gain, and that it
   might be known and heard of. God overrules all these actions for his
   glory, and for the benefit of his church.

   Use 1. First, if we be not in this condition, let us look for it and
   prepare for it. Religion is a stranger in the world, and therefore it
   is often ill-treated; we have a stable happiness elsewhere, and here we
   must expect changes. All the comforts and hopes of the scriptures is
   suited to such a condition; a great part of the Bible would be need
   less, and would be but as bladders given to a man who stands upon dry
   land, and never means to go into the waters; the comforts and
   provisions God hath made for us in the word would be useless, it' such
   things did not befall us. Why hath God laid in so many sup ports, if we
   think never to be put to distress and troubles? Oh! then, think of
   these things beforehand, and make them familiar to you. The evil which
   I feared is come upon me,' saith Job. When the back is fitted, the
   burden will not be so dreadful. Think of these things beforehand, that
   you may provide and prepare for them. Now, that you may not be strange
   at such kind of providences, consider four things:--

   1. The world will be the world still. There is a natural enmity between
   the two seeds, which will never be wholly laid aside, between the seed
   of the woman and the seed of the serpent, Gen. iii. 15; as natural an
   enmity as between the wolf and the lamb, the raven and the dove: 1 John
   iii. 12, Cain was of that wicked one, and slew his brother; and
   wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his
   brother's righteous.' Separation and estrangement in course of life is
   a provoking thing. Men that live in any sinful course are loath any
   should part company with them, that there might be none to make them
   ashamed; therefore when they draw from their sins, and do not run with
   them into the same excess of riot, they think it strange; your life is
   a reproof to them: John vii. 7, The world hateth me, because I
   testified of it that the works thereof are evil;' and Heb. xi. 7, Noah
   condemned the world; being moved with fear, prepared an ark.'
   Strictness is an object reviving guilt. Every wicked man loves
   another--Velut factorem, adjutorem et excusatorem sui criminis, as one
   that favours his actions, and helps to excuse his actions. One wicked
   man doth not put another to the blush. It is no shame to be black in
   the country of the negroes. But when there is a distinction, some walk
   with God humbly and closely, certainly your life is a reproach to
   others that do not so, therefore they will hate you.

   2. This enmity hath ever been working: the prophets and holy men of God
   have had experience of it. Abel was slain by Cain, Gen. iv. 18; Isaac
   scoffed at by Ishmael, Gen. xxi. 11; which example the apostle
   allegeth, Gal. iv. 29, He that was born after the flesh persecuted him
   that was born after the spirit,' So it was then, so it is now, and so
   it will ever be to the world's end. Ever it hath been the lot of God's
   children to suffer hard things from the men of this world, though they
   are related to them in the nearest bonds of kindred and acquaintance.
   Jacob, because of the blessing and birthright, was pursued to death by
   Esau, and driven out of his father's house, Gen. xxvii.; Moses driven
   out of Egypt by his unkind brethren, Acts vii. 25-27; David hunted up
   and down like a partridge upon the mountains; Jezebel sought Elijah's
   life; Micaiah thrown into prison, and hardly used; Elisha pursued by
   Jehoram for his head. Instances are end less of this kind; ever there
   hath been an enmity, and ever will be.

   3. Persecutions are more, greater, and longer in the New Testament than
   in the Old. Why? Partly because the Old Testament church was under
   tutors and governors, Gal. iv. 1, 2; neither for light of knowledge,
   nor ardour of zeal to be compared with the New Testament church, when
   the kingdom of heaven suffers violence,' Mat. xi. 11. Look, as Christ
   spared his disciples until they were fit for greater troubles, till fit
   for the new wine, Mat. ix. 17, so God spared that church. The church
   then had troubles, but for the most part they were not for religion,
   but for defection from God, for their sins. And partly, too, because
   the church of the Old Testament was not so dispersed, but confined
   within the narrow bounds of one province or country, not mixed with the
   profane idolatrous nations, nor exposed to their hatred, contradiction,
   and rage; but of Christians, the apostle tells us, this sect is
   everywhere spoken against. And partly because Satan then had quiet
   reign over the blind world for a long time; but now, when Christ comes
   to dispossess him, to turn out the strong man--the goods were in peace
   before, and now he hath but a short time--he hath great wrath, Rev.
   xii. 11. When Christ came to seize upon the world, it was quick and hot
   work, his force and violence was greater. Again temporal promises were
   more in the eye of the covenant, where all things were wrapped up in
   types and figures; when prosperity signified happiness, and long life
   signified eternity, there were not such exercises and trials then. But
   now, All those that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer
   persecution,' 2 Tim. iii. 12. But since Christ hath set up his church,
   and brought light and immortality to the world, now troubles are
   greater.

   4. Persecutions from pseudo-Christians will also be hot and violent:
   Rev. xiv. 13, Write from henceforth, saith the Spirit, Blessed are the
   dead that die in the Lord.' Why, the dead that die in the Lord? they
   were always blessed from the beginning of the world; why such a solemn
   notice from heaven? Why from henceforth? The meaning is this: those
   that suffered under pagan persecutions, all Christians would call them
   blessed that died in the Lord. Ay! but now, when the persecutions began
   under the pseudo-Christians, blessed are the dead that die in the Lord
   from henceforth still. Nay, the persecutions here are greater than the
   pagan, and of longer continuance. Why? Because they have a show of
   Christ's authority, as the beast in the Revelations had horns like a
   lamb; that beast which spake like a dragon, deceived the nations,
   enchanted the world with her witchery and sorcery, that beast had a
   pretence of the authority of Christ, Rev. xiii. 11. And the purity of
   Christians is greater, and so more enraging; and the great quarrel in
   the latter ages of the world is about a temporal interest. The spirit
   of the world is the spirit of antichristianism, and all those that hang
   upon her are of the spirit of the world: 1 John iv. 5, They are of the
   world, therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.'
   Now, when these are contending for the world, this doth exceedingly
   inflame and heighten the rage against those that would endanger their
   worldly interest. You see there is cause to think that God will expose
   us also to our trials; therefore we should be forewarned and prepared
   for these things that they may not come upon us unawares.

   Use 2. If God's people are put into such a condition that they carry
   their lives in their hands, then learn from hence, that if we have
   greater security for our lives and interests, we ought more to bless
   God and to improve the season. It is a great mercy that we have laws to
   secure our religion and our interests, that we have Christian and
   Protestant magistrates to execute those laws, that we may in safety
   worship God in the public assemblies, and we ought to bless God. But
   then, if this be our condition, there are three duties required of
   us:--

   1. To acknowledge God in this mercy, for it is he that hath the hearts
   of magistrates in his own hands: Prov! xxi. 1, The king's heart is in
   the hand of the Lord; as the river of waters, he turneth it
   whithersoever he will.' Their thoughts, their designs, inclinations and
   aversations are in God's hands. And as God hath power, so hath he
   promised this blessing, Isa. xlix. 23, that he will give kings to be
   nursing fathers, and queens nursing mothers.' Well, there is a power
   and a promise. What follows then? Only that we praise God for so much
   of it as we have, and that we pray to God still for more, that we may,
   under our kings and governors, lead godly and quiet lives,' 1 Tim. ii.
   1, 2; and therefore, if we have greater security for our lives and
   interests, God must be acknowledged.

   2. Be so much the more in active obedience: Acts ix. 31, Then had the
   churches rest.' And what then? And they walked in the fear of God, and
   in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.' When you have a good day, you should
   improve it well; when we may walk up and down in the security of laws,
   and serve God freely, oh! let us serve him much; we are not called to
   renounce our interests, therefore let us mortify our lusts. Fires are
   not kindled about us to consume our bodies, therefore let the fire of
   God burn up our lusts. If the saints are to quit their well-being,
   certainly it should not be grievous to us to part with our ill-being,
   with our sins for God's service. Look, as Salvian de Gub. lib. iii.,
   saith, when our kings are Christians, and religion is not troubled by
   them, now God calls us to be more pure and holy in our conversations;
   now we do not shift for our lives, let us avoid occasions of evil; now
   we are not cast into prisons, let us confine ourselves to our closets,
   that we may serve God more cheerfully there.

   3. Bear the lesser troubles with more patience, when this is not our
   condition, that our lives are carried in our hands from day to day. It
   was never so well with the people of God, that if not in kingdoms, yet
   in families, in parishes, in lesser societies there will be some
   conflict; now these we should bear with more patience, because the
   children of God are exposed to that condition that they have carried
   their lives in their hands from day to day: Heb. xii. 3, Consider him
   that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be
   wearied and faint in your minds.' You are not called unto a resistance
   to blood.' As Julian the apostate said to one, If he was so offended
   with their taunts, what would he be with the darts of the Persians? If
   we cannot suffer a reproach, and an angry word for Christ; if we murmur
   when we are a little slighted and forgotten by men, and left out of the
   tale of the world, oh! what would we do if we were called to suffer
   greater things? Jer. xii. 5, If thou hast run with the footmen, and
   they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horsemen?'
   that is, if thou canst not endure the scorn, reproach, and opposition
   of a few private wicked men that stand upon even ground with thee, how
   canst thou contend with horses, when there are other manner of
   oppositions?

   Use 3. If this should now befall you, as it hath befallen God's
   choicest servants, and very likely so to do for those reasons I gave,
   then shrink not, but resolve to endure any extremity rather than take
   any sinful course for your ease; nay, be not dejected if it should
   happen: Acts xxi. 13, I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die
   for the name of the Lord Jesus.' There was one that had his life in his
   hand indeed, that had the courage to lay it down. To quicken you
   hereto, let me give a few considerations:--

   1. God hath given you greater things than possibly you can lose for his
   sake; though we should lose life and all, yet he hath given us his
   Christ. Saith Ambrose, We are indebted for a person of the. Godhead;
   and shall we stick at our personal interests and concernments? Shall we
   not die for his honour who died for our salvation? die temporally for
   him who maketh us to live eternally? and give that body as a sacrifice
   to the honour of Christ, which otherwise by the law of nature will
   become meat for the worms? therefore every Christian should carry his
   life in his hand, Phil. i. 20, either by martyrdom or ministerial
   labours.

   2. No evil is like to that evil which will befall us in forsaking God:
   Mat. x. 28, Fear not them which can but kill the body,' &c. Shall we,
   rather than run hazards with the sheep of Christ, be contented to howl
   with wolves in everlasting darkness, when we for a little temporal
   danger refuse to run hazard with Christ's sheep, shall be cast into
   hell-fire for evermore? If we are so tender of suffering, what will it
   be to suffer hell-fire?

   3. All that we can lose is abundantly made up in the other world. Heb.
   xi. 35, it is said, they would not accept deliverance, having obtained
   a better resurrection.' There is a resurrection from death to life,
   when we come out upon ill terms, by accepting the enemy's deliverance.
   Ay! but there is a better resurrection when we come out upon God's
   terms, a resurrection to life and glory hereafter. Violence doth but
   open the prison door, and let out the soul that long hath desired to be
   with Christ; and therefore we should endure, as expecting this better
   resurrection.

   4. Consider upon what slight terms men will put their lives in their
   hands for other things, and shall we not run hazards for Christ? Many
   venture their lives for a humour, a little vainglory, to show a
   greatness of spirit; or they venture their lives upon revenges, upon a
   punctilio of honour. Some will venture their lives in the wars for one
   shilling a day, and shall we not carry our lives in our hands for
   Christ? Scipio boasted of his soldiers, that they loved him so as to
   venture their lives for him, to leap into the sea, and cast themselves
   down a steep rock: There are none of these but if I spake the word,
   shall go upon a tower, and throw himself down into the sea if I bid
   him. So Fulgentius' story of those that would obey their chief, whom
   they called Vetus, the old man of the mountain, if he bid them fall
   down a steep rock, to show their obedience; and shall not we venture
   our lives for Christ?

   Doct. 2. That when our souls are continually in our hands, no kind of
   danger should make us warp and turn aside from the direction of God's
   word. Why?

   1. A Christian should be above all temporal accidents; above carnal
   grief, carnal joy, worldly hope, worldly fear; he should be dead to the
   world, or else he is not thoroughly acquainted with the virtue of
   Christ's cross, Gal. vi. 14.

   2. God can so restrain the malice of wicked men, that though we carry
   our lives in our hands, we shall be safe enough for all that: Prov.
   xvi. 7, When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies
   to be at peace with him.' Mark, the Lord can secure you against men,
   when a man pleaseth the Lord; but when a man pleaseth men, they cannot
   secure you against the Lord, they cannot save you harmless from the
   wrath of God, or answer for you to the Almighty, nor give you safety
   from the terrors of conscience. But on the other side, many a man by
   pleasing God finds more safety and comfort in opposing the lusts and
   the humours of men than in complying with them. God's providence is
   wonderfully at work for his children when they are reduced to these
   extremities; either he can allay their fury, turn in convictions upon
   their consciences of the righteousness of those whom they molest and
   trouble, as when Saul hunted for David, 1 Sam. xxiv. 17, Thou art more
   righteous than I.' God puts conviction upon him. Nay, sometimes such a
   fear and reverence that they dare not: Mark vi. 20, Herod feared John
   because he was a strict man.' Or some check or bridle, some contrary
   interest that God can set up, that their hands are withered when they
   are stretched out against them, as was Jeroboam's hand; and therefore a
   Christian, though his life be in his hand, he should not warp. Why? For
   God can mightily provide for him as to his temporal safety: 1 Peter
   iii. 13, Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which
   is good?' It is an indefinite proposition, some times it will be true.
   Let a man follow that which is good, who dares harm him? There is an
   awe, and he is kept safe, though not always.

   3. We renounced all at our first coming to Christ. Estate, credit,
   liberty, life, it was all laid at Christ's feet, if our hearts were
   really upright with him. A man must lay down self, whatever it be, else
   he cannot be Christ's disciple, Mat. xvi. 24; Luke xiv. 26. This was
   done in vow, in a time of peace; therefore it must be actually done and
   made good in a time of trouble. Your interests are God's, and are only
   given back to God again; your estate, life, liberty, and credit, all
   given up. Why? That you may have something of value to esteem as
   nothing for Christ.

   4. Our sufferings shall be abundantly recompensed and made up in the
   world to come: Rom. viii. 18, I reckon that the sufferings of this
   present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall
   be revealed.' For a man to stand comparing his interest or sufferings
   here in this world with the glory revealed, is as foolish a thing as if
   a man should set a thousand pound weight with a feather. So 2 Cor. iv.
   17, Our light affliction,' &c. We are often saying, If we lose this and
   that, what will become of us? what shall we have? Mat. xix. 27-29, We
   have left all.' A great all they had left for Christ; it may be a net,
   a fisher-boat, a cottage; yet he speaks magnificently of it, and what
   shall we have?' Have! You shall have enough; in the regeneration you
   shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.'

   5. You should not warp, though you carry your lives in your hands,
   because constancy is necessary. How necessary? For our credit and good
   name as we are men: Do I use lightness?' saith the apostle, 2 Cor. i.
   17. Men lose their authority and esteem, they are not accounted grave,
   serious, and weighty, when they shift and change, and appear with a
   various face to the world; and certainly it is for our comfort, for our
   right to everlasting blessedness is most sensibly clear by constancy in
   God's cause: Phil. i. 28, And in nothing terrified by your adversaries,
   which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of
   salvation, and that of God.' Oh! what would a man give for to clear
   this, that he is an heir of God? This is an evident token; and it is
   necessary for the credit of the truth which we profess. When we shift,
   turn, and wind, we bring a dishonour upon it; but, saith the apostle,
   Phil. i. 14, They waxed confident by my bonds;' this puts heart and
   courage. And it is for the honour of God: 1 Peter ii. 14, On your part
   he is glorified;' and John xxi. 19, Signifying by what death he should
   glorify God.' Since constancy is so necessary, either we should not
   take up principles, or suffer for them if called thereunto.

   Use 1. Caution to the people of God. Take heed you do not forget the
   word, when you carry your lives in your hand. Many of God's people may
   do so sometimes, as when we deny the truth: Mat. xxvi. 72, Peter denied
   before them all, saying, I know not the man.' Or when we take any
   sinful course for temporal safety, as when David feigned himself mad
   before Achish, 1 Sam. xxi. 13. Or when our spirits are filled with
   passion against the instruments of our trouble, and with uncomely
   heats, as Peter drew a sword in a rash zeal, and had no thanks for it,
   but a rebuke from Christ. Or when we suffer in a heartless and
   comfortless manner, as God's children sometimes are in dejections of
   spirit. David took notice of his drooping and disconsolateness, Ps.
   xlii. 5; when he flitted up and down in the wilderness, pursued with
   Saul's army, he had his droopings and discomforts. In these cases we
   forget the word of God.

   Use 2. To press you to courage and constancy in a time of danger; to
   endure all extremities, rather than do anything against the word of
   God. Here I shall inquire:--

   1. What is this Christian courage? There is military valour and
   Christian valour. The one consists in doing, the other in suffering,
   great things. Peter, at Christ's death, had more of the military valour
   and fierceness than of the passive valour, for he that could venture on
   a band of men was foiled by a damsel's question. The one dependeth on
   hastiness of temper, greatness of blood and spirits; the other upon
   faith and submission to God's will: Acts vii. 55, He being full of the
   Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of
   God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.' It is spoken when
   the people gnashed on him with their teeth, then full of the Holy
   Ghost. There is the habit of fortitude, and the act of it when led on.
   There is a great deal of difference between the courage of wicked men,
   and the faith and fortitude of good Christians. We see rude men are
   undaunted in the face of danger, but the fortitude of Christians
   consisteth in lifting up their eyes and hearts to heaven; others not,
   for as soon as they think of God, their courage faileth; the more
   brave, the more they shut out the thought of divine things, all sense
   of God and immortality: 1 Cor. xv. 32, Let us eat and drink, for
   to-morrow we shall die.' It is a brutish fury, inflamed by wine,
   stirred up by trumpets and drums, not stirred up by the consolations of
   God, or remembrance of his covenant; then they are dejected, Rev. vi.
   15-17.

   2. To remove such objections as may hinder your courage and constancy.

   [1.] It is a sore temptation to keep our service, but we must stand to
   God's providence, to honour him by service or suffering, as he shall
   think good. We are to honour God in his own way, we are not to stretch
   conscience in the least degree to continue it. God hath no need of thy
   sin; when God hath a mind to lay you aside, submit.

   [2.] The smallness of the difference is another objection. If it were
   to turn Turk, or heathen, or papist, men will say, they would not do so
   and so. God standeth upon every peek of his word, every dust of truth
   is precious.

   [3.] Another objection is this, we shall be interpreted to hinder the
   public peace.

   I answer--If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
   with all men,' Rom. xii. 18. But be sure not to betray the cause of
   God, nor lose the interest of Christ; that is not possible which is not
   lawful in a moral sense.

   [4.] Another objection is, that we shall be accounted peevish, rash,
   stubborn.

   I answer--We must be led to credit. There is a difference between men
   stubborn and obstinate and zealous. Many may sacrifice a stout body to
   a stubborn mind, but be courageous and constant in the service of God.

   3. What is necessary to this well-tempered courage, that we may suffer
   not out of humour, but out of conscience towards God? Not because
   formerly engaged by profession, or out of a desire of a name and esteem
   among religious persons, but out of obedience to God, who commandeth us
   to choose afflictions, rather than sin. To this resolution there is
   necessary--

   [I.] A heart weaned from the world, Mat. vi. 24, otherwise a man will
   act very uncertainly, and his zeal for God be very uneven.

   [2.] A heart entirely devoted to God. Every one that cometh to Christ
   must be thus resolved, Luke xiv. 26.

   [3.] A heart purged from sin, or else our zeal is not uniform, besides
   that our lusts will weaken our courage. A carnal person, suffering in a
   good cause, is of no account with God. The priests were to search the
   burnt-offering if sound, or had any defect or blemish upon them. He
   that keepeth the commandments is best able to suffer for them: Mat. v.
   10, Blessed are they that suffer for righteousness' sake.' A martyr
   must have all the precedent graces.

   [4.] A heart that lieth under a deep sense of eternity, and things to
   come: 1 John v. 4, This is the victory we have over the world, even our
   faith.' Not any looking backward, but forward.

SERMON CXX. [9]

   The wicked have laid a snare for me; yet I erred not from thy
   precepts.--Ver. 110.

   HERE is the second assault made upon David's integrity, the secret
   snares laid for him. The enemies of God's people do not always go to
   work in the way of open persecution, and directly for righteousness'
   sake; but then they lay snares; what they cannot do by open force, they
   seek to do by fraud. Many that have stood out with courage against the
   shock k of violence, have been taken in a snare; as the prophet that
   resisted the king was enticed by the blandishments of the old prophet,
   1 Kings xiii. Persecution is a more gross way, and liable to exception,
   and therefore they must go secretly to work. Sometimes this life is a
   continued temptation, and a Christian that walketh in the world walketh
   in the midst of snares set for him, by his enemies bodily and
   spiritual. The devil is the great snare-layer, and wicked men learn it
   of him: The wicked have laid a snare for me,' &c. In the words
   observe--

   1. David's temptation, a snare laid for him.

   2. The persons who managed the temptation, the wicked.

   3. The success and issue, yet I erred not from thy precepts.

   Doct. The godly have often snares laid for them, not only by Satan, but
   by wicked men.

   Now snares are to entice, or endanger, or of a mixed nature.

   1. Snares to entice them from their duty. Thus the blandishments of the
   whorish woman are called a snare: Prov. vii. 23, As the bird hasteth
   unto the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.' Of this
   nature are crafty insinuations, baits of preferment, profit, pleasure,
   or any carnal advantage, to pervert our judgments, and draw us off from
   our duty.

   2. Snares to endanger their safety, clogged with some spiteful
   condition to entrap others, or when there is a plot laid to endanger
   others, as Jeremiah complaineth, Jer. xviii. 22, They have digged a pit
   to take me, they have hid snares for my feet;' secretly conspired and
   practised his destruction. And David, Ps. cxl. 5, The proud have hid a
   snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside, and set
   gins for my feet. Selah.' Hunters and fowlers did never go more
   cunningly to work to catch the prey, than those proud men had laid
   their design to bring his life under their power. And in Ps. xxxv. 7,
   For without cause they have hid for me their net in a pit, which
   without cause they have digged for my soul;' and Ps. lvii. 6, They have
   prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a
   pit for me, into the midst whereof they are Mien themselves. Selah.'
   Now of this sort are St Bartholomew's matins, and the plot and
   contrivance to out the Protestants in France, when they were invited to
   a wedding, that they might destroy them; and of this nature was the
   Gunpowder Treason; there was a snare laid. When Orestes had plotted
   Clytemnestra's death, Euripides expresseth it, kalos ar' a'rkun es
   me'sen poreu'etai--she fitly cometh into the snare.

   3. Of a mixed nature, both to entice by endangering, and endanger by
   enticing.

   [1.] As when they put them upon such conditions as may tempt them to
   folly and sin. Some think the text verified in David, at that time when
   he said, 1 Sam. xxvi. 19, They have driven me out from abiding in the
   inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go serve other gods;' meaning, they
   excited Saul to pursue him and persecute him, and forced him to flee
   into an idolatrous country, and so a snare laid to endanger his
   steadfastness in the true faith. It is a great temptation. Necessitas
   cogit ad turpia--necessity is but an evil counsellor; and this joined
   with the other temptation of bad company: Ps. cxx. 5, Woe is me that I
   sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar.'

   [2.] When they enact a law or statute, whereby to force them to sin or
   trouble; as they had a plot against Daniel, either to make him neglect
   his God, or render him obnoxious to authority, Dan. vi. 7, 8. When they
   burden them with such laws and statutes as the godly cannot obey
   without sin, or refuse without danger; they have their ends either to
   draw them to sin or suffer.

   Now snares are laid by the wicked:--

   1. Because usually they excel in policy, craftiness, and worldly wit,
   are superior to God's children therein; their whole hearts run that
   way, and their principle is entire and unbroken; and therefore our Lord
   Christ telleth us, Luke xvi. 8, For the children of this world are in
   their generation wiser than the children of light.' They applaud
   themselves in their artifices, idolise their wit: Hab. i. 16, Sacrifice
   to their net, and burn incense to their drag;' therefore use it to the
   saints' destruction.

   2. Because they are acted by Satan, who will ever be doing against the
   church, though to little purpose. Luke xxii. 3, the devil entered into
   Judas when he plotted against Christ. They learn their wiles from
   Satan, and conceive mischief by copulation with the great incubus of
   hell.

   3. Their own hatred and malice against the people of God. Malice is a
   laying snares. Anger vents itself in a storm of words, or in some
   sudden violent action; but hatred lurketh in the soul, and puts them
   that harbour it upon plots and contrivances of revenge. The historian
   observeth of Tiberius, In malitiam statim invectus est, &c. When
   Absalom hated Amnon, because he forced his sister, he plotteth how to
   take away his life, 2 Sam. xiii. 22.

   Now, whence cometh this malice against the children of God? Either by
   envy at their interests, or hatred at their holiness.

   1. Envy at their interests, their esteem and respect in the world, when
   they come to be of any regard among men. Esther v. 9, Hainan plotteth
   against Mordecai, because he sat in the king's gate: Ps. cxii. 9, 10,
   His horn shall be exalted with honour; the wicked shall see it, and be
   grieved, and gnash with their teeth.' When the gospel was like to get
   credit, Acts xvii. 5, the envious Jews raised an uproar. Pride is loath
   to stoop; to see opposites in glory and power whets their malice, and
   they contrive how to root them out. Every man would have himself and
   his own faction admired and magnified. The Pharisees conspired to take
   Christ: John xii. 19, All the world is gone after him.' When religion
   prevaileth, and groweth in credit and fashion, it is deeply resented by
   naughty men.

   2. Hatred at their holiness. Men cannot endure to be outstripped in
   religion, and therefore hate what they will not imitate. Hatred is
   quick-sighted in revenge, full of plots and contrivances, and tickleth
   the soul with a delight in them; but especially religious hatred, when
   a man hateth another for his godliness, when religion, instead of a
   party, becomes a judge, that which should restrain our passions feeds
   them; no hatred so great as that against the power of godliness. Cain,
   when he saw Abel so punctual in God's service, he plotteth to draw him
   into the field, 1 John iii. 12, and beginneth a discourse with him
   about providence and judgment to come, and rewards and punishments, and
   while Abel maintained God's part, Cain fell upon him and slew him.

   To apply this. As these snares tend to our temporal destruction, so
   there is a double use to be made of them.

   1. To trust God with our safety in the midst of so many snares. What
   shall we do? Whatever remedy we have against violence, no man by his
   own foresight can find out all the snares that are laid for him;
   therefore commit your safety spiritual and temporal to the Lord; go to
   him and say, Ps. cxli. 9, Keep me from the snare they have laid for me,
   and the gins of the workers of iniquity.' Constant dependence upon God
   is necessary, for there can be no snare hidden from him who watcheth
   over us and our safety by night and by day. There is a double argument
   why we should trust God with our safety; because of his wisdom, and
   because of his watchful providence. Because of his wisdom. Alas! we are
   foolish and simple, and often betray ourselves into an evil condition;
   but God is wise for them that are foolish: Ps. xxxvii. 12, 13, The
   wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth:
   the Lord shall laugh at him, for he seeth that his day is coming.'
   There is a wise God acting for a foolish people. I tell you, the wisdom
   of God for us is much greater than the wisdom of God in us. Where
   enemies deal proudly, God is above them; where they deal craftily, God
   is beyond them. The wisdom of God for us is greater than the wisdom of
   any against us. And also because of his watchful providence; he hath a
   waking love and care of us night and day: Ps. cxxi. 4, Behold he that
   keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.' He will be so far from
   sleeping, that he will not so much as slumber. When, we know nothing,
   his providence finds out the secret contrivances that are against us. I
   tell you, God is our father; he will maintain us and take care for us,
   when we live by faith, and not by shifts, in a good plain downright
   course of honesty: Gen. xvii. 1, I am God all-sufficient: walk before
   me, and be thou perfect;' that is, they should go on doing their duty,
   and refer the care of their safety to God. Oh! then, cast yourselves
   upon the Lord; he will either direct your way to eschew these snares,
   or pluck your feet out of them if you be taken therein: Ps. xxv. 15,
   Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord; he shall pluck my feet out of the
   snare.' Look to him for direction and counsel.

   2. Bless God for your safety and preservation; it is a mercy to have a
   being, in the midst of so many dangers and snares as waylay us
   everywhere; especially should we bless God when we have escaped some
   notable trap and pit that was digged for us: Ps. cxxiv. 7, Our soul is
   escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
   broken, and we are escaped.' This is a passage we may use to God this
   day. There are two grounds usually of thanksgiving for this
   deliverance:--

   [1.] That their devices came to nought: Job xv. 35, They conceive
   mischief and bring forth vanity.' It discovereth the wisdom, power,
   goodness, and watchfulness of God, that this dark and hellish
   machination, that they thought so wisely laid that all devils in hell
   could not discover it, yet the God of heaven brought it to light: Prov.
   xxi. 30, There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the
   Lord.'

   Those three words set out the quintessence of parts. Wisdom noteth a
   quick apprehension; understanding a wise foresight grounded upon
   experience; counsel a designation of some rare artifice: Isa. viii. 9,
   10, Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in
   pieces; and all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be
   broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought;
   speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.'

   [2.] The mischief returned back upon themselves: Ps. vii. 15, He made a
   pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
   Higgaion. Selah.' Their instruments; it is a high note that we may
   observe it. An iron heated red-hot burneth their fingers that hold it;
   they are taken in their own pit, poisoned in their own cup, holden in
   cords of their own vanity, so that in the issue it appeareth they laid
   a snare for themselves rather than for us.

   Use 2. As they are enticements to sin; so we may make many uses of it.

   1. You ought to ask God's counsel, for you walk in the midst of snares,
   that he would guide you and lead you: Ps. xxvii. 11, Teach me thy way,
   O Lord; lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.' Those that
   watch for our halting are many, their craft is great; therefore go to
   the wise God for counsel; ask of him what your way and course shall be,
   for he seeth that which you see not.

   2. Get spiritual wisdom and understanding. An ignorant, credulous heart
   is soon seduced, but a man of understanding, that seeth his danger, is
   not easily drawn and allured into it: Prov. i. 17, In vain is the snare
   laid in the sight of any bird.' The vain, credulous, simple young man
   is soon enticed by the lewd woman, in the 7th of the Proverbs.

   3. Keep the highway of duty, and walk by a sure rule, and then you are
   safe. David saith here, I erred not from thy precepts.' In a time of
   snares, often consult with your rule. It is Satan's aim to put us out
   of our way; as when the fisherman would get the fishes into the net, he
   seeketh to rouse them out of their place. Take a man out of God's way,
   and he becometh a ready prey to Satan. In doubtful cases there is no
   man chooseth the worst, but first he breaketh some known rule and clear
   moral precept. Therefore be punctual, and keep close to God's
   directions in clear and known cases, and you are safe.

   4. There needs a mortified heart to worldly interests; our temporal
   interest is to be shaken off. A man of carnal affections seeketh but
   the snare: Job xviii. 8, He is cast into a net by his own feet, and he
   walketh upon a snare.' If we will find the sin and disposition of
   heart, God will find the occasion; and a man that hath a commodity to
   put off (faith and a good conscience), will soon find a chapman to
   truck with him. Judas was thinking of betraying Christ, and the high
   priests were plotting how to do it just at the same time. Worldliness
   layeth us open to the snare: 1 Tim. vi. 9, But they that will be rich,
   fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful
   lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.' But he that is
   dead to worldly interests remaineth firm, whatever bait be proposed.

   Secondly, We come to the' persons that managed the temptation, the
   wicked: The wicked have laid a snare for me.'

   Doct. It is the property of a wicked heart to plot and lay snares for
   the mischief and ruin of others, especially God's people. David saith
   here, The wicked have laid snares for me.'

   1. It is a deliberate, voluntary sin; and the more will and advisedness
   in any sin, the greater it is. Laying of snares is not a thing done in
   passion, but in cool blood; there is art and cunning in it, and the
   heart dwelleth long upon it. The will sets the wit a-work, to weave the
   net and frame the device. Involuntarium minuit de ratione peccati--when
   a thing is involuntary it lesseneth sin; a man may be overtaken with a
   fault, Gal. vi. 1. But when he studieth it, it is much the worse. God's
   children are surprised through unwariness, and made to stumble in a fit
   of temptation; but when men's wits are bended to project and plot sin,
   it is not an infirmity but an iniquity: Prov. vi. 14, Frowardness is in
   his heart; he deviseth mischief continually, he soweth discord.' It is
   the description of a naughty heart; so the prophet, Micah ii. 1, Woe to
   them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds: when the
   morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their
   hands.' Their wickedness is premeditated, then woe to them.

   2. It is a sign that evil is connatural to them, when they are
   plotting, as poison is to a spider; they are always working it, never
   out of their way by night and by day, their hearts run upon it: Prov.
   iv. 16, Whenever they are abroad, they sleep not unless they have done
   mischief, and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to
   fall.' Then when others cannot rest, they examine themselves. Ps. iv.
   4, Commune with your hearts upon your beds.' When our reins should
   instruct us, and suggest wholesome thoughts to us, Ps. xvi. 7; or when
   we should direct our prayer to God in the morning, Ps. v. 3, then they
   employ their thoughts and musings on evil. The apostle maketh it to be
   their disposition that are given up by God to a reprobate sense, to be
   inventors of evil things,' Rom. i. 30.

   3. They that plot evil, they are of the devil's trade, whose work it is
   to hurt and mischief those who are broken loose from him; it is his
   business to lay snares: 2 Tim. ii. 26, And that they may recover
   themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him
   at his will.' When Judas plotteth against Christ, the devil entereth
   into him. So Acts xiii. 10, it is said to Elymas the sorcerer, O thou
   full of all subtlety and mischief, the child of the devil.' They are
   like the devil in their hatred of God and the truth, and the
   persecution of the church, and like him for subtlety and politic
   contrivance. Bloody designs and inventions are the venom and poison of
   the old serpent sunk into men's hearts; there are both cruelty and
   lying: John viii. 44, Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of
   your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
   not in the truth, because there is no truth in him: when he speaketh a
   lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.'

   4. It is a sin contrary to the love of God and man, against double
   light and double obligations, from both the tables: grace and nature
   condemneth it. It is against God, for if we did love him, we would love
   his image; the saints that are so near and dear to him, they are his
   jewels,' Mal. iii. 17; they cost him dear; he gave an infinite price
   for them, the blood of Christ: they are the apple of his eye; to strike
   at them is to strike at God himself. And it is against man; if reasons
   of grace do not restrain such, yet reasons of nature should. To plot
   mischief against one that is of the same nature with us, natural light
   will teach us we should do as we would be done by. Oh! what a cruel
   creature is man to man, when God lets him alone to the sway of his own
   heart and natural fierceness!

   5. It is contrary to the gentleness and simplicity of the Christian
   religion. Christian religion is a simple and harmless thing: Phil. ii.
   15, That ye be holy and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in
   the midst of a crooked and perverse generation;' 2 Cor. 1. 12, This is
   our rejoicing, that in simplicity and godly sincerity we have had our
   conversation in the world.' It is a sign men have drunk in a false
   religion when their spirits are efferated, and grow monsters in
   wickedness. Men addicted to false worship are subtle and cruel; subtle,
   for where there is real worth there is no dissimulation; they carry
   things open and fair; they have a God and conscience to bear them out,
   and this is worth all the world; and if things do not suit to their
   minds, they can tarry God's leisure, without base and creeping acts,
   and underhand designs and machinations; but a false religion, that hath
   not a God to depend upon, breedeth fears, and fear and pusillanimity
   puts men upon plots and bloody designs, as Herod, when afraid, seeketh
   craftily to murder Christ, Mat. ii. And as a false religion is crafty,
   so it is mischievous and cruel: Jude 11, These walked in the way of
   Cain;' for a false religion cannot subsist without the plots of blood
   and tyranny and cruelty. When Judaism began to fall, the Jews bound
   themselves under an oath that they would neither eat nor drink till
   they had killed Paul. False worships put men upon a blind zeal, that
   breaketh out in tragical effects. Tantum religio potuit suadere
   malorum. So much of truth, so much of meekness, openness, and
   plainness, as the other is of spite and malice.

   Use. Oh! then, let the children of God abhor this hateful disposition;
   take heed of those kind of sins that have subtlety and malice in them;
   these are the devil's sins, the cursed old serpent, that hath been a
   murderer from the beginning; take heed of plotting mischief, and
   secretly designing the ruin of others. I would have you Christians,
   that are of the true religion, carry it meekly towards others; beware
   of deliberate sins. It is possible in some great temptation the
   children of God may fall into these kind of sins, as David plotted
   Uriah's death; but that sin was laid to his charge more than all the
   sins that ever he committed. These sins are accompanied with some
   notable affliction and judgment, as on David's sad house; they leave an
   indelible stain and blemish, and cost us dear: 1 Kings xv. 5, David did
   that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from
   anything that he commanded him all his days, save in the matter of
   Uriah.'

   How many failings have we left upon record? His distrust: I shall one
   day perish by the hand of Saul.' His dissimulation, with his rash vow
   to destroy Nabal; his injustice in the matter of Ziba and Mephibosheth;
   indulgence to Absalom, numbering the people, wherein he showed his
   carnal confidence. All these are passed over in silence, as his
   infirmities, save only in the matter of Uriah. And they will cost dear;
   there is always some eminent trouble and affliction that accompany such
   sins. When David had sinned in the matter of Uriah, what troubles were
   there in his house; his daughter ravished, Amnon slain in his
   drunkenness, Absalom driveth him from his palace royal, and then, poor
   man, his subjects deserted him, he forced to go weeping up and down,
   and shift for his life; all Israel came to Absalom, his wives defiled
   by his own son. Thus you see what is the fruit of deliberate sins.

   These sins cost us a great deal of bitter sorrow, sighs, and tears, to
   recover our peace and God's love and favour. Again, how bitterly did
   David remember his sin, and beg that God would restore to him the joy
   of his salvation!' Ps. li. Therefore take heed of deliberate sins, when
   we have time enough to have serious and sufficient consideration of the
   evil, and yet do it; when a man knoweth a thing to be evil, and yet
   resolveth to go forward with it. Sin is not done suddenly, in heat of
   blood, but at leisure; not limited to a minute, or an hour, or any
   short space of time; and yet to do it, this grieves the Spirit, and
   will cost us dear.

SERMON CXXI.

   Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the
   rejoicing of my heart.--Ver. 111.

   IN this notable psalm there are many independent sentences expressing
   David's affection to the word of God. In this verse you have--(1.)
   David's choice, Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever.'
   (2.) The evidence of that choice, For they are the rejoicing of my
   heart.' I call it the evidence, for so it is a proper demonstration
   that he took God's precepts for his heritage; this is the mark and sign
   of it, They are the rejoicing of my heart.' It did his heart good to
   think of his heritage, and what an ample portion he had in his God.

   First, Let me speak of his choice, whence this observation. It is the
   property of believers to take God's testimonies for their heritage. In
   the management of which truth, I shall show--

   1. What are God's testimonies.

   2. What it is to take them for an heritage.

   3. The reason why it is their property to do so.

   1. What are God's testimonies. Any declaration of his will, in
   doctrine, precepts, threatenings, promises. The whole word, it is the
   testimony which God hath proposed for the satisfaction of the world. It
   is God's deposition or testimony, to satisfy men what is his mind and
   will concerning their salvation. God's testimony is the public record,
   that may be appealed unto in all cases of doubt, Ps. xix. 8, The
   statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart,' &c.; The
   testimonies of the Lord are sure, making wise the simple.' By the
   statutes of the Lord, is meant in general the whole counsel of God
   delivered in the word. But then more specially and chiefly they imply
   the evangelical or gospel part of the word, the promises of the
   covenant of grace, Isa. viii. 20, To the law and to the testimonies.'
   Testimony in this sense is contradistinguished to the law or God's
   precepts, what is required of us; thus the ark of his testimony' is
   called by that name. Mark this notion of calling the word God's
   testimony; it shows us what regard we should have to the precepts and
   promises of God; you need regard them, it is God's testimony to you and
   then against you. Christ would have his word preached as a testimony
   against them,' Mat. xxiv.,--a testimony to them that they might know
   God's mind, and then, if it were not received, a testimony against them
   at the last day; when God comes to judgment, the sinner will be without
   an excuse, but will not be without a testimony; every sermon will rise
   up against him in judgment; it will be a testimony for their
   conviction.

   And as we should regard his precepts, so it shows in what regard his
   promises are, which are chiefly his testimony; therefore it is said,
   John iii. 33, He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal
   that God is true.' You give God the glory of his truth by venturing
   your souls upon his testimony, whereas otherwise you make him a liar,'
   a blasphemy which is most contrary to the glory of his being: 1 John v.
   10, He that believeth not makes God a liar.' Look upon the promises as
   God's testimonies, you may urge it to your own heart and to God. We may
   urge it to our own heart when we are full of doubts and troubles; here
   we have God's testimony to show for it, Why do ye doubt, O ye of little
   faith?' Here is God's testimony. Nay, it is a testimony under an oath,
   that the heirs of promise might want no satisfaction, Heb. vi. 18. If
   we had but God's bare word it should beget faith, for God stands much
   upon his truth; but we have his oath, his hand and seal. Why! after
   such a solemn assurance shall I make God a liar, as being in doubtful
   suspense? And they are a testimony which you may produce to God
   himself: Lord, thou hast said, and here is a promise wherein thou hast
   caused me to hope; I expect nothing but what thou wilt perform. Look,
   as Tamar showed the tokens to Judah when he was about to condemn her,
   showed him the ring and the staff as a testimony, and said, Whose are
   these? Gen. xxxviii. 25, you put God in mind of his promise; here is
   the testimony he hath called you to these hopes whereby you should wait
   upon him. How shall we take it here? for the precepts of God, or the
   promises, or both? Surely the precepts of the word are the heritage, or
   the gospel and treasure of the church, a treasure not to be valued; and
   every single believer is to take up his share, and count them his
   treasure and his heritage. No man can take the promissory part of the
   word for his heritage, but he is to take the mandatory part also; as in
   every bond and indenture the conditions must be kept on both sides. So
   if you should take it for the whole covenant of God, wherein God is
   bound to us and we to God, there were no incongruity. Yet the notion of
   an heritage is most proper to the promises, and these are the rejoicing
   of our soul, the foundation of our solid comfort and hope. The promises
   are a witness in our hearts how he stands affected to us, of which we
   are most apt to doubt through our unbelief. Natural light will convince
   us of the justice and equity of his precepts; therefore by the special
   use of the word the promises of God are called his heritage. Again, the
   promises are put for the things promised, and testimonies for the
   things contained and revealed in them; for the promises properly are
   not our heritage, but they are the evidences, the charters which we
   have to show for our heritage. The blessings of the covenant are
   properly our heritage, and the promises are the assurance and
   conveyances by which this heritage is made over to us. As we say a
   man's estate lies in bonds and leases, meaning he hath these things to
   show as his right to such an estate; so the promises, that is the
   blessings contained, or the testimony revealed there, they are the
   things a believer takes for his portion. Thus I have showed what is
   meant by the testimonies of God.

   2. What is it to take them for our heritage? There are two words,
   heritage, and I have taken them. The word heritage first notes the
   substance of our portion, or what we count our solid and principal
   estate; secondly, it notes our right and propriety in it; thirdly, the
   kind of tenure by which we hold it; fourthly, many times actual
   possession. Now saith David, I have taken; that implies actual choice
   on our part. We are not born heirs to this estate, but we take it, we
   choose it for our portion. And mark, he doth not say they are, but I
   have taken them for my heritage. Every believer cannot say, These are
   mine, they are my heritage, for everyone hath not assurance; but yet
   every one should say, I have taken them,' there I look for my
   happiness; for every believer is alike affected, though not alike
   assured. David doth not here so expressly mention his interest, though
   that is implied, as his choice. Briefly, to take God's testimony for
   our heritage implies four things:--

   [1.] To count them our choicest portions. Let others do what they will,
   this is my share, my lot, my portion, saith David; that which I esteem
   to be my happiness; this is as lands, goods, treasures to me, dearer
   and nearer than all temporal things whatsoever. Look, as a believer in
   the duty part of religion takes the precepts for his counsellor, so
   David saith, Ps. cxix. 24, Thy testimonies also are my delight and my
   counsellors,' or the men of my counsel. Answerably in the happy part,
   they are my heritage and the rejoicing of my soul; it is my wealth, my
   treasure, my chief estate. Every man is known by the choice of his
   portion; now David was not taken up with any worldly thing, so as to
   make that his heritage, or account it his solid happiness, wherein his
   soul could find complacency and contentment.

   [2.] It signifies to make it our work to get and keep up an interest in
   God's testimonies; this is to take them for our heritage. Esteem is
   manifested by prosecution. That which is our chiefest work, that shows
   us what we take to be our heritage. What 1 is it to grow great in the
   world, to shine in pomp, to flow in pleasure, or to get and maintain an
   interest in the covenant? What do we seek first? Is it the kingdom of
   God and his righteousness'? Mat. vi. 33. The main care is to make sure
   an interest in the covenant, to get a right and propriety in it.

   [3.] To hold all by this tenure: heritage is a child's tenure. We do
   not come to this right by our own purchase, but as heirs of Christ; not
   by our own merits, but by adoption, God making us children and
   joint-heirs with Christ,' Rom. viii. 17; and if children, then heirs;
   heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.' Adam's tenure was that of a
   servant; the blessings that he expected from God, by virtue of the
   covenant of works, he looked upon them as wages of obedience; but now,
   we take the promises as an heritage, as a right devolved upon us as
   heirs of Christ, because believers are called the seed of Christ, and
   upon the account of that are possessed of the privileges of the
   covenant: Isa. liii. 10, He shall see his seed, and the pleasure of the
   Lord shall prosper in his hands.' This is a heritage purchased for us
   before we were born, before we had done either good or evil; and we
   have the right and title of sons, John i. 12; he hath given us this
   privilege to be the sons of God. Whatever we receive, we receive it
   from God as a child's portion.

   [4.] Heritage signifies actual use and possession, and living upon
   them; and so I have taken thy testimonies for my heritage; that is, I
   mean to live upon them, and fetch all my comforts thence. A believer's
   interest is not an imaginary thing. We do enjoy somewhat by virtue of
   the promises. It is true our full fruition is suspended till hereafter,
   but we begin here. The testimonies of the Lord they are of present use
   in the present life; therefore we are said to be Heirs according to the
   hope of eternal life,' Titus iii. 7. God doth not take us to heaven
   presently upon our spiritual nativity or new birth. It pleaseth God to
   exercise us for a while in our nonage, under tutors and governors, and
   to make us differ little from servants; but for the present we have
   maintenance, we live by faith, Gal. ii. 20. We live upon our heritage,
   and fetch thence not only peace and righteousness and grace, but meat,
   drink, and clothing, protection, and defence. So that to take God's
   testimonies for our heritage is to live upon them as far as the present
   state will permit, to fetch out all our supplies from the covenant;
   otherwise we should make the promises to be but a conceit and
   imagination, if they did not afford present support. A believer doth
   not live upon outward supplies only, but upon the covenant; not upon
   meat and drink, food and raiment, but he fetcheth all from the
   covenant, by the exercise of faith, and so these things are sanctified
   to him. So that to take them as our heritage is to make them the
   grounds of our future hopes, and the storehouse from whence we receive
   our present supply. And this is that which is called living by faith,
   fetching all our supports and supplies out of the promises: Gal. ii.
   20, All that Hive in the flesh' (so in the original), I live by the
   faith of the Son of God.'

   3. For the reasons, why it is the property of believers to take the
   testimony of God for their heritage; before I come to that, first, I
   must show what kind of heritage it is; secondly, How believers only,
   and no others, can take them from their heritage.

   [1.] What kind of heritage it is. It is a heritage which exceeds all
   others in three particulars--it is full, it is sure, it is lasting;
   therefore we must pitch upon it for our solid happiness.

   (1.) It is a full heritage, and nothing can be added to the
   completeness of our portion; for in the promises here is God, heaven,
   earth, providences, ordinances, all made ours, and all inward comforts
   and graces they are a part of our portion; and what can a soul desire
   more? Here is God made over to us; the great blessing of the covenant
   is, I am thy God. Other men say (and they will think it a great matter
   when they can say), This kingdom is mine, this lordship is mine, this
   house, these fields are mine; but a believer can say, this God, this
   Christ, this Holy Spirit is mine. Alas! riches and honour and worldly
   greatness are poor things to a God made ours in covenant. Nay, mark the
   emphasis; God is not only ours, but ours as an heritage: Ps. xvi. 5,
   The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.' They may claim a title to
   God, and enjoy the possession of God as freely as a man would do his
   own inheritance. I say, they have as sure a right to God, and all that
   he is and can do, as a man can have to the patrimony whereunto he is
   born. And as the Lord is theirs, so heaven and earth are both theirs.
   Heaven is theirs: let a believer be never so despicable in the world,
   yet he is an heir-apparent to the kingdom of heaven, James ii. 15.
   Though, it may be, you are poor persons, nothing to live upon; poor
   apprentices, nothing to set up withal, yet God hath chosen the poor of
   this world to be heirs of a kingdom.' Poor believers are but princes in
   disguise, princes in a foreign country, and under a veil; they have a
   large patrimony; it lies indeed in an unknown land to the world, it is
   in terra incognita to them; but believers know what an ample portion
   God hath laid up for them, heirs of a kingdom. If that be not enough,
   take that other expression, Rom. viii. 17, Heirs, co-heirs with
   Christ.' Christ as mediator, and we as members of his body, possess the
   same God, one father, one husband, one estate; we dwell together, live
   together; where he is we are. Besides God and heaven there is the world
   too. Here is the difficulty, how a Christian, that hath not a foot of
   land, yet should be heir of all the world. All things are theirs, saith
   the apostle, 1 Cor. iii. 21. And it is said of Abraham, who was the
   father of the faithful,' and whose blessing comes upon us, that through
   the righteousness of faith he became heir of the world.' He was
   re-established in the right which Adam had before the fall, that
   wherever God should cast his portion, he should look upon it as made
   over to him by grace, as a sanctified portion belonging to the
   covenant; and in this sense he was heir of the whole world. All
   creatures are sanctified to a believer, and the comfortable enjoyment
   of them fall to our lot and share; and therefore, 1 Tim. iv. 5, it is
   said, commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be
   received with thanksgiving, to them that believe and know the truth.'
   Mark, believers only have a covenant right to meat, drink, land, money,
   and the things that are possessed in the world, to make use of the good
   creatures God hath bestowed upon them. Others are not usurpers; I dare
   not say so. All men have a providential right; it is their portion God
   hath given them in this world;' but they have not a covenant right.
   Whatever of the world falls to their share comes to them in a regular
   way of providence, that shall be sanctified, and truly without this
   covenant right, if we had all earthly possessions, it would be a mere
   nothing, and no blessing. Once more, providence is theirs, even those
   things which are against us, afflictions, death; not only life, but
   death, 1 Cor. iii. 22, as part of their portion. Ordinances are theirs,
   all the gifts of the church, Paul, Apollos, Cephas, all for their
   benefit. And graces are theirs; the righteousness of Christ and the
   graces of the Spirit, they are all a part of their portion, made over
   to them by virtue of God's testimony. As to the righteousness of
   Christ, it is said of Noah, Heb. 11, 7, that he became an heir of the
   righteousness which is by faith.' The great legacy which Christ hath
   left is his righteousness. As Elijah when he went to heaven left Elisha
   his cloak or mantle, so when Christ went to heaven, he left the garment
   of his righteousness behind him as a legacy to the church, in
   confidence whereof we appear before God. Look, as fathers leave lands
   to their children, and such as they have, so Christ hath left us what
   he had. In the outward estate we are despicable. Silver and gold he
   hath not left us, that is no solid portion; but he hath left us his
   righteousness and obedience, as a ground of our acceptance with God. No
   monarch in the world can leave us such a portion; it cost Christ very
   dear to purchase it for us. Then the graces of the Spirit; we have
   grace enough to maintain our expenses to heaven, and carry us on till
   we come to the full enjoyment of our portion. Thus God in covenant,
   heaven, earth, whatever is great and magnificent, the ordinances of the
   church, the graces of the Spirit, all these belong to our heritage; it
   is a full portion.

   (2.) It is a sure portion, both on God's part and ours. On God's part,
   there we have his word, and that is better than all the assurance in
   the world: He hath magnified that above all his name,' Ps. cxxxviii. 2.
   If we had but God's single word, that is enough, for God is very tender
   of his word, more than of heaven and earth; and all things he hath
   made: Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass
   away.' Then we have it confirmed with an oath, Heb. vi. 6, 7. God
   thought our heritage could never stand upon terms sure enough,
   therefore he condescended to give us an oath over and above his word.
   An oath is given in a doubtful matter. But now because unbelief
   possibly might not be satisfied with God's bare word, he hath
   interposed by an oath, and pawned all his holiness and glory, laid them
   at pledge with the heirs of promise, that they might have strong
   consolation,' for that is the effect of God's oath, when the Lord
   swears, As I live, saith the Lord;' as if he should say, Take my life
   in pawn, count me not an excellent, glorious, holy God, if I do not
   accomplish this for you: I will make good this promise. There is no
   inheritance in the world so sure as this, made over to the heirs of
   promise. And then on our part, there it is made sure. God will maintain
   our right to this inheritance. We should embezzle our inheritance, lose
   it every hour, if it were wholly committed to us; but mark, Thou art
   the portion of mine inheritance, thou shalt maintain my lot, O Lord,'
   Ps. xvi. 5. A heritage is either wasted by the prodigality of the
   owner, or else wrested from us by the violence and cunning of others.
   Now, for the prodigal disposition of the owner: indeed we should spend
   our patrimony apace, soon embezzle our portion, if we had the sole
   keeping of it, for we are prodigals. But mark, under the law, Exod.
   xxv. 23, an Israelite, though he might alienate his inheritance for a
   while, till the year of jubilee came, yet God forbids him to sell it
   away for ever. So we blot our evidences often, we cannot read our
   title; there is an interruption of comfort, a kind of sequestration
   from the privileges of the covenant for a while; but Jesus Christ is
   our guardian to look after them that take the promises for their
   heritages. And then it cannot be wrested from us by the violence of
   others. All heritages in the world are liable to violences. Princes
   have been driven from their kingdoms, and men from their heritages; but
   this is a heritage God will maintain; he hath engaged his own power:
   John x. 28, No man is able to pluck them out of my hand.' It shall not
   be wrested from us by any pleas in law. The devil would soon pick a
   flaw in our title, there are so many temptations and accusations; but
   now God will maintain our right and possession of the privileges of the
   covenant. He is deeply engaged to maintain their right whose hearts
   depend upon him: they may take away life, but not the favour of God.

   (3.) It is a most lasting and durable inheritance, as being eternal: I
   have taken thy testimonies for my heritage for ever.' You know all
   estates are valuable according as they last. A lease for years is
   better than to be tenant at will, an inheritance is better than a
   lease. Our inheritance lasts for ever and ever. All other heritages
   determine with life, but then ours begins--this heritage of God's
   testimonies. A worldly portion may crumble away and waste to nothing
   before we die, but these testimonies will give us a good estate when
   all things else fail. A believer, when he is stripped of all, and
   reduced to bare promises, is a happy man; and when he is reduced to
   exigencies, then is the time to put the bonds in suit. God by promise
   hath made him self a debtor: As having nothing, yet possessing all
   things,' 2 Cor. vi. 10. They have all things in the promise, though
   nothing in sense. If we have but one gracious promise left to subsist
   upon, we cannot be poor; it is better riches than all the world, for
   then our right to God and eternal life still remaineth. If an estate
   here should last till death, yet then certainly men try the weakness of
   their portion. When other men find the worthlessness and baseness of
   their portion, you find the sweetness, fulness, and comfort of yours.
   Carnal men have but an estate for life at best: Luke xvi. 25, Son, in
   thy lifetime thou receivedst thy good things;' when they come to die
   they can look for no more; then they find the gnawing worm of
   conscience prove matter of vexation and torment; but then your heritage
   comes to the full: Ps. lxxiii. 26, My flesh and my heart faileth; but
   God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.' Not only
   when all outward comforts fail, all creatures in the world have spent
   their allowance, but when the flesh begins to fail, when we consume and
   faint away, and hasten to the grave: Lord, then thou failest not, thou
   art the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. We have an
   interest in the eternal God, and we shall live eternally to enjoy him.
   God lives for ever, and we live for ever, that we may enjoy God.

   [2.] Now I come to give the reasons why it is the property of believers
   to choose this for their portion, and why no others can do it. It is
   the property of believers to do so upon two grounds:--

   (1.) Because of the wisdom that is in faith. Faith is a spiritual
   prudence. You shall see faith is opposed not only to ignorance, but to
   folly, because it teacheth us to make a wise choice. Reason makes us
   wise to choose a good portion in this world: The children of this world
   are wiser in their generation than the children of light,' Luke xvi. 9.
   But faith is for the inward and spiritual life. Worldly men are wise in
   worldly employments, to make a wise choice, and accomplish such things
   they affect, turn and wind in the world; there they excel the children
   of God; but faith makes us wise for eternity, and therefore it chooseth
   the better portion. Faith is a spiritual light, and seeth a worth in
   other things. It is a notable saying, Prov. xxiii. 4, Labour not to be
   rich: cease from thine own wisdom.' How came these two things to be
   coupled? If we had no better wisdom than our own, we should spend our
   time, strength, and care to labour to be rich. Human wisdom doth only
   incline and enable us to the affairs of the present life, but God
   infuseth a supernatural light into the saints; they have counsel from
   the Lord: Ps. xvi. 7, I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel:
   my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.' As if he had said, Ah!
   Lord, if I am left to myself, and the workings of my own natural
   spirit, I should be as vain and foolish as others are; but thou hast
   given me counsel.

   (2.) The next reason is, because of the nobleness and height of spirit
   that is in faith. Faith will not be satisfied with any slight fancies;
   it must have better things than the world yieldeth. The great privilege
   of the covenant and work of grace is to give us a new heart; that is,
   another manner of spirit than we had before. Our natural spirit is the
   spirit of the world, a cheap, vile, low spirit, that will be satisfied
   with every base thing. Every man seeketh something for his portion, for
   no man hath sufficiency in himself, but seeketh it without. Natural men
   go no further than the world, riches, honour, pleasure; they seek it
   some in one thing, some in another. There is none more unsatisfied than
   a worldly man, for his heart cannot find rest, and yet none are sooner
   satisfied. A worldly man is not dainty, but taketh up what is next at
   hand. You think there is no such excellent-spirited men as they that
   have high designs in the world, and can achieve greatness and honour.
   But a poor Christian is of a more excellent spirit; these things will
   not give him contentment, nothing on this side God. Faith yieldeth a
   man a choice spirit, it maketh us take the testimonies of the Lord for
   our heritage. A renewed soul it hath its aspirings; it gets up to God,
   and will not be satisfied with worldly delights; but thou art my
   portion, saith my soul,' Lam. iii. 24. Others hunt after other things
   beneath God, heaven, the graces of the Spirit, the righteousness of
   Christ. Therefore thus it must needs be the property of God's children,
   because they have another understanding and another heart. And then
   none but the children of God can have these privileges. Why? Because
   though they are very magnificent and glorious, yet they are invisible,
   and for the most part future and to come; they make no fair show in the
   flesh; this is hidden manna, meat and drink the world knows not of.
   Carnal men look upon an estate that lies in the covenant to be but a
   notion and mere conceit, and they cannot believe they shall be provided
   for if God bears the purse for them; they cannot live immediately upon
   God, they must have something visible, outward, and glorious: and
   partly this inheritance is to come, therefore they cannot have this
   property: Heb. vi. 12, Be ye followers of them who through faith and
   patience inherit the promises.' The testimonies of the Lord are an
   inheritance we cannot come at presently, there needs a great deal of
   faith and patience in waiting upon God: as a hired servant must have
   money from quarter to quarter, and cannot with the child expect when
   the inheritance will befall him. A carnal heart dares not trust God,
   cannot tarry his leisure; wicked men have their reward,' Mat. vi. 2;
   they must have present wages, glory, honour, and profit here; they
   discharge God of other things, because it is a thing which costs them
   much waiting. A humble dependence upon God conflicts with many
   difficulties and hardships. Carnal men see no beauty in it, and because
   it is to come, it turns their stomachs.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXXII.

   Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the
   rejoicing of my heart.--Ver. 111.

   USE 1. It informs us what is the reason why a believer, that hath
   nothing in hand, nothing to live upon, yet is not only patient, but
   comfortable and joyful, as the men of the world when their corn, wine,
   and oil increase. Whence are these men maintained, supplied, and kept
   at such a rate of cheerfulness? Their inheritance lies in the promise.
   As Christ said, I have meat and drink the world knows not of;' so they
   have land and estate the world knows not of; they have all in God. You
   account him a richer man that hath much land, and a thousand pounds in
   bonds, than he that hath only a hundred pounds in ready money; so a
   child of God that hath one promise is richer than all the world: he
   hath bonds, and his debtor cannot fail him. Let me tell you, a man may
   not only live by faith, but he may grow rich by faith. You read of
   living by faith, Gal. ii. 20; this is that which supports and keeps up
   a believer in heart and life. This will not only keep body and soul
   together, but help us to grow rich.

   Use 2. For examination. You have heard much what it is to have an
   heritage in the testimonies of the Lord. Oh! but who is the man? Try
   yourselves. Let me propound a few plain questions.

   1. Were you ever chased out of yourselves in the sense of the
   insufficiency of your worldly portion, and the curse due to you? Are
   you driven out of yourselves? Heb. vi. 18, there is a comfortable
   place: God, willing to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability
   of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things,
   in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
   consolation.' Oh! who are these heirs of promise? If we could find out
   that, we are sure there is enough in God; there they are named who have
   fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. There is none
   ever took the testimony of the Lord for their portion, but they came
   first to take hold of it as men in danger, ready to sink and perish and
   be undone. Our first redress is to take sanctuary in the covenant, to
   flee to Christ, represented there as a city of refuge, that we may be
   safe. It is an allusion to a man which fled from the avenger of blood.
   When taken out of the city of refuge, under the law he was to die
   without remedy. So a poor soul that first takes hold of the covenant
   runs for sanctuary there first, before he comes to take possession of
   the comforts of it.

   2. What do you take to be your main and your great work? Do you make it
   your main care to keep up your interest in the promises? the great
   business you drive on, you would sit down in as your work and
   employment? What do you wait upon as your great project and design in
   the world? Mary chose the better part, Luke x. 42; do you make this
   your choice, your work and business you drive on, that you may be
   possessed of the whole land of promise, and enjoy eternal life, and
   clear up your right and title to heaven? 1 Tim. vi. 19, Laying up in
   store a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay
   hold of eternal life.'

   3. Are you very chary of your Interest? Oh! you would not hazard it
   upon such easy terms. This is that all your happiness depends upon.
   What! shall I break with God for such a trifle? Are you afraid to lose
   your inheritance by sin, as a man his treasure by theft? Are you
   careful and wary in this kind, that you may not hazard your interest? 1
   Kings xxi. 3, said Naboth, God forbid that I should sell mine
   inheritance.' Mark, there was a king would traffic with him, and that
   inheritance was but a poor vineyard of the earth, but it was that which
   was descended from his father: now God forbid I should sell it. Thus
   will be the disposition of God's children. Oh! here lies my all, my
   happiness, my daily supplies from God. God forbid that upon every
   trifle and carnal satisfaction I should break with God. It was a great
   profaneness in Esau, Heb. xii. 16, who for one morsel of meat sold his
   birthright.' It is an argument that God is little valued, or the
   covenant and testimony of the Lord, when you can part with them for a
   mess of pottage, when the consolations of God are so cheap, and you can
   part with them for a little temporal satisfaction, and sell your part
   in Christ at a very easy rate.

   4. What respect do you bear to the promises of God? Do you often
   meditate upon them? Have you recourse to them in straits? Do you keep
   them up as the choicest things upon your heart, upon which all your
   comfort depends, as a man would keep the key safe which opens to all
   his treasure? Do you carry the promises as a bundle of myrrh in your
   bosom? Because this is the key that gives you ad mission to the
   blessings promised. A man will keep his bonds chary, and will be often
   looking over them and considering them. So are you meditating upon the
   promises? Are they the rejoicing and delight of your souls? Do you keep
   them near and dear to you? When alone, do your hearts run upon them?
   For a man may know his heritage by his musing and imagination. When
   Nebuchadnezzar was alone, Is not this great Babel which I have built
   for the honour of my majesty?' He was thinking of his large
   territories. So if you have taken the testimonies of the Lord for your
   heritage, your heart will be running upon them. Oh! what a happiness is
   it tor God to be my God, and my interest cleared up in eternal life,
   and the great things of the covenant! Many times the flesh interposeth:
   Ps. cxliv. 15, Happy is that people that is in such a case.' You will
   be ad miring carnal excellency sometimes, but then you will check your
   souls: Yea, rather, happy is that people whose God is the Lord.'

   5. If the testimonies of the Lord be your heritage, then you will live
   upon them, and make them the storehouse from whence you fetch all your
   supplies, as righteousness, peace, comfort, and spiritual strength;
   nay, all your outward maintenance. This will be comfort in straits,
   strength in duty, provision for your families. There are two sorts of
   the children of God, either those that are in prosperity, or those that
   are in want, and both live on the covenant. A child of God that hath a
   plentiful affluence of outward comforts, yet he doth live upon God, 1
   Tim. iv. 5, to them that believe, for everything is sanctified by the
   word and prayer. Though God hath supplied them with mercy, yet they
   have their right; all comforts and blessings owe their rise from the
   promise. I take them immediately out of God's hand, from a God in
   covenant with me; and so I use the blessing and praise God. Otherwise,
   if you look only to present supplies, you live by sense, not by faith.
   Every one is to say, Give us this day our daily bread,' to fetch out
   his supplies from God every day, rich men as well as others, when you
   see you have a right and liberty by Christ. So God's leave and God's
   blessing go along with all; by this means rich men live upon the
   covenant. Ay! but chiefly in want; the word quickened and strengthened
   him when he was in distress and in want of all things. Do you find the
   word afford maintenance in distress and want of all things? The
   covenant is a storehouse that never foils. When all else fails, God is
   alive still, and the promises are the same; when the field yields no
   meat, when there are no calves in the stall, &c., yet then you can live
   upon your covenant interest, and comfort yourselves in the Lord your
   God, Hab. iii. 18. Though the course of nature may fail, yet the
   covenant of God doth not fail, for that is beyond the course of nature,
   or beyond the common providence of God. When you can see that all the
   accidents which fall out in the world can never take your portion from
   you, you have enough to live upon; when you see more in the promises
   than the creature can take away from you, and can see all made up in
   God. As the children of Israel in the wilderness had no house, but,
   Lord, thou art our dwelling-place,' Ps. xc. 1. Faith gets a living from
   promises when nothing comes to hand in sense and outward feeling; and
   nothing can be taken from us but what the covenant can restore again,
   and to fetch quickening and support from heaven.

   Use 3. For exhortation, to press you to take God's promises for an
   heritage; the poorest, that are born to nothing, may put in for a
   share. Take those motives:--

   1. Consider every man hath an heritage, he hath a chief good: Ps. iv.
   6, Many say, Who will show us any good?' There is something that man
   takes to be his happiness. The soul in itself is a chaos of desires;
   like a sponge that sucks and thirsts, it hath not sufficiency in
   itself; it was made for something without ourselves. Now man. being
   such a needy creature, is always looking abroad for a happiness, for a
   portion to maintain and keep him up in comfort and life, Every man must
   have a portion. Men are not men without looking after something to
   maintain them as a portion. Now there is no portion like this, like the
   testimony of the Lord; there is none so full as this, God's covenant
   notion is all-sufficiency; here is all things to be found in God. When
   God came to indent with Abraham, I am God all-sufficient.' He that hath
   the testimony of the Lord for his portion, hath God's all-sufficiency
   engaged to give him everything he stands in need of.

   2. This is a portion will go along with you wherever you go. If you go
   into exile, a foreign land, into prison, into the grave, your heritage
   will follow you there. Your estate, though it lay in jewels, cannot be
   carried safe with you; but this portion you may carry with you, they
   cannot plunder and deprive you of it. There is a notable expression:
   Prov. xiv. 14, A good man shall be satisfied from him self.' A very
   strange expression: it is the highest sacrilege and usurpation that can
   be to be sufficient to ourselves; it is an encroachment upon God. Man,
   when he first fell from God, self was the next pretender. To seek that
   in ourselves which is only found in God, now is it meant a good man
   shall be satisfied from himself?' What! shall the Lord be laid aside?
   shall he be sufficient to his own happiness? No; it is not meant in
   opposition to God, but in opposition to external things that lie
   without him. He is satisfied from himself; that is, from the comfort
   God lets into his own heart. A godly man is independent, his comfort
   doth not hang upon the creature; if you take away the creature, you do
   not take away his portion. As the philosopher could say, when all were
   he wailing the loss and spoil of the enemy, I carry all mine with me;
   so a Christian carries all his treasure about him. There is the same
   expression, Heb. x. 34, Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods,
   knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring
   substance.' A Christian hath a substance that is out of the reach of
   spoiling, since inward comfort is far better than riches, and all this
   lumber that is without.

   3. All other things will never give you satisfaction. A worldly
   heritage may give us a bellyful, but cannot give us a heartful: Ps.
   xvii. 14, Their bellies are filled with hid treasure.' They which are
   rich and great in the world have more dishes at their tables, but those
   have a more delicious feast in their souls that have chosen God for
   their portion. All other heritages do but yield more matter for sin,
   more fuel for wickedness, to be spent upon lust, pride, luxury,
   appetite; that is all the difference. The heart of man is not satisfied
   with these things; and yet if the heart could be satisfied, conscience
   could not, for that is a sore place; still our sore will run upon us.
   Thus you see there is no heritage like this, that lieth out of the
   reach of the world, and that will fill up the whole heart, and yield
   satisfaction. You know all other things cannot help us in many worldly
   cases. In sickness spiritual comfort doth only relish of sweetness. A
   man doth never relish the comfort of the covenant as when he is under
   sickness, and-deprived of other things. For all other heritages, we
   know the best of them at first, but this is a heritage that grows upon
   us; here we have the pledge and earnest of our inheritance: an earnest
   is a small thing to bind the bargain in lieu of a greater sum.

   4. This heritage sanctifies all our heritages. Oh! it is a sad thing to
   enjoy a heritage with a curse and the wrath of God. First seek the
   kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all other things shall be
   added;' then they are cast in over and above, as paper and pack thread
   into the bargain, and are cast in in a sanctified way. A man may grow
   worse for every other portion, all the world will not bring one dram of
   grace; but this improves the world, and betters us.

   5. Again, this is a good sign of adoption, when we have the spirit of
   God's children, both in God's gift and our choice. When men take the
   promises for their portion, it is a sign they have a good spirit. There
   is no mark put upon them that have an excellent disposition and
   dexterity to grow great in the world; but to be labouring and striving
   after an interest in the testimony of the Lord, it is a sign we have a
   child's spirit.

   6. Again, this is a peculiar portion, and always goes along with the
   favour of God. Other things a man may have with the hatred of God; God
   giveth gifts to all his creatures. Isaac had the inheritance, but the
   children of the concubines had gifts. So every creature may have common
   gifts, a common portion, abundance of supplies in outward things, but
   no right in the promises of God; and all this may be without the love
   of God.

   7. Again, they that refuse this heritage the Lord will cause his
   vengeance to seize upon them. It is not arbitrary whether you will take
   the testimony of the Lord for your heritage or no. God cannot endure to
   be despised. When Nabal despised David's kindness, I will cut off every
   one that pisseth against the wall.' So when the Lord hath made such an
   offer of himself and his Christ in covenant, and love hath gone to the
   uttermost to save, and we turn hack, then snares, and brimstone, and a
   horrible tempest, this shall be the portion of their cup,' Ps. xi. 6.
   It would make a man's heart tremble to think of the heirs-apparent of
   the land of darkness, that is, wicked men: God will give them their
   portion with hypocrites in everlasting burnings.' Therefore take heed
   of refusing this portion; you can look for nothing but terrible things
   from God, for his love is despised. Well, then, go in God's name, and
   take hold of the covenant.

   Again, this may be of use to press believers to live answerable to such
   an heritage. Am I an heir of heaven, and so uncomfortable and dejected?
   Can I have an interest in the promises and be no more affected? This
   returning upon our hearts, Rom. viii. 31. When the apostle had spoken
   that we should be co-heirs with Christ, and laid forth the privileges
   of the covenant, he concludes, What shall we say to these things?' So,
   Christians, go home, return upon your heart, and say, Have I an
   interest in him, and live at such a low rate both for comfort and
   grace? Do I walk in such a low and unsuitable manner? Do I look upon
   this as the only sure heritage for my soul. Urge your heart with such
   questions as these.

   Doct. 2. The taking of God's testimonies for our heritage breeds joy
   and rejoicing in the heart.

   Now this joy ariseth partly from the portion itself, partly from the
   disposition of the saints, and partly from the dispensation of God.

   1. From the portion itself. It is a portion that deserves to be
   rejoiced in, it is so full, and God cannot be possessed without great
   joy. A man cannot think of a little pelf and worldly riches that is his
   own without some comfort; and can a man think of these great things
   without comfort? Consider both what we have in hand and hope, and still
   it is matter of joy. In hand, there is reconciliation with God. Oh, to
   have God in amity with us! Rom. v. 1. If one have but a great man to
   his friend, it comforts him that he hath such a prop and stay. Oh, but
   now to have God reconciled! And then to have the care of providence, to
   have God engaged as a father--God caring for us--to be under a promise
   that he will never fail us till he hath brought us to heaven. And then
   to have heaven kept for us, those glorious things: We rejoice in the
   hope of the glory of God.' Joy is pitched upon our hopes in many
   places, something in possession, and something in reversion; this must
   needs breed a joy in our soul: Heb. iii. 6, The rejoicing of hope;' and
   Rom. xii. 12, Rejoice in hope.' A Christian hath cause to rejoice for
   what he hath in hand. God is at peace with him, he can go to him as a
   friend, as a God in covenant with him; he is bound to provide for him
   as a father; and then, at the end of all, a glorious happiness that is
   to be enjoyed.

   2. It ariseth from the disposition of the hearts of God's people;
   partly from their esteem, their faith, their assurance; they take it
   for their heritage, they esteem it as their portion, they believe it,
   and reflect upon their own interest; and all this causeth joy. It comes
   from their esteem; that which I esteem I will delight in: Mat. vi. 21.
   Where the treasure is, there will the heart be.' Affection follows
   esteem, and above all the affection of delight. A man may desire a
   thing that is nothing worth; when he comes to enjoy it, then he slights
   it. We are not acquainted with the imperfection of all worldly things
   until we come to enjoy them; but delight, that is an argument of
   esteem, the choicest affection. And then it comes from faith. Many hear
   of such great promises, but they hear like men in a dream. But now a
   believer, that hath a piercing sight, that seeth the reality and truth
   of them, his heart leaps within him. Heb. xi. 13, it is said, These all
   died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
   afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them.' When a man is
   persuaded of the truth, the reality, and goodness of the promise, oh!
   his heart leaps. They hugged the promises. Here is a promise that will
   yield glory, heaven, and happiness, and all that I stand in need of.
   Spiritual sight makes way for spiritual persuasion, and spiritual
   persuasion for holy rejoicing; that is the order: In whom believing, we
   were filled with joy.' Faith is the immediate ground; and that is the
   reason why carnal men do not feel such lively joy, they do not believe
   it. Then it comes, too, from assurance and reflection upon their own
   interest, when they can challenge it as theirs, when it is made over to
   them. The rejoicing of faith is not only good in common, but propriety
   is a ground of rejoicing, and delight is nothing but a complacency in
   our portion: 1 Sam. xxx. 6, David encouraged himself in the Lord his
   God.'

   3. It comes from the dispensation of God; for when we esteem the
   promises and delight in them, then the Lord fills the heart with
   sweetness: Rom. xv. 13, The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace
   in believing.' The Lord rewards delight with delight. Thou shalt call
   the Sabbath thy delight' in one place, then, presently Thou shalt
   delight thyself'--there is the promise. There is a delight and
   rejoicing that is our duty, and a delight and rejoicing that is God's
   dispensation. God loves to reward grace with grace. Look, as in a way
   of judgment he punisheth sin with sin, as when security is punished
   with sottish obstinacy and hardness of heart; so it is a sweet mercy
   when grace is rewarded with grace, when our delight in the promises is
   rewarded with a sweetness and taste of the promises.

   Use 1. The portion of God's children and religion is no dark gloomy
   thing. The people of God have hidden joys. As the sun shines many times
   when it rains, so, though they be under affliction, yet they have the
   shine of God's face, the comfort of God's promises. Let me show the
   excellency of the spiritual heritage above the carnal. A carnal
   heritage, alas! that is a poor thing; there is no strong consolation in
   it. The comforts of wicked men are poor, weak comforts, they cannot
   comfort us in any affliction, poor things soon overcome; but to God's
   people their heritage affords strong consolation, in overcoming worldly
   lusts, in spoiling the relish of other pleasures, overcoming worldly
   care and worldly sorrow, in bearing us out in all. afflictions; nay,
   the strength of it is seen in overcoming the terrors of the Lord,
   death, hell, judgment to come, the fears and doubts of our own
   conscience. It will not only swallow up the sense of poverty, disgrace,
   and affliction, but will bear us out in life and death; they have a joy
   that will make them to do and to suffer the will of the Lord. When once
   they have tasted the comforts of God's presence, other things will go
   down easy. I might press you to look after this rejoicing of heart. It
   makes much for the glory of God, for the honour of our portion, that we
   do not repent us of our choice, that we bear up cheerfully. And it is
   of abundant profit: the joy of the Lord is a Christian's strength; it
   bears him out in doing for God. To this purpose you should beware of
   sin; that is a clouding, darkening thing. Men or angels cannot keep
   their hearts comfortable that sin against God. Sin takes away all joy,
   peace, and the whole strength of men; and an angel cannot make the
   conscience of a sinner rejoice: therefore the children of God must take
   heed that they do not allow sin. In Acts ix. 31, They walked in the
   fear of God and comfort of the Holy Ghost.' Usually these two go
   together, and the oil of grace makes way for the oil of gladness; and
   usually obedience concurs to the establishing of our joy. Above all,
   look after communion with God, for he is the fountain of joy; and the
   more communion we have with him, the more we rejoice. The more
   communion in prayer: 1 Sam. i. 6, when Hannah prayed, she was no more
   sad.' Prayer hath a pacifying virtue in it. And then in the use of the
   seals, for these are assuring ordinances. Now the more we revive the
   grounds of assurance, the stronger the consolation; that appears Heb.
   vi. 18, Acts viii. 39. The eunuch when he was baptized went away
   rejoicing.' When a man hath an inheritance made over to him, passed in
   court, all things done, the title not to be made void, then he goes and
   rejoiceth. So when the promises have been confirmed by a solemn
   ratification, it makes joy. Then meditation and thanksgiving keep this
   joy alive; thanksgiving gives vent, and meditation that maintains it.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXXIII.

   I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes always to the
   end.--Ver. 112.

   DAVID did not only feast his soul with comforts, but also minded duty
   and service. In the former verse he had professed his comfort and joy,
   resulting from an interest in the promise; now he expresses the bent of
   his heart to God's statutes. Ephraim is represented as an heifer that
   is taught, that would tread out the corn, but not break the clods. It
   is a fault in Christians when they only delight to hear of privileges,
   but entertain coldly enforcements of duty and obedience. David was of
   another temper; first he said, I have taken thy testimonies for an
   heritage,' and then, I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes
   always to the end.'

   In which words you have all the requisites of God's service.

   1. The principle of obedience, I have inclined my heart.

   2. The matter of obedience, thy statutes.

   3. The manner of doing--(1.) Accurately to perform; (2.) The
   universality and uniformity, always; (3.) Constantly, to the end.

   First, That which the Psalmist bringeth in evidence for himself is the
   frame of his heart; he beginneth there, not with eyes or hands or feet,
   but my heart. Secondly, This heart is spoken of as inclined, poised,
   and set, to show his proneness and readiness to serve God; not
   compelled but inclined. The heart of man is set between two objects;
   corruption inclineth it one way and grace another; the law of sin on
   the one side and the law of grace on the other; when the scales are
   cast on grace's side, then the heart, is inclined to God's statutes.
   Now he saith, I have inclined.' It is the work of God's Spirit to
   incline and bend our hearts, as David expresseth himself, ver. 36. But
   it is not unusual in scripture to ascribe to us what God worketh in us,
   because of our subservient endeavours to grace as we pursue the work of
   God. Certum est nos facere quod facimus, sed Deus facit ut faciamus,
   saith Augustine. It is our duty to incline our hearts to God's law,
   which naturally hang sin ward, but it is God's work. God beginneth by
   his preventing grace, and the soul obeyeth the impression left upon it:
   Turn me and I shall be turned,' Jer. xxxi. 18. Yea, he still followeth
   us with his subsequent and co-operating grace; we do but act under him:
   I inclined my heart after thou hadst filled it with thy Spirit; when I
   felt the motions of thy grace, my consent followed; preventing grace
   made me willing, and subsequent grace that I should not will in vain.
   Now, what was his heart inclined to? To perform thy statutes;' not to
   understand them only, or to talk of them, but inclined to perform them,
   to go through with the work; that is the notion of performing: Rom.
   vii. 18, How to perform.' We render katerga'zesthai by it; to be
   complete in God's will, to do his utmost therein; this not by fits and
   starts, but always, a continual care and conscience to walk in God's
   law, not suffering ourselves for any respect to be turned out of the
   way. Many have good motions by starts, temporise a little; their
   goodness is like the morning dew; it is thus not for a time, but to the
   end. A holy inclination while the fit lasteth is no such great matter;
   this was to the last. Some stop in the middle of the journey, or faint
   before they come to the goal, but David held out to the last. Or this
   is brought as an evidence of his sincerity (the sum is a bent of heart
   carrying him out to perform whatsoever God doth command all the days of
   his life). I shall speak of what is most material, and observe this
   point--

   Doct. They that would sincerely and thoroughly obey God must have a
   heart inclined to his statutes.

   Here I shall show--

   1. What is this heart inclined.

   2. The necessity of it.

   First, What is this heart inclined. God expects the heart in all the
   service that we do him: Prov. xxiii. 26, My son, give me thy heart;'
   not the ear or the eyes or the tongue, but the heart. The most
   considerable thing in man is his heart; it is terminus actionum ad
   intra, and fons actionum ad extra--it is the bound of those actions
   that look inward. The senses report to the fancy, that to the mind, and
   the mind counsels the heart: Prov. ii. 10, If wisdom enter upon thy
   heart.' It is also the well-spring of those actions that look out ward
   to the life, Prov. iv. 23; Mat. xv. 19. You have both these in one
   place: Let thy heart keep my precepts, let thine heart receive my
   words,' Prov. iv. 4. In taking in we end with the heart; the statutes
   of God they are never well lodged till they are laid up in the heart.
   In giving out duty and service, we begin with the heart; we must go so
   deep, or else all that we do is of no worth. The heart is the spring of
   motion, that sets all the wheels a-working: Ps. xlv. 1, My heart
   inditeth a good matter, my tongue is as the pen of a ready writer,'
   ready to praise God and serve him. When the prophet would cure the
   brackishness of the water, he cast salt into the spring. Our heart is
   blind: 1 Chron. xxii. 19, Now set your heart to seek the Lord.' There
   is a setting and fixing the heart which is the fruit of grace and
   ground of obedience.

   1. It is the fruit of grace. By nature the heart is averse from God,
   desireth not to serve or enjoy him. See what the scripture saith of
   man's heart: Prov. x. 20, The heart of the wicked is nothing worth,' a
   sty and nest of unclean birds; Gen. vi. 5, Every imagination of the
   thoughts of his heart are only evil continually.' The scripture doth
   much set out the heart of man; it is foolish, vain, deceitful, Jer.
   xvii. 9, vain, earthly, unclean, proud. There is a strange bead-roll:
   Mark vii. 21-23, Out of the heart of man proceed evil thoughts,
   adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, deceit,
   lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.' It was in,
   or else it would never come out. If a man should vomit nothing but
   knives, daggers, pistols, and other instruments of destruction, of what
   a monstrous complexion would you judge that man to be! Oh, no such
   monster in the world as man's heart! If let alone to its own bent, it
   would grow worse every day, as putrid flesh grows more noisome every
   day. But now God by his grace giveth a new heart,' that hath other
   dispositions and inclinations, a heart that loveth God, and delights in
   God, tends to God. A new heart is the great blessing of the covenant,
   Ezek. xxxvi. 26; a new heart is a new placing of our desires and
   delights, for by these the heart is known.

   2. It is the ground of obedience; for the heart is the main wheel of
   the soul, that moveth other things: a bowl is made round before it
   runneth round: Deut. v. 2, Oh, that there were such an heart in them,
   that they would fear me!' There must be somewhat to bear up our
   resolutions. But more particularly, what is this bent and inclination
   of heart?

   And first negatively.

   1. It is not a simple approbation of the ways of God. Many go so far as
   to approve what is good, to condemn themselves for not doing it, to
   praise others that are holy, can be content that those that are under
   their power should take to the ways of God, as dissolute parents would
   have their children soberly brought up, video meliora proboque: Acts v.
   13, The people magnified them,' yet durst not join themselves with the
   disciples of Christ. Saul said unto David, 1 Sam. xxiv. 17, Thou art
   more righteous than I;' yet David was fain to go to his hold; as the
   woman, in Luke xi. 27, 28, cried out, Blessed is the womb that bare
   thee, and the paps that gave thee suck;' but Christ said, Rather
   blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.'

   2. It is not a bare desire or wish. Many that live ill could wish to
   live well. Balaam had his wishes, but went on in his course, Num.
   xxiii. 10. Some flashes they have; a spark is not enough to set the
   heart on fire in holy things; in carnal things it is enough. Many such
   languid motions carnal men have, yea, many cold prayers, that God would
   make them better, but the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath
   nothing, for his hands refuse to labour;' they do not set themselves in
   good earnest to get that grace they wish for. Would I were at such a
   place! but never stir a foot. Would I had written such a task! and
   never put pen to paper.

   3. It is not a hypocritical will; or, as one called it, a copulative
   will. We would, but with such or such a condition. I would, if it did
   not cost me so dear; if I were not to mortify lusts, to deny friends,
   interests, relations. They would come to the supper, Mat. xxii., but
   one had married a wife, another had a yoke of oxen to prove, another
   had found merchandise; this is no full and perfect will. No doubt but
   the chapman would have the wares, but he will not come to the price; a
   Christian should say, I will whatever it cost me, I will what ever come
   of it: Ps. xxvii. 4, One thing I have desired of the Lord, and this I
   will seek after.'

   Secondly, Positively. Then is the heart inclined:--

   1. When the judgment determineth for God, and comes to a full decree
   about obedience to him. Acts xi. 23, Paul exhorted them, That with full
   purpose of heart they would cleave to the Lord;' that is the fruit of
   conversion; not a little liking or hovering or faint resolution, but a
   full purpose, an absolute positive decree in the will, to own God and
   his ways whatever it cost us, a full consent to the duty of the
   covenant.

   2. When the will is poised and swayed with love and delight, and the
   heart is made suitable to obedience: Thy law is in my heart, and I
   delight to do thy will, O God,' Ps. xl. 8. Many times the law of God is
   written in the mind; many have good apprehensions, but the will is not
   swayed, bent this way. Amor meus est pondus meum, eo feror quocunque
   feror; when there is a natural inclination.

   3. When this bent of the will is seconded with constant endeavours to
   attain what we resolve upon, and there is a continual striving to make
   good the articles of our perfect resignation or first surrender of
   ourselves to God: Phil. iii. 12, I follow after that I may apprehend
   that for which I am apprehended of Christ.' God taketh hold of us by
   his grace, and we carry on this grace in the way of diligent pursuit or
   constant obedience. It is not one endeavour or two, but such as hath
   its constant force; hath not its pangs of devotion, but to` the'lein
   para'keitai, to will is present with me,' Rom. vii. 18. It is a daily
   habitual constant will; not a volatile devotion, that cometh upon us
   now and then, but such a will as is present as constant as evil is,
   Rom. vii. 21: kako`n para'keitai. Wherever you go, or whatever you are
   about, you carry a sinning nature about with you; it is urging the
   heart to vanity, folly, and lust. So this will is present, urging the
   heart to good, and stirring up to holy motions.

   Secondly, Let me now show you the necessity of this inclined heart,
   that we may yield to God cheerful, uniform, and constant obedience.

   1. That we may yield to God cheerful obedience in all our services. God
   looketh for a ready mind. God, that accepts the will for the deed,
   never accepts the deed without the will. The dregs of things come out
   with squeezing and wringing; duty is best done when, like live honey,
   it droppeth of its own accord; cheerful and hearty service only
   pleaseth the Lord. Now, that is cheerful service which cometh not from
   the influence of by-ends and foreign motives, or the compulsion of a
   natural conscience or legal fears, but from the native inclination and
   bent of the heart: 1 John v. 3, This is love, to keep his commandments,
   and his commandments are not grievous.' The work is not grievous, but
   pleasant, because suitable to the principles that are in us; it is not
   done against the hair: Cain offered sacrifice, but with a grudging
   mind. It is somewhere said, They offered to the Lord whose hearts made
   them willing.' When the heart is in it, it is not constrained, forced
   service, but natural and genuine; not like water out of a still, but
   like water out of a fountain.

   2. For uniform obedience, to serve God in the whole tenor of our lives,
   that needs a heart inclined, that may be as a constant spring of
   holiness. A man may force himself now and then to actions displeasing
   to himself, but his constant course is according to his natural tent
   and inclination. Haman could refrain himself from murder, but his heart
   still boiled with rancour and malice. When men look only to the
   refraining of outward actions, or the restraining the outward man, it
   will never hold; the bent of the heart will discover itself, and so
   they will be off and on with God. The compulsion of conscience will
   sometimes urge them to God, but the inclination of the heart will draw
   them to evil; therefore God wisheth that his people had a heart to
   serve him,' Deut. v. 29.

   3. Constant obedience; that can never be till the heart be inclined.
   Judas was a disciple for a while, but Satan entered into his heart,
   Luke xxii. 3. Ananias joined himself to the people of God, but Satan
   filled his heart.' Simon Magus was baptized, but his heart was not
   right with God,' Acts viii. 22. Here is the great defect. But now, when
   God gets possession of the heart, there he dwelleth, Eph. iii. 17,
   there he abideth, as in his strong citadel, and from thence commandeth
   all the faculties of the soul and the members of the body.

   Use 1. To press you to get this bent of heart, otherwise all your
   labour in religion will be in vain, every difficulty will put you out
   of the way, and make you think of a revolt from God; till this the work
   of grace is not begun. God's first gift is a new heart: Ezek. xxxvi.
   26, A new heart also will I give unto you, and a new spirit will I put
   within you.' Without this you can never hold out, but you will be
   uncertain and mutable in the profession of godliness; whatever
   restraints are upon you for a time, sin will be breaking out ever and
   anon with violence; and at length men will return with the dog to the
   vomit, and with the sow to her wallowing in the mire,' 2 Peter ii. 20.
   Oh! then, go to God for it: Jer. xvii. 10, say, Heal me, O Lord, and I
   shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved.' Carry forth the work
   of God so far as you receive it; follow after to apprehend that for
   which we are apprehended of Christ,' Phil. iii. 12.

   Use 2. Have we such a heart, a heart inclined to do the will of God?

   1. Though there be such a bent and inclination, there will be failings,
   yea, reluctances and oppositions: Rom. vii. 18, To will is present with
   me, yet how to perform that which is good I find not.' There is a ready
   will asserted, and a weak discharge complained of. Observe, it is a
   will, not a wish; a weak discharge; not that nothing is done, but not
   all that good that is required, nor in that purity; the work doth not
   perfectly answer the will, nor the motions of the spirit by which it is
   excited; and mark, this weakness is not rested in, but complained of;
   and not only complained of, but resisted: I find not,' that implieth he
   sought it; for the word finding' implieth a diligent search; he laid
   about him on every side, he did not expect it should come by chance or
   a lazy inquiry.

   2. If wrought:--

   [1.] How was it wrought in you? Did God turn thee, and thou wast
   turned? Were you ever brought to self-resignation? By what steps was
   this work carried on? Thy heart was naturally wedded to thy lusts and
   to carnal vanity; did ever God make you see the odiousness of sin, the
   vanity of the creature, the insufficiency of self? Evil men seek
   contentment in the world as long as conscience will let them hold out
   in that way. You cannot cleave to God till you are rent off from the
   world and self. Was there ever such a separation? such a rending work?
   Conversion, or the altering the bent of the heart, lieth in three
   things--in turning from the creature to God, from self to Christ, from
   sin to holiness. How to God? By making us a willing people, to yield up
   ourselves to his service. How drawn from self to Christ? To seek all
   this good in him. How from sin to holiness? By seeing the beauty of
   God's ways. Paul found it a sensible work before he was brought to this
   self-resignation: Acts ix. 6, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?' How
   did God draw you or drive you to this?

   [2.] How is this bent of heart kept up towards God? Nature is apt to
   recoil, and the heart to return to its own bent and bias again. David
   beggeth, ver. 36, Incline my heart to thy testimonies.' It is a hard
   matter to keep up a bent of heart towards God; it will cost us much
   watching, striving, praying, to keep it fixed. The frame of man's heart
   is changeable and various, doth not always continue at the same pass;
   and lust will waken, and be pressing and importunate; deadness will
   creep upon us. The great business of the spiritual life is to keep the
   bent of the heart steady: neglected grace will suffer decay, and
   worldly vanities and listlessness and deadness to holy things will
   incroach upon the soul, and a gracious heart is much discomposed. As a
   needle that bendeth towards the pole may be jogged and put aside,
   though it cannot rest there, but turneth thither again, so the bent of
   the soul towards God may be much disordered, and we may lose much of
   our free spirit and ready mind, and grow uncomfortable and uncheerful
   in God's service, and it may cost us much sorrow and deep humiliation
   to get in frame again. A cold profession is easily maintained, but to
   keep up a spiritual inclination is the work of labour and cost.

   [3.] How doth it work in you? This bent of heart is seen in two
   things:--

   (1.) In pulling back the heart from those sins to which corrupt nature
   doth incline us. Nature carrieth us to carnal things. There is
   something within that puts you on, and something without to draw you
   forward. Nature thrusteth, occasion inviteth, but grace interposeth and
   checketh the motion: Gal. v. 17, The spirit lusteth against the flesh;;
   it is against the bent and inclination of the new nature; there is a
   back bias. Joseph had a temptation; we read of occasion inviting, but
   not of nature inclining; but presently his heart recoiled. The heart of
   man is seldom without these counterbuffs. It is an ad vantage to have
   the new nature as ready to check as the old nature to urge and solicit:
   1 John iii. 9, He cannot sin, for his seed remaineth in him.'

   (2.) In putting on the heart upon duties that are against the hair and
   bent of corruption. Such acts of obedience as are most troublesome and
   burdensome to the flesh, as are laborious, costly, dangerous.
   Laborious, as private worship, wrestling with God in prayer, holding
   the heart to meditation and self-examination; sluggish nature is apt to
   shrink, but love constraineth,' 2 Cor. v. 14. Spiritual worship, and
   such as is altogether without secular encouragement, that is tedious;
   to work truth into the heart, to commune with God, to ransack
   conscience, it is troublesome, but thy striving will overcome it. So
   there is costly and chargeable work, as alms, contributions to public
   good; there must be a striving to bring the heart to it. Then for
   actions dangerous, as public contests for God's glory, or keeping a
   good conscience, though with cost to ourselves. Our great work is to
   keep the will afoot, nature is slow to what is good. A coachman in his
   journey is always quickening his horses, and stirring them up; so must
   we quicken a sluggish will, do what we can, though we cannot do all
   that we should; the will must hold up still. A prisoner escaped would
   go as far as he can, but his bolts will not suffer to make long
   journeys, but yet he thinketh he can never get far enough; so this will
   is a disposition that puts us upon striving to do our utmost for God.

   Secondly, The matter resolved on, to perform thy statutes always unto
   the end.' Uniform obedience, always, or all his days. As long as life
   lasteth we must be always ready to observe all God's commands, which
   notes the continuity of our obedience, sincerity, and perpetuity of it.
   We are to engage our hearts by a serious resolution to serve him, and
   that not by fits and starts, but always; not for a time, but to the
   end. Resolve to cleave to him, to hold him fast that he may not go, to
   keep our hold fast that we may not go. Take notice of the first decays,
   and let us keep our hold fast, and bewail often the inconstancy of our
   hearts, that we are so inconstant in that which is good. Every hour our
   hearts are changed in a duty. What a Proteus would man be, if his
   thoughts were visible, in the best duty that ever he performed! Rom.
   vii. 18, Evil is present with me, but how to perform that which is good
   I find not.' Our devotion comes by pangs and fits, now humble, anon
   proud; now meek, anon passionate; not the same men in a duty and act of
   a duty, unstable as water. Compare it with God's constancy, his
   unchangeable nature, his love to us, that we may be ashamed of our
   levity. From everlasting to everlasting, God is where he was, the same;
   the same to those that believe in him. Secondly, This to the end.'
   God's grace holdeth out to the end; so should our obedience: He that
   hath begun a good work will perfect it,' &c. Consider how unreasonable
   it is to desire God to be ours unto the end, if we are not his: Ps.
   xlviii. 14, He is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide till
   death.' He doth not lay down the conduct of his providence. So Ps.
   lxxiii. 24, Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterwards
   receive me to glory.' We can give nothing to God, our obedience is but
   a profession of homage. If God be always in our eye, we shall be always
   in his. We receive life, breath, and motion from him every moment; he
   sustaineth us, every day and hour yieldeth new mercy. God watcheth over
   us when we are asleep, yet how much of our time passeth away when we do
   not perform one act of love to God! The devil is awake when we sleep,
   to do us a mischief, but the God of Israel never slumbereth nor
   sleepeth. How can we offend him? Let us then take up this serious
   resolution, to perform God's statutes always to the end.

SERMON CXXIV.

   I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.--Ver. 113.

   THERE are in men two great influencing affections--love and hatred; one
   serves for choice and pursuit, the other for flight and aversation. The
   great work of grace is to fix these upon their proper objects. If we
   could but set our love and hatred right, we should do well enough in
   the spiritual life. Man fallen is but the anagram of man in innocency;
   we have the same affections, but they are misplaced; we love where we
   should hate, and hate where we should love; our affections are like a
   member out of joint, out of its proper place, as if the arms should
   hang backward. If men knew how to bestow their love and hatred, they
   would be other manner of persons than now they are. In the text we are
   taught what to do in both by David's example. See how he bestowed his
   love and hatred: I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.' Love was
   made for God, and for all that is of God's side, his law, his
   ordinances, his image, &c.; but hatred was made for sin. All sin must
   be hated, of what kind and degree soever it be. Every drop of water is
   water, and every spark of fire is fire; so the least degree of sin is
   sin. Thoughts are but a partial act, a tendency towards an action, and
   yet thoughts are sin. Of all the operations of the soul, the world
   thinketh a man should be least troubled about his thoughts; of all
   actual breaches of the law these are most secret; therefore we think
   thoughts are free, and subject to no tribunal. Most of the religion
   that is in the world is but man's observance, and therefore we let
   thoughts go without dislike or remorse, because they do not betray us
   to shame or punishment. These are most venial in man's account, they
   are but partial or half acts. What! not a thought pass but we must make
   conscience of it? this is intolerable. Once more, of all thoughts, vain
   thoughts would escape censure. A thought that hath apparent wickedness
   in it, a murderous or an unclean thought, a natural conscience will
   rise up in arms against it; but vain thoughts we think are not to be
   stood upon. Oh! but David was sensible that these were contrary to the
   law of God, transgressions as well as other thoughts, and therefore
   inconsistent with his love, to God: I hate vain thoughts.' Secondly, He
   bestows his love on the law. Naturally men hate God as a lawgiver and
   as a judge; they cannot hate him as a creator and preserver; under that
   formality they do not hate God, but the ground of our hatred to God is
   his law: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is
   not subject to the law of God, neither in deed can be.' But now, saith
   David, I love thy law;' I do not fear it, but love it. I do not only
   keep it, but love it. A child of God will bless God for his commands as
   well as his promises; he owns God in the holiness of his law, and looks
   upon it as a copy and draught of God's own perfection; it is a good
   law; there is a suitableness between it and a renewed heart, and
   therefore I love thy law. The one of these is inferred out of the
   other, his love to the law is mentioned as a ground of his hatred
   against vain thoughts. Love is the great wheel of the soul, that sets
   all a-going. Therefore sin is hated because the law is loved. He that
   hath a true respect to the law of God is sensible of the least
   contrariety to it, for hatred is uniform. The philosopher tells us it
   is to the whole kind; as Hainan, when he hated Mordecai, sought to
   destroy all the people of the Jews; and when a man hates sin, he hates
   all sin, even where he finds it, in thoughts, words, speeches: love
   will not allow it.

   Well, then, I love thy law, therefore do I hate vain thoughts; that is,
   though I cannot wholly keep them out of my heart, yet I hate them,
   resist them, watch against them, they are not allowed there. Without
   further glossing, the point is this:--

   Doct. It is a sign of an unfeigned love to the law of God when we hate
   vain thoughts.

   I observe it, because a man never begins to be really serious and
   strict till he makes conscience of his thoughts, his time, and is
   sensible of his last account. Of his thoughts, for that is a sign he
   minds an entire subjection to the law of God, that he may obey it from
   his very soul. Of his time, that it may not pass away before his great
   work will be done. Of his account, that is not far off; the Christian
   that lives in a due sense of his great account is always preparing to
   reckon with God. The one of these doth enforce the other. A man that is
   sensible he shall be called to a reckoning will be careful how he
   spends his time, and he that is careful how he spends his time will
   make conscience of his thoughts.

   1. To give a taste of the vanity of thoughts.

   2. Show what sins most occasion vanity of thoughts.

   3. The reasons why a godly man will make conscience of his thoughts.
   First, Some taste of the vanity of thoughts. There are three

   solemn words by which the New Testament expresseth thoughts:--(1.)
   Logismoi`, discourses with its compound dialogismoi`, which we render
   imaginations. (2.) Thume'seis, and sometimes enthume'seis, musings.
   (3.) Noe'mata, which we render devices. These three ways the dunghill
   of corruption reeks out by our thoughts; sometimes in our vain arguings
   and reasonings, by way of image and representations in our musings,
   sometimes by way of foolish inventions and devices that are in the
   heart of man.

   1. Lo'gismoi, carnal discourses of the mind, come under the notion of
   vain thoughts. If our more refined reason came to scan them, how light
   and vain would they be found! Our reasonings are usually against the
   sovereignty of God: Rom. ix. 20, Who art thou, O man, that repliest
   against God?' We cannot see how it is just that by one man's
   transgression all should be made sinners, that God should choose some
   and endow them with grace, and leave others in their corruption; how he
   should have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and harden whom he will
   harden. Man would be free from God, but would not have God free; and
   therefore, contrary to these reasonings and vain discourses, the
   scriptures plead the sovereignty of God, Mat. xx. 15, to show he may do
   with his own as pleaseth him. And as against the right and sovereignty
   of God, so there are strange discourses against the providence of God,
   many anxious traverses and debates in our minds; and therefore the
   scripture takes notice how distrust works by our thoughts: Mat. vi. 25,
   Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
   drink,' &c.; and ver. 27, Which of you by taking thought can add one
   cubit to his stature?' We are tortured with many suspensive workings
   and discourses of mind within ourselves, whereas a little trust in God
   would save many of these vain arguings: Prov. xvi. 3, Commit thy works
   unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established.' He showeth that
   want of trust in God, and his word and providence, and committing all
   to his dispose, is the cause of a great deal of confusion and darkness
   in our thoughts, and breedeth such perverse reasonings against the
   providence of God. So against the truth of the gospel. The law is
   natural, and runneth in by its own light, with evident conviction upon
   the heart; but the gospel is suspected, looked upon with prejudice,
   received as a golden dream, and as a well-devised fable. We have
   reasonings in ourselves against that which is discovered concerning the
   salvation of sinners by Christ; therefore the apostle saith, 2 Cor. x.
   5, Bringing into captivity every thought,' imaginations, or lo'gismoi,
   reasonings, those thoughts that exalt themselves against the knowledge
   of God in Christ. Then disputes against Christian faith, the mysteries
   of the Trinity, the incarnation of Christ; we are saying, as the Virgin
   Mary when the angel brought her tidings of it, How can these things
   be?' So we have perverse reasonings against positive institutions: 2
   Kings v. 12, Are not Abana and Pharpar better than all the rivers of
   Israel?' We are apt to say, Why is this? The means of grace seems
   foolish and weak: 1 Cor. i. 19, It pleaseth God by the foolishness of
   preaching to save them that believe.' So our arguings in perverting the
   truth of the gospel and holy principles of the word to the countenance
   of our lusts, as Deut. xxix. 19; when we reason thus within ourselves:
   We shall have peace though we walk in the imagination of our own
   hearts;' we need not be so nice and strict; God will be merciful, he
   will pardon all: Jude 4, Turning the grace of God into lasciviousness;'
   wresting the truth from its purpose to countenance a laziness. It is
   good to observe the different arguings in scripture from the same
   principle. To instance in this principle, our time is short, what doth
   a holy man argue from it? 1 Cor. vii. 29, Let those that have wives be
   as those that have none, those that weep as though they wept not,' &c.
   Therefore we should be strict, temperate, sober in the use of all these
   things. Now, let a carnal wretch work upon this principle, and what
   inference doth he draw? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall
   die,' 1 Cor. xv. 32. See this other principle, The grace of God brings
   salvation to poor sinners, Titus ii. 12. How doth a gracious heart work
   upon it? Teaching us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,' &c. Oh!
   what shall be done for this God, the grace that offers such salvation
   by Christ? Let a carnal wretch work upon this principle, and he will
   take liberty to sin that grace may abound: Rom. vi. 1, Shall we
   continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid.' Such kind of
   reasonings there are in the hearts of the godly: 2 Sam. vii. 2, saith
   David, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within
   curtains.' God hath fenced me with his providence, what then? Here I
   may sit down and rest, and take my ease and pleasure, and gratify my
   sensual lusts? No; he doth not argue so, but what shall I do for God,
   that hath done so much for me? Now see those ungracious Jews after
   their return, how they reason: Hag. i. 2, The time is not come, the
   time that the Lord's house should be built;' no matter for God's house.
   It is the Lord's hand, let Eli work upon that: 1 Sam. iii. 18, Let him
   do what seemeth him good;' he draws from it a submissive patience. Oh!
   the sovereign God will take his own way, and the creature must not
   murmur, repine, and set up an anti-providence against him. But now
   saith that carnal wretch, 2 Kings vi. 33, Behold, this evil is of the
   Lord; what should I wait for the Lord any longer?' He murmurs, and
   frets, and grows impatient. Solomon tells us, Prov. xxvi. 9, As a thorn
   goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of
   fools.' A thorn was their instrument of sewing; now when a drunkard
   should manage his needle, he wounds and gores himself; so is a parable
   in a fool's mouth: a carnal heart wounds and gores himself with the
   most holy principle of religion.

   2. The second sort of vain thoughts are enthume'seis, musings; and here
   take notice the vanity of our thoughts appears--

   [1.] In the slipperiness and inconstancy of them. We run from object to
   object in a moment, and our thoughts look like strangers one upon
   another, wandering like those vagabond Jews,' Acts xix. 13; so they are
   called because of their uncertain station and frequent removes. Eccles.
   vi. 9. Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
   desire;' in the original, it is the working out of the soul; Usually we
   have a straggling soul, roving, wandering here and there, and all in an
   instant; especially this roving madness may we take notice of when we
   are employed in holy things, hearing, prayer, meditation. It is strange
   to see what impertinent, sudden discursions there are from good to
   lawful, from lawful to sinful, and how far the heart is removed from
   God when we are before him; when a man hath brought his body to God,
   his heart is turned back again. These vain thoughts pursue and haunt us
   in duties, so that we mingle sulphur with our incense (it is Gregory's
   comparison), even in our prayers and holy addresses to God.

   [2.] The unprofitableness and folly of our musings. Our thoughts are
   set upon trifles and frivolous things, neither tending to our own
   profit nor the benefit of others: Prov. x. 20, The heart of the wicked
   is little worth;' all their debates, conceits, musings are of no value.
   The tongue of the just is as choice silver;' but all their thoughts are
   taken up about childish vanity and foolish conceits: Prov. xxiv. 9, The
   thought of foolishness is sin;' not only the thought of wickedness, but
   foolishness. Thoughts are the first-born of the soul, the immediate
   issues of the mind, yet we lavish them away upon every trifle. Follow
   men all the day long, and take an account of their thoughts. Oh! what
   madness and folly are in all the musings they are conscious to! Ps.
   xciv. 11, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity.'
   If we did judge as God judges, all the thoughts, reasonings, discourses
   of the mind, if they were set down in a table, we might write at the
   bottom, Here is the sum and total account of all, nothing but vanity.

   [3.] The carnality and fleshliness- of our thoughts: Phil. iii. 19,
   They mind earthly things.' How sweet is it to us to be thinking of
   worldly matters, how to grow great, to advance ourselves here! This
   carnal mind is very natural to us. We are in our element, and do with a
   great deal of savour and sweetness think of these things; it makes our
   heart merry: but when we come to think of that which is good, we are
   tired presently, and it is very tedious to spend our thoughts upon
   them. Good things come upon us like a flash of lightning, soon gone,
   but on carnal things we can spend our thoughts freely. These carnal
   musings are stirred up by carnal desire or carnal delight; sometimes by
   a desire of worldly things, so they are forming images and suppositions
   of those things they hope for; as faith works in a godly man, forming
   images and suppositions of that happy time when they shall be gathered
   to God, and all holy ones, and rejoice in his presence. He hath a
   faith, the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
   seen,' Heb. xi. 1, which represents his hopes to him. So carnal men
   dream of preferment, riches, honours, vain glorious applause; they are
   looking out after their hopes, they send their thoughts as messengers
   of the soul to forestall the contentment of those carnal things which
   they do expect. Sometimes they are employed by carnal delight, when the
   thing we muse upon' is enjoyed. The complacency men take in any carnal
   enjoyment, it is part of this vanity when we go musing upon our own
   worth and our own excellency; as that king, Dan. iv. 30, Is not this
   great Babel that I have built for the honour of my majesty?' Men take
   some time every day to worship the idol of self, and dote and gaze upon
   their own excellencies and achievements, their wisdom and wit: Hab. i.
   15, They gather them in their drag, therefore they rejoice and are
   glad.' Or else pleasing themselves in their estates, dialogising within
   themselves, as the word is, Luke xii. 13, Soul, take thine ease; thou
   hast goods laid up for many years,' &c.

   [4.] By the impiety and apparent filthiness of them. When men are taken
   up with sin so as to act it over in their own minds, delighting
   themselves in fancying of sin, either by way of revenge or lust, or any
   other such thing, as an unclean person sets up a stage in his own
   heart: 2 Peter ii. 14, Eyes full of adultery,' or the adulteress; their
   fancy is upon the beauty of women, their soul is set upon it.

   3. The third thing is noe'mata, devices. There are many devices and
   carnal inventions in the hearts of men which the scripture takes notice
   of; as--

   [1.] When men devise, debate in their judgments by carnal means,
   without complying with God: James iv. 8, Cleanse your hands, ye
   sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.' By vain thoughts
   they mind carnal projects, how to get from under the judgment without
   reformation, humiliation, and complying with God, by human means or
   sinful shifts, without God's warrant and allowance: Isa. ix. 10, when
   it was ill with them they hope to mend it: The bricks are fallen down,
   but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we
   will change them into cedars.' The state of our affairs is bad, but we
   can work it into better.

   [2.] When men spend their time wholly to compass their carnal end; as
   he, Luke xii. 18, I will pull down my barns, and build greater,' &c.
   When they sacrifice their precious thoughts to their interest and
   lusts, and catering and progging how to satisfy carnal nature, making
   provision for the flesh to fulfil it in the lusts thereof. Or--

   [3.] When men's designs are plainly wicked, and tend to the mischief of
   others: Prov. xvi. 30, He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things;
   moving his lips, he bringeth evil to pass.' Moving the lips and
   shutting the eyes are gestures and postures of men that are pensive and
   musing: Micah ii. 1, Woe unto them that devise evil upon their beds;'
   when men seek to spin and weave out a web of wickedness, and carry on
   their sins with the greatest secrecy. This, in short, is some taste of
   the vanity of our thoughts.

   Secondly, What are the sins that do most usually engross and take up
   our thoughts? I answer--

   1. Uncleanness. Speculative wickedness makes way for active: He hath
   committed adultery in his heart,' Mat. v. 28. There is polluting
   ourselves by our thoughts, and this is a sin usually works that way.

   2. Revenge. Liquors are soured when long kept; so when we dwell upon
   discontents they turn to revenge: Prov. xiv. 17, He that is soon angry
   dealeth foolishly, and a man of wicked devices is hated.' He that is
   passionate and soon angry is a fool; but when a man is not only angry
   but malicious, that puts him upon wicked devices; when he doth concoct
   his anger, he is a fool to purpose. Purposes of revenge are most sweet
   and pleasant to carnal nature: Prov. xvi. 14, Frowardness is in his
   heart; he deviseth mischief continually.' When men are full of
   revengeful and spiteful thoughts.

   3. Envy. It is a sin that feeds upon the mind, 1 Sam. xviii. 9. Those
   songs of the women that Saul had slain his thousands, but David his ten
   thousands, they ran in Saul's mind, therefore he hated David. Envy is
   an evil disease, that dwelleth in the heart, and bewrays itself mostly
   in thoughts.

   4. Pride. Either pride in the desires or pride in the mind, either
   vainglory or self-conceit; this is entertaining our hearts with
   whispers of vanity: therefore it is said, Luke i. 51. He hath scattered
   the proud in the imagination of their hearts.' Proud men are full of
   imaginations.

   5. Covetousness, which is nothing but vain musings and exercises of
   their heart: 2 Peter ii. 14, A heart they have, exercised with covetous
   practices.' And it withdraws the heart in the very time of God's
   worship: Ezek. xxxiii. 31, Their heart goeth after their covetousness.'

   6. Distrust is another thing which usually takes up our thoughts,
   distracting motions against God's providence.

   Thirdly, Upon what grounds we are to make conscience of our thoughts?

   1. Because they are irregularities contrary to the law of God. It is
   said, Ps. xix. 7, The law of God is pure, converting the soul.' The law
   of God differs herein from the laws of men. The commands of the
   greatest and most mighty potentates upon earth can go no further than
   the regulating of the conversation, for that is all they can take
   account of; but the law of God reacheth to the motions of the inward
   man, and to the reducing of our thoughts to the obedience of God; for
   God hath a tribunal in the heart and conscience, he searcheth and
   trieth the reins, knows all our thoughts afar off, and therefore it is
   proper to him to give laws to our thoughts.

   2. God hath declared much of his displeasure against them. The devil's
   sin, for which he was cast out of heaven, was a sin of thought, an.
   aspiring thought, possibly against the imperial dignity of God. And so
   great were his judgments upon men, that he doth not so much take notice
   of outward acts as of inward thoughts; therefore, Gen. vi. 5, he
   threatened the old world for the imagination of the thoughts of their
   hearts. We look to the stream, but God looks to the fountain. Acts are
   hateful to men, because liable to their cognisance; so Jer. vi. 19, I
   will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts,
   because they have not hearkened to my words, nor to my law, but
   rejected it.' Nay, in God's process at the last day, when God comes to
   judge the world, it is said, The secrets of their hearts shall be made
   manifest,' 1 Cor. iv. 5. Men's inward debates, counsels, reasonings,
   and thoughts, they shall be brought into the judgment.

   3. Make conscience of thoughts, because among all sins thoughts are
   most considerable, and that in these respects:--

   [1.] In respect of the subject. They are the sins of the highest part
   of man, the mind, which is the leading part of the soul. The errors and
   irregularities of the lower part of the soul are not so considerable as
   the counsels, debates, reasonings, principles that we are seasoned and
   guided by: Rom. viii. 7, The wisdom of the flesh is enmity against
   God.' That which should be the guide to man, his wisdom, puts him upon
   opposition. If sensual appetite were only in the fault, it were not so
   much.

   [2.] From their nature. They are the immediate issues of the soul, the
   first-born of original corruption. The free acts of the heart do
   discover more of the temper of it than words and actions that are more
   remote. A man may be known by his thoughts, but not so much known by
   his words and actions, for words and actions may be overruled by
   by-ends and restraints of fear and shame. Men may speak not as they
   would, do not as they would, but think as they would. To curry favour
   with others, a man may refrain his tongue, and do some unpleasing
   actions, or may profess opinions contrary to his own mind; but inward
   thoughts, being the immediate births of the soul, very much discover
   the temper of the man. Hereby you may take the best measure of your
   spirits. A gracious man is full of gracious thoughts, and a wicked man
   full of wicked thoughts: Prov. xii. 5, The thoughts of the righteous
   are right, but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.' Our thoughts we
   can best judge by, being the purest offspring of the mind, and the
   freest from restraint: Isa. xxxii. 8, The liberal man deviseth liberal
   things.' The unclean man is devising unclean things, the earthly man is
   always talking with himself about building, planting, trading; these
   things take up his mind. You cannot judge of a fountain by the current
   of water at a distance, six or seven miles off; it may receive a
   tincture from the channel through which it passeth; but just at the
   fountain where it bubbles up, there you can judge of the quality,
   whether sweet or bitter water: so you cannot judge of the soul by
   things that are more remote, and where by-ends may interpose: Mat. xv.
   19, Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
   fornications,' &c. Evil thoughts come first; other things come from the
   heart, but not so immediately; therefore, thoughts being so
   considerable, we should make conscience of them.

   [3.] They are considerable from their kind, here are the roots of all
   evils. Everything that we do, every deliberate act that is done by a
   reasonable creature argueth some foregoing thought, every temptation is
   fastened upon the heart by some intervening thought. Before sin be
   formed, brought forth, and becomes a complete sin, there are musings,
   which are, as it were, the incubations of the soul, or sitting a-brood
   upon the temptation: Isa. lix. 4, They conceive mischief, and bring
   forth iniquity.' The mind sits a-brood upon sin. It is thoughts that
   bring the heart and object together. First men think, then they love,
   then they practise. Beating the steel upon the flint makes the sparks
   fly out; so when the understanding beats and knocks upon the will by
   pregnant thoughts, by inculcation, that stirs up the affections. These
   are the bellows which blow up those latent sparks of sin that are in
   our souls; therefore, if you would make conscience of acts, you should
   make conscience of thoughts. It is the greatest imprudence that can be
   to think to do anything in reformation when we do not take care of our
   thoughts. See, when God adviseth us to return to him, Isa. lv. 7, he
   saith, Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts.' In vain do we lop off the branches and let the root live. If
   we would forsake our way, we must first forsake our thoughts. When
   certain fowl pestered a man, he asked how he should be rid of them? The
   answer was, The nest must be destroyed, and they must be crushed in the
   egg. So here is the best way of crushing the egg, by dashing Babylon's
   brats against the wall. So much is implied in that place, Jer. iv. 14,
   Wash thine heart from. wickedness, that thou mayest be saved: how long
   shall vain thoughts lodge within thee?' Wash thy heart, begin there.
   Medicines applied to the outward parts will do no good, unless the
   inwards be cleansed and purged; so until the soul be cleansed and
   purged from these evil thoughts, outward reformation will be to no
   purpose.

   [4.] They are considerable in regard of their number, they are most
   numberless acts of the soul, Isa. lvii. 20. The sea is. always working,
   so the heart of man is always casting forth mire and dirt: Gen. vi. 5,
   Every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is only evil
   continually.' There is a mint in us that is always working towards that
   which is evil. This is a means to humble us. The Lord knows the best of
   our thoughts are but vain; this is that which raiseth the account in
   God's book of remembrance, which makes us more admire the riches of his
   grace even to the very last. Let him forsake his thoughts,' Isa. lv. 7.
   What then? I will multiply to pardon.' Certainly, if thoughts be sins,
   God must not only pardon, but multiply to pardon.

   Use 1. To humble us all, the best of us, from first to last. Vanity of
   heart sticks to us. Oh, how many carnal thoughts haunt us wherever we
   go! As thou walkest in the streets up and down, whereupon do thy
   thoughts run? The common vain thoughts should be laid to heart. Have we
   not a God, a Christ to think of, sweet and precious promises, heaven
   and glory, and the great concernments of our souls? and yet with what
   chaff do we fill our minds! We go thinking of every toy and trifle,
   grinding chaff instead of corn every day. Oh! how do we throw away our
   thoughts, rather than God should have them, upon every vain thing! It
   is very irksome a little to retire and recollect ourselves, and think
   of God, Christ, and heaven; but what a deal of vanity do we take into
   our minds! If our hearts were turned inside outward, and all our
   thoughts liable to the notice of men, as they are to the notice of God,
   what odious creatures should we be! and have we no reverence of the
   great God? The Lord knows our hearts; he knows we have thoughts enough
   and to spare, more than we know what to do withal, and he knows we are
   backward to exercise them upon him, and things that lead to communion
   with him. These thoughts are aggravated from the time, as upon God's
   day, for then we are not to think our own thoughts,' Isa. lviii. 13; a
   Christian is then to sequester himself only for God. Nay, our vain
   heart bewrayeth itself in solemn duties; a man cannot go to prayer but
   the vanity of his thoughts will trouble him, and run about him when he
   is hearing the word; how do we course up and down like spaniels hither
   and thither! Yea, to humble ourselves because of our wicked thoughts,
   our desperate thoughts against the being of God: Ps. xiv. 1, The fool
   hath said in his heart there is no God.' Though we cannot open our eyes
   but the creature presently doth show us something of God, and call upon
   us whether we look upward or downward, yet how do we vent this thought?
   If there were no God, then we could live as we list, without check and
   restraint. Thoughts which arise within us against the truth of the
   gospel, as if it were but a well-devised fable; thoughts against the
   purity of God's laws, that we need not be so strict, that it is but
   nice folly, that we shall do well enough without repenting, believing,
   minding the work of our salvation. Yea, we have thoughts against the
   light of nature, filthy, unclean thoughts, such as defile and stain the
   heart. Of earthly thoughts, how natural is that, in musing upon that
   esteem, honour, greatness that we shall have in the world! How do
   carnal thoughts haunt us, and this not only when we are in our natural
   condition, but even after grace! And Christians are mistaken that do
   not think those thoughts evil, though there be no consent of the will.
   I confess there are thoughts cast into the mind by Satan, but these not
   resisted, these cherished, fostered, they become ours; though they are
   children of Satan's getting, and may be cast in, as the tempting of
   Christ was, by injection of thought; but then we entertain these
   things; as weeds thrown over the wall are not to be charged upon the
   gardener, but the envious man; but if the gardener lets them lie there
   and root there, then it is his fault.

   Use 2. Do we love the law of God? Do we aim at a complete and entire
   subjection to the will of God? Do we desire to serve him in spirit?
   Here is the evidence. Do we hate vain thoughts? We cannot be free from
   them, but are they your burden? A child of God is pestered with them,
   though he hates them.

   1. Do we give them entertainment? Jer. iv. 23, How long shall vain
   thoughts lodge within thee?' They may rush into a gracious heart, but
   they do not rest there. Wicked men may have good thoughts, but do not
   give them entertainment; take a snatch and away, but do not make a meal
   upon any spiritual truth; there is an occasional salute sometimes in
   wicked men of good things, but their heart doth not dwell upon them.

   2. Do you make conscience of them? Do they put you upon remorse,
   caution, watchfulness, frequent recourse to God for pardon and grace?
   Acts viii. 22, Pray, if perhaps the thoughts of thine heart may be
   forgiven thee.' Are you humbled for them, as well as for other sins,
   because these grieve the Spirit of God, are conceived there where he
   hath his residence, chiefly in the heart? Doth this trouble you, that
   the Spirit should be grieved?

   Use 3. It presseth us to take care of our thoughts. Thoughts fall under
   the judicature of God's word, Heb. iv. 12. Thoughts are hateful to God:
   The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord,' Prov. xv.
   26. And as they are hated of him, so he knows them all, it is his
   prerogative to tell man his thoughts; he under stands our thoughts afar
   off, Ps. cxxxix. 2. What thoughts we have when we are walking, praying,
   employed in our calling, what comes in, what goes out; there is not a
   thought but God regards, and God will reckon with us about our
   thoughts.

   1. Look more earnestly after a principle of regeneration, Rom. viii. 5.
   They that are after the flesh, employ their wisdom about the flesh,
   they are contriving for the flesh, savouring the things of the flesh;
   and they that are after the Spirit savour the things of God, savour
   spiritual things. We must be renewed by the Spirit, The ground brings
   forth weeds, but not flowers of itself; so our hearts naturally bring
   forth vain thoughts, but they must be cultivated and dressed. We must
   be renewed in the spirit of our mind. There is nothing discovers the
   necessity of regeneration so much as this, that we must take care of
   our thoughts. Moral restraints may prevent the excesses of life, or
   regulate the outward man. If sin did lie only in words and deeds, human
   laws and edicts would be enough, and we needed no other discipline to
   bring us to heaven. There are excel lent laws for bridling man's speech
   and practice, for these things man can take notice of; but he that is
   only good according to the laws of man, his goodness is too narrow, is
   not broad enough for God. It is the peculiar privilege of that
   judicature God hath set up to bring the thoughts under. Look that there
   may be within you a spring of holy thoughts.

   2. Get a stock of sound knowledge. The mind of man is always working,
   and if it be not fed and supplied with good matter, it works upon that
   which is evil and vain. If there be not a plenty of good matter wherein
   to exercise yourselves, the soul will necessarily spend itself in
   vanity of thoughts. Now abundance of knowledge supplies and yields
   matter. It is a good thing when our reins instruct us in the night
   season, Ps. vi. 7, in the darkness and silence of the night; when we
   are taken off from all company, books, worldly employment, and
   distractions of sense, and the soul is left to itself, to its own
   operations, then to draw out knowledge, and have our reins instruct us.
   But men are barren of holy thoughts, and so are forced to give way to
   vanity: Deut. vi. 6, 7, Bind them upon thy heart.' What then? When thou
   awakest it shall talk with thee;' that is, as soon as you awake, before
   you have received images from abroad, a man is to parley with his soul
   about the course of his service that day. Words and thoughts are both
   fed by abundance in the heart. Thoughts are but verba mentis, words of
   the mind, and words are but thoughts expressed and languaged. Now if a
   man would have these things present when he is lying down and sitting
   up, then these words must be in his heart. A man must have a good
   treasure within, that he may bring forth out of his treasure things
   both new and old, Mat. xiii. 52. When the mind is the storehouse of
   truth, he will ever be drawing forth upon all occasions. He that hath
   more silver and gold in his pocket than brass farthings, brings forth
   gold and silver oftener than brass; so he that is stored with divine
   truths, and full of the knowledge of the Lord, his mind will more run
   upon these things, and will often out of the treasure of his heart
   bring forth things that are good.

   3. Inure yourselves more to holy meditation. There must be some time to
   wind up the plummets, and lift up our hearts to God, Ps. xxv. 1. For
   want of this, no wonder if men's thoughts are loose and scattered, when
   they are left at random, when they are never solemnly exercised in
   consideration of divine truth; ver. 99 of this psalm.

   4. Begin with God: Ps. cxxxix. 8, When I awake,' saith David, I am
   still with thee.' As soon as we awake, our hearts should be in heaven;
   we should leave our hearts with God over-night, that we might find them
   with God in the morning. We owe God the first-fruits of our reason
   before we think of other things, for every day is but the lesser circle
   of our lives. We should begin with God before earthly things encroach
   upon us. Season your hearts with the thoughts of his holy presence;
   that is the means to make the fear of God abide upon us all the day
   after; and it is some recompense for those hours spent in sleep,
   wherein we showed not the least act of thankfulness to God, to exercise
   our reason again; and when we are awake we should be thinking of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXXV.

   Thou art my hiding-place and my shield: I hope in thy word.--Ver. 114.

   IN these words you have--(1.) A privilege which believers enjoy in God,
   and that is protection in time of danger. (2.) David's right to that
   privilege, I hope in thy word.' From both the note will be this:

   Doct. They that hope in God's word for the protection which he hath
   promised, will find God to be a shield and a hiding-place to them.

   1. I shall speak of the nature of divine protection, as it is here set
   forth under the notions of a shield and hiding-place.

   2. Of the respect which the word hath to these benefits.

   3. Of the necessity and use of faith and hope in the word.

   First, For the nature of this protection; it is set forth in two
   notions, a hiding-place and a shield. Upon which I observe:--

   1. David was a military man, and therefore often makes use of metaphors
   proper to his function; when he wandered in the wilderness and the
   forest of Ziph, and they yielded to him many a lurking-hole, and so he
   knew the benefit of a hiding-place; and being a man of war, he was more
   acquainted with the use of a shield in battle. That which I observe is
   this, that it is good to spiritualise the things that we often converse
   with, and from earthly occasions to raise heavenly thoughts. You will
   ever find our Lord Jesus so doing. When he sat at meat in the
   Pharisee's house, he discourseth of eating bread in his Father's
   kingdom, Luke xvi. 14. When he was at the well of Samaria, he falls a
   discoursing of the well of life, of the water that springeth up to
   eternal life, John iv. Again, when he was at the feast of tabernacles,
   you will find there it was the fashion of the people at that feast to
   fetch water from the pool of Siloam, and to pour it out until it ran in
   a great stream; and then at the feast of tabernacles Christ cried out,
   He that cometh to me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
   water,' John vii. He spiritualiseth that occasion. Thus should we learn
   to turn brass into gold, and by a holy chemistry to extract useful
   thoughts from these ordinary objects that we are cast upon. Thus doth
   David; he had been acquainted with the use of a hiding-place and with a
   shield, and accordingly expresseth his confidence by these notions. The
   Septuagint renders it simply and without the metaphor, My help and my
   undertaker; but we, from the Hebrew, My hiding-place, my shield.

   2. Observe, again, both the notions imply defence and protection. A
   shield is not a weapon offensive but defensive. Indeed elsewhere, Deut.
   xxxiii. 29, God said to Israel, I am the shield of thy strength, and
   sword of thy excellency.' God is a sword as well as a shield, a weapon
   offensive as well as defensive, in behalf of his people. But here both
   metaphors imply only defence and protection. It is not here a
   hiding-place and a sword, but a hiding-place and a shield. Why? The
   godly are subject to many dangers and perils, from adverse powers,
   spiritual and bodily, and therefore need much preservation and defence.

   [1.] The soul is in danger of Satan and his temptations. There are
   spiritual enemies, that will put us upon the need of a shield and a
   hiding-place: Eph. vi. 12, We wrestle not against flesh and blood,'
   &c.; that is, not principally. We do not wrestle against bodily or
   human powers; outward agents are not principals but instruments. Our
   chief war is with devils and evil spirits, who have a mighty power over
   a great part of the world; they are the rulers of the darkness of this
   world, the ignorant and carnal part of the world; and they assault us
   with much cunning and strength; and invisible enemies are the worst,
   none like to them for craft, for strength, for malice, for number. They
   easily get the advantage over us by their crafty insinuations, and
   applying themselves to our humours, and feeding every distemper with a
   bait suitable; and they are always about us, unseen and unperceived;
   they lie in ambush for our souls, and assault us in company and alone,
   in business and in recreations, in the duties of religion, and in our
   ordinary affairs; they follow us in our retirements, and pursue us with
   unwearied diligence. No such enemies as these for craft and subtlety of
   address. And then for their power and strength, they have their fiery
   darts to throw upon us, ver. 16. They inject and cast in blasphemous
   thoughts, and enkindle and awaken in us burning lusts, or fire us with
   rage and despair; their power is exceeding great, because they have the
   management of fiery darts. And their malice is great; it is not to hurt
   our bodies chiefly, that is but the shell of the man, but the chiefest
   part, our immortal soul; and therefore we need a hiding-place and a
   shield when we have to do with spiritual wickednesses, that are always
   assaulting us in this manner upon all occasions. And for their number,
   there are many of them, and all engaged in this spiritual warfare
   against the saints: we cannot dream of ease if we would be Christ's
   soldiers. In the Gospel we find one man possessed with a whole legion
   of them: Mark v. 9, My name is legion, for we are many.' They cease not
   in this manner thus continually to assault and vex us, and therefore we
   need a hiding-place and shield.

   [2.] The bodies of God's people and their temporal lives are exposed to
   a great deal of hazard and danger from evil men, who are ready to
   molest and trouble us, sometimes upon one pretence, and sometimes upon
   another. They that indeed would go to heaven, and have a serious sense
   of the world to come upon their hearts, they are a different party from
   the world, and therefore the world hates them, John xvii. 14; and Rom.
   xii. 2, Be not conformed to this world.' It was never yet so well with
   the world but they were forced to stand upon their defence; and
   usually, as to any visible interest, they are the weakest when their
   enemies are mighty and strong; and therefore they had need of a
   hiding-place to run to, and a shield to defend them, to run to the
   covert and defence of God's providence.

   3. Observe the difference between these two notions, hiding-place and
   shield. Sometimes God is said to be our strength and our shield, Ps.
   xxviii. 7. He furnisheth us within and without; he strengthens and
   fortifies the heart, then shields us and keeps off dangers. And
   sometimes again he is said to be a sun and a shield, Ps. lxxxiv. 11. We
   have positive and privative blessings, or a sun to give us light, and a
   shield to give us strength. He promiseth to be both; but usually he so
   attempereth his providence, that where he is more a sun there he is
   less a shield; that is to say, the more sparingly he vouchsafeth the
   knowledge of heavenly comforts, the more powerfully doth he assist his
   people in their weakness by his providence. As the Jews that were
   conversant about the shadows of the law, and lived under the darkness
   of that pedagogy, God was less a sun to them than he is to us; but yet
   they knew more of his powerful providence, of his temporal protection.
   Now here it is a hiding-place and a shield; what is the difference
   between these? God is a hiding-place to keep us out of danger, and a
   shield to keep us in danger. Either we shall be kept from trouble, that
   dangers shall not overtake us; or, if they do over take us, they shall
   riot hurt us; they shall only serve for this use, to make us sensible
   of God's defence, and to increase our thanksgiving for our protection:
   for God hides us, and as a shield interposeth him self between us and
   the strokes of our adversaries, those fiery darts which are flung at
   us. Well, then, they imply, either God will keep us from seeing the
   evil, or fortify us that the evil shall not hurt us. One of these
   notions was not enough to express the fulness of God's protection: a
   hiding-place, that is a fixed thing; but a shield and buckler, we may
   constantly carry it about with us wherever we go, and make use of God's
   power and love against all conflicts whenever we are assaulted. Again,
   on the other side, a shield were not enough to express it, for that
   only respects actual assaults; but God saves us from many dangers which
   we are not aware of, prevents troubles which we never thought of, Ps.
   xxi. 3.

   4. Let us view these notions apart, and see what they contain for our
   comfort.

   First, Let us look upon God as a hiding-place. Men in great straits,
   when they are not able to make defence against pursuing enemies, they
   run to their hiding-place, as we shall see the Israelites did from the
   Philistines: 1 Sam. xiii. 6, When the men of Israel saw that they were
   distressed, they hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in
   high places, and in pits;' and so God's children, when they are too
   weak for their enemies, seek a safe and sure hiding-place: Prov. xxii.
   3, A wise man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself.' Certainly there
   is a hiding-place for the saints, if we had but skill to find it out;
   and where is it but in God? Ps. xxxii. 7, Lord, thou art my
   hiding-place, thou shalt preserve me from trouble.' I do not delight to
   squeeze a metaphor, and to make it yield what it intends not; yet these
   four things are offered plainly in this notion of a hiding-place--there
   is secrecy, and capacity to receive, and safety, and comfort.

   1. Secrecy. It is not a fortress wherein a man does profess himself to
   be, and to stand out assaults, but it is a hiding-place: Ps. xxvii. 5,
   In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret
   of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me upon a rock.' God's
   protection of his people is a secret hidden mystery, as every thing is
   to a carnal man. The person hidden is seen abroad every day following
   his business, serving his generation, doing that work which God hath
   given him to do; yet he is hidden while he is seen, by the secret power
   and love of God dispensing of all things for his comfort and
   protection; the man is kept safe by ways which the world knows not of.
   So Ps. xxxi. 20, Thou shalt hide him in the secret of thy presence from
   the pride of man.' There is a secret power of God by which they are
   upheld and maintained by one means or other, which they see not and
   cannot find out.

   2. The next thing considerable in a hiding-place is capacity to receive
   us; and so there is in God; we may trust him with our souls, with our
   bodies, with our peace, with our goods, with our good name, with our
   all. Our souls, all that concerns us between this and the day of
   judgment, as St Paul did, 2 Tim. i. 12, I know whom I have believed;
   and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
   unto him against that day.' He calls his soul and all the concernments
   of it a thing that was left, and that he durst trust, in the hands of
   God. Our soul is much sought after. Satan, that hath lost the favour of
   God himself, envies that others would enjoy it, therefore maligns the
   saints, pursues them with great malice and power; but put it into the
   hands of God, he is able to keep it. And so for outward things, this
   hiding-place is wide enough for all that we have, for goods, body, and
   good name: Ps. xxxi. 20, Thou shalt keep them secretly as in a pavilion
   from the strife of tongues.' As the hearts of men are in the hands of
   God, so are their tongues. There is the same reason why we should trust
   in God for all things, when we trust in him for one thing. And indeed,
   did we truly and upon scripture grounds trust him for one thing, we
   would trust him for all things. If we did trust him with our souls, we
   would without anxious care trust him with our bodies and secular
   interests and concernments also.

   3. Here is safety till the trouble be over, and we may be kept as quiet
   in God as if there were no danger: Ps. lvii. 1, Under the shadow of thy
   wings will I make my refuge until these calamities are overpast.' There
   is an allusion to a chicken under the dam's wing, when hawks, kites,
   and birds of prey are abroad; that are ready to seize upon them with
   their sharp beaks and talons; they run to the dam's wings, and there
   they are safe. So Isa. xxvi. 20, Come, my people, enter thou into thy
   chambers, and shut the doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a
   little moment, until the indignation be overpast.' There we have an
   allusion to a storm that is soon over, it is a little cloud that will
   easily be blown over; but in the meantime here is a covert and a
   defence. The use of God's protection and love is best known in a time
   of straits and difficulties.

   4. There is not only safety but comfort; as under the dam's wings the
   chickens are not only protected but cherished. Christians, it is not a
   dead refuge or hiding-place, but like the wings of the hen, which yield
   warmth and comfort to the young brood: Ps. xxxiv. 22, None of them that
   trust in him shall be desolate.' There is sweet support, and spiritual
   experience, and inward comforts; so that a believer that is hidden in
   the secret of God's presence fares better than all those that have the
   world at will, and flow in ease and plenty, if he would judge of his
   condition by spiritual considerations. Thus we have seen the first
   notion, God is a hiding-place.

   Secondly, God is a shield. He is often called his people's shield in
   scripture. Now the excellency and properties of a shield lie in these
   things:--

   1. In the largeness and breadth of it, in that it hides and covers the
   person that weareth it from all darts that are flung at him, so as they
   cannot reach him: Ps. v. 12, Thou wilt bless the righteous with favour,
   thou wilt compass him as with a shield.' There is the excellency of a
   shield, to compass a person round about that the darts flung at him may
   not reach him. There is a comfortable promise; it runs in other notions
   indeed, yet I will mention it upon this occasion, because the
   expressions are so notable and emphatical: Zech. ii. 5, For I, saith
   the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about.' Mark every
   word, for every word hath its weight. It was spoken when the returning
   Jews were discouraged at their small number; they had not enough to
   people their country and build their towns, nor to defend themselves
   against their numerous and potent adversaries. Now what shall they do?
   God makes them this promise of a future increase, I will be a wall,'
   &c. And there are three promises included in this one, viz., that he
   will be a wall, a wall round about them, and a wall of fire round about
   them, which is a further degree. A wall! there is a promise of that,
   Isa. xxvi. 1, We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for
   walls and bulwarks.' And a wall that doth encompass them on every side
   round about, there is a promise of that, Ps. cxxv. 2, As the mountains
   are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people, from
   henceforth even for ever;' he will be instead of all guards and
   defences. So likewise a wall of fire; not of brass or of stone, but of
   fire, that affrights at a distance, and consumes near at hand. Here is
   enough for a refuge, and to stay our hearts in the Lord's keeping. An
   allusion to those countries; when they travelled in the wilderness they
   were wont to make a fire about them, to preserve them from wild beasts.
   Thus doth God express his all-encompassing protection, he that is our
   shield.

   2. The excellence of a shield lies in that it is hard and impenetrable.
   So this answers to the invincible power of God's providence, by which
   he can break the assaults of all enemies; and such a shield is God to
   his people: Ps. cxiiv. 2, My strength and my shield, in whom I trust.'

   3. Shall I add one thing more? Stones and darts flung upon a hard
   shield are beaten back upon him that flings them; so God beats back the
   evil upon his enemies, and the enemies of his people: Ps. lix. 11,
   Bring them down, O Lord, our shield.' Shall I speak in a word? The
   favour of God is a shield: Ps. v. 12, With favour wilt thou compass him
   as with a shield.' The truth of God is a shield: Ps. xci. 4, His truth
   shall be thy shield and buckler.' And the strength and power of God,
   that is our shield: Ps. xxviii. 7,. He is my strength and my shield.'

   Well, now, you see how this defence and this protection is set forth,
   Thou art my hiding-place and my shield.' God accommodates him self to
   lisp to us in our own dialect, and to speak in such notions as we can
   best understand, for the help of our faith. Having opened the nature of
   this defence, the next thing I am to do is to show--

   Secondly, The respect to the word, I hope in thy word.'

   1. The word discovers God to be such a protection and such a defence to
   his people everywhere: Ps. lxxxiv. 11, God will be a sun and a shield,
   grace and glory will he give.' As a sun, so he will give all things
   that belong to our blessedness; as a shield, so he will keep off all
   dangers from us. The scripture shows not only what God can do herein,
   but what he will do for our sakes. So Gen. xv. 1, saith God to Abraham,
   I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.' Abraham might be under
   some fear that the kings which he had lately vanquished would work him
   some trouble, and then God comes and appears to him and comforts him,
   and tells him, I am thy shield.'

   2. As the scripture doth discover God under these notions, so it
   invites us and encourageth us to put God to this use: Isa. xxvi. 20,
   Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, shut the door about thee, and
   hide thyself as it were for a little moment.' There are chambers where
   we may rest; where are they but in the arms of God's protection, in the
   chambers of his attributes, promises, and providence? The word invites
   us so to make use of God, to enter into him as into a chamber of
   repose, while the storm is furious, and seems to blow hard upon us. So
   Ps. xci. 1, He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall
   abide under the shadow of the Almighty.' He that committeth himself to
   God for refuge shall not be thrust out, but suffered to dwell there,
   and enjoy the benefit of a covert and defence.

   3. The scripture assureth us of the divine protection, that certainly
   it shall be so: Prov. xxx. 5, Every word of God is pure; he is a shield
   unto them that put their trust in him.' Do not think that these are
   careless expressions, that dropped into the scripture by chance. No;
   they are the sure and pure words of the Lord, that will yield a great
   deal of comfort, peace, and happiness. So Ps. xviii. 30, As for God,
   his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to
   all those that trust in him.' God hath passed his word, which he hath
   ever been tender of in all ages of the world; he invites us to depend
   upon it. Thus it assures us of the divine protection.

   4. It directeth us as to the qualifications of the persons who shall
   enjoy this privilege. Who are they?

   [1.] You might observe, all those that believe, and none but those that
   believe; he is a buckler and a shield to all those that trust in him,
   Prov. xxx. 5; Ps. xviii. 30. Trust and have it. If you will glorify God
   by faith, and depend upon him according to his word, you will find it
   to be so. We miss of our protection and defence by our doubts,
   unbelief, and distrust of God. All those that in time of danger are
   duly sensible of it, and make use of God as their refuge and
   hiding-place, shall find him to be that to them which their faith
   expects from him.

   [2.] The qualification which the word directs us unto is this: those
   that sincerely obey his covenant: Ps. lxxxiv. 11, God is a sun and a
   shield to those that walk uprightly;' and the same is repeated Prov.
   ii. 7, God is a buckler to them that walk uprightly;' and Isa. xxxiii.
   15, 16, where God saith they that seek him shall dwell on high; his
   place of defence shall be the munitions of the rocks; they shall be
   preserved safe that fear him, and walk with him according. to the tenor
   of his covenant. If you will not be faithful servants to God, how can
   you expect he should be a good master to you? Sincerely give up your
   heart to walk with God exactly and closely, and he will not be wanting
   to you. Others may be preserved by general providence, or rather
   reserved to future judgment; they may be kept until the pit be digged
   for the wicked, Ps. xciv. 13, as a malefactor is suffered to live till
   the place of execution be prepared. But to have this protection in
   mercy, it supposeth we are in covenant with God, and walk sincerely
   with him.

   5. It directeth us how to expect this blessing, in what manner; only in
   the way and manner that it is promised, Zeph. iii. 3. Seek
   righteousness, seek meekness, it may be you shall be hid; not
   absolutely, but as referring it to God's will. There is the keeping of
   the outward man, and the keeping of the inward man. As to the out ward
   man, all things come alike to all; the Christian is safe, whatever
   becomes of the man; the Lord will keep him to his heavenly kingdom, 2
   Tim. iv. 17, 18. That which the Christian desires mainly to be kept is
   his soul, that he may not miscarry, and blemish his profession, and
   dishonour God, and do anything that is unseemly. I say, we cannot
   absolutely expect temporal safety. The righteous are liable to many
   troubles, therefore in temporal things God will not always keep off the
   temporal stroke, but leave us to many uncertainties, or at least hold
   us in doubt about it, that we may trust his goodness. When we trust God
   we must trust all his attributes, not only his power, that he is able
   to preserve, but his goodness, that he will do that which is best, that
   there may be a submission and referring of all things to his will; as
   David, 2 Sam. xv. 26, If he say, I have no delight in thee; be hold
   here am I, let him do unto me as seemeth good unto him.' God will
   certainly make good his promise, but this trust lies not in an absolute
   certainty of success. However, this should riot discourage us from
   making God our refuge, because better promises are sure enough, and
   God's keeping us in suspense about other things is no evidence he will
   not afford them to us; it is his usual course, and few instances can be
   given to the contrary, to have a special regard to his trusting
   servants, and to hide them secretly. They that know his name will find
   it, that he never hath forsaken them that put their trust in him, Ps.
   ix. 10. It is the only sure way to be safe; whereas to perplex our
   souls with distrust, even about these outward things, that is the way
   to bring ruin and mischief upon ourselves, or turn aside to crooked
   paths. Well, then, you see what respect the word hath to this
   privilege, that God is a shield and a hiding-place. The word discovers
   God under these notions, the word invites and encourageth us to put God
   to this use, the word assures us of the divine protection, it directeth
   us to the qualification of the persons that shall enjoy this privilege,
   they that can trust God, and walk uprightly with him; and it directeth
   us to expect the blessing, not with absolute confidence, but leaving it
   to God.

   Thirdly, The third thing I am to do is to show this word must be
   applied by faith, I hope in thy word.' Hope is not strictly taken here,
   but for faith, or a certain expectation of the blessing promised. What
   doth faith do here? Why, the use of faith is--

   1. To quiet the heart in waiting God's leisure: Ps. xxxiii. 20, Our
   soul waiteth for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.' If God be
   our help and shield, then faith is quietly to wait the Lord's leisure;
   till he sends deliverance, the word must bear up our hearts, and we
   must be contented to tarry his time: Isa. xxviii. 16, He that believeth
   shall not make haste,' will not outrun God.

   2. In fortifying the heart against present difficulties, that when all
   visible helps and interests are cut off, yet we may encourage ourselves
   in the Lord. When they were wandering in the wilderness, and had
   neither house nor home, then Moses, the man of God, pens that psalm,
   and how doth he begin it? Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in
   all generations,' Ps. xc. 1. What was wanting in sense they saw was
   made up in the all-sufficiency of God. And so here is the use of faith,
   when in defiance of all difficulties we can see an all -sufficiency in
   God to counterbalance that which is wanting in sense. So doth David,
   Ps. iii. 3, Lord,' saith he, thou art my shield and glory, and the
   lifter up of my head.' Look to that psalm; it was penned when David was
   driven from his palace royal by Absalom: when he was in danger, God was
   his shield; when his kingdom and honour were laid in the dust, God was
   his glory; when he was under sorrow and shame, and enemies insulting
   over him, when the people rose against him, and he was in great
   dejection of spirit, God was the lifter up of his head. This is getting
   under the covert of this shield, or compass of this hiding-place.

   3. The use of faith is to quicken us to go on cheerfully in our duty,
   and with a quiet heart, resting upon God's love, power, and truth. So
   David, Ps. cxxxi. 5, Into thy hands I commit my spirit, for thou hast
   redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.' David was then in great danger; the
   net was laid for him, as he saith in the former verse; and when he was
   likely to perish, what doth he do? He casts all his cares upon God, and
   trusts him with his life, Into thy hands I commit my spirit,' that is,
   his life, safety, &c.

   Use 1. Admire the goodness of God, who will be all things to his
   people. If we want a house, he will be our dwelling-place; if we want a
   covert, he will be our shield, our hiding-place; whatever we want, God
   will supply it. There is a notable expression: Ps. xci. 9, Because thou
   hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy
   habitation.' Mark that double notion; a habitation is the place of our
   abode in time of peace, a refuge the place of our retreat in a time of
   war. Be it peace or war, God will be all in all; he will be a fountain
   of blessing to us in a time of peace, he will be our habitation there
   where we have our sweetest comforts; and then in time when dangers and
   difficulties are abroad, God will be a refuge and a place of retreat to
   our souls.

   Use 2. To persuade us to contentation in a time of trouble. Though we
   have not a palace, yet if we have but a hiding-place; though our
   condition be not so commodious as we do desire, yet if God will vouch
   safe a little liberty in our service we must be content, if he will
   give us a little safety though not plenty, for here is not our full
   reward. And therefore it is well we can make this use of God, to be our
   shield and hiding-place, though we have not that ample condition which
   a carnal heart would fancy. God never undertook in his covenant to
   maintain us at such a rate, nor thus to enlarge our portion; if he will
   vouchsafe a little security and safety to us during the time of our
   pilgrimage, we must be content.

   Use 3. This should more encourage us against the evil of sin, since God
   assures us of protection and defence against the evil of trouble. If
   God did leave us to shift for ourselves, and never expressed himself in
   his word for our comfort, then we were more excusable, though not
   altogether, if we did shift and turn aside to crooked paths, because we
   are under an obligation to obey, whatsoever it cost us. But when he
   hath offered himself to be our shield and our hiding-place, to stand by
   us, be with us, carry us through fire and water, all dangers and
   difficulties, shall we warp now and turn aside from God? Gen. xvii. 1,
   saith the Lord, I am God all-sufficient; walk before me, and be thou
   perfect.' There is enough in God; why should we trouble our selves, or
   why should we run to any practices which God will not own?

   Use 4. It presseth us to depend upon God's protection. Shall I urge
   arguments to you?

   1. This is one. Every one must have a hiding-place. Saith Solomon, The
   conies are a feeble folk, yet they have their burrows and holes. All
   creatures must depend upon somewhat, especially the children of God,
   that are exposed to a thousand difficulties. You must expect to have
   your faith and patience tried if ever you come to inherit the promises,
   and during that time it is good to have a hiding-place and a shield.

   2. Your hearts will not be kept in safety unless you make God your
   strong defence. When Phocas fortified cities to secure his ill-gotten
   goods, a voice was heard, Sin within will soon batter down all those
   walls and fortifications. Unless God be our hiding-place and shield,
   the strongest defences in the world are not enough to keep us from
   danger. All the shifts we run into will but entangle us the more, and
   drive us the more from God, and to greater inconvenience: 2 Chron.
   xxviii. 20, as the king of Assyria to Ahaz; he distressed him, but
   helped him not. So many run away from God's protection, and seek out
   means of safety for themselves, and will not trust him, but seek to
   secure themselves by some shifts of their own. They do but plunge
   themselves into troubles so much the more, and draw greater
   inconveniences upon themselves. There is a great deal of sin and danger
   in departing from God, and he can soon blast our confidences. All those
   places of safety we fancy to ourselves can soon be demolished and
   battered down. God will blast our carnal shifts.

   3. It is a thing that we owe to God by virtue of the fundamental
   article of the covenant. If you have chosen God for your God, then you
   have chosen him for your refuge. Every one in his straits runs to the
   God he hath chosen. Nature taught the heathens in their distress to run
   to their gods. You may see the pagan mariners, a sort of men usually
   not much haunted with religious thoughts, yet when the storm arose, the
   sea wrought and was tempestuous, danger grew upon them, and they were
   afraid: They called every man upon his god,' Jonah i. 5; they were
   sensible that some divine power must give them protection. It
   immediately results from the owning of a God, that we must trust him
   with our safety; and so, if we have taken the true God for our God, we
   have taken him for our refuge and hiding-place: Ruth ii. 12, A full
   reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou
   art come to trust.' When Ruth came to profess the true God, by taking
   the God of Israel for her God, it is expressed thus; she did commit
   herself to his providence and protection: and therefore covetousness,
   because of its trust in riches, is called idolatry; it is a breach of
   the fundamental article of the covenant, taking God for our God.

   4. This trust ever succeeds well. It will be of great use to you to
   still and calm your thoughts, and free you from many anxious cares, and
   in due time it will bring deliverance according to his promise. How may
   we thus trust in God? Why! commit and submit your persons and all your
   conditions and affairs to his providence. This is to trust in God, to
   make him your hiding-place and your shield. These notions are often
   used in scripture, 2 Tim. i. 12; Prov. xvi. 3; Ps. xxxvii. 5. If there
   be a thing to be brought about for you, commit it and submit it to God;
   he is able, wise, loving, and faithful; he will do what shall be for
   the best. Commit your comforts, your health, liberty, peace, your all
   into God's hands, for he is the author of all; let the Lord do what he
   will. This is to trust in God, when you can thus without trouble or
   anxious care refer yourselves to the wise disposal of his providence.

   [1.] No hurt can come to you without God's leave. No creature can move
   or stir, saving not only by his permission, but by his influence.
   Others may have a will to hurt, but not power unless given them from
   above, as Christ told Pilate. The devil is a raging adversary against
   the people of God, but he is forced to ask leave to touch either Job's
   goods or his person; he could not touch his skin, or any thing that
   belonged to him without a commission from God, Job i.; nay, he must ask
   leave to enter into the herd of swine, Mat. viii. 31. And Tertullian
   hath a notable gloss upon that. If God hath numbered the bristles of
   swine, certainly he hath numbered much more the hairs of the saints; if
   he cannot enter into a herd of swine, he cannot worry a friend of
   Christ's, without God's leave.

   [2.] Consider how much God hath expressed his singular affection, and
   his care and providence over his people. There are many emphatical
   expressions in scripture; that is one, Mat. x. 29, 30, The very hairs
   of your head are numbered.' Mark, he doth not speak of the heart, or
   hands, or feet, those that we call parts which are necessary to the
   conservation of life; but he speaks of the excrementitious parts, which
   are rather for convenience and ornament than necessity. What is more
   slight than the shedding a hair of the head? Thus he expresses the
   particular care of his people. Again, Zech. ii. 8, He that toucheth you
   toucheth the apple of his eye.' No part is more tender than the eye;
   and the apple of the eye, how hath nature guarded it, that it may
   receive no prejudice! So Isa. xlix. 15, Can a mother forget her
   sucking-child?' &c. See how his tender affection and yearning bowels
   are expressed; passions in females are most vehement, therefore God
   alludes to mothers' affections. And mark, it is not a child that can
   shift for itself, but a sucking-child, that is wholly helpless, that
   was but newly given her to draw her love. Nature hath left tender
   affections on the hearts of parents to their tender infants; yet if a
   woman should be so unnatural, Yet will I not forget thee,' saith the
   Lord. Now, shall we not trust him, and make him our hiding-place? Isa.
   xxvii. 3, I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment; lest any
   hurt it, I will keep it night and day.' God will keep his people by
   day, lest by force they break in upon his heritage; and keep them by
   night, lest they steal in privily, and by secret machinations hurt
   them.

   [3.] Again, consider how many arguments there are to work us to this
   trust. Sometimes the scripture teacheth us to argue from the less to
   the greater: Mat. vi. 30, If God so clothe the grass of the field,
   which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
   more clothe you, O ye of little faith?' Sometimes the scripture
   teacheth us to argue on the contrary; from the greater to the less,
   Rom. viii. 32. If God hath given us his Christ, will he not with him
   freely give us all things? Sometimes the scripture teacheth us to argue
   from things past. God hath been your shield and helper, he hath
   delivered from the mouth of the lion and bear, and this uncircumcised
   Philistine shall be as one of them, 1 Sam. xvii. 37. Some times from
   things past and present to things to come: 2 Cor. i. 10, Who hath
   delivered from so great a death, and doth deliver; in whom we trust
   that he will yet deliver.' Sometimes from things to come to things
   present: Luke xii. 32, Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's
   good pleasure to give you the kingdom.' Anne dabit regnum, et non dabit
   viaticum? If he give a kingdom, will he not give daily bread? Will he
   not preserve you while he hath a mind to use you? Thus our unbelief is
   overpowered by divers arguments to press us to this trust. Well, then,
   run to your security. How so?

   First, In defiance of all difficulty, own God as your hiding-place and
   shield. David when he was driven from his palace royal, and wandered up
   and down for his life, and when his enemies began to say, Now there is
   no help for him in God, Ps. iii. 3; all Israel were against him. Many
   there be which say thus: his son drives him from his palace; now there
   is no safety, nor defence; but saith he, Lord, thou art my shield and
   my glory, and the lifter up of my head.' This is the way to get under
   the covert of his wing, when in the face of all difficulties we will
   own God as our hiding-place.

   Secondly, Sue out your protection by earnest prayer. God hath given us
   promises as so many bonds upon himself, and we must put these bonds in
   suit. Our necessity leads us to the promises, and the promises lead us
   to the throne of grace: Ps. cxli. 9, I fly to thee; hide me, O Lord;
   keep me from the snare which they have laid for me.' Plead with him,
   and say, Lord, thou hast said thou wilt be my refuge and hiding-place;
   whither should a child go but to its father? and whither should I go
   but to thee, for thou art my God? Challenge him upon his word. See how
   David expresseth himself: Ps. xvii. 7, 8, Show thy marvellous
   loving-kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put
   their trust in thee. Keep me as the apple of thine eye: hide me tinder
   the shadow of thy wings.' Go challenge God upon his word: Lord, thou
   hast said thou wilt save those that trust in thee, those that depend
   upon thee. The eye is offended with the least dust, and nature hath
   provided a fence and covert for it. Thus may we go to God, and
   challenge such kind of protection: Keep me as the apple of thine eye,
   hide me under thy wings. As the dam is ready to flutter and spread her
   wings over the young brood when they fly to her, so will God.

   Thirdly, Take notice whenever it is made good; give God his honour when
   he hath been a hiding-place and protection to you, that you may observe
   his providence: Ps. xviii. 30, As for God, his way is perfect: the word
   of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.'
   Well, I have waited upon God according to these promises, and lo! it is
   come to pass as the Lord hath said. So Ps. xxviii. 7, The Lord is my
   strength and my shield; my heart trusteth in him, and I am helped;'
   Gen. xlviii. 16, The angel of the covenant, which hath fed me all my
   days, and redeemed me from all evil.' He speaks of the faithfulness of
   God and of the mediator in all those promises of protection.

   Fourthly, Constantly make use of God. You may think this discourse may
   be of no use to you, because you are out of fears and dangers: why, you
   are constantly to make use of God, be it well or ill, and to live upon
   God. All our comforts are from God, as well as our support in trouble.
   Certainly he that lives upon God in prosperity, will live upon him in
   adversity. Oh! when you are well at ease, and abound in all things, you
   take these things out of the hand of God; you will learn better to make
   him your refuge. But he that lives upon the creature in his prosperity,
   when the creature fails he will be in utter distress, and know not what
   to do.

SERMON CXXVI.

   Depart from me, ye evil-doers: for I will keep the commandments of my
   God.--Ver. 115.

   MOST of the passages of this psalm are directed to God himself; but now
   he speaks to carnal men, shaking them off, as Christ will at the last
   day. His speech is then, Mat. vii. 22, Depart from me, ye workers of
   iniquity;' and so saith David, Depart from me, ye evil-doers.' Whether
   David speaks this for his own sake, or for others' instruction, as he
   doth many things in this psalm, I will not dispute. But certainly the
   drift of this verse is to show, that if we intend to walk constantly
   with God, we should keep at a distance from wicked men. Separation from
   them is necessary for a conjunction with God. If they be not God's,
   they should be none of yours, for you are his: Depart from me, ye
   evil-doers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.' Here--

   1. Take notice of the persons to whom he speaks, ye evil-doers.

   2. What is said; he renounceth all commerce with them, depart from me.

   The reason of this renunciation, for I will keep the commandments of my
   God.

   Where you may note--

   [1.] The fixedness of his resolution, I will.

   [2.] The matter resolved upon, I will keep the commandments, which they
   broke or made light of, and so their friendship and company was a
   hindrance to him.

   [3.] The inducing consideration, my God; he is the comfort and refuge
   of my soul, more than all men are to me. Friends are dear, but God
   should be dearer. None is ours so much as he is; he is my God,
   therefore it is him that I will please; my God's commands I will
   conform myself to.

   All the business is to show on what grounds David bids the evil doers
   depart from him.

   1. It is either because of his confidence in God; as ver. 114, Thou art
   my hiding-place and my shield,' therefore depart. He did not fear their
   disturbance or persecution, because God would protect him, so as he
   should peaceably and cheerfully attend his service. This form of speech
   is so used, Ps. vi. 8, Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for
   the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping;' that is, Now I reckon not
   of your assaults and molestations; my God will carry me through his
   work. Or--

   2. It is a renouncing of their aid and assistance offered upon ill
   terms; and so the meaning would be, that he would not stand by their
   interest, or cry up a confederacy with them, and admit of any other
   ways of safety but what were fully consistent with his duty to God.
   Depart from me, as repelling their temptations and carnal counsel.
   Christ saith to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan, when he came with
   carnal counsel; so David saith, Depart from me; you labour in vain to
   draw me to commit wickedness with you: I must keep in with my God, not
   with you: do his commandments, not follow your fancies. Or--

   3. It is a renouncing of all society with them, lest he should be
   corrupted by their evil examples or their carnal suggestions and
   enticements. He seems to speak this as fearing a snare and hindrance by
   their company and intimacy. This is the consideration that I prefer.
   The points may be two:--

   1. That they which would have God for their God must keep his
   commandments.

   2. They that would keep his commandments must avoid the company of the
   wicked.

   Doct. 1. They that would have God for their God must keep his
   commandments.

   This point I shall soon despatch, for it often comes in this psalm.

   1. A covenant relation inferreth a covenant duty. You know the tenor of
   the covenant runs thus, I will be your God, and ye shall be my people,'
   Jer. xxxi. 33; Ezek. xi. 20; Zech. xiii. 9; and other places. Where
   observe this: the stipulation is mutual; there is something which God
   offers, and something which God requires. A covenant is not made up all
   of promises; there is a stipulation of obedience, as well as a promise
   of happiness; and both must concur: a keeping the commandments must be,
   as well as taking hold of the privileges of the covenant: Ps. ciii. 18,
   To such as keep his covenant, that remember his commandments to do
   them.' Both must concur.

   But let us observe distinctly what God offers and what God requires.

   [1.] What God offers: He offers himself to be our God; that is, to be a
   God to bless, and a God to govern and rule; and so the offer of God
   infers not only dependence upon him as he will be a God to bless, but
   subjection to him as he will be a God to rule and govern. Those that
   would have God's blessing must be under his dominion, for the notion of
   our God implies a sovereign as well as a benefactor; he doth not leave
   us to our liberty to live as we list, for then he is not God nor
   supreme. Therefore it is but equal and reasonable he should rule and
   govern, and we obey.

   [2.] But what he requires; that maketh it the more plain. You shall be
   my people; that noteth separation from all others, and a dedication to
   God's use, and a walking according to the tenor of that dedication:
   Deut. xxix. 9, 10, This day thou art become the people of the Lord thy
   God; therefore obey the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep his
   commandments, to love him, obey him, fear him, trust in him.' Well,
   then, as God offers himself to be a God to rule and govern us according
   to his will, so we, in giving up ourselves to be his people, resign
   ourselves up to his government.

   2. In point of gratitude as well as covenant obligation. If God, the
   other contracting party, were our equal, as he is our superior, yet the
   kindness we receive from our God should move us to do him all the
   service we can. His kindness and grace in the covenant should make us
   fearful to offend: They shall fear the Lord and his goodness,' Hosea
   iii. 5; and careful to please God: To walk worthy of God unto all
   well-pleasing,' Col. iii. 10. And therefore love is said to keep the
   commandments: love, which is enkindled by a sense of God's love to us
   in the covenant of grace, will put us upon obeying and careful pleasing
   of God.

   Use 1. Information, to show us how we should make sin odious to us,
   both by way of caution and humiliation; caution against the admission
   of sin, and humiliation because of the commission of it.

   1. Caution. When thou art sinning, remember it is against thy God, who
   hath made thee, who hath kept thee, who hath bought thee, whom thou
   hast owned in covenant, who never showed any backwardness to thy good.
   Is this thy kindness to thy friend, as he said, to sin against God, thy
   best friend? See, the covenant interest is produced to stir up
   indignation against the offences of others: Jude 4, They turn the grace
   of our God into lasciviousness.' There is very much in that, that the
   grace of our God should be abused. So Isa. vii. 13, Is it nothing to
   weary men, but will ye weary my God also?' Wilt thou grieve the spirit
   of thy God, and violate his holy law? If we cannot endure an offence in
   another, much less in ourselves.

   2. For humiliation. This should wound us to the quick, to sin against
   the Lord our God, Jer. iii. 25. Every sin is a breach of covenant. What
   is simple fornication in others, is adultery in you, or breach of
   marriage vow: Luke xv., I have sinned against heaven, and before thee.'

   Use 2 To press us to behave ourselves to God, as he is the Lord our
   God. Why?

   1. Otherwise you do but mock him: Luke vi. 46, Why call ye me Lord,
   Lord, and do not the things which I say?' Cui res nomini subjecta
   negatur, nomini illuditur, saith Tertullian--it is but a mockery of God
   to give him the title, and deny him the duty included in that title. As
   the soldiers which saluted Christ with, Hail, king of the Jews, yet at
   the same time spat in his face and buffeted him; so for us to say, My
   God: Mal. i. 6, If I be a lord, where is my fear? If I be a father,
   where is mine honour?'

   2. Consider, God will not be mocked, but will avenge the quarrel of his
   covenant, Lev. xxvi. 25. A people that profess God to be their God, all
   the judgments that shall come upon them, they come in pursuance of
   God's quarrel, because they give God the covenant title, and do not
   perform the covenant duty. There is hypocrisy in them, in that they
   call him Our God, and make a show to be his peculiar people, and in the
   meantime do neither serve him, love him, nor obey him as our God. And
   there is plain treachery, in that we set up another god, the lust and
   sin which we would gratify with the displeasure of God; so that we are
   not a people for him according to the covenant.

   3. This God will bear us out in our work: Dan. iii. 17; Our God whom we
   serve is able to deliver us.' You may promise yourselves all that a God
   can do for you; therefore let this persuade you to do as David, firmly
   to resolve, and exactly to observe, all that he hath required of us.
   First, Firmly to resolve upon a strict course of obedience. I will,
   saith David in the text; I am resolved of it, whatever cometh on it, or
   whatsoever temptations I meet with to the contrary. Many are convinced
   of their evil courses, and that there is a necessity to leave them, but
   want resolution, therefore are inconstant in all their ways. Secondly,
   Exactly to observe; I will keep the commandments of my God. He that is
   our God, it is fit he should be obeyed in all things: Micah vi. 8, Walk
   humbly with thy God.' You deny his sovereignty by interpretation, if
   you stick at any precept of his.

   Doct. 2. They that would keep the commandments of God must avoid the
   company of the wicked.

   1. I shall show how far the company of the wicked is to be avoided.

   2. Why they that would keep the commandments of God are to do so.

   First, How far the company of the wicked is to be avoided. On the one
   hand--

   1. There is necessary civil converse allowed; for otherwise, as the
   apostle saith, we must needs go out of the world, 1 Cor. v. 10.
   Necessary converse in buying, selling, trading, performing the duties
   of our relations, it is allowed.

   2. We must not forsake the church because of some wicked men therein.
   In God's floor there is wheat and chaff. Saith Augustine, Fugio paleam,
   ne hoc sim; non aream, ne nihil sim--I fly from the chaff that I may
   not be it; but I may not, I do not fly from the floor, lest I be
   nothing. Christ maintained communion with the church wherein there were
   men corrupt in manners, and bids us to hear those that sit in Moses'
   chair, though they say and do not, Mat. xxiii. 1, 2.

   3. We are not hindered from endeavouring the good of their souls;
   whilst there is hope and opportunity to gain them, we may converse with
   them for their good. Thus Jesus Christ did converse with sinners to
   gain them: Luke xv. 2, The Pharisees murmured, saying, This man
   receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.' It is one thing to converse
   with sinners to harden them in their sins, another thing to converse
   with them to gain them to God; as physicians to heal the sick, not as
   their associates to delight in their company. So we may converse with
   them with all gentleness, remembering that we ourselves were sometime
   foolish, disobedient, deceived, &c. Thus we must not avoid them.

   But yet we should avoid them so--

   1. That we should not be familiar with them. Eschew all unnecessary
   voluntary fellowship and familiarity: Ps. xxvi. 4, I have not sat with
   vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.' We are not to
   choose them for our companions, lest we be corrupted and deadened by
   their example.

   2. We are not to enter into a durable relation with them, such as will
   put us upon continual converse. When we are at liberty, 2 Cor. vi. 15,
   Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.' Parents, upon any
   conveniences of estate or outward emoluments, are not to dispose of
   their children there where they may necessarily converse with wicked
   persons: Exod. xxxiv. 15, Thou shalt not take of their daughters to thy
   sons, lest they go a-whoring after their gods.' Instances there are
   many of the great mischief that hath come by entering into these
   durable relations with wicked men: Gen. vi. 2, The sons of God saw the
   daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all
   which they chose.' Men in the visible church are called the sons of
   God, they that were of the line of Seth;. and they that were of the
   line of Cain are called the daughters of men: to go in to them, because
   they are fair, or they are noble, or because they are of our rank, this
   was the provoking sin that helped to bring the flood upon them. So Ps.
   cvi. 35, They were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.'
   Solomon gave an instance that he was corrupted by his wives. So it is
   said of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, 2 Kings viii. 18, That he
   walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for
   the daughter of Ahab was his wife, and he did evil in the sight of the
   Lord.' In ecclesiastical stories we read of Valence the emperor, who
   married with an Arian lady, and so was ensnared thereby, and became a
   cruel persecutor of the catholics; as the best metals, mixed with baser
   metals, are embased thereby.

   3. If necessitated to keep company with them, because of our dwellings,
   relations, and business, let us not comply with them in their sins:
   Eph. v. 11, Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
   but rather reprove them.' We may freely converse with such as we are
   bound to by the laws of necessity, but we must converse with them with
   a great deal of caution, that we may not be ensnared. David had no
   great liking to his companions, yet he was forced to abide with them in
   the deserts: Ps. cxx. 5, 6, Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I
   dwell in the tents of Kedar; my soul hath long dwelt with him that
   hateth peace.' The apostle would have the wife to abide with the
   husband, 1 Cor. vii. 12, and servants to abide with their masters, 1
   Peter ii. 18, and children with their parents, Eph. vi. 1; but no tie
   of that kind doth bind us to partake with them in their sins. And being
   thus necessitated to their converse, we ought to have the more fear and
   caution. And thus Joseph lived in Egypt untainted, and Nehemiah in
   Ahasuerus's court, and Lot in Sodom, and Daniel in the court of Persia;
   necessity forced them thither, but all their care was to keep
   themselves unspotted from the world in the places where they lived.

   Secondly, Why they that would keep the commandments of God are to do
   so.

   1. Because it is hard to keep familiarity with them, and avoid and
   escape the contagion of their example. Example in general hath a great
   force, especially evil example; the force of example is great. Why?
   Seneca gives the reason. Homines plus oculis credunt, quam auribus,
   because an example strikes more upon the heart than a bare word. Man,
   being a sociable creature, is mightily encouraged to do as others do,
   especially in an evil example; for we are more susceptible of evil than
   we are of good. Sickness is sooner communicated than health; we easily
   catch a disease one of another, but those that are sound do not
   communicate health to the diseased. Or rather, to take God's own
   expression, that sets it forth thus, by touching the unclean the man
   became unclean under the law, but by touching the clean the man was not
   purified. The conversation of the wicked hath more power to corrupt the
   good, than the conversation of the virtuous and holy to correct the
   lewd. The prophet tells us, Isa. vi. 5, I am a man of unclean lips, and
   I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.' We soon increase our
   pollution by living among them. Josephus relates that Agrippa at first
   was a lover of virtue and of his country, that he stood for the liberty
   of the people of the Jews; but by conversing with Caligula the Roman
   emperor, being intimate and familiar with him, learned his manners; and
   as he affected divine honours, so Agrippa too, and God smites him with
   lice, Acts xii. In infected places we get a disease, though we feel it
   not presently; so secretly our hearts are tainted by example. As a man
   that walks in the sun, unawares before he thinks of it his countenance
   is tanned, so our hearts are defiled: Prov. xxii. 24, Make no
   friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not
   go.' The furies of passion are so uncomely and so displeasing, that a
   man would think that he should not take infection there, that the sight
   should rather deter than invite him; but insensibly we learn their ways
   when we make friendship with furious and angry men; for saith Solomon,
   in the next verse, Lest you learn his ways, and get a snare to thy
   soul.' Melancthon saith, By converse familiarly with the wicked,
   insensibly we grow wicked. He that toucheth pitch is defiled, and a
   little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, 1 Cor. v. 6.

   2. They will molest and disturb us in the exercise of godliness by
   their scoffs and persecutions; you can never be acceptable to them if
   you live as you should. Why? For you will upbraid their consciences by
   your lives, dart conviction and reproofs into them; as Noah condemned
   the world, Heb. xi. 7. Christ saith, The world hates me because I
   testify of it that the works thereof are evil, John vii. 7. You that
   live up to your profession, and do not run into the same excess of riot
   with others, your estrangement of course revives guilt upon their
   conscience, and therefore not to follow them in all things will be
   distasteful. As sore eyes cannot endure the light, so they cannot
   endure you if you are faithful to God. Diversity of humours cannot long
   agree together. You must either be like them, or be hated by them. You
   must either jump with them in all things, or expect a greater trouble.
   Now there is less danger in the flight than fight. Now a total
   withdrawment is better than a partial compliance.

   3. They will seek to pervert us by carnal suggestions and counsels; as
   the Psalmist speaks, Ps. i. 1, Blessed is the man that walketh not in
   the counsel of the ungodly.' Like troublesome flies, they will always
   be buzzing about us to take share and lot with them, and importunate
   suitors will prevail at length, Prov. i. 10-15, the enticings of the
   wicked are spoken of: My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not;
   walk thou not in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path,'
   &c.

   4. Familiarity with them will be a blemish and scandal upon your good
   name. Every man's company declares what he is. Birds of a sort flock
   together. So that, if they rob not the conscience, they wound the
   reputation, and we are polluted and defiled by being of the same
   society, which a Christian should be tender of. When a scandalous sin
   breaketh out in the church, the blot lies upon all. The apostle tells
   us in Heb. xii. 15, When any root of bitterness springs up, thereby
   many are defiled;' many are defiled, not only by the contagion of the
   example, but the imputation of the fault; much more in private and
   intimate familiarity doth this hold good. A carnal man delights in such
   as are like him, and run with him in the same folly and sin. But when a
   man is changed, he will change his company: Ps. cxix. 53, I am a
   companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy
   precepts.' That is one thing David avoucheth for his innocency. One
   wicked man falls in with another, as the tenon doth into the mortise,
   and their spirits suit frequently: Ps. lx. 18, When thou sawest a
   thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with
   adulterers.' There is no such out ward sign to discover our temper.

   5. If we have any love for God, and zeal for his glory, their company
   must needs be grievous and offensive to us; for how can they that love
   God delight in their company that are always grieving the Spirit of God
   with unsavoury speeches and a vain conversation? Ps. cxxxix. 21, Do not
   I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those
   that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count
   them mine enemies.' So 2 Peter ii. 8, Lot's righteous soul was grieved
   from day to day.' It is not only said his righteous soul was vexed,
   which is passive, but he is said to vex himself at their wickedness,
   which is an active word. Injuries done to God should touch us no less
   nearly than injuries done to ourselves; it will be a continual grief
   and vexation of heart to us. Well, then, how can their company be
   acceptable to us, unless we have a mind to vex and bring trouble upon
   ourselves?

   6. Our familiarity with them may be a means to harden them in their
   sin, and our withdrawing a means to humble them: 2 Thes. iii. 6, 14,
   Withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly: and if
   any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no
   company with him, that he may be ashamed.' While you company freely
   with them, you seem tacitly to approve their doing, and make them more
   obstinate in their way. An alien from the faith may be melted with
   kindness, but a brother that walketh' disorderly is more ashamed if you
   withdraw from him, whereas otherwise you seem to show approbation. He
   that biddeth him God-speed is par taker of his evil deeds, 2 John 10,
   11, as he seemeth to countenance them in their damnable errors; but now
   when a man lives as an outcast from God's people, this may work upon
   his heart. Society with God's children is not only a duty, but a
   privilege; by the loss of this privilege we are to make them sensible
   of the evil course wherein they are.

   7. The great judgments that follow evil company; therefore we must riot
   voluntarily cry up a confederacy with them: Rev. xviii. 4, Come out of
   her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
   receive not of her plagues.' In conversing with the wicked there is a
   double danger--infection of sin, and infliction of punishment: Prov.
   xiii. 20, A companion of fools shall be destroyed; not only fools, but
   their companions.' Lot, living among the wicked Sodomites, he suffered
   with them. You know, when Sodom was assaulted, Lot was taken prisoner,
   and his goods plundered as theirs were, Gen. xiv. 12. Jehoshaphat being
   associated with Ahab, was in danger of death, 1 Kings xxii. 37. The
   heathens were sensible that wicked men were marked out for vengeance.
   The Athenians would not wash in the same bath with the persecutors of
   Socrates; so Polycarp would not go into the same bath with Cerinthus,
   but said, The enemy of truth is here; let us depart hence, lest the
   bath fall down upon us. [10]

   Use 1. Reproof of their foolhardiness that rush upon evil company, and
   fear nothing. What! are your hearts so good that you think scorn that
   any company should hurt you? Consider, is sin grown less dangerous than
   it was? or are we come to such a height of perfection as to be above
   temptation to sin? Or have we so good a command of ourselves that we
   need not take such care of our company? that we shall do well enough
   though we play about the cockatrice's hole, and run into all companies
   and societies without fear? Good David here in the text is fain to
   proclaim, Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity,' and to banish them
   out of his company: and David exceeded us in holiness, and surely we
   live in more wicked days than he did. See how it succeeded with Peter:
   he would venture into the high priest's hall, and sit with the company
   there, and how did it succeed with him? It brought him to a denial of
   Christ. Eve was bold with the serpent, and the Virgin Mary shamefaced
   with an angel, Luke i. 29, 30; and you know how it fell out both with
   the one and the other: one was a means to ruin all mankind, and the
   other to repair it. What is the matter? Is not sin the same as it was?
   and is not human nature as bad as ever? What spells and charms have we
   about ourselves that the people of God had not heretofore? Or are we
   more fortified, and so are less watchful? Shall we be running still
   upon the pit's brink, and show how far we can go and not fall in? Are
   all those cautions out of date that bid us shun the occasions of sin?
   and is not evil company one of the chiefest of them? Yet some men can
   frolic it in all companies, revel and dance, run to plays, and no harm
   they think of all this. Solomon says, Prov. iv. 14, 15, Enter not into
   the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men; avoid it,
   pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.' See how he heaps up
   words. Did he trifle and speak needlessly when with such earnestness he
   pressed this, that we would be careful of associating with wicked men?
   Surely no; and yet men are for all companies, as if there were no
   danger to their souls.

   Use 2. Let us be persuaded to shake off the society of the wicked.
   Depart from them that depart from God, and would draw you along with
   them. But chiefly should we shun them, because bad company is the pest
   and bane of godliness. Under the law, a man that had a running issue,
   whoever touched him was unclean, Lev. xiv. 4. And so it is here; you
   are defiled by your conversing with them. Men of different humours,
   spirits, interests, how can they agree? Either you must abate somewhat
   of your zeal, or you can never suit if you enter into friendship with
   them. You cannot deal so plainly against their sins, or gainsay them in
   their evil practices, but will wax cold by little and little. If you be
   in defiance with them, that will make way for calumny and all manner of
   injuries; therefore it is better never to begin acquaintance with them.
   Consider, again, if none of this fall out, yet their company will be a
   loss to you; as it spendeth time and hindereth you of many
   opportunities of religious privacy and service of God; so, if no other
   way you had a loss by them, they would not better you; for they are not
   company you expect to gain by. As he said, Nunquam ad te accedo, quin
   doctior recedam, quin sanctior--I never came to such an one but I went
   away more learned and holy. Certainly a Christian should choose such
   for his company that he might say, I go away more holy, otherwise his
   company would be a loss to us.

   But to pursue this argument a little further. To give some
   observations, then some helps against evil company.

   First, Some observations.

   1. This concerns young ones especially, and those that are not in a
   radicated state of grace. Indeed, it concerns all. If you mean to keep
   close to God, you must divorce your heart from them; but chiefly young
   ones, that are either left to choose, or not confirmed in their choice,
   for the danger to them is greater than to others. Oh! how many young
   ones are undone by carnal company! Eusebius tells us of a young man
   that was bred up under St John, who by evil company was not only drawn
   to be a robber, but the prince and captain of robbers (Euseb. lib. iii.
   c. 23), until St John went out and met him. And Gregory the Great
   speaks of Gordiana, his own aunt, that was drawn off from the love of
   God, and the strictness of a holy life, after the death of her two
   sisters, Tharsylla and Æmiliana, by her companions. And St Augustine,
   lib. viii. Confess. cap. 8, Quem fructum habui miser aliquando in iis
   quae nunc recolligens erubesco, maxime in illo furto, in quo ipsum
   furtum amavi, nihil aliud; et ipsum esset nihil, et ego eo miserior, et
   tamen solus id non fecissem. Sic recordor animum tunc meum, solus
   omnino id non fecissem, ergo amavi consortium eorum cum quibus id
   feci--O Lord, what cause have I to be ashamed when I remember these
   things, especially the theft, where I loved the theft for the theft's
   sake! What was the gain but a few apples stolen? And yet, saith he, I
   had never done it if I had been alone; oh! it was the company of them
   that drew me to this theft. Then afterwards, It was my companions drew
   me to this. O nimis iniqua amicitia! seductio mentis investigabilis--O
   cruel friendship! when they said, Come, let us go and do it; I was
   ashamed not to be shameless, and as evil as they. When, then, in this
   waxen age, youth are above all to avoid the company of evil-doers.

   2. We must not only take heed that we be not inured to evil, but also
   that we be not deadened to that which is good. Example may corrupt us
   either way. Neglect of God will keep us out of heaven, as well as
   profaneness. Now, alas! how easily are we leavened with deadness and
   formality by our company! Frequent society with dead-hearted
   formalists, or persons merely civil and moral, whose conference is
   empty, unsavoury, barren, may much divert our hearts from heaven, and
   do us a great deal of mischief. The apostle tells us, Heb. x. 24, we
   should consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.'
   Our dulness and backwardness is such that we need the most powerful
   helps.

   3. Of all evil company, the company of seducers, those that cause
   divisions and offences in the church, and broach novel opinions, ought
   to be avoided: Rom. xvi. 17, Mark them which cause divisions and
   offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid
   them;' 2 John 10, If any man bring another doctrine, receive him not
   into your house, neither bid him God-speed;' 1 Tim. vi. 5, and men that
   are given to perverse disputings, from such withdraw thyself.' Error is
   more catching than vice, and more spreading. It is more catching, the
   face of it being represented with the loveliness of some pretence or
   other; whereas foul actions are found hateful and more contrary to
   natural conscience; and besides, it is more spreading. Vice is like a
   duel; it killeth but one. Error is like a war that destroys many at
   once; therefore we should not be familiar with these. Erroneous
   apprehensions in religion carry a marvellous compliance with a man's
   natural thoughts.

   4. It is not enough to avoid bad company, but we must choose that which
   is good. A man must have friends; the use of them in this life is very
   great. Man. is a sociable creature, as Aristotle speaks; company and
   friendship we must have. Christ himself was not without his peculiar
   friends; there was Peter, James, and John, that were the flower of the
   apostles, that were conscious to his transfiguration and his agonies.
   We must have our friends and our society, so that the advantage of good
   company is very great: Prov. xiii. 20, He that walketh with wise men
   shall be wise;' their example will allure and excite to holy emulation,
   and their counsel and instruction will he a great help in the business
   of religion. Even Saul, being among the prophets, had his raptures, 1
   Sam. xix. 23. So living in the company of godly men, and seeing,
   hearing, and conferring with them of good things, leaveth some
   impression.

   Secondly, Some helps and considerations.

   1. Consider what is our chiefest good. This is principium
   universalissimum. The last end or chiefest good is the principle which
   doth influence all our actions. And certainly, if men fix their last
   end aright, it will have an influence upon all they do; our company,
   our business, our recreation, our holy duties. Well, now, consider what
   is your chiefest good and your last end. If pleasure were our chiefest
   good, and if we had nothing else to do but to pass away the time, and
   to get rid of melancholy, there would need no great care in the choice
   of our company. But enjoying the blessed God, that is our last end and
   chiefest good: everything must be answerable to help you to heaven.

   2. A sincere resolution to walk with God, to keep in with God firmly
   set; for here David saith, Depart from me, ye evil-doers; for I will
   keep the commandments of my God.' His resolution was set, therefore he
   shakes them off. When Ruth's resolution was set, Naomi left off
   persuading. When Paul's company saw his resolution, that he went bound
   in the spirit, they ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done' Acts
   xxi. 14. So this will fortify against all suggestion; they will be
   discouraged from haunting you more when you are resolved.

   3. Our company will be a great part of our happiness in heaven: Heb.
   xii. 22, We are come to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
   company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the
   first-born, which are written in heaven;' and Mat. viii. 11, They shall
   sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.'
   Company will be a great part of our happiness, and for the present it
   will be a great hindrance or a great furtherance; therefore, when we
   think of this, it will make us choose those with whom we shall converse
   to all eternity, that we may say, Now I shall change places, but not my
   company; I shall but go from saints to saints.

   4. Bad company can yield you no comfort hereafter when trouble of
   conscience comes. When your heart begins to wound you, they cannot or
   will not help: Mat. xxvii. 4, What is that to us? see thou to that.' If
   they draw you to inconvenience, when it comes upon you they will yield
   you no relief or comfort. Well, he that considers he is to die and give
   an account, will not displease God to please men.

SERMON CXXVII.

   Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live; and let me not be
   ashamed of my hope.--Ver. 116.

   IN the former verse, David had bound himself by a firm resolution to
   keep the commandments of his God. Now presently he turneth to prayer,
   Lord, uphold me according to thy word, that I may live; and let me not
   be ashamed of my hope.' Our purposes and resolutions will not hold out
   without God's confirming grace. David, that would have the wicked
   depart from him there, would have God draw nigh to him here. Both are
   necessary if we would keep the commands. The company of the wicked, as
   a great impediment, must be removed: Depart from me, ye evil-doers;'
   and then the assistance of God must be entreated: Uphold me according
   unto thy word,' &c. Two things he begs of God in this verse:--

   1. Confirmation in waiting.

   2. The full and final accomplishment of his hope.

   In the first request there is--

   1. The blessing prayed for, confirmation or sustentation, uphold me.

   2. The ground or warrant of asking, according unto thy word. Some
   translations have it, by thy word,' making it the instrument of his
   support.

   3. To what end, that I might live.

   In the second request an argument is intimated, that frustration or
   disappointment of his hope would bring shame.

   I begin with the first, the blessing prayed for, sustentation and
   support, Uphold me.' David speaketh not this with respect to his
   outward man, as if God should keep him alive, maugre the rage of his
   enemies. Indeed, God doth uphold his creatures in that sense, by his
   outward providence and divine maintenance. But he speaketh this of his
   inward man, the support of the soul, that God would sup port him in a
   way of faith and comfort. In ver. 114, Thou art my hiding-place and my
   shield: I hope in thy word.' Now, Lord, that I might live, keep up the
   life of this hope. And ver. 115, I will keep the commandments of my
   God.' And now he desires God would support him in a way of courage and
   obedience. Hence observe--

   Doct. Sustaining grace is necessary to the saints. Confirmation in a
   state of grace is as necessary to them as conversion to it.

   There is a twofold grace which God gives--habitual and actual; either
   he works upon us per modum habitus, infusing grace, permanentis, or
   else per modum auxilii transientis.

   First, There is habitual grace, called in scripture the new heart and
   new spirit, Ezek. xxxvi. 26; and by St John called spe'rma autou, 1
   John iii. 9. the abiding seed; and by St Paul, 2 Cor. v. 17, kaine`
   kti'sis, the new creature. All these expressions intend those fixed and
   permanent habits which are the principles of holy actions.

   Secondly, There is actual grace, for the former is not enough to carry
   us through all duties, and to uphold us in all the varieties of this
   mortal condition. Why? Quia non totaliter sanat--habitual grace works
   not a total, but only a partial cure. Though there be the new creature
   wrought, though there be an abiding seed, yet there is something of
   sin, and something of the flesh still left in the soul. Therefore we
   want perpetual supplies of actual grace. Now this kind of grace serveth
   for divers uses.

   1. To direct us in the exercise of grace formerly received. A ship
   already rigged needs a pilot; so, although God hath renewed the heart,
   yet there needs direction how to exercise and put forth that grace that
   we have received; therefore David, Ps. cxix. 5, Oh, that my ways were
   directed to keep thy statutes;' and 2 Thes. iii. 5, The Lord direct
   your hearts into the love of God,' &c. In the exercise of every grace
   we need new directions from God.

   2. To excite and quicken the habits of grace. This is like blowing up
   the sparks of fire that are buried under the ashes. There needs
   continual excitation, which is often sought by the saints: Quicken me,
   O Lord, according to thy word.' And draw me, saith the spouse, Cant. i.
   4.

   3. This actual grace serves for this use, to strengthen them in the
   operation, and to facilitate the work. This is that which is expressed
   Ps. cxix. 32, When thou shalt enlarge my heart;' that when the
   inclination of the renewed heart to good things is powerfully set
   a-work, this is like filling the sails with a good wind, which carries
   on the ship merrily to its port and haven.

   4. Use it to sustain, protect, and defend the grace that we have
   against the assaults and temptations and varieties and casualties of
   the present life. And this is that which is meant here, Uphold me,
   Lord, that I may live.' Now this use of God's actual assistance by way
   of sustentation and protection is necessary for us upon three
   grounds--(1.) Because of the natural changeableness of our spirits.
   (2.) Because of daily assaults from Satan. (3.) Because of the great
   impression which our temporal condition makes upon us.

   [1.] Because of the natural changeableness of our spirits. Man of
   himself is an unstable creature. Take him at the best, he is but a
   creature, and to be a creature and to be mutable is all one. God found
   no stability in the angels; they are creatures, and therefore they
   might sin. God only is impeccable; and why? Quia Deus est, because he
   is God. But all creatures may fail; angels fell, and Adam fell in
   innocency; and how can we hope to stand unless God uphold us? The best
   of God's children are often troubled with fits of unbelief and decays
   of love; their faith and love are not always at one stay and tenor, but
   sometimes more and sometimes less. David felt the waverings, and was
   afraid of himself; therefore saith to God, Uphold me, that I may live.'
   And so all that have any spiritual experience see that without
   continual grace they cannot live, and keep body and soul together. They
   find that often purposes and resolutions are upon them to those things
   that are good, but within a while their hearts sink again. Such is the
   inconstancy and uncertainty of their affections; now, they hope, anon
   they fear; now a great flush of affections, anon dead again; now
   humble, anon proud; now meek, anon passionate; now confident, then full
   of fears and anguish; like men sick of an ague, sometimes well and
   sometimes ill. What a Proteus would even a good man seem, if all his
   affections and passions were visible and liable to the notice of the
   world! None differ so much from them as they seem to differ from
   themselves. Sometimes they are like trees laden with fruit, at another
   time they are like trees in the winter, which, though they seem to have
   life in the root, yet to appearance they differ little from those that
   are stark dead. Nay, in those very particular graces for which they are
   eminent, how have they failed! Abraham, that was the father of the
   faithful, so eminent for faith, yet in Abimelech's country he
   discovered much carnal fear, Gen. xx. Moses, that was the meekest man
   upon earth, yet in what a froward passion was he when he struck the
   rock twice, Num. xx. 10, 11, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips,'
   Ps. cvi. 33, which God took so heinously, that he only gave him a sight
   of Canaan, and would not permit him to enter. Peter is noted to have
   the greatest fervency and zeal of all the apostles (you know he had so
   much courage that he ventures against a band of men that came to attack
   Christ), and yet how was he surprised with cowardice and sinful fear at
   a damsel's question! And therefore we need this sustaining grace, and
   to go to God: Lord, uphold me.' The wards of the lock are held up only
   while the key is turned, so God must uphold us or we fall. Or let me
   express it thus: As meteors are kept up in the air while the sun stays,
   that which first drew them up must keep them up, or else they fall to
   the ground; so we sink presently when this sustaining grace is
   withdrawn. Or as Moses, when he was but a while in the mount with God,
   how soon the people fell to idolatry! So if God be but away we shall be
   found as unstable as water.

   [2.] Because of the daily assaults of Satan. When a poor soul is gotten
   out of his hands, he pursues him with continual malice, 1 Peter v. 8;
   no less doth he aim at than the utter destruction of our souls, and
   wrestles to recover the prey, to plunge us in that estate of misery
   wherein himself lies; therefore we must be defended and protected every
   day. When cities are besieged, they are not left to their ordinary
   strength and standing provision, but fresh supplies of men and
   ammunition are sent to their relief; so God deals with us. As we are
   unstable creatures, we need the continual assistance of God, for all
   depends on him, in esse, conservare, and operari. But here is another
   consideration to help to uphold us under assault. When the disciples
   were tossed to and fro, and shaken with sundry temptations, then Christ
   prays than their faith may not fail, begs further assistance, Luke xx.
   31; so when Paul was buffeted by Satan, God makes him a promise of
   additional grace: 2 Cor. xii. 9, My grace is sufficient for thee.' We
   need further help from God, that we may stand against his batteries and
   assaults.

   [3.] Because of the great impression which our temporal condition makes
   upon us. We are now happy, anon afflicted. Now, as unequal uncertain
   weather doth afflict the body, so do our various conditions distemper
   the soul. To abound and to be abased, to be up and to be down, to carry
   an equal hand in unequal conditions, is very hard, and will call for
   the supporting strength of God's Spirit. So the apostle, Phil. iv. 12,
   13, I know how to be abased, and how to abound; every where and in all
   things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound
   and to suffer need: I can do all things through Christ which
   strengtheneth me.' From that place let me observe something.

   (1.) That we are subject to change of conditions in outward things;
   sometimes in credit, sometimes in disgrace; sometimes rich, some times
   poor; cut short by the providence of God; sometimes sick, sometimes in
   health; sometimes enjoy all things comfortably, at other times reduced
   to great necessity. Now it is very hard to go through all these
   conditions, not to be dejected on the one side or puffed up on the
   other.

   (2.) Observe again from that place, either of these conditions have
   their snares, so that we need all the grace that possibly we can get to
   avoid them. Some think that snares and temptations lie but on one side,
   namely, they think it is easy to be rich, and to maintain hope and
   comfort in God then; but it is hard to be poor, and to be destitute of
   all things. When they have nothing to live upon, they cannot see how
   they should live by faith, or keep from murmurings, repinings, or
   uncomely dejections and sinkings of heart. On the other side, some
   think it easy to be poor and religious; but how to keep a good
   conscience in a full estate, where there is so rough to draw them from
   God, to keep down pride and security, and to live under a lively sense
   of the comforts of the other world, to do this in the midst of
   opulency, this is hard. There are indeed temptations on both hands.

   (3.) Observe, again, some that have held well in one condition have
   failed in another. One sort of temptations have a greater force upon
   some spirits than others have. When God hath kept men low, they have
   been modest and humble; but when they have been exalted, then they have
   showed themselves, their pride, their disdain, their forgetfulness of
   God, their mindlessness of the interest of Christ. On the other hand,
   others have carried it well in prosperity, yet when the bleak winds of
   adversity are let loose upon them, they are withered and dried up. Some
   cannot encounter terrors, others blandishments. As the prophet saith of
   Ephraim, he is a cake not turned, that is, baked only of the one side,
   very dough on the other; so it is with many men; on one side of
   providence they seem to do well, but when God puts them in another
   condition they have foully miscarried. 1 Kings xiii. the young prophet
   that could thunder out judgment against the king, when the old prophet
   enticed him, he is gone.

   (4.) Nay, and which is more, to have these conditions to succeed one
   another makes the temptation the greater. To be cast down, after that
   we have got on the top of the wheel, and have tasted of the world's
   happiness, is the greater trial. And so on the other side, to be lifted
   up after extreme misery; sudden changes affect us more. Now, to possess
   things without love, or lose them without grief; to be temperate and
   sober in the enjoyment of worldly happiness, or to be meek and patient
   in the loss of it; or to exercise a Christian mode ration as to all
   these dispensations; it is a very hard thing to keep the heart steady
   and right with God; and therefore we need the influence of God's
   special grace, as the apostle presently adds, I can do all things
   through Christ that strengthens me.'

   Use. To press us to look after this upholding and sustaining grace,
   that as we come to God, so we may keep with God. In some cases
   perseverance is more difficult than conversion; it is a harder thing to
   persevere than to be converted at first. In the first conversion we are
   mainly passive, if not altogether, but in perseverance active. It is
   God that plants us into Christ, but when we are in Christ we ought to
   walk in him. As an infant in the mother's womb before it is born lives
   by the life of the mother, and is fed and grows by the mother's
   feeding, without any concurrence of its own; but when born, indeed it
   is suckled by the mother still, but the child sucks itself, and applies
   nourishment to itself; and the more it grows, the more the care of its
   life is devolved upon itself; so the first conversion is chiefly God's
   work, and when converted we cannot persevere without his help, but the
   care of the spiritual life is more devolved upon us than before. God
   doth give perseverance as well as conversion: 2 Peter i. 5, We are kept
   by the power of God through faith unto salvation;' but so that more is
   required to be done by us when converted than in conversion itself.
   Eph. ii. 10, the apostle tells us that we are his workmanship, created
   in Christ Jesus unto good works;' there is an action required of us.
   What is conversion? A consent to the terms of the gospel convenant,
   that is the great act of conversion on our part. But now perseverance
   is the fulfilling of the duty of this covenant. Now it is more easy to
   consent to the terms than to make them good. As in the matrimonial
   contract, the promise of the duties proper to that relation is more
   easy than the performance; so the consenting to God's covenant, all the
   business is to make it good, because of our unstable nature, manifold
   temptations, and great discouragements in the way of holiness.
   Certainly, to keep in the life of grace in the soul is a very hard
   thing. The Israelites, after they were brought to consent to receive
   Moses for their captain to lead them to Canaan, yet when they came out
   of Egypt, and had trial of the difficulties of the way, and were
   exposed to so many dangers, they were ever and anon desiring to return.
   So it is with us; it is hard to hold out against all assaults; many
   things will be interposing, and breaking your resolutions, and taking
   you off from God. The flesh will be interposing, so that you must often
   say, as Rom. v. 12, We are not debtors to the flesh, to live after the
   flesh,' to fulfil it in the lusts whereof. And the world will be
   threatening, and you must say as they, Dan. iii. 16; We are not careful
   to answer thee in this matter,' Dangers will grow upon us and increase,
   and then we must say, as Esth. iv. 16, If we perish, we perish.'
   Friends will be soliciting, and you must say, as Paul, Acts xxi. 13,
   What mean you to break my heart? I am ready to die for Christ;' or as
   Christ said to his mother, John ii. 4, Woman, what have I to do with
   thee?' Must I not be about my Father's business?' Seducers will be
   persuading, and we must be ready to say, as Acts iv. 19, Whether it be
   right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge
   ye.' Nay, God himself will seem to discourage us, and to be against us;
   and you must even say to God, as Job xiii. 15, Though thou slay me, yet
   will I put my trust in thee.' To keep up this life in this vigour of
   faith and this courage of obedience in the midst of all these
   interposings, is a very difficult, hard work. What then? Therefore go
   to God: Lord, uphold me, that I may live.'

   1. Ask it of God earnestly, because of your necessities. Secondly, In
   faith, because of his all-sufficiency. First, earnestly, because of
   your necessities. Without God's upholding a man, he hath within himself
   no power to withstand any the least temptation or occasion unto sin.
   There is no evil so foul, nor sin so grievous, but there is a
   possibility that we may fall into it. Ps. xix. 13, David saith, Keep
   back thy servant from presumptuous sins.' Mark the expression, keep
   back;' it implies that he felt an inclination and readiness in his
   heart, and therefore desires God to hold the bridle of grace the more
   hard upon him: Lord, keep back thy servant. When Satan disguiseth a
   gross sin with a plausible and tempting appearance, and when he bribes
   the flesh with some pleasure or advantage, oh! how soon is lust set
   agog and the heart overborne by the violence of its own affections! and
   how soon do we faint and are discouraged when we are exercised
   variously with divers assaults on this hand and that! Secondly, In
   faith, because of God's all-sufficiency: 1 Peter v. 10, The God of all
   grace make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.' Observe the
   title that he gives to God, The God of all grace;' it notes that he
   hath good store, and hath a gracious inclination to give it. And then
   he reckons up the several kinds of graces. What would you have? Would
   you keep that which you have already attained to? The Lord establish
   you. Would you increase what you have? The Lord perfect you. Would you
   act what you have with life and vigour, and grow more resolute? The
   Lord strengthen you. Would you grow more resolute against difficulty?
   The Lord settle you. So the apostle, 2 Thes. ii. 17, The God of all
   grace comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and
   work.' There is an all-sufficiency in God to help you, and carry you
   through all trials and all your difficulties. Therefore ask it of God.

   2. Do not forfeit this assisting grace by presumptuous sins. God
   withdraws his protection and defence when we provoke him: Isa. lii. 2,
   Your sins have separated between you and your God, and made him hide
   his face from you;' and Hosea v. 15, Now I will go to my own place,' I
   will leave them to themselves, till they acknowledge their iniquity.'
   David prays for this after he had fallen foully: Ps. li. 12, Lord,
   uphold me with thy free Spirit.' He had lost his strength in God, his
   largeness of love; he wanted the assistances of God's grace; he had
   been tampering with forbidden fruit: Lord, come again; Lord, uphold me
   with thy free Spirit.'

   3. Do not expose yourselves to temptation, for you are weak and cannot
   stand without confirming grace, which is not at your beck, not given
   out according to your pleasure, but he giveth us to will and to do,'
   kata` eudoki'an, according to his good pleasure,' Phil. ii. 12.
   Christians! when we will try mysteries, and run into the mouth of
   danger, and be dealing with them that are apt to seduce us into evil,
   God will no more show the power of his grace than Christ would show a
   miracle to satisfy Herod's curiosity and wanton fancy. Oh! therefore,
   let us not unnecessarily and unwarrantably throw ourselves upon the
   enticements of sin. For instance, as if no evil company could infect,
   or no carnal sports corrupt, or ambitious affectation of high places,
   when God doth not call us up by the voice of his providence; this doth
   but increase our temptation. When we will be rushing into places of
   danger, as Peter into the high priest's hall, we go thither without our
   defence. A man that is sensible what will do his body hurt is very
   cautious how he meddleth with it. The like care should we have of our
   souls.

   The second thing in the text is the ground and warrant of his request,
   According to thy word;' or by thy word, as some read it. God hath
   promised support to those that wait upon him: Isa. xl. 29, 31, He
   giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaseth
   strength. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they
   shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary,
   and they shall walk and not faint.' Before their full and final
   deliverance come, they shall have present support and strength renewed
   to them every day. This note should quicken us:--

   1. To pray to God for grace to stand with the more confidence. God hath
   promised to uphold those that cleave to him, and run to him; therefore
   say, Lord, thy word bids me to hope; though I am an unstable creature,
   I will hope in thy word: Ps. xxxi. 24, Be of good courage, and he shall
   strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord.' Though nothing
   else be stable, yet this is stable.

   2. Bless God and own his grace; look upon it as a fulfilling of his
   promise, if you have sustentation, or any strength renewed upon you,
   though your trials and temptations are yet continued to you: Ps.
   cxxxviii. 3, In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me, and
   strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.' It is an answer of prayer,
   fulfilling of a promise, when we have strength to persevere without
   fainting; though we be not delivered, to have support before the
   deliverance come. I thank God, saith St Paul, for the sustentation I
   have. Great sustentation I have, though spiritual suavities I taste not
   many. It is matter of thanksgiving and comfort if we have but
   sustentation, and keep up the life of grace in the soul, though we
   taste not Christ's banquets and dainties.

   The third circumstance is the end, That I may live.' David speaks not
   this of bodily life, not the life of nature, but the life of grace. And
   then the note is this--

   Doct. The children of God do not count themselves to live, unless their
   spiritual life be kept in good plight.

   David, that enjoyed the pleasure and honour of the regal state, he doth
   not count that to live, though he were king in Israel, of an opulent
   and flourishing kingdom, and had mighty successes and victories over
   the people round about him, but when his heart was upheld in the ways
   of God. So Col. iii. 3, Your life is hid with Christ in God.' They had
   a life visible, as other men had; but your life, that which you chiefly
   esteem, and indeed count to be your life, is a hidden thing.

   Here I shall inquire--(1.) What is this spiritual life. (2.) Show that
   there is a spiritual life distinct from the natural. (3.) The
   excellency of the one above the other. (4.) When this spiritual life is
   in good plight.

   1. What is meant by spiritual life? It is threefold--a life of
   justification and sanctification and glorification.

   [1.] The life of justification. We are all dead by the merit of sin.
   When a man is cast at law, we say he is a dead man: Through one man's
   offence all were dead,' Rom. v. 5. We are sensible of it when the law
   cometh in with power, Rom. vii. 9; we begin to awaken out of our dead
   sleep. God's first work is to awaken him and open his eyes, that he may
   see he is a child of wrath, a condemned person, undone, without a
   pardon. When the law came, sin revived and I died;' before he thought
   himself a living man, in as good an estate as the best; but when he was
   enlightened to see the true meaning of the law, he found himself no
   better than a dead man. Now, when justified, the sinner is translated
   from a sentence of death to a sentence of life passed in his favour;
   and therefore it is called justification of life, Rom. v. 18, and John
   v. 29, He that believeth shall not enter into condemnation, but hath
   passed from death to life;' that is, is acquitted from the sentence of
   death and condemnation passed on him by the law.

   [2.] The life of sanctification, which lies in. a conjunction of the
   soul with the spirit of God, even as the natural' life is a conjunction
   of the body with the soul. Adam, though his body was organised and
   formed, was but a dead lump till God breathed the soul into him; so
   till our union with Christ, by the communion of his Spirit, we are dead
   and unable to every good work. But the Holy Ghost puts us into a living
   condition: Eph. ii. 4, 5, We were dead in trespasses and sins, yet now
   hath he quickened us.' There is a new manner of being, which we have
   upon the receiving of grace.

   [3.] Life eternal, or the life of glory, which is the final result and
   consummation of both the former; for justification and sanctification
   are but the beginnings of our happy estate; justification is the cause
   and foundation, and sanctification is an introduction or entrance into
   that life that we shall ever live with God.

   2. Now this life is distinct from life natural, first, for it hath a
   distinct principle, which is the Spirit of God; the other a reasonable
   soul: 1 Cor. xv. 45, The first man Adam was made a living soul, the
   last Adam was made a quickening spirit.' Parents are but instruments of
   God's providence to unite body and soul together: but here we live by
   the Spirit or by Christ, Gal. ii. 20; God and we are united together.
   Then we live when joined to God as the fountain of life, whence the
   soul is quickened by the Spirit of grace. This is to live indeed. It is
   called the life of God, Eph. iv. 18, not by common influence of his
   providence, but by special influences of his grace. Secondly, It is
   distinct in its operations, Unumquodque operatur secundum suam formam,
   as things that move upward and downward according to their form; so the
   new nature carrieth men out to their own natural motion and tendency.
   Walking as men, 1 Cor. iii. 3, and walking as Christians, are two
   distinct things. The natural and human life is nothing else but the
   orderly use of sense and reason; but the divine and spiritual life is
   the acting of grace in order to communion with God, as if another soul
   dwelt in the same body: Ego non sum ego. Old lusts, old acquaintance,
   old temptations, knock at the same door, but there is another
   inhabitant. Thirdly, Distinct in supports. Hidden manna, meat indeed,
   drink indeed, John vi. 55. There is an outward man and an inward man;
   the inward man hath its life as well as the outward. And as life, so
   taste: Omnis vita gustu ducitur. The hidden man must be fed with hidden
   manna, meat and drink that the world knows not of; its comforts are
   never higher than in decays of the body, 2 Cor. iv. 16. A man is as his
   delight and pleasure is; it must have something agreeable. Fourthly,
   Distinct in ends. The aim and tendency of the new nature is to God; it
   is from God, and therefore to him, Gal. ii. 19. It is a life whereby a
   man is enabled to move and act towards God as his utmost end, to
   glorify him, or to enjoy him. A carnal man's personal contentment is
   his highest aim: water riseth not beyond its fountain. But a gracious
   man doth all to please God, Col. i. 11, to glorify God, 1 Cor. x. 31;
   and this not only from his obligations, Rom. xiv. 7, 8, but from his
   being, that principle of life that is within him, Eph. i. 12. A man
   that hath a new principle cannot live without God; his great purpose
   and desire is to enjoy more of him.

   3. The excellency of the one above the other. There is life carnal,
   life natural, and life spiritual. Life carnal, as much as it glittereth
   and maketh a noise in the world, it is but a death in comparison of the
   life of grace: 1 Tim. v. 6, She that liveth in pleasure is dead whilst
   she liveth;' and Let the dead bury their dead,' Luke ix. 60; and dead
   in trespasses and sins. None seem to make so much of their lives as
   they, yet dead as to any true life and sincere comfort. So life
   natural, it is but a vapour, a wind, and a little puff of wind, that is
   soon gone. Take it in the best, nature is but a continued sickness, our
   food is a constant medicine to remedy the decays of nature: most men
   use it so, alimenta sunt medicamenta. But more particularly--(1.) Life
   natural is a common thing to devils, reprobates, beasts, worms, trees,
   and plants; but this is the peculiar privilege of the children of God,
   1 John iv. 13. Therefore God's children think they have no life unless
   they have this life. If we think we have a life because we see and
   hear, so do the worms and smallest flies. If we think we are alive
   because we eat, drink, and sleep, so do the beasts and cattle. If we
   think we live because we reason and confer, so do the heathens and men
   that shall never see God. If we think we have life because we grow well
   and wax strong, proceeding to old age, so do the plants and trees of
   the field. Nay, we have not only this in common with them, but in this
   kind of life other creatures excel man. The trees excel us for growth
   in bulk and stature, who from little plants grow up into most excellent
   cedars. In hearing, smelling, seeing, many of the beasts go before us;
   eagles in sight, dogs in scent, &c. Sense is their perfection. Some see
   better, others hear better, others smell better; all have a better
   appetite to their meat, and more strong to digest it. For life
   rational, endowed with reason, many philosophers and ethnics excel
   Christians in the use of reason. Our excellency then lieth not in the
   vegetative life, wherein plants excel thee; nor in sensitive, which
   beasts have better than thou; nor in the reasonable, which many
   reprobates have, which shall never see the face of God; but in life
   spiritual, to have the soul quickened by the spirit of grace. (2.) Life
   natural is short and uncertain, but this eternal grace is an immortal
   flame, a spark that cannot be quenched. All our labour and toil is to
   maintain a lamp that soon goeth out, or to prop up a tabernacle that is
   always falling; when we have made provision for it, taken away this
   night, &c.; it is in the power of every ruffian and assassin: but this
   is a life that beginneth in grace and endeth in glory. (3.) The outward
   life is short, but yet we soon grow weary of it; but this is a life
   that we shall never be weary of. 1 Kings xix. 4, Elijah requested for
   himself that he might die. The shortest life is long enough to be
   encumbered with a thousand miseries. If you live to old age, age is a
   burthen to itself: Days come in which there is no pleasure,' Eccles.
   xii. 1; but you will never wish for an end of this life. (4.) In the
   preparations and costs which God hath been at to bring about this life
   at first. Without any difficulty God breathed into man the breath of
   life, Gen. ii. 7; but to procure this life of grace, God must become
   man, and set up a new fountain of life in our natures, John x. 20. And
   not only so, but to die: John vi. 51, My flesh which I give for the
   life of the world.' Consider the price paid for it. God would not
   bestow it at a cheaper rate than the death of his only Son. (5.) In the
   provisions of it: Isa. lvii. 10, the life of thy hands.' With a great
   deal of toil and labour we get a few supports for it; but this is fed
   with the blood of Christ, influences of grace, and comforts from the
   Spirit; not with gross things, but sublime, high, noble. (6.) In the
   use for which it serveth. It fitteth us for communion with God, as the
   other fits us for communion with men. Things can have no communion with
   one another that do not live the life of one another. We dwell in God,
   and God dwelleth in us. (7.) Its necessities are greater, which show
   the value of the life. The higher the life, the more dependence. Things
   inanimate, as stones, need not such supplies as things that have life.
   Where plants will not grow, they must have a kindly soil. Among plants
   the vine needs more dressing and care than the bramble; beasts more
   than plants; their food appointed God hath most left to man's care, as
   the instrument of his providence; man more than beasts, saints more
   than men, much waiting upon God. No creature so dependent, in need of
   such daily supplies, as the inward man. (8.) Its sense is greater.
   There is a greater sensibleness in this life than in any other life.
   All life hath a sweetness in it. As any life exceedeth another, so more
   sensibleness; a beast is more sensible of wrong and hurt than a plant.
   As the life of a man exceedeth the life of a beast, so more capable of
   joy and grief. As the life of grace exceedeth the life of a man, so its
   joy is greater, its grief is greater, trouble of conscience, a wounded
   spirit. So the joy of saints is unspeakable and glorious, peace that
   passeth all understanding.

   4. When is this life in good plight? It showeth itself in these two
   effects--(1.) A comfortable sense of God's love. (2.) A holy
   disposition to serve and please God. The vitality of it lieth in these
   two graces--faith and love; when they are kept up in their height and
   vigour, then it is a life begun. It lieth in the height of faith,
   apprehending and applying God s love to the soul: I live by faith; and
   the height of love swaying and inclining the heart to obedience, 2 Cor.
   v. 14. Therefore they desire God to uphold them, that they might be
   kept in heart and comfort, and in a free inclination to serve him. Now
   when they find any abatement of faith, so that they cannot rejoice in
   the promises as they were wont to do, they count themselves dead; or
   when their inward man doth not delight itself in the law of God, but
   they are dull and slow to good things, they look upon themselves as
   dead. But on the other side, when they find the vigour of this life in
   them, they are merry and glad; when they feel their wonted delight in
   prayer and holy exercises, this is that they mainly prize. That which
   is not seen and felt is as if it were not to their comfort, not to
   their safety.

   Use. To exhort us all to look after this life, and when you have got
   it, to be very chary of it. First, look after this life. You that are
   alienated from the life of God through ignorance and hardness of heart,
   be invited to come to him; it is for life: Job ii. 4, Skin for skin,
   and all a man hath, will he give for his life.' We all desire life;
   vile things that live excel more precious that are dead: A living dog
   is better than a dead lion,' Eccles. ix. 4. A dog was an unclean beast,
   and of all creatures a lion is the most noble and generous. A worm is
   more capable of life than the sun. Now, if life natural be so sweet,
   what is life spiritual? No such life as this; it fits us for communion
   with God and blessed spirits. Christ chideth them, You will not come to
   me that you might have life.' Better you had never lived, if you live
   not this life of grace. When beasts die their misery dieth with them,
   but yours beginneth. Secondly, If you have this life begun, be chary of
   it. If the bodily life be but a little annoyed we complain presently;
   but why are you so stupid and careless, and do not look after this, to
   keep the spiritual life in good plight? Let your prayers and desires be
   to have this life strengthened; make this your prayer, to be
   strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man. A Christian
   maketh this to be his main comfort and his main care. Oh! how busy are
   we to provide for the outward man, that we may be well fed, well
   clothed! Most men's care is for back and belly. Oh! be more careful for
   the inner man; let that be refreshed with the blood of Christ and the
   comforts of the Spirit. Be careful for the soul, that you may keep up a
   lively faith, and a constant sense of blessedness to come, and so
   rejoice in God. Oh! how much time and pains do men waste in decking and
   trimming the body, when in the meantime they neglect their souls! We
   may all fall a-weeping when we consider how little we look after this
   inner life, to keep that in heart and vigour.

SERMON CXXVIII.

   And let me not be ashamed of my hope. Hold thou me up, and I shall be
   safe; and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.--Ver. 116,
   117.

   IN the former verse I observed David begs two things--confirmation in
   waiting, and the full and final accomplishment of his hopes.

   Something remains upon the 116th verse, Let me not be ashamed of my
   hope.' Hope follows faith, and nourisheth it. Faith assures there is a
   promise; hope looks out for the accomplishment of it. Now David, having
   fixed his hope upon the mercies of God, begs, Let me not be ashamed;'
   that is, that hope may not be disappointed, for hope disappointed
   brings shame. Man is conscious of the folly and rashness in conceiving
   such a hope: Job vi. 20, They were confounded, because they had hoped;
   they came thither, and were ashamed.' They looked for water from the
   brooks of Tema, but when they were dried up they were confounded and
   ashamed. That breeds shame when we are frustrated in our expectations.
   There is a hope that will leave us ashamed, and there is another hope
   that will not leave us ashamed; for David goes to God, and desires him
   to accomplish his hope. There is a Christian hope that is founded upon
   the mercies and promises of God, and encouraged by experience of God,
   that will never deceive us. I shall speak of that hope that will bring
   shame and confusion; and that is twofold--worldly hope and carnal
   security.

   1. Worldly hopes, such as are built upon worldly men and worldly
   things. Upon worldly men, they are mutable, and so may deceive us;
   sometimes their minds may change, the favour of man is a deceitful
   thing. As Cardinal Wolsey said in his distress, If I had served God as
   diligently as I have done the king, he would not have given me over in
   my grey hairs; but it is a just reward for my study to do him service,
   not regarding the service of God to do him pleasure: Let God be true,
   and every man a liar.' A man makes way for shame that humours the lusts
   of others and wrongs his conscience; and first or last, they will find
   it is better to put confidence in God than the greatest potentates in
   the world, Ps. cxviii. 8; and therefore it should be our chief care to
   apply ourselves to God, and study his pleasure, rather than to please
   men, and conform ourselves to their uncertain minds and interests. To
   attend God daily, and be at his beck, is a stable happiness; the other
   is a poor thing to build upon. Men's affections are mutable, and so is
   their condition too: Ps. lxii. 9, Surely men of high degree are a lie,
   and men of low degree are vanity.' Whoever trusts in men, high or low,
   are sure to be deceived in their expectations. And therefore we should
   think of it before hand, lest we be left in the dirt when we think they
   should bear us out: 1 Kings i. 21, When my Lord the king shall sleep
   with his fathers, I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders. When
   the scene is shifted, and new actors come upon the stage, none so
   liable to be hated as those that promised to themselves a perpetual
   happiness by the favour of men. This is a hope that will leave us
   ashamed. And then worldly things, they that hope in these for their
   happiness will be ashamed. There are two remarkable seasons when this
   hope leaves us ashamed--in the time of distress of conscience, and in
   the day of death. In time of distress of conscience: Ps. xxxix. 11,
   When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his
   beauty to consume away like a moth.' When sin finds us out, and
   conscience goes to work upon the sense of its own guilt, oh! then what
   will all the plenty of worldly comforts do us good! The creatures then
   have spent their allowance, and can help us no more. What good will an
   estate do? And all the pomp and bravery of the world will be of no more
   use to us than a rich shoe to a gouty foot: Prov. xviii. 14, A wounded
   spirit who can bear?' But now he that hath chosen God for his portion,
   in all distress and calamities can revive his hopes. So also in the
   hour of death: Job xxvii. 8, What is the hope of the hypocrite, though
   he hath gained, when God shall take away his soul?' When God puts the
   bond in suit, though man hath gained, where is his hope, when God
   delivers him over to the executioner, to chains of darkness?

   2. Carnal security will leave us ashamed. Men living in their sins hope
   they shall do well enough, and expect mercy to bear all and pardon all;
   though they be not so strict and nice as others, yet they shall do as
   well as they. This hope is compared to a spider's web, Job viii. 12, a
   poor slight thing, that is gone with the blast of every temptation;
   when the besom comes, both spider and web are swept away. And it is
   said, Job xi. 20, The hope of the wicked is like the giving up of the
   ghost;' and these in a moment take an everlasting farewell of their
   hopes. So their hopes fail in the greatest extremity. This carnal and
   secure hope in God, presumption of his mercy, it is but a waking dream,
   as a dream fills men with vain delusions and phantasms. It is notably
   set out by the prophet, Isa. xxix. 8, They shall even be as when a
   hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul
   is empty.' There will an awakening time come, and then the dream of a
   hungry man torments him more. Carnal men are like dreamers, that lose
   all as soon as they awake; though they dream of enjoying sceptres and
   crowns, yet they are in the midst of bonds and irons. Vain illusions do
   they please themselves with, that make way for eternal sorrow and
   shame.

   Let us see how this false hope of the wicked differs from the true hope
   of God's children.

   1. This hope is not indeed built upon God, God hath the name, but
   indeed they trust upon other things; as those women the prophet speaks
   of, Isa. iv. 1, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel;
   only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.' So they
   call their hope after God's name, but their hearts are borne up with
   other things, as appears; because when outward things fail they are at
   a loss, and begin to awake out of their dream, especially in a
   distressed case when it pincheth hard.

   2. It is not a serious and advised trust, but a slight and superficial
   hope, that grows upon us we know not how, a fruit of ignorance and
   incogitancy; when they are serious they begin to feel it a foolish kind
   of presumption, upon which no account can be given, 1 Peter iii. 15.
   How can they give a reason of their hope? But gracious souls, the more
   they consider their warrant and the promise of God, the more their hope
   is increased.

   3. It is a dead and a cold hope, not a lively hope, 1 Peter i. 3. They
   have no taste, no groans, no ravishing thoughts about the happiness
   which they expect, no strong desires after the thing hoped for: Rom.
   xii. 12, Rejoice in hope,' saith the apostle; they have but cold
   apprehensions of such great things. And the hope that we expect is so
   excellent, that it should stir up the greatest longings, the greatest
   waiting, and put us upon earnest expectation.

   4. It is a weak inconstant hope, a loose fond conjecture, a guess
   rather than a certain expectation: 1 Cor. ix. 26, I therefore so run,
   not as uncertainly,' not at random, but upon sure and solid grounds. A
   child of God hath a due sense of the difficulty, yet withal an
   assurance of the possibility and of the certainty of it; and therefore
   it continues; he presseth on, if it be possible he may attain to his
   great hopes, the resurrection of the dead.

   5. It is a lazy loitering hope. Carnal men would have heaven and
   happiness, but they make no haste towards it, they give no diligence to
   make sure of it; it is but a devout sloth. Whereas he that hath a true
   hope is pressing forward, Phil. iii. 13, and hastening and looking for
   the coming of Christ, 2 Peter iii. 12.

   But then there is a true hope in God, both for final deliverance,
   present support, and present mercy, that will never leave us ashamed:
   Ps. xxii. 5, They that hope in thee are not confounded;' and Ps. xxv.
   2, 3, Let none that wait on thee be ashamed: O my God, I trust in thee,
   let me not be ashamed.' What is a true Christian hope? It may be
   discovered by the grounds of discouragement, but most sensibly by the
   effects.

   1. By it the heart is drawn from earth to heaven, earthly desires and
   hopes abated: Phil. iii. 20, For our conversation is in heaven, whence
   also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.' They live as
   those that within a few days expect to be with God. Christ in heaven
   hath a magnetic virtue to draw up the hearts of believers thither; as a
   man that hath looked steadfastly upon the sun can for a great while see
   nothing else.

   2. By it the heart is enlivened in duty, and quickened with diligence
   in the business of salvation. Hope apprehends the difficulty, as well
   as the excellency and possibility, of salvation; therefore what a man
   truly hopes for in this kind he makes it his business to get it, and
   look after it: Phil. iii. 13, This one thing I do, forgetting those
   things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those which are
   before.' They mind it seriously, and not superficially, by the by.

   3. It engageth the heart against sin, 2 Peter iii. 11. We that look for
   these things, What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy
   conversation and godliness.' Holiness implies purity, and godliness
   dedication to God. Now a false hope is consistent with the reign of
   sin, suffers a man to be vile, carnal, careless, neglectful of God,
   full of malice, envy, pride, but without any serious and solid ground;
   it is but a lying presumption. Now, this hope that is thus fixed upon
   God will never disappoint us. For--

   [1.] The fruition will ever be more than the expectation. God doth for
   us above what we can ask or think, Eph. iii. 20. When the prodigal son
   came and said, Make me as an hired servant,' the father brought forth
   the fatted calf, and put a ring on his finger, &c. Solomon asked
   wisdom, and God gave him riches, honour, and great abundance. But much
   more in the world to come will the fruition be above expectation; for
   prophecy is but in part; we are not now capable to know what we shall
   then enjoy; we have but childish thoughts of things to come, as a child
   comes short of the apprehensions of a man, 1 Cor. xiii. 9-11.

   [2.] This hope cannot be abated with the greatest evil. To a worldly
   man death is the king of terrors, and to a godly man it is his last
   end; though it vanquish his body, it doth not vanquish his soul: Prov.
   xiv. 32, The wicked is driven away in his wickedness, but the righteous
   hath hope in his death.' When other men's hopes vanish, his hopes go
   down with him to the grave, Ps. xvi. 9; as in a bed of ease they shall
   sleep until the waking time.

   Use. Oh! be not deceived with false promises. We must expect blessing
   according to the tenor of the covenant; only things promised, and no
   otherwise than they are promised; temporal things, with a limitation,
   as good for us, and with the exception of the cross; spiritual
   blessings, their essence, rather than degree of grace. And take heed of
   false hope that is, groundless and fruitless. Groundless; the warrant
   of true hope is the word of God: I hope in thy word,' Ps. cxxx. 5. Hope
   that is without a warrant will be without effect. When men please
   themselves, they shall do well enough, contrary to the word of God,
   Deut. xxix. 19. And it is fruitless; it doth not fill the heart with
   gladness, and quicken to holiness, and stir up to walk with God. And
   take heed of false experiences; that is, building upon temporal
   blessings, and bare deliverances out of trouble. Men are not so much
   preserved as reserved to further trouble: many are spared but for a
   time, it is but a reprieve.

   I proceed to the 117th verse, Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and
   I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.' Here observe--(1.)
   A repetition of his request for sustaining grace. (2.) A renewing of
   the promise of obedience conceived before, ver. 115.

   1. A repetition of his request for sustaining grace, Hold thou me up,
   and I shall be safe.' Where observe the request, hold thou me up: and
   the fruit and effect promised to himself, I shall be safe.

   First, The blessing asked, Hold thou me up;' a metaphor taken from
   those that faint, or those that slide and are ready to fall. Secondly,
   The fruit of it, I shall be safe.' Before he had said, Uphold me
   according unto thy word, that I may live;' now he promiseth himself
   more from the divine assistance, safety. By safety he means either the
   safety of the outward or inward man. Why not both? I shall be safe from
   those warpings and apostasy, and all dangers and mischiefs that do
   attend it. Turning aside from our duty doth not procure our safety, but
   perseverance in our duty. God's children, when they have failed, have
   run themselves into much temporal inconveniences, as Josiah ran upon
   his own death by his own folly, 2 Chron. xxxiii. 22.

   2. The resolution of his obedience, that is renewed and promised upon
   obtaining of this mercy. And there take notice--(1.) Of the accuracy of
   that obedience promised, I will have respect unto thy statutes. (2.)
   The constancy of it, continually; not for a moment only, a few days, in
   a pang, or when the mercy is fresh and warm upon the heart, but
   constantly, without intermission, without defection.

   First, Observe from the repeating of the same request:--

   Doct. 1. That sustaining grace must be sought with all earnestness and
   importunity. Uphold me' before, and now again, Hold thou me up, and I
   shall be safe.'

   Reason 1. They that have a due sense of things upon their hearts will
   do so; that is to say, that have a sense of their own weakness, the
   evil of sin, and the comfort of perseverance in obedience.

   1. That have a sense of their own weakness, as David was touched with a
   sense of his own necessity; therefore he repeats this prayer, Hold thou
   me up;' and if David need to be held up, what need have we! If pillars
   are not able to stand of themselves, what shall reeds do? If giants are
   overthrown and vanquished, children much more: Prov. xxviii. 14, Happy
   is the man that feareth always.' How so? With a fear of caution, not a
   fear of distrust; with a fear of reverence, not with a fear of bondage;
   otherwise it were a torture, not a blessedness. That man that is
   sensible of his own frailty is more blessed than other men. Why?
   Because he will ever have recourse to God to set his power a-work for
   the good of his soul: Rom. xi. 20, Be not high-minded, but fear.'
   Though weakness be a misery, yet a sense of it is a degree towards
   blessedness, because it makes way for the great Christian grace, which
   is trust and dependence.

   2. They have a sense of the evil that is in the least sin. This is the
   difference between a tender conscience and a hard heart--one is afraid
   to offend God in the least matter, the other makes nothing of sin, and
   so runneth into mischief, Prov. xxviii. 14. Well, then, a man that hath
   a tender heart is loath to fall into the least sin, he is ever drawing
   to God to be kept from all sin. When we are earnest in this matter, it
   is a sign we are sensible what an evil sin is. Men that side with their
   own lusts and interests may wonder at the frequent requests of the
   Psalmist here--establishment and preservation from sin. But those that
   have a tender conscience are like the eye, soon offended, and make it
   their business to keep it from offence; they are thus solicitous and
   earnest with God to be upheld.

   3. They are sensible of the good of perseverance in obedience. There
   are two things here:--

   [1.] Obedience is good; the more we experiment it, the more we would
   desire to keep it up in an even tenor of close walking with God,
   without interruption, without intermission. God appeals to experience:
   Micah ii. 7, Do not my words do good to him that walketh up rightly?'
   And when men wander they have this experience, Am I a barren
   wilderness?' Micah vi. 3, O my people! what have I done unto thee, and
   wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.' The more we find
   liberty, sweetness, and comfort in the ways of God, the more we should
   desire to continue in them.

   [2.] As obedience is good, so perseverance in obedience is good, for it
   strengthens grace, especially in an hour of temptation, when many make
   defection. The choicest discovery of good men is in bad times: Noah was
   upright in his generation,' Gen. vi. 9; to stand when others decline,
   to be like fish that keeps its freshness in salt water, to hold fast
   there where Satan hath his throne, Rev. ii. 13, and to be faithful, as
   is said of Judah, Hosea xi. 12, when Ephraim compassed me about with
   lies, and the house of Israel with deceit.' It is a comfort and honour
   to persevere with God.

   Reason 2. This sustaining grace must be asked, because God will show
   his sovereignty, that it is not at our beck; it must cost us waiting,
   striving, and earnest and renewed prayer: 2 Cor. xii. 8, For this thing
   I besought the Lord thrice.' God will not answer at the first knock,
   but at the third, then God came in. So Christ; Mat. xxvi. 44, the third
   time he came and repeated the same thing; then, if you compare Luke, he
   received his consolation by an angel. God doth not come at the first
   knock, therefore we must pray again, Uphold me.'

   Reason 3. Without continued influences of grace we cannot be safe,
   therefore they must not be sought once and no more, but daily. As we
   seek daily bread, so we should seek daily grace. The word se'meron,
   this day, hath respect to all the petitions; this day we must have our
   daily bread, this day lead us not into temptation, this day keep us
   from evil. While temptations continue, we must continue prayer. Long
   suits, though often denied, may prevail at length. In short, the
   continuance of strength and assistance from God is necessary to
   preserve both habitual and actual grace, therefore they must be
   continually asked.

   1. To preserve habitual grace, the seed that remains in us. We would
   wonder to see a herb to thrive and grow in the midst of many weeds; so
   that grace should be there where there is so much pride, love of
   pleasure, worldly care and brutish lusts, especially when any of these
   are set a-work by temptations without. The angels and Adam fell when
   there was nothing within to work upon them but the mutability of their
   nature; so when there is so much within to work, and temptations
   without, it is hard to keep grace in the soul.

   2. For the quickening and actual stirrings of the soul to good. We
   should soon faint and tire in the ways that we have begun were it not
   for God's sustaining grace; these sparks would quickly go out, if God
   did not keep them alive. 1 Chron. xxix. 18, when the people were in a
   high point of willingness, Lord, keep this for ever in the imagination
   of the thoughts of the heart of thy people.' When we have gotten any
   good frame of spirit, we cannot preserve it without this continual
   influence.

   Reason 4. Renewed prayer is a means of persevering, not only for it,
   but by it. God keeps us alive in the way of grace, as by the word, so
   by prayer. Praying in the Holy Ghost is one means of establishment,
   Jude 20. Prayer is a solemn preaching to our selves, or a serious
   warming of our souls in our duty in the sight of God. Now means of
   support must be used, not once, but often. There must be constant meals
   for the increase of bodily strength. If a man be never so strong, yet
   he cannot always grow in strength by one meal, there must be new
   refreshment; so this is one means for our preservation, therefore it
   must be often used.

   Use. For reproof of those that ask sustaining grace customarily and
   carelessly, without any deep sense or renewed importunity. We are too
   cold and formal when we say, Lead us not into temptation.'

   1. Consider, none stand but may fall in some degree, and it is our
   business to take heed we do not. Every hour we are in danger either of
   getting some distemper, or letting out some corruption. Of getting some
   distemper, being spotted and defiled in the world, or at least being
   made dull and indisposed in the service of God. Or else of letting out
   some corruptions; if God do not keep our heart and all (Ps. cxli. 3,
   Set a watch, Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips'), how
   soon should we betray our folly! And therefore it is a happy day, and
   we have cause to bless God, when we have not by some words or works of
   ours interrupted our communion with him.

   2. Consider how many things concur to lead us aside, corruptions within
   and temptations without, and, it may be, sometimes the example of
   others that are of esteem in the church. Corruption within, always
   righting against grace--the flesh lusteth against the Spirit; and
   temptations without, the favours and frowns of the world. If these
   things have not, they may befall us, and it is too late to seek armour
   in time of conflict.

   3. And then to see men eminent for knowledge and profession turn back
   from the holy commandment, and glorious stars fall from their orb and
   station; this overturns the faith of many, 2 Tim. ii. 18. So that, all
   these things considered, we cannot stand a moment without God; and
   therefore we should be more earnest with him for grace.

   Doct. 2. The constant safety of God's people lies in sustaining grace.

   1. Negatively; without it we cannot be safe, partly because there are
   so many trials and temptations between us and home, by reason of the
   sleights of the flesh, the cunning of Satan, and oppositions of the
   world; and partly because the measure of grace received is so small:
   Phil. iii. 13, I have not attained;' and the danger of sinning against
   God is so great: Amos iii. 2, You only have I known of all the families
   of the earth; therefore will I punish you for all your iniquities.' So
   that we are no longer safe from sin and punishment than God puts under
   his hand.

   2. Positively; by God's sustaining grace we are kept safe, both as the
   power and faithfulness of God are engaged for our defence.

   [1.] The power of God is engaged: 1 Peter i. 5, Who are kept by the
   power of God through faith unto salvation.' The apostle first speaks of
   heaven, that that is kept for us, and then, presently, you are kept for
   it by the power of God. An earthly inheritance may be sure enough for
   the heir, but who can secure the heir from death and all other
   accidents? But here God provides for our comfort. Not only our
   inheritance is sure, but we are kept. And how doth God keep us? By his
   power. Oh! what greater safety can there be? He can mitigate the
   temptation, or else give a supply of strength; he can keep off trials,
   or support us under them, 1 Cor. x. 13.

   [2.] The faithfulness of God is engaged: 1 Cor. i. 9, God is faithful,
   by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son;' and 2 Thes.
   iii. 3, The Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you
   from evil.' Certainly God is able, but how shall we know that he will
   do it? His truth is laid in pawn for what he hath promised, and
   therefore we may hold up our heads with confidence; and this should
   comfort us against all fears and doubtful and uncertain thoughts.

   Use. Instruction, to show us how constantly God must be sought to in
   prayer, and relied upon in the use of means for our preservation, both
   from sin and danger.

   1. Sought to in prayer. Our strength lies not in ourselves, but in God:
   2 Cor. iii. 5, We are not sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as
   of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.' It is not only of God,
   but in God; there is our treasure kept: 2 Tim. ii. 1, Be strong in the
   grace that is in Christ Jesus;' and Eph. vi. 10, Be strong in the Lord,
   and in the power of his might.' If the stock were in our own hands,
   besides the danger of embezzling it, we should neglect God; as when the
   prodigal son had his portion, he went away from his father. Therefore
   God keeps grace in his own hand, to keep us humble, depending,
   observing, and to have a constant converse with him, that our eyes may
   be to him; as Ps. cxxiii. 2, As the eyes of servants look unto the hand
   of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
   mistress, so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have
   mercy upon us;' that is, as maid and men servants look for their dole
   and portion, their allowance given to them, from their master and
   mistress, so God will still keep us to him. Dependence begets
   observance, to keep up our allegiance to the crown of heaven.

   2. As he must be sought to in prayer, so relied upon in the use of
   means for our preservation. God keeps us, but not without our care and
   diligence. A Christian is said to keep himself, 1 Tim. v. 22; and this
   is pure religion, to keep ourselves unspotted, James i. 27; and 1 John
   v. 18, He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, that the wicked one
   touch him not;' and Jude 21, Keep yourselves in the love of God.' What!
   doth not this detract from all that was spoken before? No; we act with
   subordination and dependence upon him. Our keeping is from him, by him,
   and under him; so we keep ourselves through his blessing upon the use
   of means, which he hath appointed for us to use.

   The third note is taken from the promise of obedience upon the sup
   position of this help from God, Uphold me.' What then? And I will have
   respect unto thy statutes.' Observe--

   Doct. 3. The more experience we have of God's grace in the preserving
   us from sin and danger, the more we should be encouraged in his ways.
   Why so?

   1. Because of the obligation. It is his mercy which requires thank
   fulness. Now gratitude and thankfulness is the true principle which
   should urge us to perform our duty to God. Observe, there are several
   principles which put men upon God's service, some false and rotten,
   some more tolerable, some lawful, some excellent. Some false and
   rotten, as carnal custom. Shall we serve God, say they, as we have
   done? Zech. vii. 3; when men only do as they have done, it is the
   manner of the place, they learn it of their fathers, and so customarily
   worship and serve God. Then vainglory, to be seen of men; that is a
   rotten thing, Mat. vi. Come and see my zeal for the Lord, saith Jehu.
   This may put us upon great seeming zeal and activity. So for profit, to
   make a market of religion; as the pharisees got themselves credit to be
   trusted with widows' estates by their long prayers; these are rotten
   principles. Then some are more tolerable, not so bad principles as the
   former; as when we serve God out of hope of temporal mercy, as when
   they howl upon their beds for corn, wine, and oil, Hosea vii. 4; or for
   fear of temporal judgments, when men hang down their heads like a
   bulrush for a while, or else for mere fear of eternal death, they shall
   else be damned; when men's duties are a sin-offering, a sleepy sop to
   appease an accusing conscience. But then there are some that are
   lawful, good, and sound, as when duties are done out of the impulsion
   of an enlightened conscience, that urgeth them to that which is good;
   or upon the bare command of God, his authority swaying the conscience;
   or when they walk in the ways of God out of the consideration of the
   reward to come, a respect to heaven; this is very good in its place.
   Again, there are some excellent principles of grace, and which do most
   of all discover a gospel spirit, a well-tempered frame of soul to God,
   and these are love to God because of his benefits and love to us,
   gratitude, and thankfulness: 1 John iv. 19, We love him because he
   first loved us;' and Rom. xii. 1, I beseech you by the mercies of God;'
   when we serve him out of love. Again, when we serve him out of delight,
   out of love to the duty, find such a complacency in the work that we
   love the work for the work's sake; as David, I love thy law because it
   is pure;' when we love the law for the purity of it; or when the glory
   of God prevails above all our own interests; or when the promises and
   covenant of God enabling of us; that is our principle, Heb. x. 16. I
   observe this, men usually are brought on from one sort of principle to
   another; from sinful principles they are brought to tolerable and
   lawful, and from lawful to those that are rare and excellent.

   2. This is such a mercy as gives us hope of more mercy in that kind. If
   God hath held us up, and we have been safe hitherto, then we may say,
   Thou hast held me up. We may look for more; new temptation will bring
   new strength, every day's work will bring its own refreshment. God, by
   giving, binds himself more to give, for he loves to crown his own work.
   When he hath done good, he will do good again: Zech. iii. 2, Is not
   this a brand plucked out of the fire?' He hath saved us, and he will
   save us. And it holds good sometimes in temporal mercies: 2 Cor. i. 10,
   He hath delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver.' But
   especially it holds good in spiritual mercies: 2 Tim. iv. 17, 18, He
   hath delivered me out of the mouth of the lion. And the Lord shall
   deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly
   kingdom.' One act of mercy gives us more. God, that hath begun, will
   make an end; he that hath kept me will keep me.

   Use. It serves to reprove two sorts of people:--

   1. Those that are unthankful after their deliverance. We forget his
   care of us, and never think how much we owe to him. When the mariners
   have gotten to the haven and harbour, they forget the tem pest; so
   these forget how God stood by them in the temptation and conflict; they
   do not abound more in the work of the Lord. These are like those that
   would have deliverance, that thorns might be taken out of the way, that
   they might run more readily to that which is evil.

   2. It reproveth those that faint and despond in God's ways, after much
   experiences of his help and presence with them. The Israelites in the
   wilderness, upon every new difficulty their faith is at a loss, and
   then back again to Egypt they would go; though they had so often
   experience of God, they would not believe him because of his wonders,
   but forgat his works and his wonders that he had showed them,' Ps.
   lxxviii. 11. God had given them wonderful mercy in destroying Pharaoh,
   that it might be meat to their faith, yet they believed not. Good David
   was ready to say, I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul,' 1 Sam.
   xxvii. 1, though he had experience upon experience. We should rather
   encourage ourselves, and go on in our work notwithstanding all
   difficulties.

   The last point, from the accuracy and constancy of his obedience, I
   will have respect unto thy statutes continually.' This phrase is
   diversely rendered. The Septuagint renders it, I will exercise myself
   in them, or apply my heart to them. David's regard to God's law is
   diversely expressed in this psalm.

   Doct. 4. God's precepts must be respected and consulted with as the
   constant measure and direction of our lives.

   Not only respect, but continual respect: Gal. vi. 16, As many as walk
   according to this rule;' it notes as many as shall walk in rank and
   order: there needeth great accurateness and intension, that we may keep
   within the bounds of commanded duty. So walk circumspectly. Some men
   are so crafty through their self-deceiving hearts, through their lusts
   and interests, so doubtful, that there needs a great exactness, and so
   apt to be turned out of the way, that we need a great deal of care to
   look to the fountain and principle of our actions, to look to the
   matter, manner, end, and weigh all circumstances that we may serve God
   exactly.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXXIX.

   Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their
   deceit is falsehood.--Ver. 118.

   IN the former verse, the man of God had begged establishment in the
   ways of God; and now, as a help to what he had prayed for, he ob serves
   God's judgments on those that err from them. It is a special means to
   preserve us from sin to observe how mischievous it hath been to those
   that close with it. So the prophet here, I will have respect to thy
   statutes.' Why? Thou hast trodden down them that err from thy
   statutes.' By this means we learn to be wise at other men's costs, and
   are whipped upon others' backs: Zeph. iii. 6, 7, I have cut off the
   nations: their towers are made desolate, their cities are destroyed;
   there is none inhabitant: I said, Surely thou wilt fear me,' &c. God is
   very much disappointed if we be not bettered and improved by his
   judgments. Exemplo qui peccat, bis peccat. He that would plunge himself
   into a quagmire where others have miscarried before, sins doubly,
   because he neither fears threatenings, nor would take warning by their
   example. God looks to be the more reverenced for every warning he gives
   us in his providence, because then what was before matter of faith is
   made matter of sense, and needs only a little application. Thus it will
   be with me if I should straggle from God, and go contrary to his
   direction: Isa. xxvi. 9, When thy judgments are in the earth, the
   inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.' We need not doubt
   any more whether God will punish the disobedient, when we see his
   threatenings made good; only we should reflect upon our hearts: And
   will not God visit my transgression if I should go on breaking his
   laws? And what should hinder making such application? Are not all
   sinners alike to God? Christ tells us, Ye shall all likewise perish
   except ye repent,' Luke xiii. 5. They contented themselves to censure
   those on whom the tower of Siloam fell. The desert of sin is the same,
   and God's justice as exact as ever; therefore, if others are punished,
   why not we? We are strangely stupid if we do not walk more exactly with
   God. This use David maketh of it. Whether it were a judgment past, or a
   judgment expected in faith, this deterred him from doing as they did:
   Thou hast trodden down them that err from thy statutes.' In the words
   observe--

   1. An account of God's judgments upon wicked men, Thou hast trodden
   down them that err from thy statutes.'

   2. The reason given of that dispensation, For their deceit is
   falsehood.'

   First, In the first place observe--

   1. The notion by which the judgment is expressed, thou hast trodden
   down.

   2. The persons described upon whom this judgment hath lighted, or shall
   light, them that err from thy statutes.

   3. The note of universality, all, of what estate or condition soever
   they be.

   From the first of these observe--

   Doct. Those that proudly err from God's statutes, God can, hath, and
   will soon pull them down with ignominy and contempt.

   This point will be made good if we consider--

   1. The persons described.

   2. The notion by which judgment is expressed.

   3. Something concerning the certainty of this judgment.

   1. The persons described, Them that err from thy statutes.' Some err
   out of weakness, and some out of pride and obstinacy. (1.) To err out
   of weakness, to wander in by-paths of our own, is not safe: Ps. cxxv.
   2, As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall
   lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.' Men that do not sin out
   of malice, but are discouraged by the rod of the wicked resting upon
   the lot of the righteous, ver. 3; therefore think to shift for
   themselves by their own compliances, counsels, and crooked courses, God
   will deal with them as with his open enemies. (2.) Proudly to exalt
   ourselves against God, and trample his interest under foot, will bring
   sure judgment: Ps. cxix. 21, Thou hast rebuked the proud that are
   cursed, which do err from thy commandments.' Of such the text speaks,
   those that oppose themselves against God, and bear themselves high in
   sinful courses, upon account of their prosperity.

   2. The notion by which the judgment is expressed, Thou hast trodden
   down.' The Septuagint exoude'nosas, ad nihil deduxisti, thou hast
   brought to nothing; Acquila, confixisti, thou hast stricken through;
   Symmachus, ape'lenxas, reprobasti, thou hast disproved; the vulgar,
   sprevisti, thou hast contemned; Apollinarius, athe'rixas, parvi
   pependisti, thou hast little esteemed: all to the same purpose. The
   phrase of treading under foot, used by us, implies--(1.) A full
   punishment; (2.) A disgraceful one.

   [1.] A full punishment. God will pull them down from their altitudes,
   even to the dust, though never so high and proudly exalting themselves
   against God. A full conquest of enemies is thus often expressed in
   scripture: Isa. x. 6, the Assyrian is said to take the prey, and to
   tread them down like mire in the streets;' so Micah vii. 10, the same
   expression, when an adversary is laid even with the ground, that he may
   be crushed and trampled upon, as Jehu trode Jezebel under foot, 2 Kings
   ix. 32; and Isa. xxvi. 6, The feet of the poor shall tread it down,
   even the steps of the needy.' So the utter and final overthrow of Satan
   is expressed, Rom. xvi. 20, He shall tread Satan under his feet.'

   [2.] It implies a disgraceful punishment: Ps. cx. 1, Until I make thine
   enemies thy footstool;' an expression to show the ignominy and contempt
   God will put upon them. Christ keeps his sheep in his hands, John x.
   28, his lambs in his bosom, Isa. xl. 11, and his enemies under his
   feet, Josh. x. 24. When he vanquished the Canaanitish kings, Come
   near,' saith he to his captains; put your feet upon the necks of these
   kings.' Thus Sapores the king of Persia trampled upon Valentinian the
   emperor, and Tamberlane made Bajazet his footstool. The meaning is, God
   will not only bring them under, but reduce them to an abject and
   contemptible condition. So Chrysostom on the text expoundeth this
   phrase, that God will make them eponeidi'stous, kai` katagela'stous,
   ignominious and contemptible. They shall not go off honourably, but
   with scorn and confusion of face, miserably broken.

   3. The certainty of this judgment, that he can, hath, and will do so.

   [1.] He can do so, though they be fortified with never so many
   advantages, for what is too hard for God who made all things? It is
   easier, we know, to destroy than to build up things. Things long
   a-building may be destroyed in a moment; and therefore, God, that made
   them, can destroy them: Isa. xxvii. 4, Who would set the briers and
   thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them
   together.' Briers and thorns are matter to feed the fire, not to quench
   it. We want faith in the power of God, and therefore we are dismayed
   when we see wicked men great and high.

   [2.] He hath done so, notwithstanding their greatness and proud
   attempts. That is the Psalmist's expression here; God hath already
   trodden down many such persons, and hath decreed to tread down all. Of
   that sort the prophet speaks as a thing already done, either in way of
   faith, or in part of sense, as begun to be executed: Amos ii. 9, I
   destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of
   the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit
   from above, and his roots from beneath.' Potent and mighty enemies, if
   they stand in the way of his people's mercies, God can pluck them up,
   root and branch. When Pharaoh advanced himself against the people of
   God, God trod him down, and flung him into the bottom of the sea. So
   the Psalmist tells us, Ps. cxxxv. 10, He smote great nations, and slew
   mighty kings for their sakes, all the kingdoms of Canaan, and gave
   their land for an heritage unto Israel his people.' God will show what
   respect he hath to his people; therefore, when he ariseth to avenge
   their quarrel, nothing shall be able to stand before him.

   [3.] He will do so, tread them down all.

   (1.) Because of his invariable justice: God is but one,' Gal. iii. 20;
   that is, one always consonant unto himself, what he hath done he will
   do; his justice is the same that ever it was, and his power the same;
   and therefore in all his dispensations he is one; that is, ever like
   himself, is as ready to take vengeance on the insolences of men now as
   before, and keepeth a proportion in his proceedings: he is of one mind,
   and who can turn him?

   (2.) Because of the suitableness between judgment and sin. They trample
   all that is holy and sacred under their feet, therefore God treadeth
   them under foot; they despise God, therefore are despised, 1 Sam. ii.
   30; they trample upon the grace of God in Christ, therefore are said,
   Heb. x. 29, to tread the blood of the covenant under foot;' they
   trample upon the law of God: Amos ii. 4, I will not turn away the
   punishment there of, because they have despised my law;' they trample
   upon all godly admonitions and reproofs: Mat. vii. 6, Cast not your
   pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn
   again and rend you;' and they trample the servants of God under foot,
   and make his saints bow down for them to go over, Isa. li. 23; and
   therefore are they themselves trodden under foot. They despised God,
   and he therefore despiseth them, and poureth contempt upon them; and
   the more they esteem themselves, of the less reckoning are they with
   God.

   (3.) For the undeceiving the world, who usually look to sensible
   things. While their ways are prosperous, we make another manner of
   judgment upon them than we do when they are under contempt and
   disgrace: Mal. iii. 15, We call the proud happy; yea they that work
   wickedness are set up, and they that tempt God are even delivered.' We
   dote too much upon outward things, insomuch that things wicked, if
   prosperous, seem good and holy. Our affections bribe our judgments, and
   those things that we would otherwise loathe have a fair gloss and
   varnish put upon them. It is a mighty temptation, even to good men, and
   they begin to have other thoughts of things when to appearance they are
   befriended by God's providence and succeed beyond expectation;
   therefore God will tread them down.

   (4.) To undeceive sinners themselves, that are hardened by their own
   prosperity and success, and make God's providence and forbearing
   punishment to be an approbation of their actions against his law. So
   Ps. l. 21, These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
   thoughtest I was altogether such an one as thyself, but I will reprove
   thee.' God may for a long time endure very horrible provocations
   without any act or mark of vengeance, till sinners flatter themselves
   that the things they do are pleasing to God; but they shall find they
   have erred when they read their sins in their punishment: Mal. ii. 9,
   Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the
   people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in
   the law.' The great God aims at the repentance of men, both in his
   forbearance and his punishment. In his forbearance: Rom. ii. 4, Not
   knowing that the forbearance of God leadeth to repentance.' He is
   pleased to suffer them that offend him grievously to taste the goodness
   of his providence, and have their turn in this world's felicity, to see
   if that will better them; if not, then he poureth contempt and shame
   upon them, that by his frowns he may further their conviction. When
   prosperity is a temptation, God will change the dispensation, and
   instead of general favour and respect, they meet with shame and
   disestimation and disgrace. This is the punishment of those that are
   partial in his law. It is true this is not to be taken singly without
   the foregoing provocation. It was the lot of Christ and his prophets
   and apostles to be disrespected in a wicked world, and such a trial may
   befall his faithful messengers. Yet when this is the fruit of foregoing
   unfaithfulness, and men that had nothing to commend them to the world
   but their height and grandeur, that only had a testimony in men's
   carnal affections because of their greatness, and not a testimony in
   men's consciences because of their purity and holiness and good fruits,
   as good men have been in the consciences of those that hate them, it is
   to them a judgment. But, however, when those that in the main are
   faithful are by a righteous providence exposed to ignominy and
   contempt, they ought the more to search their ways, and to see whether
   they have been throughout with God in the conscience of their duty to
   him, and whether some neglect and partiality of theirs hath not brought
   this judgment upon them.

   (5.) To give a check to the insolency of men who abuse their power, and
   think they may do what they please when they have no hindrance and rub
   in the way: Micah ii. 1, They do evil because it is in the power of
   their hands.' Restraints of conscience prevail not with many, but only
   restraints of providence. It is no thanks to them if they are not worse
   than they are; it is not because they want will, but because they want
   power. Therefore God cuts them short, and treads them down like mire.

   Use 1. A warning to them that are in prosperity, that they do not carry
   it proudly against God, his ways and people. God hath unhorsed many
   that have held their heads very high; therefore let none presume to do
   evil because they are high and exalted. There is a foolish and mad
   confidence which wicked men have in their prosperity, as if they were
   above the reach of providence, and therefore abuse their greatness to
   contempt and oppression. When men are up they know nothing moderate.
   Former judgments upon the proud and disobedient, that contemn God, his
   people and ways, should a little check them. God, that hath scattered
   the proud in the imagination of their hearts, Luke i. 51, can do it
   again, and will, when men will not take warning. As Nazianzen, when his
   heart was like to be corrupted and grow wanton with ease and
   prosperity, I thought, saith he, of reading the Lamentations of
   Jeremiah, and of the doleful condition of the church in former times.
   This means he took to reduce himself to a holy sobriety. This is the
   thing God aimed at in the ceremonial law. In the thank-offerings,
   leavened bread was required, which was allowed in no other sacrifice;
   thereby showing we should not so surfeit and run riot with our mercies
   as to forget the bitterness of former afflictions, together with the
   causes of them.

   Use 2. Not to be dismayed at the prosperity of the wicked, so as to be
   troubled either about your own persons, or about the cause of God, or
   to cry up a confederacy with them that err from God's statutes when
   uppermost. Wicked men are here supposed to be in power, height, and
   pride of spirit; but God treadeth them down: and to be full of craft
   and subtlety; but their deceit is falsehood; that is, for all their
   might and subtlety, they are not able to resist God. David was shaken
   with this trial, when evil men were great flourished in wealth and
   authority, Ps. lxxiii. 17; but how doth he settle his heart? I went
   into the sanctuary, and there I understood their end.' When we look to
   the end of things, that will settle us; but when we see God's work by
   halves, we miscarry: we make another judgment when we see God's work
   brought to perfection than we did when we only saw the beginning of it.
   Therefore let us not be altogether dismayed; a little faith will help
   us against the temptations from sense. When the Lord shall have tried
   and humbled his people, then the cup is put into the hand of the
   wicked, and God will throw them down from the seat of their arrogancy,
   and trample upon them like dust. What should hinder? Cannot God do it,
   or will he not? Cannot he do it? Yes; very easily. Poor earthen vessels
   that oppose him, they do but dash themselves against a rock, they do
   but break themselves in pieces; all attempts are nothing; God will
   laugh them to scorn. Or else will he not do it? Doth not he hate sin as
   much as before, or love his people as much as ever? What God punisheth
   in one he punisheth in all, if repentance prevent not; he oweth them a
   shame, therefore will pour contempt and disgrace upon those that
   dishonour him, Ps. liii. 5. It might soon be known what will become of
   them, if you would but awaken faith; you may look upon it as a thing
   accomplished already: he shall tread down all iniquity under his feet,
   Mal. iv. 3.

   Use 3. Observe the judgments upon those that err from God's statutes,
   that we may fear before the Lord, and believe in him, and learn to obey
   his statutes. David trembled to see Uzzah smitten, 2 Sam. vi. 7, 8; so
   should we when God revenges the quarrel of any commandment. Examples of
   judgments are lively instances, and are apt to strike deep upon the
   heart. Therefore, when we read or hear or see any of these, we should
   look upon it as a warning piece let off from heaven to warn us not to
   sin after the similitude of their transgression. God comes to speak to
   us in the language of sense; when we cannot understand by faith, he
   makes good his threatenings. The unbelieving Israelites were destroyed,
   Jude 5; Aaron's sons for offering strange fire were consumed, Lev. x.;
   Uzzah for touching the ark; Lot's wife for looking back turned into a
   pillar of salt; therefore it is said, Remember Lot's wife,' Luke xvii.
   32. So in every age there are remarkable judgments, how God treads down
   those that err from his statutes; which should be observed, not to
   censure others, but for our own caution.

   But now, because men are apt to misapply providence by a malicious
   interpretation, and to make perverse judgments of the sins of others, I
   shall give you some rules how you may avoid censure on the one hand,
   yet not hinder profit on the other.

   1. It is certain God's judgments upon others must be observed: Jer.
   vii. 12, Go unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at
   the first, and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my people
   Israel;' Amos vi. 2, Pass ye to Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye
   to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they
   better than these kingdoms?' It is stupidness not to take notice of
   God's hand. Providence is a comment upon the word of God, written many
   times in blood, and those that will not observe it shall feel it.
   Remember Lot's wife.' One observeth upon those words, Lege historiam,
   nefias liistoria--observe the instances of God's wrath upon others,
   lest thou be made an instance thyself. Some times God meets with this
   sinner, sometimes that; any that will go on in a way of sin and
   disobedience against God.

   2. This observation must be to a good end; not to censure others, for
   that is malice: to speak even to the grief of those whom God hath
   wounded, this is condemned, as enemies did of the people of God in
   their affliction, Jer. l. 7. Neither must we do it to justify
   ourselves; that is pride and self-conceit, condemned Luke xiii. 5,
   Except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish;' but for instruction,
   that we may fear for ourselves: Zeph. iii. 7, Surely now thou shalt
   fear me.' And that we may be cautioned against the like sins, that we
   may see what an evil and bitter thing it is to forsake the Lord, Jer.
   ii. 19; and that we may admire the Lord's mercy to us, that we are not
   set out as marks of his vengeance, that we are not in their condition,
   Amos vi. 2; that we may give to the Lord the glory of his mercy,
   justice, and truth. Take one place for all: Rom. xi. 22, there the
   apostle doth sum up all these three, that we might not boast ourselves
   over others, that we may admire the justice of God, and mercy to us-
   ward, and may learn to fear him, and walk cautiously and humbly with
   him, lest we' contract the like judgment upon ourselves.

   3. In making the observation, there must be care that we do not make
   providence speak a language which it owneth not, the language of our
   fancies, and pry into God's counsels without warrant.

   [1.] When you come to observe judgment, there must be a due reasoning
   from the provocation to the judgment, but not e contra, not judge of
   the wickedness of the person by the affliction of the person. The
   barbarians showed little reason, and less charity, in misconstruing the
   passage of the viper fastening upon St Paul's hand, Acts xxviii. 4. The
   foregoing provocation must be evident before we interpret the judgment
   The dispensations of God's providence are common, and fall alike to
   good and bad, Eccles. ix. 2. God by a sudden stroke may take off the
   godly as well as the wicked. Good Eli broke his neck, 1 Sam. iv. 18,
   and Josiah died in the army in the same manner that Ahab did, by an
   arrow in battle after he disguised himself, 1 Chron. xxxv. 23.
   Therefore do not reason from the stroke of God. Shimei misinterpreted
   David's afflictions: 2 Sam. xvi. 7, 8, Come out, thou bloody man, and
   thou man of Belial; the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of
   the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the Lord hath
   delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son.' Job's friends
   thought him a hypocrite because God smote him with boils and sores. The
   best of God's children may suffer greatly from his hand; but the
   judgment must not make you conclude a sin, but the foregoing sin must
   make you interpret it to be a judgment.

   [2.] When the sin is written upon the judgment, and there are some
   remarkable circumstances wherein the sin and the judgment meet; as
   Judges i. 7, Adonibezek, as he served his vanquished enemies, so was he
   served himself, his thumbs and toes cut off. God's retaliation is very
   notable. Many judgments have a signature upon them, as many herbs in
   nature have a signature to show for what use they serve: Obad. 15, As
   thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy reward shall return
   upon thine own head.' When God payeth men home in their own coin--Gen.
   ix. 6, Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed--it
   is not only a law, what ought to be done in justice, but a rule of
   providence, what shall be done. Pharaoh was the author of the execution
   in drowning the Israelites' children, so Pharaoh and all his host, his
   nobility and men of war, were drowned in the sea. Ahab's blood was
   licked up with dogs in the place where they licked up the blood of
   Naboth. Jezebel was more guilty than he; Ahab permitted it, but Jezebel
   contrived it; Ahab humbled himself, therefore his body was buried, but
   Jezebel was entombed in the bellies of dogs. Haman was hanged on the
   gallows set up for Mordecai. Henry III. of France was killed in the
   same chamber where the massacre was contrived. Charles IX. flowed with
   blood in his bed. Thus God will requite men in the same kind. His own
   people meet with this. Jacob supplanted his elder brother, and
   therefore the elder is brought to him instead of the younger. Asa put
   the prophet in the stocks, and he was diseased in his feet. Joseph's
   brethren were not flexible to his request; afterwards, when they were
   in extremity, Joseph proves inexorable to them: Gen. xlii. 21, We are
   verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his
   soul when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this
   distress come upon us.' How comes this into their minds? This was many
   years after the fact was committed, some twenty years as they computed.
   So God deals with his children in like manner as they dealt with
   others, that their consciences may work the more kindly. The same is
   observed concerning David and Absalom, 2 Sam. xii. 10-12. He took the
   wife of Uriah to be his wife, and Absalom took his wives before his
   eyes. St Paul consented to the stoning of Stephen, and assisted in the
   execution, They laid down their garments at his feet;' therefore,
   afterwards, Paul himself for preaching the gospel is stoned and left
   for dead, Acts xiv. 19, 20. Barnabas was not stoned, that assisted
   Paul; both were alike offensive to the men of Iconium in preaching the
   gospel. Paul was sensible of this as a great part of his guilt, Acts,
   xxii. 20, and his conscience works upon that. Many other instances
   might be given, but this is enough.

   [3.] When judgments fall upon them in the very act of their
   provocation. Thus many are taken away by a violent death in the very
   heat of their drunkenness. Zimri and Cozbi lost their lives in the very
   instant when they were unloading their lusts, and many times we see
   punishment treads upon the heels of sin.

   [4.] When they are authors of their own destruction. Not only in such a
   sensible manner as Saul, Achitophel, and Judas, that murdered
   themselves; but thus, when men are given up to their headlong counsels,
   to break themselves: Prov. v. 22, His own iniquities shall take the
   wicked himself, and he shall be hoi den with the cords of his sins.'
   Wicked men are often whipped with their own rods; and Ps. ix. 15,16, In
   the net which they hid, is their own foot taken. The Lord is known by
   the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of
   his own hands. Higgajon, Selah.' When by their own errors, mistakes,
   and furious passions they undo themselves.

   [5.] When evil men are brought down, wonderfully, suddenly, contrary to
   all apparent likelihood and the course of second causes: Ps. lxiv. 7,
   God shall shoot at them with an arrow, suddenly shall they be wounded;
   so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves.' And Ps.
   lviii. 7, unto the 11th verse, there is this consolation given to the
   church, that enemies shall be destroyed before the pots feel the
   thorns. When they are contriving and boiling somewhat in their minds,
   before the pots feel the thorns, God takes them away suddenly in an
   instant, and then men shall say, Verily there is a rewarder of evil.

   [6.] When God's judgments are executed by unlikely means and
   instruments. Sisera, a great captain, destroyed by Jael, Judges iv. 21;
   Adrian the pope strangled by a gnat; Arius voiding his bowels in a
   draught after his perjury; Cora, Dathan, and Abiram, when the earth
   clave to receive them that had made a rent in the congregation; and
   Herod was eaten up with the lice.

   [7.] When such accidents bring a great deal of glory to God, and peace
   and tranquillity to his people; as hanging Haman with his sons upon his
   own gallows, Esther vii. 9, and viii. 17.

   [8.] When God supplies the defects of man's justice, and their iniquity
   finds them out, when they think all is forgotten, and shall be no more
   heard of: Ps. ix. 12, When he maketh inquisition for blood, he
   remembereth them; he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.' There are
   many instances how God finds out men that seem to escape well enough
   from man's hands, when they could not be found out by man. Zeph. iii.
   5, the prophet tells us, Every morning he will bring his judgments to
   light.' There is some sinner or other which God notably punisheth, that
   men may own his providence.

   [9.] When the word kata` to` reto`n, in the express letter, is made
   good upon men: Hosea vii. 12, I will chastise them, as their
   congregation hath heard.' The word doth fully take effect, and what
   they would not believe they are made to feel. By these rules we may
   observe God's judgments with profit. To quicken you to do so,
   consider--

   (1.) It would be a mighty cure to atheism. There are a sort of men
   settled on their lees, that say in their heart, The Lord will not do
   good, neither will he do evil,' Zeph. i. 12; that think God is so shut
   up within the curtain of the heavens, that he takes no notice of what
   is done below. These vain conceits would soon vanish if men would but
   turn students in God's providence; they would soon cry out, Verily
   there is a reward for the righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth
   in the earth: they would say, There is a ruler of the affairs of the
   world, and a righteous judge that takes care of all things here below.
   Usually men think amiss of God, as if, good and evil were of no respect
   with him, but all things were governed by chance; as Job's wife said,
   Dost thou yet retain thy integrity? Curse God and die.' Mal. ii. 12, Ye
   have wearied the Lord with your words, yet ye say, Wherein have we
   wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the
   sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of
   judgment?' We do not see his justice, and so have atheistical and evil
   conceits of God. When we fancy evil men are in esteem, and the good
   neglected and despised, it is a temptation to men to think there is no
   providence--no God. So when the nocent are prosperous, and the good
   vexed with all manner of displeasure; as Claudian the poet much doubted
   whether there were any such thing as providence, that had a care of
   sublunary things; but at length, when he saw Ruffinus was only lifted
   up that his fall might be the greater, then he no more calls in
   question God's providence, or taxes him of indifferency to good and
   evil.

   (2.) It will be a notable curb and awe upon us to keep us from sin; for
   all these things befall them for our learning. It is our stupid
   incogitancy when God puts these examples before our eyes, and we are
   not affected with them, and so are of little use to us: Josh. ix. 3,
   When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and to
   Ai,' they were wiser than we; they did not expect the coming of Joshua,
   but sent messengers to meet him and strike up a covenant with him. Or
   as that captain that came to Elijah, 2 Kings i. 13, when two captains
   were destroyed with their fifties, he comes and desires the prophet to
   spare his life, and that those he brought with him might be dear and
   precious in his eyes. As he did, so should we. God hath smitten this
   and that for sin; we should the more humble ourselves, and desire terms
   of grace; but our blindness and stupidness is such that we are not
   moved with God's judgments on others to look to the state of our souls:
   Prov. xxii. 3, The wise man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself, but
   the fool goeth on and is punished.'

   Secondly, I come now to the reason rendered, For their deceit is
   falsehood.' The Septuagint hath on o'ti a'dikon to` enthu'mema
   auton--thou hast despised all those that err from thy statutes, for
   their thought is unjust. But to open the words. These two notions,
   deceit and falsehood, sometimes are taken for the vanity of outward
   things, the disappointment of trust; for by an ill-built trust a man
   deceives himself, and his hopes prove false; and sometimes they are put
   for craft, guile, and hypocrisy. Now, according to these different
   acceptions of the word, diverse senses are given. (1.) Some think these
   words relate to the disappointment of their trust. Thus their
   confidences wherein they trust will deceive them at last, and be found
   falsehood. Certain it is that carnal men have many imaginations and
   carnal confidences wherein they flatter themselves, and hope to avoid
   their appointed judgments, which prove in the conclusion but lying
   vanities. If this were the sense, that at length it shall appear how
   deceitful their trust is, then it concerns us to see to our trust, to
   see what in probability these confidences might he whereby they deceive
   their own souls. Is it their greatness and present height? This
   deceiveth them when they are brought down wonderfully, Isa. xiv. 12-16.
   Or is it meant of their devices and witty counsels wherein they trust?
   But their subtle devices fail, and they are often taken in the snares
   they laid for others: Isa. xxix. 14, The wisdom of the wise men shall
   perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall be hidden.' All
   their craft will do them no good; all their cunning and policy, by
   which they hope to fortify and defend themselves and prevent their
   ruin, shall come to nought. Or they do not get that by their deceit
   which they hope for; though they have many methods and stratagems to
   circumvent the people of God, yet they shall prove but vain. (2.) Most
   simply it seemeth to be taken for hypocrisy and guile of spirit,
   manifested either in shows of piety or any guileful course, whereby
   they would under mine others; for this reason God will bring them down.

   Doct. All fraudulency and hypocrisy is hateful to God, therefore he
   will sooner or later discover and destroy those that practise it.

   Fraudulency is twofold:--

   1. Either falsehood in ordinary commerce, lying or treacherous imposing
   on the simplicity of upright and honest men. Most men's wisdom and
   policy lies in their falsehood and deceitfulness; but this shall be
   manifested, and whilst they think to deceive others, they shall be
   deceived themselves, Job v. 13, and be taken in their own snares; and
   whilst they seek to ruin and undermine others, they are ruined and
   undermined themselves. Or--

   2. There is another sort of fraudulency, pretences of piety, whereby
   such men deceive the world. Now this deceit is threefold either the
   deceit of the heretic and erroneous person, or the formalist and
   supertitious person, or the deceit of those that pretend to be truly
   religious. All these cheats put upon the world shall not long hold.

   [1.] The cheat of erroneous persons and heretical seducers, who, under
   a fair mask and plausible appearance, carry on such designs as prove
   troublesome and noxious to the church of God. Though for a while they
   carry great sway under colour of a godly life, yet at length God will
   tread them to dust and nothing, and then all will be counted but
   deceit. The deceit of heretical seducers is often spoken of in
   scripture: Rev. ii. 9, I know the blasphemy of them which say they are
   Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan;' and 1 Tim. iii. 5,
   9, But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest
   unto all men.' When, under a form of godliness, they carry on a
   horrible design unto the great disturbance of the church, of the
   kingdom and commonwealth, the day shall declare it, 1 Cor. iii. 13; God
   will bring them down.

   [2.] There is the deceit of superstitious persons and formalists, who
   seem to be devout, and have great zeal for outward things, not
   commanded by God; such make a fair show in the flesh,' Gal. vi. 12, by
   observing outward and carnal rites, as circumcision, difference of
   meats, legal purifications; all their religion is but a vain show, to
   be guile a loose conscience. This same sort of men are again described
   to be those that speak lies in hypocrisy,' 1 Tim. iv. 7. These also do
   in time discover the folly of their way, manifested by some notable
   judgment; for these things take not hold of men's consciences, but only
   of their affections; and when public countenance is gone, they are of
   no more esteem.

   [3.] There is the deceit of those that only pretend to be truly
   religions, and are not so; and because false and counterfeit, they are
   hateful and abominable to God. Now these God will not only punish in
   the other world: Mat. xxiv. 51, He shall appoint him his portion with
   the hypocrites;' hell seems to be their freehold and patrimony; but
   here, sooner or later, God will pluck off these vizards, and bring
   disappointment and ruin upon these deceivers: Prov. xxvi. 26, the
   hypocrite shall be discovered before the congregation. Things that are
   counterfeit and false do not long hold out. God will discover them,
   either by some trying judgment, as he that builds upon the sand, when
   the winds blow and beat upon the house, down it falls. Earthen vessels,
   when they come to be scoured, the varnish and paint wears off. Or by
   some scandalous fall, for that which is lame will soon be turned out of
   the way,' Heb. xii. 13. This deceitfulness--

   (1.) Is contrary to God, who is a God of truth, Ps. xxxi. 5; the author
   of truth: Eph. iv. 24, Created after God in righteousness and true
   holiness;' and a lover of truth: Ps. li. 3, Thou desirest truth in the
   inward parts.' So that it is a great affront to God when men deal
   falsely: Jer. v. 3, O Lord, are not thine eyes upon the truth?' Is not
   that the thing thou lookest after in all the works of men? This is all
   in all with God.

   (2.) It is contrary to justice, charity, and common ingenuity; it
   destroys the commerce between man and man: Eph. iv. 25, Put away lying,
   speak every man truth with his neighbour; for ye are members one of
   another.' It is unnatural and monstrous by lying and deceit to
   circumvent one another; it is as for one part of the body to destroy
   another. It is a sin not only unseemly for a Christian, but it tends to
   the overthrow of all human society, fidelity and mutual trust being the
   ground of all commerce. Now God will pour out his judgments upon them.

   Use. Let this teach us to carry it sincerely both to God and men, for
   craft will not always succeed. The more real worth in any, the more
   openly and fairly they carry it. But for motives.

   1. You will never else have true solid comfort, until you are real,
   without dissembling before God and men: 2 Cor. i. 12, For our rejoicing
   is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly
   sincerity, not with guile and fleshly wisdom, we have had our
   conversation in the world.' Truth breeds joy and comfort of heart when
   a man is sincere and acts according to his conscience.

   2. You will never hold out without it; your mask will fall off: James
   i. 8, The double-minded man is unstable in all his ways;; wavering,
   inconstant, up and down, off and on with God. A hypocrite is compared
   to a rush that grows in the mire, Job viii. 12; pluck it up, it soon
   withers: they are like reeds shaken with every wind. And you can have
   no approbation and acceptation with God; God likes those that are
   sincere: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.' Who
   are those who have pardon of sin sealed up to their souls? Oh! blessed
   is that man that can say his sins are forgiven him. Who is that man? In
   whose spirit there is no guile;' that is, without dissimulation,
   fraudulency, and guile: this man enjoys acceptance with God, pardon of
   sin, justification before God. And the contrary will certainly bring
   down a heavy judgment.

SERMON CXXX.

   Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I
   love thy testimonies.--Ver. 119.

   IN these words we have--(1.) God's dispensation; (2.) The effect it had
   upon David's heart.

   In the first branch we have--

   1. The character by which they are described, all the wicked of the
   earth.

   2. The esteem God hath of them, they are dross.

   3. A suitable providence dealt out to them, intimated, thou puttest
   them away like dross.

   First, That the wicked are men of the earth. There are common reasons
   why we are all men of the earth. Our original is earth, made of the
   dust of the ground, Gen. ii. 7. They are but a little earth or red clay
   fashioned into the form of a man, a handful of enlivened dust. Our
   abode and service is here: John xvii. 4, I have glorified thee upon
   earth;' and at our end and dissolution we are turned into earth again:
   Eccles. xii. 7, Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was;' Ps.
   cxlvi. 4, His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth.' Princes
   as well as others must look to be dissolved into dust again. But in an
   especial respect are wicked men said to be of the earth, and that in
   contradistinction to the people of God, Rev. xiii. 10. God's witnesses
   tormented the dwellers upon earth;' that is, those that are out of the
   true church, in Antichrist's kingdom. So Rev. xiii. 8, And all that
   dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in
   the book of life of the Lamb.' As, on the contrary, they that dwell in
   the church, are said to be in heaven: Rev. xiii. 6, And he opened his
   mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his
   tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven;' so Rev. xviii. 20, Rejoice
   over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles.' But why are they thus
   characterised? Because here they flourish: Jer. xvii. 13, Their names
   shall be written in earth;' grow great, and of good reckoning and
   account here. Judas had the bag; they pros per in the world,' Ps.
   lxxiii. 12, Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world.'
   Here they are respected: 1 John iv. 5, They are of the world, and speak
   of the world, and the world heareth them.' Here their hearts and minds
   are, Mat. vi. 19, 20. It is their natural frame to be worldly; they
   only savour the things of the world; preferment, honour, greatness, it
   is their unum magnum; here is their pleasure, and here is their
   portion, their hopes and their happiness. A child of God looketh for
   another inheritance, immortal and undefiled.

   Use 1. To wean us from present things, which the wicked enjoy more than
   the righteous, and which certainly are but poor things in comparison of
   our happiness: Set your affections on things above, not on things in
   the earth,' Col. iii. 2. Affect them not as your happiness and last
   end: Ps. xvii. 14, Their portion is in this life.' Affect them not in
   competition with heavenly things, but in subordination, Mat. vi. 33;
   affect them not inordinately, but so as to part with them when God
   will: Job i. 21. Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall
   I return thither; the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed
   be the name of the Lord.' Affect them not so as to use unlawful means
   to get them: Prov. xxviii. 8, He that by usury and unjust gain
   increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the
   poor.' Affect them not so as to put yourselves upon the temptation of
   getting or keeping them by unjust means: 1 Tim. vi. 9, But they that
   will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish
   and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition;' Prov.
   xxviii. 20, He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.'
   Affect them not so as to be backward to good works: But whoso hath this
   world's goods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his
   bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?' 1
   John iii. 17; 1 Sam. xxv. 11, Shall I take my bread, and my water, and
   my flesh, which I have provided for my shearers, and give it to men I
   know not?' Affect them not so as to neglect heavenly things; affect
   them not so as to lay out your whole time and care about them: Prov.
   xxiii. 4, Cease from thine own understanding; labour not to be rich;'
   Isa. lv. 2, Why do ye spend your money for that which is not bread, and
   your labour for that which satisfieth not?' But only affect them as you
   may honour God: Prov. iii. 9, Honour the Lord with thy substance.' You
   may provide for your families in the fair lawful way of God's
   providence, 1 Tim. v. 8; also you may be helpful to others, Eph. iv.
   28; for if you so do, you are not the wicked of the earth, but those
   that use this world, but hope to enjoy better things.

   Use 2. Let us be contented though we be kept low and mean in the world.
   God's people are not the children of this world; better things are
   reserved for them in the world to come: and therefore, if we have food
   and raiment, and that but of the coarsest, let us be content: 1 Tim.
   vi. 8, Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.' Jesus
   Christ gave thanks for five barley loaves and two fishes, Mark vi. 41.
   The wicked are characterised to be of the earth; God's children are
   from above as to their original, and thither they tend as to their
   scope and end; and if we have anything by the way, we have no cause to
   complain: 1 Peter ii. 11, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims.'
   What would a man care for in a journey but a bait or a little
   refreshing? If we seek after more, it is inordinate affection, and must
   be mortified, not satisfied: Eph. iii. 5, Mortify your members which
   are upon the earth.' Evil inclinations bend us to the earth, and
   earthly things, those splendid nothings, riches, pleasures, honours,
   these hinder us from nobler things; yea, they increase our difficulties
   about the things that are necessary for us by the way: Heb. xiii. 5,
   Let your conversations be without covetousness, and be content with
   such things as you have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor
   for sake thee;' implying that whilst we indulge carnal desires, it is
   hard to trust God with daily supports, for daily protection and daily
   maintenance; but always distract ourselves with fruitless cares and
   thoughts about the things of this life. And also we may say, The Lord
   is my helper; I do not fear what man can do unto me.' Therefore let us
   not desire more than God alloweth: a little with God's blessing is
   enough to supply our necessities as to wants, and to give us protection
   against dangers; as the apostle subjoineth God's undertaking, and the
   saints' confidence thereupon by way of a cure; if we believe God's
   promises, and have the spirit of his saints, this is enough to us.

   Use 3. Let us not envy the prosperity of the wicked.

   1. They are the wicked of the earth; here they flourish; as nettles
   will more easily grow than choicer plants, the soil bringeth them forth
   of its own accord; so do wicked men thrive here: but you need not envy
   them; not only our hopes are much better than their possessions, but
   our present condition is much better, Ps. xvii. 14. Their possessions
   are not to be compared with our hopes. What is a more plentiful table
   to the everlasting fruition of God? the pomp of the world to the seeing
   God face to face? vainglory to everlasting glory? honour here to the
   glory that shall be upon us at Christ's appearing? their momentary
   pleasures, which pass away suddenly as a dream, to the everlasting
   pleasure you shall enjoy in the sight of God? Nay, for the present you
   have communion with God and the sense of his favour, how poor and
   afflicted soever your outward condition be: Ps. iv. 6, 7, There be many
   that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of
   thy countenance upon us: thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than
   in the time when their corn and wine increased.' Carnal men rejoice in
   sensual earthly good things, not in the favour of God. And mark, this
   joy is proposed with a supposition of increase; and at the time of this
   increase, when the carnalist doth enjoy the greatest affluence of
   worldly blessings, take them at their best, when they have the most
   lively sense of these things, yet a Christian hath more cause of
   rejoicing: Thou hast put gladness in my heart;' here is matter and
   ground of rejoicing. They drink of the cistern, you of the fountain,
   Jer. xii. 13; they rejoice not in God, but his gifts; and not the best
   gifts, but the common sort, riches, pleasures, and honours; and these
   not as the effects of God's bounty, but as happening to them in the
   ordinary course of second causes: Who will show us any good?' But you
   rejoice in God, in his best gifts, his love and grace. And then here is
   the author of this joy: Thou hast put gladness.' This joy is allowed by
   God, and wrought by him: Rom. xiv. 17, The kingdom of God is not meat
   and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.' It
   is stirred up by his Spirit; their joy is neither God's allowance nor
   God's work. And then here is the subject and seat of this joy; not
   tickle the senses, but delight the heart: Thou hast put gladness in my
   heart.' And then here is the measure; it is more joy, it is more pure
   and sublime, of a stronger efficacy, which not only overcometh the
   sense of present infelicities, but the fear of death, hell, and
   judgment to come: Heb. vi. 18, That we might have stronger
   consolation.' But wicked men dance about the brink of hell, have their
   secret gripes; and will you envy them, as if your condition were not
   much better? When God hath given you the feast, will you be troubled
   that they have the scraps and fragments of his bounty?

   2. In regard of the uncertainty of their condition: Ps. xxxvii. 1, 2,
   Fret not thyself because of the evil-doers, neither be thou envious
   against the workers of iniquity; for they shall soon be cut down like
   the grass, and wither as the green herb.' Though they seem to be in a
   very prosperous condition for the present, as grass while it is
   standing is very green, yet they are soon cut down by the scythe of
   providence, then presently fadeth, and is carried away from the place
   where it grew. You think providence doth not deal righteously, because
   the unworthy are exalted and the worthy depressed. Do but tarry a
   while, and you will have no cause to complain, or to grow weary of
   godliness, or to cry up a confederacy with evil men. They are never
   nearer their own ruin than when they come to the height of their
   exaltation, as the sun declineth presently when he cometh to the
   highest point of the zenith. Who would envy those that climb up a
   ladder for execution? or are carried to the top of a rock, that they
   may be thrown down from thence to be broken in pieces? Ps. lxxiii. 18,
   Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down
   into destruction.'

   Secondly, That the wicked of the earth are as dross. They are so in
   these respects:--

   1. As to external show, they seem to be a part of the substance or
   metal, but indeed they are but the filth of the metal, which is wont to
   be consumed with fire, that the metal may be purged. This is fitly
   applied to the degenerate members of the visible church, that have only
   a show of the purity of religion, but are corrupt in faith and manners,
   ungodly and unrighteous. There are disciples in show, and disciples
   indeed, John viii. 31; some that live, and some only that have a name
   to live, but indeed are dead, Rev. iii. 4. There is a Jew outwardly and
   inwardly, of the letter and of the spirit, Rom. ii. 28, 29. There are
   branches in Christ, by an external visible union, that bring forth no
   fruit, John xv. 2. Some are Christians in name, by external visible
   communion, others by real implantation into Christ. It concerneth us to
   see whether we be dross or metal, living members of Christ's mystical
   body, or only equivocally called Christians, because of some loose
   profession of Christ's name.

   2. Dross is intermingled with purer metal, and maketh one mass with it.
   The wicked and the godly live together in the visible church; they are
   never totally severed till the great day of separation or general
   judgment, when the sheep and the goats are put apart, some on Christ's
   right hand and some on his left. Here in the world, as in the finest
   metal, there is some dross, and in the same field there is chaff and
   corn, Mat. xiii. 29. We should not leave the flour for the chaff, but
   leave the chaff that we may be pure grain.

   3. In God's esteem they are refuse, drossy, worthless things: Ezek.
   xxii. 19, Thus saith the Lord, Because ye are become dross,' poor,
   unprofitable creatures. The church and people of God, because of their
   excellency, are compared to gold and silver; so Rev. i. 20, The seven
   golden candlesticks.' As gold is the most precious metal, so is the
   church, much esteemed by God, called God's jewels, Mal. iii. 17; as a
   diamond among a heap of pebbles; God's jewels, of whom the world is not
   worthy,' Heb. xi. 38; his peculiar people,' Titus ii. 14. God maketh no
   such reckoning of wicked men. Dross is cast away as good for nothing;
   and all the wicked of the earth are but as dross to so much good metal.
   But all his saints are much set by, as the things of silver and gold
   are precious. What a difference is there between the judgment of God
   and the judgment of the world! The men of the world esteem the saints
   to be, 1 Cor. iv. 13, the offscouring and filth of all things,' as the
   sweeping of the city, to be cast forth to the dunghill. Whereas
   themselves are so indeed in God's account; but reprobate silver,' Jer.
   vi. 30, or rather dross, which is the refuse of gold and silver.
   Therefore their contempt is not to be regarded, how great soever they
   be; though potentates, high in honour and place, yet if ungodly and
   wicked, God reckons them to be vile persons, Dan. xi. 21, dross,
   worthless souls. Men are not valued by God for their secular interests,
   but moral qualifications. The potentates of the earth are not valued as
   his princely, but holy ones: The righteous is more excellent than his
   neighbour,' Prov. xii. 26. God puts the highest price upon them, they
   are coin and medals who bear his own image.

   4. They are consumed in trials, as dross consumeth in the fining and
   trying of metals. Solid metal endureth, but the dross is consumed;
   which holdeth true of wicked men in two respects:--(1.) Their seeming
   goodness is lost, and the difference is seen between them and those
   that are sincere. Sound and searching judgments discover hypocrites, as
   the lightness of a building is seen in a storm: Mat. vii. 27, When the
   rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, the house
   fell, and great was the fall of it.' So God, in the metaphor of the
   text, is often said to melt and try his people, Jer. ix. 7, to discover
   the dross from pure gold. Hirelings will soon prove changelings, when
   God trieth them to purpose. (2.) Their imaginary felicity vanished into
   smoke, they perish, the meanest as well as the greatest. Thou puttest
   away all the wicked of the earth like dross; they are consumed in the
   fire of God's wrath, and destroyed: Ezek. xxii. 20, As they gather
   silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the
   furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in
   mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.'
   But of this by and by.

   Use. Let us see what we are, real members of Christ's mystical body,
   yea or no. The wicked of the earth are as dross, and the godly are the
   finest sort of metals. To move you to consider what you are:--

   1. Ordinarily the visible church is so mixed, that the generality
   thereof is unsound: Zech. xiii. 8, Two parts thereof shall be cut off
   and die; and I will bring the third part through the fire, and refine
   them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried.' There is but
   one part in three sound, and it were well the proportion were sound
   every where; and therefore we had need to consider who shall be saved
   and found faithful: Luke xiii. 23, 24, And one said unto him, Lord, are
   there few that shall be saved? and he said unto them, Strive to enter
   in at the strait gate; for many shall seek to enter, and shall not be
   able.' We had need be the more earnest, because the most miscarry.

   2. The trials will be searching; we must pass through the fire, and
   then what will become of the dross? Rev. iii. 10, An hour of temptation
   shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon earth.' And,
   alas! are we able to brook the fiery trial? 1 Peter iv. 10. Few
   professors will be able to abide it, when we are to part with the
   sweetest of our earthly comforts, yea, and it may be life itself, which
   maketh us capable to enjoy them. It is no strange thing that it should
   happen to us, 1 Peter iv. 12; it is as useful as violent storms at sea
   or tempestuous weather in winter; when God is upon reckoning with his
   people, such things may be expected.

   3. The best of us will be found but dross if God would deal with us in
   extremity; so much of corruption cleaveth to us, and so many hidden
   lusts do we cherish and indulge, that would soon become a root of
   apostasy, if God did not hold a hand of grace over us. But God will not
   be extreme: Isa. xlviii. 10, Behold, I have refined thee, but not with
   silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction;' that is, not
   so thoroughly. Silver is not refined till all the dross be consumed and
   wrought out of it; and when should we see good day if God should so
   refine us?

   4. They are not reckoned to dross, but metal, that walk answerable to
   their profession and obligations to God, as becometh his peculiar
   people to do; they are not satisfied with common mercies. A man may
   have the world at will, and yet be a castaway; they must have something
   peculiar and distinguishing: Ps. cxix. 132, Look upon me, and be
   merciful unto me, as thou usest to do to them that love thy name;'
   things that can never be given in anger. They do not rest in common
   grace: Heb. vi. 9, But we hope better things of you, and things that do
   accompany salvation;' those good moods in hypocrites and temporaries.
   Nor content themselves with a common conversation: 1 Cor. iii. 3, Are
   ye not carnal, and walk as men?' 1 Peter iv. 4, Wherein they think it
   strange that you run not with them into the same excess of riot;' Mat.
   v. 46, If you love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even
   the publicans the same?' You should do something rare and singular, not
   in an ordinary loose rate.

   Thirdly, That it is God's business in heaven to put away the wicked as
   dross, to sever them from the purer metal.

   1. God hath many ways and means to do it. (1.) Partly by his judgments
   he doth it more and more: Mat. iii. 12, His fan is in his hand, and he
   will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner;
   but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.' As the chaff
   from corn, so dross from metal: Isa. iv. 4, When the Lord shall have
   washed away the filth of the daughter of Zion, and shall have purged
   the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of
   judgment, and by the spirit of burning;' that is, by the judgment
   executed upon the evil among them: Ezek. xx. 38, And I will purge out
   from among them the rebels, and them that transgress against me.' This
   God doth by destroying, wasting judgments. (2.) Partly by the censures
   of the church: 1 Cor. v. 9, Put away from among yourselves that wicked
   person.' And partly by the stroke of the civil magistrate, and their
   punishments: Prov. xxv. 4, 5, Take away the dross from the silver, and
   there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. Take away the wicked
   from before the king, and his throne shall be established in
   righteousness.' Thus doth God do it now, but he will fully and finally
   do it at the last judgment, when there shall be a perfect separation of
   them, and all the wicked shall be cast away as refuse: Mat. xxv. 32,
   33, Before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall separate
   them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats;
   and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left
   hand;' there is a congregation and then a segregation, never to meet
   more, nor be mingled more. Now God doth it in part, but then more
   fully.

   2. The reasons. (1.) God doth so, lest the silver itself should be
   turned into dross. We are apt to corrupt one another, natural
   corruption within meeting with examples without: Isa. vi. 5, Woe is me,
   I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a
   people of unclean lips;' as a man that hath the matter of a disease
   prepared, coming into infectious company, is soon infected. God's
   choicest people have much dross in them, therefore the Lord needeth to
   purge out their dross. The purest church is apt to contract pollution
   and to degenerate, and the choice plants of the covenant-stock to run
   wild, were it not for these dispensations. (2.) That impunity may not
   harden the wicked and encourage others. God suffereth it as long as he
   judgeth it expedient: Eccles. viii. 11, Because sentence against an
   evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the hearts of the sons of
   men are fully set in them to do evil;' Ps. ix. 16, The Lord is known by
   the judgments he executeth; the wicked is snared in the work of his own
   hands.' Men sin more freely and securely when a judgment doth not
   presently overtake them, when sinners go on without any mark of God's
   vengeance; but God will in every age clear his providence, by bringing
   of judgments upon wicked men. (3.) The nearer they are to God, the more
   hateful their provocations are, and more severely punished: Amos iii.
   2, You have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will
   punish you for all your iniquities.' For their sins the valley of
   vision is brought to barrenness. They sin against the clearest light,
   the dearest love, the highest engagements to the contrary; and
   therefore, when they are mingled among his people as dross with the
   silver, God putteth them away.

   Use 1. To inform us that God in his judicial proceedings will
   distinguish; he will divide the dross from the other metal, that he may
   destroy the one, and preserve the other. David prayeth, Ps. xxvi. 9,
   Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men;' that God
   would not lay him common with the wicked. God hath his harvest, for
   cutting down, for cutting and binding together those that sinned. Now
   David prayeth that he, that had severed himself in his course of life,
   might not be gathered with them in their punishment. God will
   distinguish; his judgments are for the destruction of the worser sort,
   and the amendment of the better; when he severeth the dross, he hath a
   care of the silver. Though never so terrible to the wicked, still he
   will be comfortable to his own: 2 Peter ii. 9, The Lord knoweth how to
   deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unjust to the
   day of judgment to be punished.' His own jewel, that lieth hidden among
   them: when all is shaken round about them, God can hide them in the
   secret of his presence, and preserve them as he did Lot and Noah. His
   own are wonderfully preserved in common judgments; several scriptures
   speak to this: Eccles. viii. 12, 13, Surely it shall be well with them
   that fear God, but it shall not be well with the wicked;' and Josh.
   iii. 10, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and he
   will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the
   Hittites;' Isa. iii. 10, 11, Say unto the righteous, It shall be well
   with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe to the
   wicked, it shall be ill with him; for the reward of his hands shall be
   given him.' God will make a difference between good and bad.

   Use 2. That a few wicked men may bring a great deal of hurt and
   mischief, as Achan upon Israel; two dry sticks may set a green one on
   fire, as the whole metal is melted that the dross may be severed.

   Use 3. All judgments on the visible church are to sever the dross from
   the gold. God suffereth them a while to be mingled, and then come
   trying judgments to separate the one from the other; which is a comfort
   to us; the church is the purer for these judgments: Isa. i. 25, And I
   will turn my hand upon thee, and I will surely purge away thy dross,
   and take away thy tin.' So Mal. iii. 3, And he shall sit as a refiner
   and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge
   them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering
   in righteousness.' He will send such judgments as will destroy the
   incorrigible wicked ones, and purify the rest. It is a comfort against
   persecutions. We murmur under them, know not how they shall be turned
   away; God, who is the purger of his church, will find out some way. And
   it is a comfort under his judgments; they are not to destroy, but to
   purge. God intendeth only our purging, how hot soever the furnace be;
   therefore let God alone with his work.

   Use 4. To teach us to wait upon God in the way of his judgments. He is
   putting away the wicked of the earth like dross; it is not only a work
   that he hath done, or will hereafter do, but he is always doing of it.
   We should observe how God hath already done it, and so by faith we
   should look upon him as still about it. First, he beginneth with his
   people; he is purging away their wickedness: Isa. xxvii. 9. By this
   shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged.' But many shall cleave to them
   by flatteries, and some of them of understanding shall fall, to try
   them and to purge, and make them white,' Dan. xi. 35. Now, when God
   hath employed wicked men to fan and purge his people, then their turn
   cometh next: Jer. xxv. 29, For lo I begin to bring evil on the city
   which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye
   shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the
   inhabitants of the earth;' 1 Peter iv. 17, If punishment begin at the
   house of God, where shall the wicked and ungodly appear?' Prov. xi. 31,
   Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth, much more the
   wicked and the sinner.' When the Lord hath performed his work upon
   Mount Zion and Jerusalem, then he will reckon with his enemies. He
   beginneth with his church, and maketh an end with their enemies: his
   enemies drink the dregs of the cup, and their end must needs be
   unspeakably terrible.

   Use 5. Let us see we be not put away like dross, when God's judgments
   are abroad in the earth: 1 Cor. xi. 32, We are chastened of the Lord,
   that we should not be condemned with the world.' We shall put that out
   of question if we do two things:--(1.) If we be faithful to God, and
   cleave to God's people, truth, and interest, how great soever our
   trials be: Ps. xliv. 17, All this is come upon us, yet we have not
   forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in the covenant.' To
   consume in the melting is the property of dross; but the pure metal is
   the more united, and cleaveth together the more closely. (2.) If you
   are refined by all these trials: Isa. xxvii. 9, Bv this shall the
   iniquity of Jacob be purged.' A Christian loseth nothing by his
   afflictions but sin, which is better parted with than kept.

   We come now to the second branch of the text, and that is the effect it
   had upon David's heart, Therefore I love thy testimonies.' This use he
   made of all God's judgments.

   Doct. A gracious heart, that observeth the providence of God, and the
   course of his judicial dispensations, will find more cause to love the
   word of God than ever before.

   1. Because thereby he hath sensible experience of the truth of it.
   God's providence is a comment upon his word; the effect is answerable
   to the prediction, and the word that God hath said is fulfilled to a
   tittle. Now, the more confirmation the word receiveth, the more is
   affection increased. The apostle telleth us that the word spoken by
   angels was steadfast,' Heb. ii. 2, because every transgression and
   disobedience received a just recompense of reward.' The punishment of
   the transgressors of the law was a proof of God's authorising their
   doctrine; the same law made formerly is valid. We see the word doth not
   threaten in vain, and they that slight it smart for it. Now I see the
   word of God is to be valued, for God will make it good, even to a
   tittle.

   2. Because if we love not the word, we may see great danger likely to
   ensue: even those terrible punishments by which he purgeth out the
   dross should make us fall in love with God's law. If we would not
   perish with the wicked of the earth, we should not sin with the wicked
   of the earth. If we partake of their sins, we must partake of their
   plagues: Ps. ii. 12, Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from
   the way, if his wrath be kindled but a little: blessed are they that
   trust in him.' When we see the danger of being enemies to God, or
   unsound with him, we have need to learn this wisdom of showing all
   affection and reverence and respect to Christ in his ways, and submit
   to him heartily; there is no safety in any other course. If a spark of
   his wrath light upon us, how soon will it consume us! The stupid world
   regardeth not this, to love his ways the more God giveth out proofs of
   his anger against those that despise them. Many are cut off in the
   midway sooner than they did or could expect, and yet they do not grow
   one jot the wiser. It is dangerous to stand out against God, his cause,
   work, or people.

   3. It doth endear the mercy of God to us; because he hath dealt
   otherwise with us, who in strict justice have deserved the same. God's
   judgments on the wicked commend his mercies to his children, Rom. ix.
   23. The vessels of wrath fitted to destruction serve to show the
   greater love of God to the vessels of mercy; the torments of hell
   inflicted on the wicked do the more set forth his love to the saints,
   to whom he hath appointed the joys of heaven. So the severity of God in
   his present judgments doth imply the love of God to his chosen people,
   who can take comfort in the promises when the threatenings are
   accomplished upon others; this might have been our condition too, but
   that grace hath made the difference. Well, then, as it doth endear the
   mercy of God to us, so it calleth upon us more highly to love and prize
   him and his word, because of this distinction.

   4. It is not only a means to set off the love of God to us, but even
   his judgments upon others may be a necessary act of love to us. They
   are purged out as dross, that they may not infect us by their example,
   or molest us by their persecutions or oppressions. Now the more we are
   befriended in this kind, the more we are bound to serve God cheer
   fully: Luke i. 74, 75, That being delivered from the hands of our
   enemies, we may serve God in righteousness and holiness all the days of
   our lives.' The world is one of those enemies, or the wicked of the
   earth; therefore we should serve him faithfully.

   5. By this means we see the world is governed by God, and we may the
   more safely commit ourselves to his protection upon the encouragement
   of his promises. If the affairs of the world were governed by blind
   chance, and men might do what they listed without check and control, we
   might think that we had cleansed our hearts in vain, and that a man
   doth make himself a prey by the simplicity of his innocence. But when
   God punisheth the wicked in our sight, certainly this should teach us
   to be more holy in all our ways: Ps. lviii. 11, A man shall say, Verily
   there is a reward for the righteous, verily there is a God that judgeth
   in the earth.' They that knew not what to think of providence shall see
   there is a God in the heavens that doth wisely administer all things
   below; and so we are encouraged to love him and serve him more
   heartily. Say, as the Psalmist, It is good for me to draw nigh to God,'
   Ps. lxxiii. 28.

   Use. Well, then, let our love to God, and liking and approbation of his
   law, be accompanied with the hatred of sin, the more we observe his
   judgments in putting away the wicked like dross, that we may be more
   holy, and seek after communion with God as our only blessedness. To
   this end:--

   1. Let us bless God for giving a sure rule to walk by, and such
   promises of protection in the midst of the darkness and uncertainty of
   the present world. When others perish, you are safe: Isa. viii. 20, To
   the law and to the testimony,' &c. Thou shalt walk in this way safely,
   and shalt not stumble; yea, please God, and you need not fear.

   2. Let us walk exactly by this rule, since our temporal and eternal
   safety and happiness is concerned thereby. For the world to come it is
   clear, as well as in this life: Prov. iii. 1, 2, My son, forget not my
   law, but let thine heart keep my commandments; for length of days, and
   long life, and peace shall they add unto thee,' and Gal. vi. 16, As
   many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them.'

   3. The more God doth own his law by his judgments, the more let our
   love be increased. This is to wash our feet in the blood of the wicked:
   Ps. lviii. 10, The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance:
   he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.'

SERMON CXXXI.

   My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy
   judgments.--Ver. 120.

   IN this psalm you find the man of God under divers passions, some times
   of joy, sometimes of sorrow, sometimes of hope and courage, and
   sometimes of fear. As there is a time for all things in this world,
   there are several conditions and duties that we run through, and we
   have affections planted in us that suit with every condition. Religion
   doth not nullify, but sanctify our affections. Some have vainly thought
   affections to be an after-growth of noisome weeds in our nature
   corrupted; whereas they are wholesome herbs, implanted in us by God at
   our first creation, of great use to grace when rightly stirred and
   ordered: Anima nunquam melius agit, &c. The passion expressed in the
   text is fear; for two or three verses his meditations had been taken up
   in the observation of God's judgments upon evil-doers: Thou hast
   trodden down all them that err from thy statutes; for their deceit is
   falsehood' (ver. 118). They were once high, but God hath brought them
   down with ignominy and contempt; they had borne themselves out in their
   sinful courses on account of their prosperity, but at length they are
   utterly ruined and broken. And why? For their deceit is falsehood;'
   that is, they were unmasked, and all their pretences of piety and
   justice found to be fraud and imposture. In ver. 119 he still insisteth
   upon the same argument: Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth
   like dross; therefore I love thy testimonies.' They seemed to cleave to
   the church and people of God as dross to gold or silver. That God, who
   is the purger and refiner of his church, failed not to put a
   difference, and to consume the dross and refine his silver. The use
   that David made of these judgments was twofold:--(1.) To love God's
   ways so much the more, and to cleave to them with greater firmness,
   Therefore I love thy testimonies. (2.) To fear before the Lord, and
   tremble at the Lord's judgments, as in the text. There are two
   affections wherein we should always seek to profit--the love of God and
   the fear of God. Of this last in the text, My flesh trembleth for fear
   of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments.' In which words we have--

   1. The degree of his fear, my flesh trembleth.

   2. The object of his fear, for fear of thee.

   3. The ground and reason of his fear, I am afraid of thy judgments.

   1. The degree of his fear, My flesh trembleth.' The word samar St
   Hierome rendereth, horrivilavit caro mea--my flesh is in horror and
   affrightment. Symmachus before him, orthotrichei apo` tou pho'bou e
   sa'rx mou--my flesh maketh my hair stand on end, as the prickles of a
   hedgehog, which is an emblem of horror. The poet Persius expresseth
   such an affrightment thus, Excussit membris tremor albus aristas--my
   fear made my hair stand up like a field of corn, from the contraction
   of the skin. So it happeneth in cases of fear. You have the like
   expression, Job iv. 14, 15, Fear came upon me, and trembling, which
   made all my bones to shake; the hair of my flesh stood up.' And
   elsewhere the same word is so used. The Septuagint reads it
   imperatively, kathe'loson ek tou pho'bou ta`s sarka's mou, apo` ga`r
   ton krima'ton sou ephobe'then--pierce through my flesh with fear, as
   with nails. Surely it noteth some deep sense and high degree of fear;
   as the prophet Habakkuk expresseth upon like occasion, Hab. iii. 15,
   When I heard this, my belly trembled, my lips quivered, rottenness
   entered into my bones, and I trembled in my flesh;' his bowels did beat
   and shake for fear, and his lips quivered for fear, that he could not
   speak. The judgments of God ought to beget a deep sense and trembling,
   not a slight affection in us. The prophet saith, Amos iii. 8, The lion
   roareth; who will not fear?' We have need to stir up our hearts again
   and again. When the Lord roareth and cometh forth to judgment, we have
   need be ashamed of our stupidity when we are not affected.

   2. The object of his fear, For fear of thee.' It was not the fear of
   man that put him into such an agony and consternation. We are always
   dissuaded from the fear of man, but we are exhorted to the fear of God:
   Mat. x. 28, And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
   kill the soul; but rather fear him that is able to destroy both soul
   and body in hell.' The one is a snare--Prov. xxix. 25, The fear of man
   bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be
   safe'--but the other is a duty. The great preservation of the soul from
   spiritual dangers is the fear of God. We are tuti si cauti, securi si
   attoniti, saith Tertullian--the fear of God maketh us circumspect, and
   so bringeth safety to us; yea, the one is the cure of the other, Isa.
   viii. 12, 13. As one nail driveth out another, or as Moses' rod did eat
   up the rods of the magicians, so doth the fear of God against all
   contrary fears and terrors, whereby the heart may be turned from God.
   Man can only kill the body, but God can cast both soul and body into
   hell-fire; so that we may set God against man, soul and body against
   the body only, and hell-fire against temporal punishment. As that holy
   man said, Da veniam, imperator, tu carcerem comminaris, Deus autem
   comminatur Gehennam--thou threatenest bonds and imprisonment, he
   threateneth everlasting damnation; therefore it is God is to be feared:
   Ps. lxxvi. 7, Thou, even thou, are to be feared; and who can stand in
   thy sight when thou art angry?' Not man, in comparison of God. Man
   against man may stand, and wicked men in the time of his patience may
   stand; but when God judgeth, who can stand? Now of God there is a
   double fear--filial, which draweth us to him; and servile, which
   driveth us from him: Exod. xx. 20, And Moses said unto the people, Fear
   not, for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your
   face, that ye sin not.' Fear not with a slavish fear, but an awful
   fear, composed of reverence and love.

   3. The ground of his fear, I am afraid of thy judgments.' The great
   seventy which God did exercise in punishing the evil-doers, and purging
   out the dross. When God doth smite the wicked and call them to an
   account for sin, he warneth his own people to stand in awe. As here,
   Thou puttest away the wicked like dross. When the threatening is made
   good, and terrible judgments are abroad, every one needeth to look to
   himself; not only to love God's testimonies, but to stand in awe of his
   judgments. We need all affections to keep us within our duty, both fear
   and love.

   Doct. That when God is angry, and his judgments are abroad in the
   world, it becometh his own people to observe them, and have a&gt; deep
   awe and sense thereof.

   Here I shall show you--

   1. How far the people of God do and ought to take notice of his
   judgments.

   2. This fear that is wrought thereby, whether it be an infirmity or a
   duty.

   3. The reasons why it becometh them to have a deep awe and sense of
   these things.

   For the first:--

   1. His ancient judgments in former times ought to be laid to heart by
   us, especially when like sins abound. The scripture referreth to the
   days of Lot and Noah, and biddeth us remember Lot's wife, Luke xvii.
   26-32. God biddeth his people, But go ye now to my place which was in
   Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it, for
   the wickedness of my people Israel,' Jer. vii. 12. And the apostle
   tells us that all the punishments that befell the stubborn Israelites
   are for our caution and warning: 1 Cor. x. 1-10, And all these things
   happened unto them for ensamples, and they are written for our
   admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come;' so he concludeth
   in ver. 11. And the apostle tells us that Sodom and Gomorrah were an
   example to those that after should live ungodly,' 2 Peter ii. 6. A
   people might easily read their own doom and destiny if they would blow
   off the dust from these ancient providences, and mark the prints of
   God's justice and truth in them, and how the word of God was verified
   upon them, for these are but copies and patterns. The desert of sin is
   still the same, and the exactness of divine justice remaineth still the
   same. These providences are pledges of the same wrath, of the like for
   substance to come upon us also, if we walk contrary to God. Others have
   smarted, why not we? God is impartially and immutably just: Gal. iii.
   20, He is but one;' always consonant unto himself, like unto himself;
   his power is the same, so is his justice; and therefore we should take
   warning: Exemplo qui peccat, bis peccat. He that will plunge himself in
   a bog or quagmire, where others have miscarried before him. is doubly
   guilty of folly, because he neither feareth nor will take warning by
   their example. This is one great benefit we have by the historical part
   of the word, that it doth not only preserve the memory of the saints,
   that we may imitate their graces and enjoy their blessings, but also
   records the sins and punishments of the wicked, that we may know God
   hath owned the historical part of the word, and fear for ourselves:
   Heb. ii. 1, 2, Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
   things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
   For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression
   and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;' Rom. i. 18, The
   wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
   unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.' So the
   historical parts are also to justify the prophetical. It is not only a
   register and chronicle of what is past, but a calendar and
   prognostication of what is to come. God might have blotted out the
   memory of sinners, that it should be no more thought or heard of, but
   he would secure it upon record for our learning; as some malefactors,
   their bodies are not buried, but quarters set upon places of greatest
   resort: Ut qui vivi noluerunt prodesse, morte eorum respublica utatur;
   or as Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt, to season after ages. So
   that our flesh may tremble at the old judgments, that Adam for one sin
   was turned out of paradise, the old world swept away with a flood,
   Dathan and Abiram swallowed up of the earth, Achitophel and Judas
   brought to the halter, Herod eaten up with worms for his pride; and all
   these have their use.

   2. Judgments that light upon other countries ought to be made use of by
   us, because usually they go in, a circuit; the cup of trembling goeth
   round, Jer. xxv. 32; and because by this means we may learn to be wise,
   and have all our schooling at other men's costs. As God expresseth it,
   Zeph. iii. 6, 7, I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate:
   I made their streets waste, that none passed by: their cities are
   destroyed, so that there is no man, none inhabitant. I said, Surely
   thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling
   should not be cut off, however I punished them: but they rose early,
   and corrupted all their doings.' God would have us take warning at a
   distance, and, while he is yet a great way off, to send for conditions
   of peace; otherwise it is a new provocation, and the judgment is
   hastened, Jer. iii. 7-10. A fire in one house alarmeth all the street:
   and they make provision for their safety.

   3. When the judgments of God break in among us, and are executed before
   our eyes, that must be the more considered: Isa. xxvi. 9, When thy
   judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn
   righteousness.' God looketh to be more reverenced and obeyed for this,
   because then what was before matter of faith is made matter of sense;
   and we need not doubt any more whether God will punish the disobedient
   when his threatening is made good. Smoke is a sign of fire, much more
   when the fire is breaking out; and we see what we only heard before,
   and we feel what we would not believe before.

   4. Though we should be well at ease in our own persons, yet the
   judgments upon others should be considered by us. Nehemiah, chap. i.,
   preferred at court, yet hath a sad resentment of the state of
   Jerusalem. So Daniel, chap. ix. 5, a great man in Babylon, yet layeth
   to heart the judgments upon the people of God.

   5. Though the judgment pursue but a few, yet all should fear. When
   Ananias and Sapphira fell down dead, it is said, Acts v. 5, That great
   fear fell upon all that heard these things.' God, in one or a few,
   giveth an instance of his severity that others may tremble; as it is
   said of David, when the breach was made upon Uzzah, 1 Chron. xiii. 12,
   And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark
   of God home to me?' The sin was Uzzah's, the breach only upon him, but
   the stroke was God's, and that maketh David tremble. Yea, the pagan
   mariners, when divine vengeance had pursued Jonah, chap. i. 18, Then
   the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the
   Lord, and made vows.' The danger was for Jonah's sake; when he was
   thrown overboard, there was a calm; but the men feared greatly.

   6. Though it should light upon enemies to us and God, yet their fall is
   not to be insulted over, but God's hand observed with great reverence:
   Thou puttest away the wicked of the earth like dross;' then my flesh
   trembleth,' saith David. So in Ps. lxxvi. 6, 7, At thy rebuke, O God of
   Jacob, both the chariot and the horse are cast into a deep sleep. Thou,
   even thou, art to be feared; and who may stand in thy sight when once
   thou art angry?' We ought to express a sense of our Father's
   displeasure, as a child quaketh when he heareth his father is angry
   with or doth correct a servant. Naturalists say a lion will tremble to
   see a dog beaten before him: Ps. Hi. 6, The righteous also shall see
   and fear.' The godly will be wise observers of God's work and
   dispensations of justice, and the spiritual advantage they may gain
   thereby: Prov. xxi. 12, The righteous man wisely considereth the house
   of the wicked, and that God overthroweth the wicked for their
   wickedness.' Holy men do exceedingly profit by these judgments.

   7. Much more should we tremble at God's judgments upon his own people,
   when he cometh to visit their iniquities with rods and their
   transgressions with scourges. If this be done in the green tree, what
   in the dry? If judgment begin at the house of God, where shall the
   ungodly and sinner appear?' 1 Peter iv. 18. Many times they are broken
   with a great breach and heavy corrections: Jer. xxv. 17, Then I took
   the cup at the Lord's hand, and made all the nations to drink.' His own
   people sip of the bitter cup that others drank the dregs of. The world
   shall know that he is a God hating sin, and therefore will punish them
   for it, lest he should seem to approve their sin. Though God doth not
   condemn his people to hell for their sin, yet by his sharp corrections
   of them in this life the world shall know how much he hateth sin;
   especially when they have made the name of God to be evil spoken of.
   God will vindicate himself. Now these should make us tremble; they are
   ordered for this purpose.

   Secondly, I shall inquire what this fear is, an infirmity or a duty. To
   many, to fear judgments seemeth slavish, and thereupon build a false
   conceit, that God only is to be feared for his mercies and not for his
   judgments. Indeed God is feared for his goodness,' Hosea iii. 5, but
   not only. Judgments are the object of fear; and the fear conversant
   about them may be so far from being a sin that it is a grace. Briefly,
   then, it is not such a fear as driveth us from God, Gen. iii. 5, but
   bringeth us to him, keepeth us with him: I will put my fear into their
   hearts, and they shall never depart from me,' Jer. xxxii. 40. They are
   afraid both to sin and to suffer for sin. Afraid to sin, and so it is
   the fear of caution and circumspection. Certainly it can be no fault to
   be afraid of that which deserveth punishment or judgment; and afraid to
   suffer for sin in this world, where all things come alike to all; and
   in the world to come, where God will stir up ail his wrath. But to fear
   punishment, is not this servile? No, it is not. First, if it keep its
   proportion, and doth not exceed its limits, driving us into a
   despairing anguish, such as the devil's is, James ii. 19. Secondly, if
   it have its spiritual use and end, which is the main and principal
   thing, which is to make us cleave the closer to God: Jer. xxxii. 40,
   But I will put my fear into their hearts, and they shall not depart
   from me.' Or, thirdly, if it be subordinate, which is to make us
   cautelous and watchful against sin, or such things as may occasion
   these judgments, fleeing from wrath to come, Mat. iii. 7, and to use
   the means for our preservation with the more diligence, Heb. xi. 7.

   Thirdly, The reasons.

   1. Because a tender heart is easily affected with all God's
   dispensations; one of the great and first privileges of grace is a
   heart of flesh, Ezek. xxxvi. 26. Wicked men have a heart of stone, a
   stout, obstinate, stupid spirit; but when God's hand is upon their
   persons they have no sense: Jer. ix. 3, Thou hast smitten them, but
   they have not grieved.' But God's children have a heart of flesh, that
   trembleth at his word, and at judgments at a distance: they are soon
   affected with a providence. This tenderness, as it is wrought in them
   by grace at the first, so it is increased by their acquaintance with
   God and experiences of his love. Familiarity with men breedeth
   contempt; familiarity with God not so. None are moved with reverence to
   the Lord more than they that know him best, and are most familiar with
   him. None rejoice more than they when they find God is pleased and
   giveth out demonstrations of grace to the world. None fear more than
   they when God is angry: Ps. xc. 11, Who knoweth the power of thine
   anger? According to thy fear, so is thy wrath.' The world think not of
   God's anger till they feel the terrible effects of it; but God's
   children, that have a deep awe of God, and observe him in all his
   motions, have the greatest apprehensions of his displeasure.

   2. It is the property of God's children, when they look to anything
   without them, still to draw home the providence, and consider their own
   case, and to edify themselves by that they see in others, whether it be
   good or evil. Electorum corda semper ad se sollicite videant, saith
   Gregory. When Uzzah was stricken, How shall I bring the ark of God home
   to me?' saith David, 1 Chron. xiii. 12. Will not God be as severe to
   me, if I behave myself unreverently? He ob served how failing about
   holy things did much incense God's wrath: Gal. vi. 13, Ye which are
   spiritual, restore such a one with meekness, considering thyself, lest
   thou also be tempted.' They that rigidly and uncharitably censure
   others, are usually greatest strangers to their own hearts; but a man
   that draweth all things home, knoweth that if God should let loose
   temptations upon him, he may be as bad as others. A man that usually
   reflects upon himself will be afraid, and will not reflect on the
   judgments executed on others, but tremble. Nunquid ego tali? &c., was a
   good question in a heathen. If God should visit my transgressions, I
   have broken his laws, and deserve as great a punishment. A spirit of
   application is a great advantage. Our Lord telleth others, Luke xiii.
   5, ye shall likewise perish, without repentance. David was afraid lest
   he should be cast away with the dross, because they love not God's
   testimonies; therefore he would not only love his testimonies, hut also
   fear his judgments. Carnal men forget themselves when they are so
   bitter against others.

   3. The usefulness of this fear showeth it is their duty. It is very
   necessary--

   [1.] To stir up watchfulness and care for our own safety, that we may
   not fall into like offences, or do anything that is displeasing to God,
   lest we fall into his vengeance. We are bidden to work out our
   salvation with fear and trembling, Phil. ii. 12. We have to do with a
   just and holy God, who is tender of his laws. Now, this fear should be
   more active and lively when we see his judgments executed, for then God
   is ready at hand with a whip to awaken us, and to show us he will not
   be dallied with, and that danger attendeth us, when we begin to
   straggle out of our duty. He that breaketh through a hedge, a serpent
   shall bite him. Fear is the great restraint of sin, as the fear of man
   keepeth the beasts from hurting him, Gen. ix. 2; it is their bridle:
   The fear of you shall be upon the beasts of the field.' So fear of God
   helps to keep from offending him, or breaking his laws.

   [2.] To humble us, when we see that sin shall not escape unpunished.
   Alas! if God should enter into judgment with us, who could stand? Ps.
   cxliii. 2. Non dicit cum hostibus tuis, sed cum servo tuo. He doth not
   say, If them shouldest enter into judgment with thine enemy, but with
   thy servant. God is a just judge, and therefore, when we see judgments
   executed upon others, we may be afraid of his righteousness. Every
   humble heart is conscious to himself of grievous offences; and if God,
   when he cometh to purge out dross, should be severe with us, what
   miserable wretched creatures should we be! This striketh a holy fear
   into our hearts, and so helps us to humble ourselves in his presence.

   [3.] To make us thankful for our mercies and gracious escape. It is
   fear that maketh us taste the sweetness of the promise of free par don,
   when we see from what miseries we are delivered by the mercy of God.
   When the Israelites had seen the Egyptians drowned in the water, they
   saw they had cause to triumph in the God of their salvation, Exod. xv.
   1, 2. The consideration of our defects is in part represented to us in
   the bitter experience of others; there we may see what dangers we are
   liable unto, were it not for his preventing grace, that we are riot
   condemned with the world, and left to perish in our sins.

   [4.] To quicken and sharpen our prayers. God knoweth how to take
   vengeance on all iniquity, even in his dearest servants: Joel ii. 17,
   Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach.'
   Sparing is an act of God's mercy, withdrawing and mode rating deserved
   judgments. Now the more our fear is increased, the more earnest and
   importunate will we be to keep off or get the judgment removed.

   Use. Reproof of the greatest part of the world, that pass by God's
   judgments, and take no notice of them, so as to fear and return to him;
   not his judgments upon others. When the arrows of God fly round about
   us, we should fear for ourselves, and when wrath is making inquisition
   for sinners, be the more earnest to be found in Christ. But a senseless
   stupidity possesseth most men; they mind none of these things. The
   Gibeonites were more wise and cautious, Josh. ix. 3, 4. When they saw
   the cities of Jericho and Ai destroyed, and their inhabitants cut off
   by the sword, they did not expect the coming of Joshua, but sent
   messengers to him, and by a wile struck up a covenant with him, before
   he came any further. Or as that captain, when two before him with their
   fifties were destroyed by fire, he fell upon his knees before the
   prophet, 2 Kings i. 13, 14, saying, O man of God, let my life and the
   life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sight. Behold,
   there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the
   former fifties, with their fifties; therefore let my life be precious
   in thy sight.' But oh! our blindness and stupidness! though others fall
   under the judgment of God, we are as immovable as rocks, and do not
   fall down before the Lord to deprecate his anger. Certainly if we had a
   due sense of our condition, we are as worthy as they; it is by the
   mercy of God that yet we stand. Therefore we should fear with a holy
   fear, that we may bridle the flesh, humble ourselves before the Lord,
   be thankful for our safety, and be earnest in prayer: this we should do
   when we see any others in afflictions. Again, when judgments are on
   ourselves, when God cometh nearer to us, and beginneth to touch us with
   his hand, we should relent presently. To be sinning and suffering is
   the condition of the damned in hell. The Holy Ghost sets a brand upon
   Ahaz: 2 Chron. xxviii. 22, That in the time of his distress he did yet
   trespass more and more against the Lord; this is that king Ahaz.' If we
   keep our pride, luxury, vanity, wantonness still, our avarice, coldness
   in religion, Sabbath profanation, if we be not brought by all our
   afflictions to fear God the more, such a brand will he put upon us,
   yea, our judgments will be increased, and the furnace heated seven
   times hotter; as when the child is stubborn and obstinate, the father
   redoubleth his strokes. Therefore we are to beg his Spirit with his
   rod, that we may be the better by all his corrections: Numb. xii. 14,
   If her father had spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven
   days?' So if our heavenly Father be displeased and casts contempt upon
   us, &c.

   Use 2. It reproveth those that triumph over the fallen, and declaim and
   inveigh against their sins, but do not consider their own. We should
   rather tremble and learn to fear from every judgment executed, though
   upon the worst of men, and say, Well, God is a righteous God, and
   whosoever provoketh him to wrath shall not escape unpunished. But this
   epichairekaki'a, this insulting over and upbraiding others with their
   evil and afflicted condition, is a sin which God cannot endure, and
   will certainly punish: Prov. xvii. 5, And he that is glad at calamities
   shall not be unpunished.' If God hath stricken them, and the hand of
   justice found them out, we should be tender to them: Prov. xxiv. 17,
   18, Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be
   glad when he stumbleth; lest the Lord see it and it displease him, and
   he turn away his wrath from him.' Some read it, Et convertat iram suam
   in te--he turn his wrath upon thee. Thine enemy is not he that thou
   hatest, for a Christian should hate nobody, but he that hateth thee. If
   we rejoice in their evil, certainly it is a sign we hate them, however
   we please ourselves with the thoughts of forgiving them. As not when he
   falleth, so not when he stumbleth, not at lesser evils that befall
   them. Many will say they do not wish their destruction, but a little
   evil they could be glad of; which showeth how rare true piety is. God
   will give him like advantage against thee; as the leprosy of Naaman
   doth cleave to Gehazi. David, when he heard of the death of Saul, rent
   his clothes and wept and fasted, 2 Sam. i. 11, 12. Therefore, to feed
   our eyes with the misery and torment of others, is no holy affection.
   Job disclaimed it: Job xxxi. 29, If I rejoiced at the destruction of
   him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him, neither
   have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.'
   Revenge is sweet to carnal nature, but such a disposition as that
   cannot or should not find room in a gracious heart. To evidence his
   integrity, Job produceth this vindication. Though they that hate us be
   our worst enemies, and should have spirits steeped in bitterness and
   wormwood against us, yet ought we not to rejoice at the misery of an
   enemy. Yea, to mourn at their fall becometh us more, if we would act as
   Christians; and to fear because of it is an act of piety. Therefore
   this old leaven of malice and revenge must be purged out, this being
   inwardly delighted, when we hear of the fall of those that hate us.
   When thine enemy falleth, consider, Either I myself am like him, or
   worse, or better than he. If better, who made thee to differ? If worse,
   thou hast cause to wonder thou art spared, and to fear before the Lord.
   Let us therefore observe the judgments of God executed according to his
   word. Lactantius telleth us, Quod non metuitur, contemnitur, quod
   contemnitur utique non colitur. If the wrath of God be not feared, it
   is contemned; and if God be contemned, he cannot be worshipped.

SERMON CXXXII.

   I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
   oppressors.--Ver. 121.

   HERE is--

   1. David's plea.

   2. His prayer.

   First, His plea, I have done judgment and justice.' Defensio est, non
   arrogantia, saith Ambrose; he doth not speak this boasting or trusting
   in his own righteousness, but by way of apology and just defence: it is
   no pleading of merit, as if God were his debtor; but an asserting of
   his innocency against slanderers. There is justitia personae, the
   righteousness of the person; and justitia causae, the righteousness of
   the cause wherein any one is engaged. We may propound the justice of
   our cause to God as the judge of the earth, and appeal to him how
   innocently we suffer, when we are not able to plead the righteousness
   of our persons as to a strict and legal qualification: Ps. cxliii. 2,
   Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man
   living be justified.' Well, then, David pleadeth the equity and justice
   of his cause, and his right behaviour therein. They cannot condemn him
   of any unrighteousness and injustice, and yet endeavour to oppress him;
   therefore he pleads, Lord, thou knowest where the right lieth, so far
   as concerneth their slanders, I appeal to thee for my integrity and
   sincerity; thou knowest that I have given up myself to do just and
   right things; though they are thus forward to mischief, I have done
   them no wrong; hear me, O God of my righteousness,' Ps. iv. 1. They
   that look to be protected by God must look that they have a good cause,
   and handle that cause well, other wise we make him the patron of sin.
   When we suffer as evil-doers, it is the devil's cross, not Christ's,
   that we take up.

   But let us see how David expresseth his innocency, I have done judgment
   and justice.' These two words are often joined together in scripture.
   When God is spoken of, it is said of him, Ps. xxxiii. 5, He loveth
   righteousness and judgment;' and in the 2 Sam. viii. 15, it is said
   that David executed judgment and justice over all Israel.' Muis
   distinguished them thus, Judicium adversus sceleratos, justitia erga
   bonos--judgment in punishing the wicked, justice in rewarding the good.
   Besides that David speaketh not here as a king, but as a poor oppressed
   man, the words will hardly admit of that notion. Some think they are
   only put to increase the sense: I have done judgment justly, exactly. I
   suppose the one referreth to the law or rule itself, according to which
   every one is to do right--that is, judgment, a clear knowledge of what
   ought to be done; the other referreth to the action that followeth
   thereupon. So that judgment is a doing of what we know, and acting
   according to received light: Ezek. xviii. 5, Do that which is lawful
   and right;' it is in the margin, Do judgment and justice. Now when this
   is attributed to public persons, judgment signifieth due order in
   trying and finding out the state of a cause; and justice the giving out
   sentence on that trial and judgment, or causing justice to be executed
   for righting the wronged and punishing the wrong-doer. When to private
   men, the one implies the direction of conscience, the other the
   rectitude of our actions. By judgment we discern between right and
   wrong, and by justice doing things justly according to the rule. Thus
   it is said, Ps. cvi. 3, Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he
   that doth righteousness at all times.' There is another notion of these
   two words, which I had almost for gotten:--(1.) Judgment seemeth to be
   opposite to rigour and extremity, and seemeth to import equitable
   carriage, mixed with mercy and moderation in exacting our own from
   others. Certainly, so judgment is sometimes taken, Jer. x. 24, O Lord,
   correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me
   to nothing.' (2.) Justice is just and faithful, dealing in and about
   those things which we owe to others, or are employed about, or are
   intrusted with by. others.

   Doct. It is a comely property in God's children, and very comfortable
   to them, to do judgment and justice.

   1. It is an excellent property--

   [1.] Because by it we are made like God. Righteousness is part of God's
   image, and herein we do most resemble his perfection: Ps. cxlv. 5, The
   Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.' There is
   a perfect holiness in his nature, and a condecency in all his actions.
   Therefore it is God-like in us when our natures are sanctified, and all
   our actions are righteous and holy. It is said, Eph. iv. 24, That the
   new man is created after God in righteousness and true holiness,'
   according to the pattern of God, much like to him: they that are most
   so, are most like him. Natural conscience doth homage to the image of
   God: Mark vi. 20, And Herod feared John, knowing he was a just man.'

   [2.] It is acceptable and pleasing to God. The just man is an object of
   God's complacency: Prov. xv. 9, The Lord loveth him that followeth
   after righteousness.' God loveth all his creatures with a general love,
   but with a special love those that bear his image. He doth not love men
   because they are rich and mighty, fair and beautiful, valiant and
   strong, but as holy and just. It is said, Prov. xxi. 3, To do justice
   and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.' God hath
   required both, and we should make conscience of both; but yet the one
   is better than the other, though the one be a duty of the first table,
   the other of the second, because moral and substantial duties are
   better than ceremonial, internal before external, and duties evident by
   natural light before things of positive institution. It appeareth in
   this, that God doth accept of moral duties without ceremonial
   observances, For in every nation, he that feareth God and worketh
   righteousness, is accepted of him,' Acts x. 35. But ceremonial
   observances without moral duties are of no account in God's sight: he
   still rejecteth their offerings when they neglect justice; not
   thousands of rams and rivers of oil, but to show mercy, and to do
   justly, Micah vi. 7, 8, this is good. Again, he dispenseth with the
   ceremonials and the externals of religion when they come in competition
   with moral duties, even of the second table; as David's eating the
   shew-bread when he was hungry, Mat. xii. 5. Well, then, how right and
   punctual soever we be in other things, unless we show mercy and do
   justice, we are not accepted with God, though zealous for and against
   ceremonies of the stricter party in religion. It is true we cannot say
   they are better than faith and love, and the fear of God, and hope in
   his grace, for these are the substantial duties of the first table. And
   compare substantials with substantials, de ordine modus, first-table
   duties are more weighty. But compare internals of the second with
   externals of the first, moral duties of the second with the ceremonies
   of the first, natural and evident with the merely positive and
   instituted; these latter [11] are more weighty. Give to God what is
   God's, and to men what is men's.

   [3.] Because it fitteth for communion with God. When you are just and
   righteous, you may call for and look for such blessings as you stand in
   need of; for the righteous have an easy access to him, and are sure of
   audience: Ps. xvii. 15, But as for me, I will behold thy face in
   righteousness.' I cannot behold the face of Saul, he will not see my
   face; but this comforts me, that I can behold thy face. Lord, thou wilt
   look upon me, and be gracious to me, and hear my prayers. Otherwise God
   will not hear the unjust, as he saith he would not accept of their
   peace-offerings, till judgment ran down as a river, and righteousness
   as a mighty stream,' Amos v. 23, 24, and rejects the Jewish fasts, Isa.
   lviii., because they did not loose the oppressed, &c. On the other
   side, he hath assured the protection of his providence to him that is
   just: Isa. xxxiii. 15, 16, He that walketh righteously, and speaketh
   uprightly, he that despiseth the gain of oppression, and shaketh his
   hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
   blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil, he shall dwell on high,
   his place of defence shall be the munition of rocks; bread shall be
   given him, and his water shall be sure.' God will minister to him sure
   comforts and sure supplies. They that walk in a continual course of
   righteousness and just dealing of all sorts shall be as safe as if in a
   fort impregnable, not to be taken by any force, and sufficiently
   furnished with store of provisions to hold out any siege; a high craggy
   place is such. Bread and water are tokens of God's full and final
   deliverance: Isa. li. 1, Hearken unto me, ye that follow after
   righteousness.' None must look to be thus qualified but the righteous.

   [4.] It is so suitable to the new nature as fruits to such a tree. What
   is works meet for repentance? Acts xxvi. 20, That they should repent,
   and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance;' and bring forth
   fruits meet for repentance,' Mat. iii. 8. They are the kindly products
   of faith in Christ and repentance towards God. It is as unsuitable to
   those that are gracious to be unjust, as that the egg of a crow should
   drop from a hen, or venomous berries should grow upon a choice vine.
   That grace that is put into our hearts, which maketh us submissive and
   dutiful to God, doth also make us kind and harmless to men. These
   things are required of us as the fruits of true faith and repentance:
   Isa. i. 16, 17, Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your
   doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek
   judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the
   widow.' This is particularly insisted upon as the proper fruit of their
   change. So Dan. iv. 27, Break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine
   iniquities by showing mercy to the poor.' Repentance is a breaking off
   the former course of sin. The king, an open oppressor, Daniel preacheth
   righteousness and mercy to him. They that continue their former unjust
   courses never yet truly repented: Zech. viii. 16, 17, These are the
   things that ye shall do, Speak ye every man truth to his neighbour;
   execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates, and let none of
   you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour, and love no
   false oath; for all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord.' He
   would have their repentance thus expressed.

   [5.] Because it is so lovely and venerable in the eyes of the world. A
   Christian, if he had no other engagement upon him, yet, for the honour
   of God and the credit of religion, he should do those things that are
   lovely and comely in themselves, and so esteemed by the world, for he
   is to glorify God, 1 Peter ii. 12, and adorn religion, Titus ii. 10, to
   represent his profession with advantage to the consciences of men. God
   is dishonoured by nothing so much as injustice, which is so odious and
   hateful to men; and wicked men are hardened, the hopeful discouraged,
   atheism prevaileth: Neh. v. 9, Also I said, It is not good that ye do;
   ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of
   the heathen our enemies?' On the contrary, when wo give every one their
   due, we bring honour to God and credit to religion; you can the better
   hold up the profession of it against contra diction, hold up head
   before God and man. Now justice is so lovely, partly as it is a
   stricture of the image of God, as before, in which respect it is said,
   Prov. xii. 26, The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.' Men
   are convinced that he is a more perfect man, fitter to be trusted, as
   being one that will deal faithfully. And partly because the welfare of
   human society is promoted by such things: Titus iii. 8, These things
   are good and profitable for men.'

   [6.] And indeed that is my last reason; it conduceth so much to the
   good of human society. A Christian is a member of a double
   community--of the church and of the world; the one in order to eternal
   life, the other in order to the present life; as a man, and as a
   Christian. Without justice what would the world be but a den of
   thieves? Remove justitiam, &c., saith St Augustine. The world cannot
   subsist without justice: The king's throne is established by
   righteousness,' Prov. xvi. 10. The nation gets honour and reputation by
   it abroad: Prov. xiii. 34, Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin is
   a reproach to any people.' Never did the people of the Jews, nor any
   other nation whose history is come to our ears, flourish so much as
   when they were careful and exact in maintaining righteousness. And as
   to persons, all commerce between man and man is kept up by justice. And
   if this be a truth, that God, and not the devil, doth govern the world,
   and distribute rewards and the blessings of this life, surely then
   justice, which is a compliance with God's will, is the way to be
   exalted, and to live well in the world, and not lying, cozening, and
   dissembling.

   2. It is very comfortable to us to be just. The comfort of
   righteousness is often spoken of in scripture: Prov. xxix. 6, In the
   transgression of an evil man there is a snare; but the righteous doth
   sing and rejoice;' whatever befalleth him, good or evil, much or
   little, in life or death. Good or evil; if good, he hath comfort in his
   portion, because what he hath he hath by the fair leave and allowance
   of God's providence: Prov. xiii. 25, The righteous eateth to the
   satisfying of his soul;' he hath enough, because he hath what God seeth
   fit for him; he hath enough to supply his wants, enough to satisfy his
   desires; sometimes it is much, sometimes it is little. It is much some
   times, for they are under the blessing of the promise: Deut. xvi. 20,
   That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live,
   and inherit the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.' Justice shalt
   thou follow; if you will take care for that, God will take care to
   bless you. If it be little, that little is better than more gotten by
   fraud and injustice: Prov. xvi. 8, Better is a little with
   righteousness, than great revenues without right;' Prov. xv. 16, 17,
   Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure, and
   trouble therewith;' though it be but a dinner of herbs: Ps. xxxvii. 16,
   A little that a righteous man hath is better than the treasures of many
   wicked.' The comfort, if they will stand to the scriptures, lieth not
   in abundance, but in God's blessing. There is more satisfaction in
   their small provisions than in the greatest plenty. Suppose their
   condition be evil, whatsoever evil a just man suffers, he shall get
   some good by it, living or dying, and so still hath ground of comfort:
   if scorned or neglected, he hath the comfort of his innocent dealing to
   bear him out. As Samuel, when he and his house was laid aside, 1 Sam.
   xii. 2, 3, he appeals to them, Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
   I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or from whose
   hands have I received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith, and I will
   restore it?' If you are opposed and maligned, you may plead against
   your enemies as Moses did, Num. xvi. 15, Respect riot their offerings;
   I have not taken an ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.'
   You may plead thus when you are sure you have not wronged them. If you
   are oppressed, as David in the text, you may appeal to the God of your
   righteousness. In life, in death, they have the comfort of their
   righteousness; in life, Deut. xvi. 20, as before. In death; Prov. xiv.
   32, The righteous man hath hope in his death;' Isa. xxxviii. 3,
   Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, that I have walked before thee in
   truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in
   thy sight.' When he is going the way of all the earth, this will be a
   comfort to him, that he hath done no wrong, but served God faithfully,
   and lived with men without guile and deceit. Oh, for comforts for a
   dying hour! Now this comfort ariseth partly from a good conscience, and
   partly from the many promises of God that are made to righteousness.

   [1.] From peace of conscience. We are told, Prov. xv. 15, That a good
   conscience is a continual feast.' Ahasuerus made a magnificent feast,
   that lasted a hundred and eighty days; but this is a continual feast, a
   dish we are never weary of. Now, who have this feast? The crooked, the
   subtle, the deceitful? No; but those that walk with a simple and
   plain-hearted honesty: 2 Cor. i. 12, This is our rejoicing, the
   testimony of our consciences, that in simplicity and godly sincerity we
   have had our conversation in the world.' They have comfort in all
   conditions: Acts xxiv. 16, Herein do I exercise myself always, to keep
   a conscience void of offence towards God and towards men.' Others are
   like trees of the forest, every wind shaketh them; but they are the
   garden of God: Cant. iv. 16, Awake, O north wind; blow, south wind,
   upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.' Out of what
   corner soever the wind bloweth, it bloweth good to them.

   [2.] Partly from the many promises of God, both as to the world to come
   and this present life. For the world to come, the question is put, Ps.
   xv. 1, and it were well we would often put it to our hearts, Lord, who
   shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?' It is
   answered, He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
   speaketh the truth with his heart, that backbiteth not with his tongue,
   nor doth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his
   neighbour;' a man that maketh conscience of all his words and actions.
   So the apostle telleth us, in the new heavens and new earth there
   dwelleth righteousness, 2 Peter iii. 13. Then, for this world there are
   many promises: take a taste; this bringeth profit, and is only
   profitable: Prov. x. 2, Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but
   righteousness delivereth from death.' Men think to do anything with
   wealth, and that, naked honesty may be a-cold; they have food and
   physic, friends and honour; alas! how soon can God blow upon an estate
   and make it useless to us--make a man vomit up again his ill-gotten
   morsels! Job xx. 15, He hath swallowed down riches, and shall vomit
   them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.' As a man that
   hath eaten too much, though God permit him to get, he doth not permit
   him to hold what he hath gotten unjustly. There is a flaw in the title
   will one time or other cast them out of possession. Well, then, riches
   profit not. But what is profit able? 1 Tim. iv. 8, Godliness is
   profitable to all things.' And this part of godliness, righteousness,
   that will prolong life, and bring a blessing upon the soul of the
   righteous: Prov. x. 3, The Lord will not suffer the soul of the
   righteous to famish; but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.'
   Another promise; it bringeth preservation in times of difficulty and
   danger; he that hath carried it righteously, they know not how to lay
   hold upon him, and work him any mischief: Prov. xi. 3, The integrity of
   the upright shall guide him, but the perverseness of transgressors
   shall destroy them.' So again, Prov. xiii. 6, Righteousness keepeth him
   that is upright in the way, but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.' It
   is God keepeth us, but the qualification of the person kept is to be
   observed, it is he that is just and honest. We think it is the way to
   danger, because the eye of the flesh is more perspicuous than the eye
   of the spirit or mind; and we are more apt to see what is, and who is
   against us, than what and who is for us: Ps. xxv. 21, Let integrity and
   uprightness preserve me, for I wait on thee.' That which, in the
   judgment of the flesh, is the means of our ruin, is indeed the means of
   our preservation. So Isa. xxxiii. 15, He that walketh righteously, and
   speaketh uprightly,' &c. Again, for recovery out of trouble: Prov.
   xxiv. 15, 16, Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the
   righteous; spoil not his resting-place; for the just man falleth seven
   times, and riseth up again; but the wicked shall fall into mischief.'
   They may be persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
   destroyed.' There are strange changes of providence; we are up and
   down, but shall rise again; with the wicked it is not so. Again, for
   stability: Prov. x. 4, 5, As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no
   more; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.' Wicked men,
   being great in power, rend and tear all things, and bring down all
   things before them; but they have no foundation: the one is fleeting as
   the wind, the other is settled as the earth. So Prov. xii. 3, A man
   shall not be established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous
   shall not be moved.' Wicked men get up, seem high for the time, but
   they have no root, therefore soon wither: they have no root, as that
   ambassador, when he saw the treasure of St Mark, said, This hath no
   root. All their policies, secret friendships, shall never be able to
   keep them up. Ahab was told that God would root out him and all his
   family; he thought to avoid this threatening; gets many wives and
   concubines, by whom he hath seventy children, hoping that one of them
   would remain to succeed him; he committed their tutelage and education
   to the choicest of his nobility, men of Samaria, a strong town; but you
   see all this came to nought, 2 Kings x. So Prov. x. 36, The righteous
   shall never be moved, but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.'
   Every man that is in good estate would fain make it as firm and lasting
   as he can; these settle polities, contract friendships, use all means
   to make their acquisitions firm and secure, but pass by the main care,
   which is to settle things upon a righteous foundation, and therefore
   they shall not flourish. So for posterity: Prov. xi. 21, The seed of
   the righteous shall be delivered.' So Prov. xii. 7, The wicked are
   overthrown and are not, but the house of the righteous shall stand;'
   Prov. xx. 7, The just man walketh in his integrity; his children are
   blessed after him.' All our care is for posterity, man multiplied,
   continued; in short, all manner of blessings: Prov. xxi. 21, He that
   followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness,
   and honour.' He findeth life: Prov. xi. 19, As righteousness tendeth to
   life, so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death;' Prov.
   xii. 28, In the way of righteousness is life, and in the pathway
   thereof there is no death.' Righteousness; he shall have righteous
   dealing from others. Honour; he shall have a good name in the world,
   and be preferred when God thinks fit.

   Use. To press us to do judgment and justice--

   1. As to our private dealing with others; carry yourselves faithfully,
   and make conscience of justice and equity.

   [1.] Propound to do nothing but what is agreeable to righteousness and
   honesty: Prov. xii. 5, The thoughts of the righteous are right, but the
   counsels of the wicked are deceit.' Our evil purpose spoils all. A good
   man erreth sometimes through ignorance, incogitancy, or violence of
   temptation, overtaken or overborne; but he doth not propose to do evil,
   that is the property of the wicked.

   J2.] Be always exercising righteousness, as God giveth opportunity
   occasion: 1 John iii. 7, He that doth righteousness is righteous;' Ps.
   cvi. 3, Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doth
   righteousness at all times.' Justice must be observed in lesser things
   as well as in great, for where heaven and hell are concerned nothing is
   little, Luke xvi. 10. He that is faithful in that which is least, in
   minimo, o pisto`s en elachi'sto--he that is faithful in a little thing
   will not be unfaithful in anything. Many will be righteous in some
   thing, but in some others dispense with themselves.

   [3.] Do not depart from your rule and resolution of just dealing upon
   any temptation whatsoever. Men resolve to be just, but when the
   temptation cometh, their resolution is shaken. Oh! remember the
   greatest gain will not countervail your loss: Mat. xvi. 26, What is a
   man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'
   It will prove a poor bargain in the end; and there is no profit in what
   is gained unjustly; it is a certain loss, and so it will prove in the
   issue: Hab. ii. 9, 10, Woe unto him that coveteth an evil covetousness
   to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be
   delivered from the power of evil: thou hast consulted shame to thy
   house, and hast sinned against thine own soul.' You think to avoid all
   emergent evils; there needs no more to pull down the power and
   greatness of the oppressor than his studying to make it great; nothing
   destroyeth it so much.

   [4.] Take special heed to thyself that thou be not unrighteous when
   opportunity is offered, when put in places of power and trust. Many are
   innocent because they have no opportunity to be otherwise. It is said,
   John xii. 6, He was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put
   therein.' When corrupt affections and suitable temptations and objects
   meet, then it is dangerous to the soul.

   [5.] Take heed of covetousness: 1 Tim. vi. 10, The love of money is the
   root of all evil.' It will make a breach on thy duty when it is
   indulged; therefore take away the lusts, and temptations will have less
   power over thee.

   For motives--

   (1.) Righteousness is a christian's breastplate: Eph. vi. 14, And
   having on the breastplate of righteousness,' to defend the heart and
   vital parts. It keepeth the heart whole; if the breast be covered with
   a firm resolution to shun whatsoever is evil and unjust, temptations
   will not pierce us. Unless you arm yourself with this resolution, you
   will lose comfort, and lose grace.

   (2.) Consider how soon God breaketh in with a judgment when once men
   transgress righteousness: 1 Thes. iv. 6, Let no man go be yond his
   brother, nor defraud his brother; for God is the avenger of all such.'
   God, that is the patron of human society, will not suffer
   unrighteousness and injustice to go unpunished.

   2. In your public engagements, see that you have a good cause and a
   good conscience, and in due time God will plead your cause. (1.) See
   that you have a good cause; you must not intitle God to your petty
   quarrels and revenges: 1 Peter ii. 19, 20, For this is thankworthy, if
   a man for conscience towards God endure grief, suffering wrongfully;
   for what glory is it if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall
   take it patiently? but if when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take
   it patiently, this is acceptable with God:' 1 Peter iii. 16, 17, Having
   a good conscience, that whereas they speak evil of you as of
   evil-doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good
   conversation in Christ: for it is better, if the will of God be so,
   that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.' That epistle was
   penned in a suffering time. When you are exposed to hardships, be sure
   you are in God's way. (2.) As the cause is good, so must your carriage
   be. Do not step out of God's way for the greatest good. So many, if
   they may drive on their designs, they care not what they do, as if a
   good end would warrant them. Christ need not get up on the devil's
   shoulders. God is now bound to avenge this, for the wrath of God is
   revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.' In this evil day the
   righteous shall be saved. God saved Noah, a preacher of righteousness,
   and delivered just Lot, 2 Peter ii.

   Secondly, We have David's prayer, Leave me not to mine oppressors.' He
   beggeth help against the oppression of the enemy. I might observe--

   1. That it is no new thing to see innocent men troubled, oppressed,
   persecuted. He that could say, I have done judgment and justice, yet
   had his oppressors. As long as Satan wants not instruments, the people
   of God shall not want troubles; and the two seeds will never be
   reconciled. Therefore we should not censure the oppressed, and those
   that are fallen under the displeasure of men; and the oppressed
   themselves should not wonder at it--wicked men do but after their kind.

   2. That to be left of God under the oppression of wicked men is a
   grievous calamity, and earnestly to be deprecated.

   [1.] When are we said outwardly and visibly to be left by God under the
   oppression of wicked men?

   (1.) When he taketh off the restraints of his providence, and the hedge
   of his protection is broken down, and lets loose the enemy upon us, and
   we are left in the power of their hands: Dan. i. 2, The Lord gave the
   king of Judah into his hands.'

   (2.) When he doth not comfort us in such a condition, particularly when
   God's assistance is not vouchsafed. Sometimes he doth so: 2 Cor. i. 4,
   Who comforts us in all our tribulations.' At other times all is dark:
   Ps. lxxiv. 9, We see not our signs; there is no more any prophet,
   neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.'

   (3.) When he doth not direct us, and show us our duty: Ps. cxliii. 10,
   Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God, thy Spirit is good, lead
   me into the land of uprightness.' It was a time when his enemies
   prevailed over him. Now, if God hide counsel from us, we grope at
   noonday.

   (4.) When he doth not support us. Sometimes this, Ps. cxxxviii. 3, In
   the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with
   strength in my soul;' and Ps. xciv. 18, When I said my foot slippeth,
   thy mercy, O Lord, held me up;' Ps. lxxiii. 23, Nevertheless I am
   continually with thee: thou hast holden me up by my right hand.' David
   prayeth, Put me not into their power, do not let loose the reins; thou
   hast hindered them hitherto. It is thy mercy that all this while I have
   not been given up as a prey to their teeth; they want not malice and a
   will to take vengeance to the uttermost.

   [2.] It is a grievous calamity.

   (1.) It is a hard thing to be left to the will and lusts of men. David
   was in a strait; he chose rather to fall into the Lord's hands than
   into the hands of men: 2 Sam. xxiv. 14, I am in a great strait; let me
   now fall into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great, and not
   into the hand of man.' Men are revengeful, proud, insolent: wicked men
   will soon exceed their commission: Zech. i. 15, And I am very sore
   displeased with the heathen that are at ease; for I was but a little
   displeased, and they helped forward the affliction;' Deut. xxxii. 27,
   Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
   adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should
   say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.' God
   speaketh after the manner of men.

   (2.) It is a great mark of our Father's displeasure when he
   withdraweth, hideth counsel from us, leaveth us without support and
   comfort: Mat. ix. 15, And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the
   bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the
   days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then
   shall they fast.'

   [3.] It is earnestly to be deprecated, not only as a grievous calamity,
   but as hoping for relief: I will riot leave you orphanou`s,' John xiv.
   18, comfortless;' and Mat. xxviii. 20, Lo, I am with you to the end of
   the world.'

   Use. Go, then, and represent your condition to God with humiliation,
   owning his anger, but with faith waiting for his help. Tell him what a
   prey you have been to Satan; desire him, if he withdraw his presence
   one way, he will manifest it in another, in comforting, counselling his
   own people; tell him your weakness, the enemies' malice, and implore
   his aid and assistance.

SERMON CXXXIII.

   Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.--Ver.
   122.

   IN this verse we may observe a petition--(1.) Metaphorically expressed;
   (2.) Literally explained.

   In the former branch we have--(1.) The notion by which the help he
   expecteth from God is expressed: it is that of a surety, be surety for
   thy servant. (2.) The end and fruit of that help, or the terms on which
   he expecteth it, for good.

   In the literal explanation we have--(1.) The matter of the petition,
   let them not oppress me. (2.) An argument insinuated from the quality
   and disposition of his enemies, the proud.

   First, From the metaphorical notion, Be surety for thy servant,' we may
   observe this doctrine--

   Doct. In deep distress we have leave and encouragement to desire God to
   interpose for his people's relief.

   1. I shall open the notion of a surety.

   2. Show why we have leave and encouragement to desire God to interpose.

   First, For the notion of a surety. Symmachus, anade'xai me` eis
   agatho`n, receive me into thy protection for good. Septuagint, ekde'xai
   te doulo'n sou, suscipe servum tuum. It is a phrase taken from men when
   they are sureties for a debtor, to take him out of the hands of a cruel
   creditor who is ready to cast him into prison. And thus the prophet
   speaketh to God when he was in extreme danger, and could think of no
   help but God's.

   1. It implieth the danger imminent; when a sergeant hath attached a
   man, and he is ready to go to prison, and there is no means for him to
   escape, unless somebody be his surety to answer all the challenges and
   demands of the law. In this sense Hezekiah used it: Isa. xxxviii. 14, I
   am oppressed; undertake for me.' He spake it when he was summoned to
   the grave, to pay the debt we all owe to nature: I am like a poor
   debtor called to pay my debt speedily; therefore, Lord, be my pledge,
   deliver me out of this danger. So doth David here, when the proud were
   cruelly set upon his destruction. We are driven to God alone, and beat
   to the throne of grace by our miseries; yea, God lets the affairs of
   his people run on to loss and ruin, till we be in the condition of a
   debtor going to prison; he reserveth himself for such occasions till
   brought nigh to utter ruin, and all other inferior reliefs fail. And we
   must be content it should be so; for there is no use of a surety till
   we are attached. Imminent danger giveth notice that the Lord is coming.

   2. That this distress and misery cometh as a debt respecting God's laws
   and the higher court, where all things are decreed and sentenced before
   they are executed in the world, so it is a debt that must be paid, and
   distress is God's arrest. God is compared to a creditor, Luke vii. 41;
   therefore the miseries of God's people are expressed by chains, stocks,
   prisons, fetters, words that relate to a judicial proceeding. To
   chains: Lam. iii. 7, He hath made my chain heavy.' To stocks: Job xiii.
   27, Thou puttest my feet into the stocks.' To a prison: Ps. cxlii. 7,
   Bring my soul out of prison.' To fetters: Job xxxvi. 8, And if they be
   bound in fetters, and holden in cords of afflictions.' To a debt that
   must be paid, so is sin considered with respect to its punishment, Mat.
   vi. 12; Luke xi. 4, Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one
   that is indebted to us.' God puts the bond in suit, the instruments are
   but as sergeants and officers to demand of us satisfaction for breach
   of covenant with God. They think not so, neither doth their evil heart
   mean so; but so it is in God's purpose. When you are in trouble God
   hath committed you to prison, and there is no coming out without
   submission and humiliation, urging the satisfaction of Christ. You are
   sent thither by God's authority, and there is no getting out without
   his leave.

   3. That the party is insolvent and undone unless some course be taken
   to satisfy the creditor; he cannot help himself by his own wisdom and
   strength out of the danger. The debtor in the Gospel had nought to pay,
   Mat. xviii. 25. Why else should we look after a surety: Job xvii. 3,
   Put me in a surety with thee: who is he that will strike hands with
   me?' Man is not able to stand alone under the weight of his
   afflictions; it is a burden too heavy for us to bear. We have no might,
   2 Chron. xx. 12. God's people are often brought into such a case. When
   the principal is not solvendo, the surety answereth. We are weak, but
   he is strong; we are not able to subsist. They exceed us in carnal
   advantages; if force be to be resisted by force, they will easily
   overcome us, unless another that is stronger than we undertake for us.

   4. That the surety taketh upon him the debt of the principal person,
   and is to be responsible for it. God hath taken our obligation upon
   himself, to pay our debts, to oppose himself against all our wrongs. He
   will take our cause as his own: Ps. ix. 4, For thou hast maintained my
   right and my cause;' and in his own time and manner will show it to the
   world, and justify us against our enemies. Oh! how should our hearts
   rejoice in this, that he will be the party responsible, make our cause
   his own, and be liable to the suit as a debtor is to the creditor!; He
   that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye, Zech. ii. 8; He that
   despiseth you, despiseth me;' Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?'
   Acts ix. 4; and Isa. lxiii. 8, And he said, Surely they are my people,
   children that will not lie; so he was their saviour.'

   5. God is a sufficient surety. Here we may consider two things--the
   satisfaction of Christ, and the power of God's providence; in respect
   of both, which he is a pledge and surety every way sufficient for our
   comfort, safety, and deliverance.

   [1.] I would not leave out Christ's satisfaction, though it lie not so
   full in this text; for as God hath a hand in all our sufferings, and
   all our affairs are determined in a higher court, this satisfaction is
   necessary to answer the controversy and quarrel of God's justice
   against us. Thus Christ the second person is emphatikos, our surety:
   Heb. vii. 22, Christ is the surety of a better testament.' There is a
   double sort of surety--by way of caution and satisfaction, as sureties
   in case of debt and sureties for good behaviour; the one for what is
   past, the other for what is to come. The example of the one we have in
   Paul for Onesimus, Philem. 18, If he hath wronged or owed thee ought,
   put it upon my account; I Paul have written it with mine own hand, and
   I will repay it.' An example of the other we have in Judah for
   Benjamin: Gen. xliii. 9, I will be surety for him; at mine hand shalt
   thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before
   thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.' In both these respects
   Christ is a surety; he is our surety as a surety undertaketh for
   another to pay his debt; and he is our surety as he hath undertaken
   that his redeemed ones shall keep God's laws, be carried safe to
   heaven. Of his suretyship by way of caution we. speak now. Though
   Theodoret understand that in the text, Undertake for me that I shall
   keep thy laws; but it is more proper to consider the speech as it
   referreth to the payment of our debt by virtue of this suretyship.
   Solomon hath assured us, Prov. xi. 15, that he that is surety for
   another shall smart for it, or be broken and bruised. The same word is
   used concerning Christ, Isa. liii. 10. He was our surety, and was
   bruised and broken, suffered what we should have suffered. We have a
   right to appear to God's justice, but [12] our surety having made a
   full satisfaction for us, God will not exact the debt twice--of the
   surety and the principal. When the ram was taken Isaac was let go: Job
   xxxiii. 24, Deliver him from going down to the pit, for I have found a
   ransom.' Well, then, as our punishment is a due debt to God's justice,
   the Lord Christ undertaketh or is become a surety for us; not only our
   advocate to plead our cause, but our surety to pay our debt; from a
   judge become a party, and bound to pay what we owe: Isa. liii. 4,
   Surely he hath borne our griefs.'

   [2.] The power of God's providence. If God undertake for us, his bail
   is sufficient; none of our enemies can resist his almighty power,
   surely he is able to deal with our enemies: Isa. xxiii. 4, Who would
   set the briers and thorns against me in battle?' They are matter to
   feed the fire, not to quench it. He rescueth us just as going to
   prison. If he, put himself a pledge between us and our enemies, he will
   defeat all their oppositions and machinations against us, and stand
   between us and danger, as an able bail or surety doth between the
   creditor and poor debtor. Well, then, suretyship, as it noteth our
   necessity, so God's engagement, and his ability and faithfulness to do
   what he undertaketh. We must set God against the enemies: Isa. li. 13,
   And forgettest the Lord thy maker, who hath stretched forth the
   heavens, and laid the foundation of the earth; and hast feared
   continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he
   were ready to destroy; and where is the fury of the oppressor?' Dan.
   iii. 17, Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning
   fiery furnace.' We have the Almighty to be oar saviour and protector,
   why are you afraid of a man? God against man is great odds, if we had
   faith to see it: man is mortal, God is immortal; man is a poor weak
   creature, but God is almighty; what is he not able to do for us? Surely
   he will not leave his friends in the lurch; his power is such that he
   is able to keep us safe and sound.

   Secondly, The reasons why we have leave and encouragement to desire God
   to interpose.

   1. From God's covenant, where in the general there is a mutual engaging
   to be each other's. In our several capacities we engage to stand by God
   and own his cause, and God is engaged to stand by us. We make over
   ourselves, bodies, souls, interests, all to God. God, quantus quantus
   est, as great as he is, is all ours; therefore, if he be ours, we may
   pray him to appear for us, and own us in our distress and trouble. Our
   friend is a friend in distress. A gracious heart, by virtue of this
   mutual and interchangeable indenture, appears for God, and taketh his
   cause, though never so hated, as its own: The reproaches of them that
   reproached thee are fallen upon me,' Ps. vi. 9. We are his witnesses,
   Isa. xliii. 10. Surely it is too high a word for the creature; but God
   taketh our cause as his, is surety for us; by virtue of the general
   tenor of the covenant he is our God, jure venit in auxilium nostrum,
   his covenant engageth him to undertake for us. More particularly God
   undertaketh to defend and maintain his people; as to be a rewarder, so
   to be a defender: Gen. xv. 1, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great
   reward.' And Ps. lxxxiv. 11, For the Lord is a sun and a shield.' This
   defence is sometimes expressed, with respect to the violence of
   assaults in the world, by the notion of a shield. So, with respect to
   the process of the law, by the notion of a surety; Isa. lii. 3, we have
   the term of a redeemer. So that we have leave to pray him to fulfil his
   covenant engagement.

   2. God's affection is such that he will refuse no office that may be
   for his people's comfort. We are often dissuaded from suretyship,
   especially for strangers, by the wise man, with great vehemency and in
   stance: Prov. vi. 1, 2, My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if
   thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, thou art snared with the
   words of thy mouth;' Prov. xi. 15, He that is surety for a stranger
   shall smart for it;' Prov. xvii. 18, A man void of understanding
   striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend;'
   Prov. xx. 16, Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;' Prov.
   xxii. 26, 27, Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them
   that are sureties for debts: if thou hast nothing to pay, why should he
   take the bed from under thee?' and in other places. Our pity is stirred
   towards a man that is like to be undone and ruined; therefore there is
   such dissuading from suretyship. And hath not God a greater pity over
   the afflictions of his people? He pities the afflictions of them that
   suffer most justly, yea, far below their desert: Judges x. 16, His soul
   was grieved for the misery of Israel;' 2 Kings xiv. 26, For the Lord
   saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was
   not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.' How much
   more will he pity them that are unjustly oppressed of men! Acts vii.
   34, I have seen the afflictions of my people which is in Egypt, and
   have heard their groanings, and am come down to deliver them.' His
   bowels worketh; God loveth his people better than they love themselves.
   fide-jube, Domme, pro servo.

   3. Our relation to him: I am thy servant, and I know thou art a good
   master; and he is our sovereign Lord, and therefore hath under taken to
   provide for us: the master was to be the servant's patronus. God hath
   found us work, and he will find us defence. This the argument of the
   text, Be surety for thy servant.' We are employed in his work, engaged
   in his cause. If a rich man set a poor man at work, as to dig such a
   ditch, if he be afterwards troubled for it, the rich man is concerned
   to bear him out: Ps. cxvi. 16, O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy
   servant, and the son of thy handmaid.' Whilst we are engaged about our
   master's business, and in his work, he is engaged to protect us, and
   bear us out in it.

   4. Our very running to him, and committing ourselves into his hands, is
   an engaging God: Ps. lxxxvi. 2, Preserve my soul, for I am holy, O thou
   my God; save thy servant that trusteth in thee;' Ps. x. 14, The poor
   committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.'
   Employ God, and find him work; he will not fail to do what he is
   intrusted with: Ps. lvii. 1, Be merciful unto me, God, be merciful unto
   me, for my soul trusteth in thee; yea, in the shadow of thy wing will I
   make my refuge, until these calamities be over-past.' God taketh it
   well that we should make bold with him in this kind, and tell him how
   we trust him, and expect relief from him. Nothing is so dishonourable
   to God, nor vexatious to us, as the disappointment of trust. An
   ingenuous man will not fail his friend that doth trust and rely upon
   him, much less will a faithful God fail those that look to him, and
   depend upon him for help.

   Use. Advice to us what we should do in our deep distresses and
   troubles; when able to do nothing for ourselves, God will be surety,
   that is, make our cause his own.

   1. As your matters depend in a higher court, and with respect to your
   own guilt and sin, which hath cast you into these troubles, acknowledge
   your debt, but look upon Christ as your surety, who gave himself a
   ransom for us. The controversy between God and us must be taken up by
   submission on our parts, for God is an enemy that cannot be overcome,
   but must be reconciled. The way is not to persist in the contest, and
   stand it out, but beg terms of peace for Christ's sake: 2 Chron. vi.
   38, 39, If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their
   soul, then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling-place,
   their prayers and supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive
   thy people which have sinned against thee;' Job v. 8, I would seek unto
   God, and unto God would I commit my cause.'

   2. As your danger lieth with men, acknowledge your impotency. but
   consider who is your surety, and will take your part against the
   instruments that have had a hand in your trouble.

   [1.] God, who hath such a pity over his suffering servants, is ready
   ever to do them good: Ps. xxxv. 1, Plead my cause, O Lord, with them
   that strive with me; fight against them that fight against me.' He is
   in such full relation, and so fast bound to them, that they may not be
   weary and impatient and swallowed up of despair, he will interpose. God
   seeth our sufferings, heareth our groans, suffereth together with us,
   and is afflicted in all our afflictions. Believe it assuredly that he
   will take the matter into his own hand, and be the party responsible:
   Ps. cxl. 12, I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the
   afflicted, and the right of the poor.' Woe be to them that would not
   have God for their party, joined in the cause of the afflicted. God
   hath given assurance of his protection not by words only, but by deeds:
   Prov. xxii. 23, The Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of
   those that spoiled them.' He hath passed his word, and he will do it:
   Prov. xxiii. 11, For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their
   cause with thee.' It is his title, Isa. li. 22, Thus saith thy Lord,
   the Lord and thy God, that pleadeth the cause of his people;' not by a
   verbal or local, but a real and active plea: Ezek. xxxviii. 22, And I
   will plead against him with pestilence, and with blood; and I will rain
   upon him, and upon his bands, and the people that are with him, an
   overflowing rain, and great hail stones, fire and brimstone.' And Isa.
   l. 8, He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us
   stand together; who is mine adversary? let him come near to me;' that
   is, let him join issue with me, commence his suit in law. We should be
   confident upon God's undertaking: Jer. l. 34, Their redeemer is strong,
   the Lord of hosts is his name; he shall thoroughly plead their cause,
   that he may give rest to the land.' It is a great ease in affliction to
   commit our cause unto God, and put our affairs into his hand.

   [2.] God, who hath such power; we need not fear any opposite if God be
   our surety: Ps. xxvii. 1, The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom
   shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be
   afraid?' Ps. xlvi. 1, 2, God is our refuge and strength, a very present
   help in trouble; therefore will not we fear, though the earth be
   removed, and the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;' a
   resolution to adhere to God and his truth whatever cometh. If they be
   mighty, God is mightier; if they be crafty, God is wiser. It is a great
   crime to fear men so as not to trust in God; it is a great sin to fear
   men so as not to fear God. When we comply with them in things
   displeasing to God, this is to set men above God.

   Secondly, We come to the limitation, end, or fruit of this suretyship,
   For good.' There are three expositions of this clause, as noting the
   end, the cause, the event. (1.) Undertake for me, ut sim bonus et
   justus; so Rabbi Arama on the place, Be surety for me that I may be
   good. Theodoret expounds it, Undertake that I shall make good my
   resolution of keeping thy law. He that enjoineth, under taketh. Though
   we have precepts and promises, without God's undertaking we shall never
   be able to perform our duty. (2.) In good,' so some read it. God would
   not take his part in an evil cause. To commend a wrong cause to God's
   protection is to provoke him to hasten our punishment, to make us serve
   under our oppressors. But when we have a good cause and a good
   conscience, he will own us. We cannot expect he should maintain us and
   bear us out in the devil's service, wherein we have entangled ourselves
   by our own sin. (3.) For good;' so it is often rendered: Ps. lxxxvi.
   17, Show me a token for good;' Jer. xiv. 11, Pray not for this people
   for good.' So Neh. xiii. 31, Remember me, O my God, for good.' So here,
   Be surety for thy servant for good.'

   Doct. We should only desire the interposing of God's providence so as
   may be for good to us.

   I shall first give you the reasons, and then give you some rules
   concerning this good here mentioned.

   Reason 1. Because then we pray according to God's undertaking: Ps.
   xxxiv. 10, But they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing;'
   they may want food, want raiment, want many things, but they shall want
   no good thing: Ps. lxxxiv. 11, No good thing will he withhold.' He may
   keep us low and bare, withhold many temporal mercies from us, feed us
   from hand to mouth, and short commons may be sweet and wholesome, and
   deny to give us larger revenues and in comes. If they were good for us,
   we should have them. God with holds these things so as our need and
   good doth require: Jer. xxiv. 5, Whom I have sent out of this place
   into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.' Their captivity was for
   good.

   Reason 2. Because then we pray according to the new nature; old nature
   would have ease, the new nature would have grace; the flesh would be
   pleased, but the spirit would be profited; and God hears not the voice
   of the flesh, but the spirit in prayer: Rom. viii. 27, He that
   searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit, because he
   maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God.'

   Let me give you some rules.

   1. This good is not always the good of the flesh, not always the good
   of prosperity. Sometimes the good of prosperity may be good: Prov.
   xxiv. 25, But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good
   blessing shall come upon them.' A good blessing shall come upon them
   that plead God's cause against the wicked. There is the blessing of
   prosperity-good and adversity-good. All good is more or less, so as it
   cometh near or less near the chiefest good; therefore that is good that
   tendeth to make us spiritually better, more like to God, and capable of
   communion with him. Lam. iii. 27, It is good for a man that he bear the
   yoke in his youth.' That is good which conduceth to our everlasting
   good.

   2. God knoweth what is better for us [13] than we do ourselves. Wo ask
   a knife wherewith to cut ourselves. It would be the greatest misery if
   God should always carve out our condition according to our own fancy;
   we would soon pray ourselves into a snare if our will were the rule of
   our prayers, and ask that which would be cruelty in God to grant. I
   will give you an instance in Lot, Gen. xix. 17, 18, Make haste, escape
   to the mountain, lest thou be consumed: I cannot, saith he, escape to
   the mountain, behold now this city is near, it is but a little one, and
   my soul shall live.' Lot presenteth his own fancy to God's counsel and
   choice for him: this little place was in the plain; he was persuaded
   the shower of brimstone would overtake him before he got thither. Often
   it is thus with us; though God should command and we obey, we lift up
   our will above his, and doat upon our own fancies, and will prescribe
   to God, think it is better to live by sense than by faith. This
   mountain was the weaker border of the plain. [14] Now this was weakness
   in Lot surely. God, that had taken him out of Sodom by the hand of his
   angels, stricken the Sodomites with blindness, which was an instance of
   God's great power and goodness to him. Now compare the 17th and 18th
   verses with the 30th verse, And Lot went out of Zoar, and dwelt in the
   mountain, he and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in
   Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.' Mark here,
   when God biddeth him go to the mountain, then he goeth to Zoar; when
   God gave him leave to tarry in Zoar, then he goes and dwells in the
   mountain: he was afraid in Zoar, when he saw the horrible desolation of
   all the country about it. Now see the ill success of his own choice,
   and how badly we provide for ourselves: a little time will show us our
   sin and folly: his abode in the mountain drew him to incest. Another
   instance: Hosea xiii. 11, I gave them a king in mine anger, and took
   him away in my wrath.' God may let things succeed with us to our hurt:
   If we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us;' 1 John v. 14.
   God is a God of wisdom, he knoweth certainly what will be good for us.
   He is a God of bowels, and loveth us dearly, and will certainly cast
   all things for the best; therefore God is to be judge both for time and
   kind of our deliverance, otherwise we may meet with wrath in every
   condition, whether we want or have our will; but if we refer it to him,
   we shall never want what is best for us. The shepherd must choose our
   pastures, whether lean or fat, bare or full grounds. The child is not
   to be governed by his fancy, but the father's discretion; nor the sick
   man by his own fancy, but the physician's skill: our will is not the
   chief reason of all things.

   3. That which is not good may be good, and though for the present we
   see it not, yet we shall see it; though not good in its nature, it may
   be good in its fruit: Rom. viii. 28, We know that all things shall work
   together for good to them that love God;' a little faith and a little
   patience will discover it. As poisonous ingredients in a medicine, take
   them singly, and they are destructive; but as tempered with other
   things by the hands of a skilful physician, so they are whole some and
   useful: Heb. xii. 11, No affliction for the present seemeth joyous, but
   grievous.' The rod is a sour thing for the present, but wait a little,
   this bitter root may yield sweet fruit: God can so over rule it in his
   providence. So Ps. cxix. 71, It is good for me that I have been
   afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.' Ask a man under the cross,
   Is it good to feel the lashes of God's correcting hand? No; but when he
   hath been exercised, and found lust mortified, the world crucified, and
   gotten evidences of God's favour, then it is good that I have been
   afflicted.

   4. This good is not to be determined by feeling, but by faith: Ps.
   lxxiii. 1, Yet God is good to Israel, and to such as are of a clean
   heart.' God is good to his people, however he seem to deal hardly with
   them: sense judgeth it ill, but faith saith it is good; it seeth a
   great deal of love in pain and smart. There is such a difference
   between faith and sense as there was between Elisha and his servant, 2
   Kings vi. 15, 16; the servant saw the host of the enemies, but he did
   not see the fiery chariots and horsemen that were for his help; Elisha
   saw both. So believers see not only the bitterness that is in God's
   chastenings, but the sweet fruits in the issue. Faith can look at the
   pride and power of wicked men as a vain thing, when they are in the
   height of their power and greatness: Job v. 3, I have seen the foolish
   taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation;' that is,
   prophetically, not passionately; foretelling evil, not wishing it. When
   they were taking root, as themselves and other worldly men thought, I
   judged him unhappy, foretold his end and destruction. There is much of
   the spirit of prophecy in faith. When others applaud, make little gods
   of them, he looketh through all their beauty, riches and honour: Ps.
   xcii. 7, When the wicked spring as the grass, and all the workers of
   iniquity do flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed for ever.'
   Grass will wither and dry up of its own accord, especially when there
   is a worm at the root. Their very prosperity, as it ferments their
   lusts, and hardeneth their hearts, is a means to draw on their
   destruction: Ps. xxxix. 5, Man in his best estate is vanity.' Then,
   when they seem to have all things under their feet, who could harm
   them? so that none dare open the mouth, move the wing, or peep; yet God
   can easily blast and whip them with an unseen scourge.

   5. Good is of several sorts, temporal, spiritual, eternal.

   [1.] Temporal good. Cross accidents conduce to that: Gen. l. 20, Ye
   thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good; to bring to pass
   as it is this day, and to save much people alive.' The Egyptians and
   themselves had wanted a preserver if Joseph had not been sold and sent
   into Egypt. If a man were to go to sea in a voyage upon which his heart
   was much set, but the ship is gone before he cometh, but after he
   heareth that all that were in the ship are drowned, then he would say,
   This disappointment was for good. As Crassus' rival in the Parthian war
   was intercepted and cut off by the craft of the barbarians, had no
   reason to stomach his being refused. Many of us have cause to say,
   Periissem nisi periissem--we had suffered more if we had suffered less.
   In the story of Joseph there is a not able scheme and draught of
   providence. He is cast into a pit, thence drawn forth and sold to the
   Ishmaelites, by them sold into Egypt, and sold again. What doth God
   mean to do with poor Joseph? He is tempted to adultery; refusing the
   temptation, he is falsely accused, kept for a long time in ward and
   duress. Ail this is against him; who would have thought that in the
   issue this should be turned to his good? that the prison had been the
   way to preferment, and that by the pit he should come to the palace of
   the king of Egypt, and exchange his parti-coloured coat for a royal
   robe? Thus in temporal things we get by our losses, and God chooseth
   better for us than we could have chosen for ourselves. Let God alone to
   his undertaking, and he will manage our affairs better than we looked
   for.

   [2.] Good spiritual: Heb. xii. 10, For they verily for a few days
   chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we
   might be partakers of his holiness.' What do we call profit? The good
   things of this world, and the great mammon which so many worship? No;
   some better thing, some spiritual and divine benefit, a participation
   of God's holiness. Then we profit when we grow in grace and are more
   god-like, when we are more concerned as a soul than a body. It is a
   good exchange to part with outward comforts for inward holiness. If God
   take away our peace, and give us peace of conscience, we have no cause
   to complain. If our outward wants be recompensed with the abundance of
   inward grace, 1 Cor. iv. 10, and we have less of the world that we may
   have the more of God, and be kept poor that we may be rich in faith,
   James ii. 5, 6; if we have a healthy soul in a sickly body, as Gains
   had, 3 John 2; if an aching head maketh way for a better heart,--doth
   not God deal graciously and lovingly with us?

   [3.] Our eternal good. Heaven will make amends for all that we endure
   here. This mainly is intended in Rom. viii. 28, All things shall work
   together for good to them that love God.' And then in the 29th and 30th
   verses, he presently bringeth in the golden chain, 4 Whom he did
   predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, he justified;
   and those whom he justified, them he also glorified.' So 2 Cor. iv. 17,
   This light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
   more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;' it shall either hasten or
   secure our glorious estate. A man may lose ground by a temptation, his
   external good may be weakened, his soul suffereth loss; but this
   warneth him of his weakness, and quickeneth him to stand upon his
   watch, and to look up more to Christ for strength against it. Or he may
   be cut off, and perish in the affliction; but then his glorious estate
   cometh in possession.

   6. That may be good for the glory of God which doth not conduce to our
   personal benefit; and the glory of God is our great interest, John xi.
   27, 28, Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me
   from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour, Father,
   glorify thy name. Then there came a voice from heaven, saying, I have
   both glorified it, and will glorify it again.' There was the innocent
   inclination of his human nature, Father, save me from this hour;' and
   the overruling sense of his duty, or the obligation of his office, But
   for this cause came I to this hour.' We are often tossed and tumbled
   between inclinations of nature and conscience of duty; but in a
   gracious heart it prevaileth above the desire of our own comfort and
   satisfaction: the soul is cast for any course that God shall see
   fittest for his glory. Nature would be rid of trouble, but grace
   submitteth all interests to God's honour; that should be dearer to us
   than anything else; were it not selfishness and want of zeal, that
   would be our greatest interest.

SERMON CXXXIV.

   Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.--Ver.
   122.

   USE. It informeth us what reason there is to pray and wait with
   submission to the will of God. God will answer us according to our
   trouble, not always according to our will. He is wiser than we, for he
   knoweth that our own will would undo us. If things were in our own
   hands, we would never see an ill day, and in this mixed estate that
   would not be good for us. But all weathers are necessary to make the
   earth fruitful, rain as well as sunshine. We must not mistake the use
   and efficacy of prayer. We are not as sovereigns to govern the world at
   our pleasure, but as supplicants humbly to submit our desires to the
   supreme Being. Not to command as dictators, and obtrude any model upon
   God, but to solicit as servants: Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion,'
   Ps. li. 18. If we would have things done at our pleasure, we should be
   the judges, and God only would have the place of the executioner. Our
   wills would be the supreme and chief reason of all things. But this God
   cannot endure; therefore beg him to do good, but according to his own
   good pleasure.

   1. Let us submit to God for the mercy itself, in what kind we shall
   have it, whether temporal, spiritual, or eternal. If God see ease good
   for us, we shall have it; if deliverance good for us, we shall have it,
   Ps. cxxviii. 2; or give us strength in our souls, or hasten our glory.
   We should be as a die in the hand of providence, to be cast high or
   low, as God pleaseth: 1 Sam. iii. 18, It is the Lord; let him do what
   seemeth him good.'

   2. Let us submit for the time. Though Jesus loved Lazarus, yet he abode
   still two days in the same place when he heard he was sick, John xi. 6.
   It is not for want of love if he doth not help us presently, nor want
   of power. Christ may dearly love us, yet delay to help us, even in
   extremity, till a fit time come, wherein his glory may shine forth, and
   the mercy be more conspicuous. He doth not slight us, though he doth
   delay us; he will choose that time which maketh most for his own glory.
   Submit to God's dispensations, and in due time you shall see a reason
   of them.

   3. Let us submit for the way and means. We know not what God is
   a-doing: John xiii. 6, 7, Then cometh he to Simon Peter, and Peter
   saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said
   unto him, What I do thou knowest not, but thou shalt know hereafter.'
   No wonder we are much in the dark, if we consider, first, that the
   worker of these works is Wonderful in counsel and excellent in
   working,' Isa. xxviii. 29; infinitely beyond politicians, whose
   projects and purposes are often hidden from us; therefore much more
   his. Secondly, That the ways of his working are very strange and
   imperceptible, for he maketh things out of nothing: Rom. iv. 17, And
   calleth those things that be not as though they were;' one contrary out
   of another, as light out of darkness, 2 Cor. iv. 6, meat out of the
   eater, enemies catched in their own snare. Thirdly, That his end in
   working is not to satisfy our sense and curiosity: Isa. xlviii. 7, They
   are created now, and not from the beginning, even before the day when
   thou heardest them not, lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them;'
   Isa. xlii. 16, I will bring the blind by a way they knew not; I will
   lead them' in paths that they have not known.' He chooseth such a way
   as may leave enemies to harden their hearts; Micah iv. 12, But they
   know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they his counsel;
   for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.'

   Secondly, I now come to the literal explanation; and there we have--

   1. The evil deprecated, oppress me.

   2. The persons likely to inflict it, the proud.

   First, The evil deprecated, Let not the proud oppress me.' The
   Septuagint, me` sukophantesa'tosa'n me upere'phanoi, let them not
   calumniate me. The Septuagint takes this word for oppression or violent
   injustice, and therein are followed by St Luke iii. 14, xix. 8.

   Doct. Oppression is a very grievous evil, and often deprecated by the
   people of God.

   1. I shall show you what oppression is. It is an abuse of power to
   unjust and uncharitable actions. That it is an abuse of power appeareth
   by the object of it, who are those that are usually oppressed; that is,
   either the poor and needy: Deut. xxiv. 14, Thou shalt not oppress an
   hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or
   of the strangers within thy gates.' The fatherless and the widow are
   mentioned: Jer. vii. 6, Ye shall not oppress the stranger, the
   fatherless, and the widow.' The stranger: Zech. vii. 10, And oppress
   not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor;' and
   Exod. xxii. 21-23, Thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him,
   for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. Ye shall not afflict any
   widow, or fatherless child; if thou afflict them in any wise, and they
   cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry.'

   2. The subject or agent by whom it is practised--(1.) The proud;' the
   mighty, rich, great man; at least comparatively, in regard to the
   wronged party: Eccles. iv. 1, And on the side of their oppressors there
   was power, but the oppressed had no comforter;' Job xxxv. 9, By reason
   of the multitude of oppressors they make the oppressed cry, and by
   reason of the arm of the mighty.' (2.) The base and mean, when they get
   power into their hands, to oppress the rich, noble, and honourable:
   Isa. iii. 5, And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another,
   and every one by his neighbour; the child shall behave himself proudly
   against the ancient, and the base against the honour able.' It is
   commonly more insolent and cruel and contemptuous and despiteful: Prov.
   xxviii. 3, A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain
   that leaveth no food.' When men do unjust and uncharitable actions, as
   when men bear it proudly or insolently towards them, throwing them out
   of their riches, denying them the liberty of their service because it
   is in the power of their hands, or taking advantage of their low
   condition to run over them, or making an advantage of their necessity
   and want of skill: Hosea xii. 7, He is a merchant, the balance of
   deceit is in his hand; he loveth to oppress;' or prejudice their
   testimony to the truth by our credit and esteem in the church,
   rendering them so weak or wicked, factious or foolish, as not to be
   regarded.

   3. This is a grievous evil; it is so in itself, and may be specially
   aggravated as to cases.

   [1 ] It is grievous in itself, as it is so odious to God, as being a
   perversion of the end of his providence. Those that excel in any
   quality are appointed for the protection and support of the weak and
   indigent. God gave them their wealth and parts and power and credit and
   greatness, to the end they might comfort, counsel, defend, and do good
   to those that want these things. Now when they make no oilier use of
   their power than lions and bears do, to mischief others by it, they do
   evil because it is in the power of their hands, Micah ii. 1. Power, if
   men have not a great tenderness of conscience and fear of God. is an
   unwieldy wilful thing, degenerates into oppression: Isa. x. 14, 15,
   There, was none that moved the wing, or opened the month, or peeped.
   Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall
   the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod
   should shake itself against, them that lift it up, or as if the staff
   should lift up itself as if it were no wood.' Therefore he went on to
   oppress and tyrannise in the world, because none durst to oppose him.
   Power needs much balance to temper and allay it.

   [2.] It is so offensive to his people, and burthensome to them: Eccles.
   vii. 7, Oppression maketh a wise man mad;' it shaketh and discomposeth
   those of the best temper, makes them pray and weep. and cry before the
   Lord: Eccles. iv. 1, So I returned and considered all the oppressions
   under the sun, and beheld the tears of such as are oppressed.' When you
   lay such heavy loads upon them that they are not able to bear it, but
   cry to God to right them.

   [3.] The evil itself, oppression. It is not only theft, but murder.
   These expressions we have: Isa. iii. 13, 14, Ye have eaten up the
   vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses. What mean ye. that
   ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? l hat is,
   cause them by your hard usage to pine away? So Micah iii. 1-3, And I
   said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house
   of Israel, is it not for you to know judgment, who hate the good, and
   love the evil, who pluck off their skin and their flesh from off their
   bones? who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
   off them, and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for
   the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron?' It is in God's account
   human butchery and murder, beyond simple slaughter, as they make them
   die a lingering death.

   [4.] It is especially aggravated if they be God's servants oppressed
   for religion: Ps. xii. 5, For the oppression of the poor, for the
   sighing of the needy; now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set,
   them in safety, from him that puffeth at him.' The proud persecutor
   doth little think of the godly, that any power he hath can do anything
   to help him; therefore mocketh at all his hopes: therefore, when God
   hath exercised the godly for a while, he will arise, Ac. I say the sin
   is aggravated by the innocency, the holiness, the usefulness of the
   party oppressed, when titled to glorify God, and do service to the
   public, and disabled to the prejudice of both.

   [5.] It is the highest impiety to fetch power and advantage from any
   ordinance of God to commit it: John xix. 10, 11, Then said Pilate unto
   him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to
   crucify thee, and have power to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou
   couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee
   from above 1; therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater
   sin.' Courts of justice, that should be sanctuaries and places of
   refuge to oppressed innocency, they make slaughter houses and shops of
   cruelty. When pretexts of laws and justice are used to colour the
   oppression and persecution of innocent useful per sons, this makes it
   more odious in the sight of God.

   Use 1. Oh, pity the oppressed! Job vi. 14, To him that is afflicted,
   pity should he showed from his friend; hut he forsaketh the fear of the
   Almighty.' The men of Keilah thought of delivering up David, because
   they feared not God, 1 Sam. xxiii. 11, 12. But men have no fear of God,
   but too much fear of men. When God is angry, God will suffer none to
   help: Ps. lxxxviii. 18, Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and
   mine acquaintance into darkness;' Job xii. 5, He that is ready to slip
   with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at
   ease.' Sensuality will make us forget the afflictions of others: Amos
   vi. 4-6, They lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their
   couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the
   midst of the stall; that chaunt to the sound of the viol, and invent to
   themselves instruments of music like David; that drink wine in bowls,
   and anoint themselves with the chief ointments, but they are not
   grieved for the afflictions of Joseph.' Scruples of conscience through
   difference in religion: John iv. 9, How is it that thou, being a Jew,
   askest water of me?' Therefore we should pity others; we have God's
   example: 2 Cor. vii. 6, God that comforteth those that are cast down.'

   Use 2. Keep from oppression; let us be far from this sin. Samuel
   professeth his innocency: 1 Sam. xii. 3, 4, Behold here I am, witness
   against me before the Lord and his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or
   whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I
   oppressed? or of whose hand have I received a bribe to blind mine eyes
   therewith? And they said, Thou hast not defrauded nor oppressed us.'

   Motives.

   1. God will right the wrongs of the oppressed: Prov. xxii. 22, 23, Rob
   not the poor, because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in the
   gate; for the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those
   that spoiled them;' Prov. xxiii. 11, For their redeemer is mighty, he
   shall plead their cause with thee.' It belongeth to him as supreme
   judge and mighty potentate: Eccles. v. 8, If thou seest the oppression
   of the poof, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a
   province, marvel not at the matter, for he that is higher than the
   highest regardeth, and there be higher than they.' Who can break the
   power of the greatest? The poor and indigent have none to own them, to
   resent the things done unto them, but God, who is the supreme Lord,
   will not fail to own them.

   2. Consider the injustice of such dealing, as being contrary to that
   rule of reason, Quod tibi non vis fieri, alteri ne feceris. Every man
   should do as he would have others do to him. Put yourself in their
   case. Take this rule quite away, and there is nothing so false, bad,
   cruel, that you would not be drawn to think or say or do against your
   brother. Uncharitableness, and want of sympathy with us in our
   troubles, much more insulting over us in our miseries, we look on it
   with detestation; and shall we oppress and afflict others when we have
   power so to do? Those that profess themselves Christians should be far
   from this sin. Means.

   1. The fear of God should bear rule in our hearts: Job xxxi. 23, For
   destruction from God was a terror to me; and by reason of his highness
   I could not endure;' Lev. xxv. 17, Ye shall not, therefore, oppress one
   another, but thou shalt fear thy God; for I am the Lord your God.' We
   should be afraid to do them injury, as if a strong party, able to repay
   injuries, were ready to be avenged upon us for it.

   2. Take heed of envy, covetousness, pride, revenge; these are
   ill-counsellors. Ahab envies Naboth's vineyard, and covets it, and that
   put him upon oppressing him. So Hosea xii. 7, He is a merchant, the
   balances of deceit are in his hand; he loveth to oppress.' So take heed
   of pride: Ps. x. 2, The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor.'
   So when persons are of a revengeful temper, it will put them upon
   oppression and persecution for every fancied or supposed affront
   offered to them: the enemy and avenger go together, Ps. viii. 2.

   3. Think of changes, that pride may not be without a curb, nor
   affliction without a comfort. It is the proud oppress, who are drunk
   with their wealth and outward prosperity. The Lord's people are not
   troubled by humble souls, that are sensible of their mutableness and
   frailty, but by those who little think of these things, and how hard it
   fareth with them that fear God.

   Secondly, Here are the persons to inflict it, The proud.'

   Doct. The proud are they that especially persecute the godly.

   Who are the proud?

   1. Generally those that obstinately stand it out against God and the
   methods of his grace: Neh. ix. 16, But they and our fathers dealt
   proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not unto thy
   commandments;' and ver. 29, Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not
   to thy commandments;' Jer. xiii. 17, My soul shall weep in secret for
   your pride.'

   2. More especially those that are too well conceited of themselves,
   seen by their affecting to meddle with things too high for them: Ps.
   cxxxi. 1, Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither
   do I exercise myself in great matters, nor in things too high for me.'
   Murmur under crosses, quarrel with providences, finding fault with all
   God's sayings and doings, trust in themselves that they are righteous,
   Luke xviii. 14; scoff at others for their godliness: Ps. cxix. 51, the
   proud had me greatly in derision;' Ps. x. 2, The wicked in his pride
   doth persecute the poor,' ready to brawl on all occasions; Prov. xxiii.
   10, Only by pride cometh contention;' would have all to stoop to them,
   are stiff in their opinions, boasters, lessening the gifts of others,
   impatient of admonition.

   3. The particular pride here mentioned, when men are high-minded, and
   trust in uncertain riches, drunk with their prosperity. So oppressing
   in their honour and greatness, as if they would trample all others
   under foot, and crush them at pleasure. These are merciless and
   pitiless, disdain the poor, whatsoever presence of God they have with
   them; we are filled with the scorning of them that are at ease.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXXXV.

   Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
   righteousness.--Ver. 123.

   IN the former verse, David spake as one under oppression, here he
   setteth forth his longing and waiting for deliverance. In the words we
   have--

   1. The act of faith, together with the object of it; his eyes were to
   the salvation of God.

   2. The defect and weakness of his faith, and God's delay, implied in
   the occasion of it, Mine eyes fail.'

   3. The ground and support of his soul in this exercise, The word of thy
   righteousness.'

   By salvation is meant temporal deliverance: his eyes were to his
   salvation; that is, he did with faith and patience wait for it. Bat in
   waiting, his eyes failed; that noteth some deficiency and weakness, but
   his support during all this was the word of God's righteousness; that
   word wherein God promised salvation and deliverance to them that are
   oppressed. And he calleth it the word of his righteousness, because he
   is one that kept it justly and faithfully; as if he had said, Surely
   God is righteous, and is no more liberal in promises than faithful in
   performing, therefore, though mine eyes even fail, yet I will keep
   looking and longing still for his salvation.

   I begin with the ground of his faith, and the support of his soul,
   which is the word of promise.

   Doct. That God's word, wherein he hath promised deliverance to his
   suffering servants, is a word of, righteousness.

   There are three things in the promise--Veritas, fidelitas, justitia,
   fidelity, faithfulness, and righteousness.

   1. Veritas, sincerity or truth in making the promise, according to
   which God doth really intend and mean to bestow what he promiseth; For
   God is not as man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he
   should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken,
   and shall he not make it good?' To lie is to speak a falsehood with an
   intention to deceive; this cannot be imagined of God. What need hath he
   to court a worm, or to mock and flatter us into a vain hope? What
   interest can accrue to him thereby? Yea, the purity of his nature will
   not permit it: Titus i. 2, According to the hope of eternal life, which
   God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.' He will as soon
   cease to be God as cease to be true, for his truth is his nature, he is
   truth itself. Man, that is mutable, and hath an interest to promote by
   dissembling, may put on a false appearance, and speak what he never
   meaneth; but God cannot do so, for he is truth itself, essentially so
   in the abstract, can admit of no mixture, though creatures may. Light
   itself admitteth not of any darkness, but as it is in subjects, so it
   doth. But God is truth, and in him is no falsehood at all. Now, of all
   lies, a promissory lie is the worst; it is greater than an assertory
   lie. An assertory lie is when we speak of a thing past or present
   otherwise than it is. A promissory lie is when we promise a thing for
   time to come, which we never intend to perform. And this is the worse,
   because it doth not only pervert the end of speech, but defeateth
   another of that right which we seem to give him, in the thing promised;
   which is a further degree of injustice. Therefore we must take heed
   how, either directly or interpretatively, we ascribe such a lie to God.
   The apostle telleth us, 1 John v. 10, He that believeth not, maketh God
   a liar;' which is the highest dishonour you can cast upon him, which in
   manners and civility we would not offer to our equal, and which even a
   mean man would scorn to put up with at our hands. God hath made many
   promises, as that he will be with thee in six troubles, and in seven he
   will not forsake thee, Job. v. 19; that he will dispose of all things
   for the best to them that love him, Rom. viii. 28; that no good thing
   shall be wanting to them that fear him, Ps. xxxiv. 10. Doth not God
   mean as he saith? and dare we trust him no more? Your diffidence and
   drooping discouragements give him the lie, and you carry it so as if
   these were but words of course, without any intent to make them good.

   2. Fidelitas. The next thing in the promise is faithfulness, and that
   referreth to the keeping of the promise. A man may be real in
   promising, he did not intend to deceive: but afterwards lie changeth
   his mind: there may be verity in making the promise, but there is not
   fidelity in keeping the promise. But God is faithful; hath he said, and
   shall he not do it? All the promises are Yea and Amen;' in Jesus
   Christ, 2 Cor. i. 20. God's word is not; Yea and Nay,' but Yea and
   Amen;' it doth riot say Yea to-day, and Nay to-morrow, but always Yea.
   So it is Amen, so it shall be; and this in Jesus Christ, on whose merit
   they are all founded, and who was the great instance of God's truth:
   for the great promise wherein God stood bound to the church was to send
   a Saviour to redeem the world; and if God hath made good this promise,
   surely this is a pledge that he will make good all the rest; for if he
   spared not his Son, he will not stick at other things.

   3. There is justitia, righteousness; for this is righteousness, jus
   suum cuique tribuere, to give every one his right and his due. Now by
   promise, another man cometh to have a right in the thing promised;
   therefore justice requireth that you should give him the right that
   accrueth to him by virtue of your promise. So God, promittendo se fecit
   debitorem, maketh himself a debtor by promise. It was his mercy and
   goodness to make the promise, but his justice bindeth him to make it
   good. This is often spoken of in scripture: 1 John i. 9, Faithful and
   just to forgive us our sins;' 2 Tim. iv. 8, Henceforth there is laid up
   for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge,
   shall give me at that day.' By his promise he is be come a debtor to
   us; he cannot go against his own word; his justice will not suffer him
   to change. It is a debt of grace indeed, but a debt it is which it is
   justice for God to pay. Thus you see how it is a word of righteousness.

   Reason 1. Because God hath in his promises pawned his truth with the
   creature, and so given us an holdfast upon him. Chirographa tua
   injiciebat tibi Domine. Promises, as in a contract, are more than
   simple declarations, and bare assertions of what good he will do to us.
   With man it is one thing to say, This I purpose to do; another, This I
   promise to do. A promise addeth a new bond and obligation upon a man
   for fulfilling his word. An intimation or signification of God's will
   and purpose showeth the event will follow; but a promise doth riot only
   do that, but giveth us a right and claim to the things promised.
   Scripture prophecies will be fulfilled because of God's veracity; but
   scripture promises will be fulfilled, not because of his veracity, but
   his fidelity and justice. And the heirs of promise may have strong
   consolation by God's word and oath'--two immutable things, wherein it
   is impossible for God to lie,' Heb. vi. 18. There is a greater
   obligation upon God to make it good.

   Reason 2. Because none that ever depended upon God's word were
   disappointed; not one instance to the contrary: Ps. xviii. 30, The word
   of the Lord is tried; he is a buckler to all that trust in him.' Search
   the annals and records of time, and all experience hath found the word
   of God exactly true. If any build not upon it, it is because they are
   not acquainted with God, and the course of his proceedings: Ps. ix. 10,
   They that know thy name will trust in thee.' There is so little
   believing and trusting God upon his word, because they are men of no
   experience; otherwise they would find God punctual to his promise: Not
   one thing hath failed of all the good things the Lord your God spake
   concerning you,' Josh. xxiii. 14. He speaketh not only as his own
   observation, and the result of all his experiences, and that in a time
   when there was no room for dissembling: I go the way of all the earth,'
   but also you know in all your hearts, and all your souls;' and he
   repeateth it, Not one thing hath failed.' Unless you be impudent, you
   cannot deny it; try him, you have found support and relief hitherto.

   Reason 3. Because God standeth much on the credit of his word. Heathens
   have acknowledged it to be the property of the gods, aletheu'ein kai`
   euergetein; certainly the true God hath showed himself to the world in
   nothing so much as doing good and keeping promise: Ps. cxxxviii. 2,
   Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name,' above all that is
   famed or spoken or believed of God, this is most conspicuous, as being
   punctual in keeping covenant and fulfilling promises. God hath ever
   stood upon that, of being tender of the honour of his truth in the eye
   of the world: therefore we should build securely upon the word of his
   righteousness.

   Use 1. To bless God that we are upon such sure terms. All people that
   know there is a God, wait for some good things from him; but they are
   left to uncertain guesses, it may be they may have them, it may be not:
   but we have it under hand and seal, and have God's warrant for our
   hope, and so deal with God upon sure terms. Well may we take up David's
   song, In God I will praise his word, in the Lord I will praise his
   word,' Ps. lvi. 10. It is twice repeated in that psalm: that is ground
   of rejoicing, that God will assure us aforehand what he will do for us.
   God might have dealt with man by way of dominion and command alone,
   without any signification of his goodness, and left us to blind
   guesses. Promises are the eruptions and overflows of God's love, he
   cannot stay till accomplishment, but will tell us aforehand what he is
   about to do for us, that we may know how to look for it.

   Use 2. To exhort us to rest contented with God's word, and to take his
   promises as sure ground of hope. I shall show you how you should count
   it a word of righteousness; what is your duty; and that first you are
   to delight in the promise, though the performance be not yet, nor like
   to he for a good while: Heb. xi. 13, peisthe'ntes kai` aspasa'menoi,
   being persuaded of them, they embraced them. Oh! how they hugged the
   promises at a distance, and said in their hearts, Oh, blessed promise!
   this will in time yield a Messiah: John viii. 56, Your father Abraham
   rejoiced to see my day, and saw it, and was glad.' You hold the
   blessing by the root, this will in time yield deliverance, Heb. vi. 18;
   not only yield comfort, but prove comfortable: Ps. cxix. 111, Thy
   testimonies I have taken for an heritage; for they are the rejoicing of
   my heart.' For your duty--

   2. You are to rest confident of the truth of what God hath promised,
   and be assured that the performance will in time be: peisthe'ntes, Heb.
   xi. 13. Faith is not a fallible conjecture, but a sure and certain
   grace: Rom. viii. 28, We know that all things shall work together for
   good to them that love God.' So Ps. cxl 12, I know that God will
   maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.' There
   is a firm persuasion; I know I shall find this to be a truth. Men who
   are conscionable and faithful in keeping their word are believed; yet,
   being men, they may lie: Rom. iii. 4, Let God be true, and every man a
   liar.' Every man is, or may be a liar, because of the mutableness of
   his nature; from interest he will not lie, but he can lie. If we
   receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. Surely
   God cannot deceive, or be deceived. He never yet was worse than his
   word.

   3. You are to take the naked promise for the ground of your hope,
   however it seem to be contradicted in the course of God's providence;
   when it is neither performed, nor likely to be performed, it is his
   word you go by, whatsoever his dispensations be. Many times there are
   no apparent evidences of God's doing what he hath said, yea, strong
   probabilities to the contrary. It is said, Rom. iv. 18, That Abraham
   against hope believed in hope,' par' elpi'da ep' elpi'da. Abraham had
   the promise of a son, in whom all the nations of the earth should be
   blessed; but there was no appearance of this in nature, or natural hope
   of a child, both he and Sarah being old: yet he believed. It is an
   antanaclasis, an elegant figure, having the form of a contradiction he
   goeth upon God's naked word. Then faith standeth upon its own basis and
   legs, which is not probabilities, but his word of promise, Everything
   is strongest upon its own basis, which God and nature have appointed.
   For as the earth hangeth on nothing in the midst of the air, but there
   is its place, faith is seated most firmly on the word of God, who is
   able to perform what he saith.

   4. This faith must conquer our fears and cares and troubles: Ps. cxii.
   7, He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting
   in the Lord.' He must fix the heart without wavering: Ps. lvi. 4, In
   God I will praise his word, in God have I put my trust: I will not fear
   what man can do unto rue.' The force of faith is seen in calming our
   passions and sinful fears, which otherwise would weaken our reverence
   and respect to God.

   5. Above all this, you are to glorify God publicly; not only in the
   quiet of your hearts, but by your carriage before others: John iii. 33,
   Put to his seal that God is true.' It is not said, Believed or
   professed, but, Put to his seal. We seal the truth of God as his
   witnesses when we confirm others in the faith and belief of the
   promises by our joyfulness in all conditions, patience under crosses,
   diligence in holiness, hope and comfort in great straits. Num. xx. 12,
   God was angry with Moses and Aaron, because ye believe not, to sanctify
   me in the eyes of the children of Israel.' We are not only to believe
   God our selves, but to sanctify him in the eyes of others; as when the
   Thessalonians had received the word in much assurance, in much
   affliction, and much joy in the Holy Ghost, the apostle telleth them
   they were examples to all that believed in Achaia and Macedonia, 1
   Thes. i. 5. The worthiness and generousness of our faith should be a
   confutation of our base fears, but a confirmation of the gospel. But we
   are so far from confirming the weak, that we offend the strong; and
   instead of being a confirmation to the gospel, we are a confutation of
   it.

   Use 3. Reproof to us that we do no more build upon this word of
   righteousness.

   1. Some count these vain words, and the comforts thence deduced
   fanatical illusions; and hopes and joys, fantastical impressions: Ps.
   xxii. 7, 8, All they that see me laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the
   lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that he would
   deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.' Nothing
   so ridiculous in the world's eye as trust or dependence or unseen
   comforts. Ungodly wits make the life of faith a sport and matter of
   laughter.

   2. Some, though not so bad as the former, they may have more modesty,
   yet as little faith, since they are all for the present world, present
   delights, present temptations. With many, one thing in hand is more
   than the greatest promises of better things to come, 2 Tim. iv. 10;
   they have no patience. Afflictions are smart for the present: Heb. xii.
   11, No affliction for the present seemeth joyous, but grievous.' Yea,
   they do not deal equally with God and man. If a man promise, they
   reckon much of that, Qui petat, accipiet, &c. They can tarry upon man's
   security, but count God's nothing worth. They can trade with a factor
   beyond seas, and trust all their estates in a man's hand whom they have
   never seen; and yet the- word of the infallible God is of little regard
   and respect with them.

   3. The best build too weakly on the promises, as appeareth by the
   prevalency of our cares and fears. If we did take God at his word, we
   would not be so soon mated with every difficulty: Heb. xiii 5, 6, Let
   your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such
   things as you have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor
   forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper; I will
   not fear what man can do unto me.' There would be more resolution in
   trials, more hardness against troubles. Besides maintenance, there is
   protection in the promise. If we had faith to believe this, it would
   effectually quiet our minds in all our necessities and straits and
   perplexities. Man can do much, bring them low, even to a morsel of
   bread. We need not much desire the best things of the world, nor fear
   the worst; need not be covetous, nor fearful. Where faith is in any
   life and strength, it moderateth our desires and fears. It is an ill
   part of a believer to hang the head.

   Secondly, From that clause, David's eyes were to God's salvation, that
   God's word being passed his people do and must wait for the
   accomplishment of it. The lifting up of the eyes implies three
   things--faith, hope, and patience; all which do make up the duty of
   waiting for help and relief from God.

   1. The lifting up the eyes implies faith and confident persuasion that
   God is ready and willing to help us: 2 Chron. xx. 12, But our eyes are
   unto thee;' Ps. cxxiii. 1, 2, Unto thee I lift mine eyes, O thou that
   dwellest in the heavens.' The very lifting up of the bodily eye towards
   heaven is an expression of this inward trust: so David in effect saith,
   From thee, Lord, I expect relief, and the fulfilling of thy promises.
   So that there is faith in it, that faith which is the evidence of
   things not seen. How great soever the darkness of our calamities be,
   though the clouds of present troubles thicken about us, and hide the
   Lord's care and loving-kindness from us, yet faith must look through
   all to his power and constancy of truth and love. The eye of faith is a
   clear, piercing, eagle eye: Heb. xi. 27, Moses endured, as seeing him
   that was invisible.' A man is very short-sighted before: 2 Peter i. 9,
   He that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off;' can
   only skill in the things of sense and reason, see a danger near him, as
   beasts or a bait while it is before him; a brute thinketh of no other;
   or else goeth by probabilities, as it seeth things by the light of
   reason in their causes. But faith seeth things afar off in the
   promises, Heb. xi. 13, at a greater distance than the eye of nature can
   reach to. Take it either for the eye of the body, or the mind, faith
   will draw comfort not only from what is invisible at present, but not
   to come for a long time; it is future as well as invisible; its
   supports lie iii the other world, and are yet to come.

   2. There is hope in it; for what a man hopeth for he will look for it,
   if he. can see it a-coming: the earnest expectation of the creature,'
   apokaradoki'a tes kti'seos, Rom. viii. 19; the stretching forth of the
   head: Judges v. 28, They looked out at the window, and cried through
   the lattice, Why is his chariot so long a-coming?' So by spiritual hope
   there is a lifting up of the eyes, or a looking out for what God hath
   promised, or an intent observing all together: Our conversation is in
   heaven, from whence we look for a Saviour,' Phil. iii. 20. Faith
   keepeth the eye of the mind fixed upon the promise, and is ever looking
   out for deliverance: Ps. cxxi. 1, 2, I will lift up mine eyes to the
   hills, from whence cometh my help: my help cometh from the Lord, which
   made heaven and earth.' Thence they look and wait for succour; it must
   come out of heaven to them. They see it, they can spy a cloud a-coming;
   that which a man careth not for he doth not look for. David saith, I
   will pray and look up,' Ps. v. 3. Hope hath expectation of the thing or
   object hoped for.

   3. There is patience in it, in persevering and keeping on our looking
   till mercy come, with faith and ardency in expecting God's help.
   Looking and waiting is to be conjoined, notwithstanding difficulties,
   till it procure deliverance: Ps. cxxiii. 2. Our eyes wait on the Lord,
   who will have mercy on us.' This lifting up of the eyes doth not imply
   a glance, or once looking to heaven; but that we keep looking till God
   cloth help: Isa. viii. 17, I will wait on the Lord, that hideth his
   face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.' There is a
   constant depending, and patient attending upon God, notwithstanding the
   present tokens of his wrath and displeasure. As a man withdraweth
   himself from a party, and will not be seen of him, nor spoken to by
   him, but the resolute suitor tarrieth to meet and speak with him. So
   Micah vii. 7, Therefore I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the
   God of my salvation: my God will hear me.' Not give over upon every
   discouragement, as a merchant doth not discontinue trading for every
   loss at sea. Certainly it is not faith and hope, unless we can endure
   and bear out. Natural courage will bear out for a while, but not long.
   A little touch breaketh a bubble, and a slight natural expectation is
   soon discouraged; but to hope against hope, to pray when God forbids
   praying, to keep waiting when we have not only difficulties in the
   world, but seeming disappointments from heaven itself, when the promise
   and Christ seem to be parting from you, and refuse you; yet then to
   say, I will not let thee go until thou bless me, as Jacob said to the
   angel, Gen. xxxii. 25, 26, when God saith, Let me alone.

   Use. Let us turn ourselves towards God for help, and have our eyes on
   him, and keep them there: Ps. cxli. 8, But mine eyes are unto thee, O
   God the Lord; in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.' Let us
   not give way to discouragements, though God delay us so long till all
   our carnal provisions are spent, no meal in the barrel, nor oil in the
   cruse, and we are brought to the last morsel of bread; though brought
   to complain for pity to them that will show none, but pour vinegar into
   our wounds; yea, till our spiritual provisions be spent. Faith will
   hold out no longer, hope can do us no service, patience lost and clear
   gone; we fall a-questioning God's love and care. I say, though we grow
   weary, let us strive against it, acquaint God with it, renew faith in
   the word of promise. There is a holy obstinacy in believing.

   To get this eye of faith--

   1. There is need of the Spirit's enlightening. Nature is short-sighted,
   2 Peter i. 9. A man cannot look into the other world till his eyes be
   opened by the Spirit of God: Eph. i. 17, 18, The Father of glory give
   unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him,
   the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what
   is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his
   inheritance in the saints.' There needs spiritual eye-salve to get this
   piercing eye to look through the curtain of the clouds.

   2. When your eye is opened, you must keep your eye clear from the
   suffusions of lust and worldly affections. A mortified heart is only a
   fit soil for faith to grow in. The world is a blinding thing, 2 Cor.
   iv. 4. While present things bear bulk in our eye, invisible things are
   little regarded by us. Dust cast into the eyes hindereth the sight,
   carnal affections send up the fumes and steams of lust to blind us.

   3. The eye being clear, you must ever be looking up out of the world of
   temptations into the world of comforts and supports, from earth to
   heaven: Heb. xi. 27, As seeing him that is invisible;' and the nothing
   things of the world, by omnifying and magnifying God. There are the
   great objects which darken the glory of the world, and all created
   things. And there we see more for us than can be against us, 2 Kings
   vi. 15. Pharaoh, a king of mighty power, was contemptible in Moses'
   eyes, because he saw a higher and a more glorious king; so glorious,
   that all the power and princes of the world are nothing to him.

   4. The less sensible evidence there is of the object of faith, the
   greater and stronger is the faith, if we believe it upon God's word:
   John xx. 29, Because thou hast seen, thou hast believed; blessed are
   they that have not seen, and yet have believed.' It extenuateth our
   faith, when the object must be visible to sense, or it worketh not on
   us. Faith hath more of the nature of faith when it is satisfied with
   God's word, whatever sense and reason say to the contrary: 1 Peter i.
   8, Whom, having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now you see him not,
   you rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory. Whatever faith
   closeth with upon sure grounds, it is spiritually present to the soul,
   though few sensible helps. The less we see in the world, the more must
   we believe. To see things to come as present, and to see things that
   otherwise cannot be seen, cometh near to God's vision of all things.
   God saw all things before they were, all things that may be, shall be,
   visione simplicis intelligentiae: Prov. viii. 31, Rejoicing in the
   habitable parts of the earth.' So doth faith eye all things in the
   all-sufficiency and promise of God, long before they come to pass, and
   affects the believer with them, John viii. 52.

   Thirdly, From the weakness and imbecillity confessed, Mine eyes fail.'
   The doctrine is--

   Doct. That sometimes God's people wait so long, that their eyes even
   fail in waiting; that is, their faith, hope, and patience is almost
   spent, and they are ready to give over looking.

   For the phrase intimateth two things--a trial on God's part, and a
   weakness on ours. First, a trial by reason of God's dispensations. Two
   things make our waiting tedious--the sharpness of afflictions, and the
   length of them, long delays of help and great trouble, in the mean
   time. First, the depth of the calamity, or the sharpness of the trial
   may occasion this failing: Ps. xxxviii. 10, My heart panteth, my
   strength faileth me, for the light of mine eyes is also gone.'
   Secondly, the length of troubles, or the protraction of deliverance. As
   the. bodily eye is- tired with long looking, so doth the soul begin to
   be weary, when this expectation is drawn out at length: Ps. cxix. 82,
   Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?' The
   delay is tedious.

   As to the matter of this failing, there are three things:--

   [1.] That the sufferings of God's children may be sometimes long. God
   ordereth it so, that faith, hope, and patience may have its perfect
   work, Heb. vi. 12. There is an intervening time between the promise and
   the accomplishment. Intervening difficulties, James i. 3, 4; Rom. viii.
   24, Hope that is seen is not hope;' it is but natural- probability,
   natural courage. Those that have received a great measure of faith have
   a great measure of trials; their troubles are greater that their graces
   may be the more exercised, that many stubborn humours may be broken,
   Jer. iv. 3. God useth to suffer his enemies to break up the fallow
   ground of his people: Ps. cxxix. 2, The plowers plough upon my back,
   they make long their furrows.' We have proud and stiff hearts,
   therefore the plough of persecution goeth deep, that the seed of the
   word may thrive the more; till they have done their work, God doth not
   cut asunder the cords. The Lord of the soil experts a richer crop. The
   power of the Spirit is more seen: Col. i. 10, 11, Strengthened with all
   might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and
   long-suffering with joyfulness.' Not only patience, but long-suffering,
   which is patience extended under continued troubles. Men may fret; it
   is not unwilling, extorted by force; but they are cheerful under the
   cross. The length of sufferings; some can endure a sharp brunt, but
   tire under a long affliction. Some go drooping and heavily under it;
   therefore joyfulness. For these and many other reasons doth God permit
   our sufferings to be long.

   [2.] Why faith, hope, and patience are apt to fail.

   (1.) Because these graces are weak in the best, and may fail under long
   and sharp trials: Ps. cxxv. 3, For the rod of the wicked shall not rest
   upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands
   to iniquity.' The strongest believer may faint in trouble, therefore
   God will not try them above their strength; but as he sometimes giveth
   more grace, so sometimes he abateth the temptations. Grace is not so
   perfect in any as to be above all weakening by assaults. Who would have
   thought that a meek Moses could be angry? Ps. cvi. 33. There are relics
   of sin unmortified, such as may be awakened in the best. Who would have
   thought that David should fall into uncleanness, an old experienced
   man, who had many wives of his own, when Joseph, a young man, a
   captive, resisted an offered occasion? But especially do these graces
   fail in their operation when the temptation is more spiritual; for
   these are mystical graces, to which nature giveth no help, when' things
   dear to us in the flesh and in the Lord are made the matter of the
   temptation, and set an edge upon it, &c. Sins that disturb the order of
   the present world are not so rife with the saints as sins that concern
   our commerce with God.

   (2.) Because temptations raise strange clouds and mists in the soul,
   that though they grant principles, yet they cannot reconcile
   providences with them. As Jer. xii. 1, Righteous art thou, O Lord, yet
   let me plead with thee.' It is not to be questioned, much less doubted
   of, that God is upright and just in his dealings; yet what mean those
   passages of his providence? Their thoughts are fearfully imbrangled,
   the minds of the godly are molested: Wherefore doth the way of the
   wicked prosper?' So Hab. i. 13. Thou art of purer eyes than to behold
   evil, and canst not look on iniquity; wherefore lookest thou upon them
   that deal treacherously? and boldest thy tongue, when the wicked
   devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?' God is pure and
   holy, they know; yet how can he bear with the enemy, in their treachery
   and violence against the church? So brutified are they, that they know
   not how to reconcile his dispensations with his nature and attributes;
   though they have faith enough to justify God, yet atheism enough to
   question his providence. When the heart is over-charged with fears: Ps.
   lxxiii. 1, Yet God is good to Israel: my feet were almost gone, my
   steps well-nigh slipped.' They hold fast the conclusion, Yet God is
   good to Israel;' yet cannot maintain it against all objections.

   (3.) Carnal affections are hasty and impetuous, and if God give not a
   present satisfaction, they question all his love and care of them: Ps.
   xxxi. 22: I said in my heart, I am cut off;' Isa. xlix. 14, Zion said,
   The Lord hath forsaken, and my God hath forgotten me;' Jonah ii. 4, And
   he said, I am cast out of thy sight.' So that, did not God confute his
   unbelief by some sudden experience, as in the first instance, or the
   word contain a suitable supply, as in the second, or the principle of
   grace in some measure withstand (but I will look towards thy holy
   temple'), the soul would be swallowed up in the whirlpool of despair.
   Thus hasty and precipitant are we while we hearken to the voice of the
   flesh. We are apt to count all our troubles God's total desertion of
   us. Such a hasty principle have. we within us, that will hurry us to
   desperate conclusions, as if it were in vain to wait upon God any
   longer.

   (4.) Mutability in man. What a flush of faith and zeal have we at
   first, as stuffs have a great gloss at first wearing. We lose, as our
   first love, so our first faith: Gal. v. 7, Ye did run well; who did
   hinder you?' There is a great forwardness at first, which abateth
   afterwards; and men grow remiss, faint in your minds,' Heb. xii. 3,
   from one degree to another.

   [3.] That this failing is but an infirmity of the saints; though their
   hope be weak and ready to faint, it is not quite dead.

   (1.) It is an infirmity of the better sort, not like the atheism and
   malignity of the wicked. Some diseases show a good constitution, and
   seize on none but such. This distemper is not incident to carnal men:
   Isa. xxxviii. 14, Mine eyes fail with looking up.' It argueth a
   vehemency in our hope; they that do not mind things are never troubled
   with such a spiritual disease; for this failing cannot be but where
   there is vehemency of desire and expectation. Those that desire little
   of the salvation of God's people, feel none of this.

   (2.) There is a difference between them and others; though they have
   their weaknesses, yet their faith doth not quite expire; there is a
   twig of righteousness still to trust to; they are weary of watching,
   but they do not give over waiting; and say, as he, 2 Kings vi. 33, What
   should I wait for the Lord any longer?' Fainting is one thing, and
   quite dead is another: they strive against the temptation: though no
   end of their difficulties appeareth, they attend still, keep looking,
   though the vigour of the eye be abated by long exercise. There is life
   in the saints, though not that liveliness they could- wish; for they do
   not fall, and rise no more, and are quite thrown down with every blast
   of a temptation.

   (3.) They confess their weakness to God, as David doth here,
   acquainteth God with it, and so shame themselves out of the temptation,
   and beg new strength. It is an excellent way of curing such distempers
   to lay them forth before God in prayer, for he helpeth the weak in
   their conflicts. When we debate dark cases with our own hearts, we
   entangle ourselves the more.

   Use 1. It reproveth our tenderness when we cannot bear a little while:
   What! not watch with me one hour?' Mat. xxvi. 40. David kept waiting
   till his eyes failed. Some their whole voyage is storms;--Christ
   indents with us to take up our cross daily, Luke ix. 22;--who are their
   lifetime kept under this discipline; and can we bear no check from
   providence? We would have all done in an hour or in a year, can bear
   nothing when God calleth us to bear much and long; cannot endure to
   abate a little of our wonted contentment, when God will strip us of
   all.

   Use 2. Let us provide for long sufferings. All colours will not hold as
   long as the cloth lasts. We need a great deal of grace, because we know
   not how long our great troubles may last. Sometimes sufferings are like
   to be long. First, When the cross maketh little improvement, carrieth
   little conviction with it. While the stubbornness of the child
   continueth, the blows are continued. God will withdraw till they
   acknowledge their offence, Hosea v. 15. When we eye instruments, and
   pour our rage upon them; or instruments are minded, and wo hope to be
   delivered some other way, when we repent not. Secondly, When
   provocations are long: Deut. xxviii. 58, 59, If thou wilt not observe
   to do all the words of this law, that is written in this book, that
   thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, The Lord thy God; then
   the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed,
   even great plagues, and of long continuance; and sore sicknesses, and
   of long continuance.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXXXVI.

   Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy, and teach me thy
   statutes.--Ver. 124.

   IN this verse we have two requests--the one general, the other
   particular; wherein he would have the Lord exercise his mercy to him.
   Show thy mercy to me in teaching me thy law. The one respects the
   privilege part of religion, the other the duty part; the one concerns
   time past, or the pardon of sin already committed, Deal with thy
   servant according to thy mercy;' the other prevention of sin for the
   time to come, that I may perform my duty for the future, Teach me thy
   statutes.' Mercy is the ground of his request; teaching God's law the
   matter of it. He would have this gift bestowed on him freely.

   First branch, Deal with thy servant,' &c. Where we have--

   3. His relation to God, thy servant.

   2. The terms upon which lie would have God deal with him: Not according
   to my works, but according to thy mercy.

   First, His relation is mentioned either--(1.) As a part of his plea, as
   if he had said, Lord, thou art merciful to all, for thy tender mercy is
   over all thy works,' Ps. cxlv. 9; much more to thy servants: now I am
   thy servant. God's servants have a special claim and interest in God;
   besides his general bounty, they expect his special mercy and favour:
   Ps. cxvi. 16, O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the
   son of thine handmaid.' Clear that, that you are some of God's servants
   once, and then you may the better expect your master's bounty. Or, (2.)
   To show his need of mercy though God's servant. Such an emphasis it
   seemeth to have: Ps. cxliii. 2, Enter not into judgment with thy
   servant;' non dicit cum hostibus tuis. He doth not say, Enter not into
   judgment with thine enemy, but with thy servant So here David, that was
   God's servant, a man of singular holiness, desireth that God would deal
   with him in mercy. From first to last, the saints have no other plea.
   Theodoret, on the text, observeth. o tosau'tes aretes erga'tes ele'ous
   tuchein, &c.--so great a worker of righteousness beggeth to receive
   mercy, and looketh for all his salvation by mercy. And again, ouk
   apaitei mi'sthon alla` philanthropi'an aitei--he doth not challenge a
   reward, but asketh favour and kindness.

   Doct. That God's best servants have no other and no better plea than
   that God would deal with them in mercy.

   1. Because there is and can be no merit on the creature's part towards
   God, according to the rule of justice. Adam in innocency could
   impetrare, not mereri; it was his grace to covenant with the creature,
   when innocency and purity did adorn our nature; how much more since the
   fall, and the distance between God and us hath been so widened by sin!
   What merits must be indebitum and utile. It must be indebitum: when our
   righteousness was perfect, yet still due by virtue of our relation to
   God as creatures; and paying of debts deserveth no reward. The lawyers
   tell us, Nemo consequitur praemium, quod facit ex officio debitum. We
   are bound, and do but our duty; but God is not bound to us. All that
   the creature hath and is, and can do, it oweth to God, and hath
   received it from him; and God is in such a degree of excellency above
   us that he cannot be obliged. Where there is so great a disparity of
   nature and being, there is no common right to make him obnoxious, to
   make it justice to any action of ours to reward us. Aristotle denied
   children could requite their parents, and merit from them, and that the
   obligation of merit is only between equals; certainly not between God
   and men. There was nothing which bound him necessarily to reward his
   creature but his free covenant. Again, that which merits must be utile,
   profitable to him from whom we challenge reward. If we be never so
   righteous, the benefit is ours, not God's. He is not beholden to us,
   useth us not out of indigence, but indulgence; not as if he needed
   anything, but we need his blessing: Luke xix. 10, When we have done
   all, we are unprofitable servants;' and Ps. xvi. 2, Our goodness
   extendeth not to thee.' God giveth all, receiveth nothing from us. The
   beam oweth all to the sun, the sun nothing to the beam.

   2. Because since the fall there is no claiming but by the covenant of
   grace and mere mercy. A sinner cannot expect anything but upon terms of
   mercy. The covenant of works supposed us innocent and holy, and bound
   us so to continue, Gal. iii. 20; so that the law knoweth not how to do
   good to a sinner. Once a sinner, and for ever miserable; it leaveth no
   room for repentance. So that now there is no hope for the best,
   according to the rule of strict justice, but only according to the law
   of mercy. In the new covenant there are these special differences from
   the law of works. That there is not only grace, but mercy and grace
   too. In the first covenant there was grace, but no mercy. Grace doth
   all things gratis, freely; but mercy pitieth the miserable: therefore,
   till sin and misery entered there could be no room for mercy. There was
   grace in that covenant, for it was of grace that God did enter into
   covenant with man at all, and of grace that he did accept man's perfect
   obedience, so as upon performance of it to make him sure of eternal
   life. But now in the new covenant God doth show mercy and grace too,
   and grace in the most rich and glorious manner. Mercy and grace too in
   this way of salvation, in that there is hope for a sinner, a plank cast
   out after shipwreck; and grace in the richest and most glorious manner;
   partly for the design, and end that was driven at; it was the glory of
   grace: Eph. i. 6, To the praise of the glory of his grace;' and partly
   the ground of it was founded upon the infinite mercy of God and the
   infinite merit of Christ. The infinite mercy of God: Mercy is the
   infinite goodness of God, flowing out freely to the creature, without
   any moving cause or worth on the creature's part to expect it: Rom. ix.
   16, It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth; but of God
   that showeth mercy.' And the infinite merit of Christ: Isa. lv. 3, I
   will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of
   David;' Isa. xlii. 6, And give thee for a covenant to the people;' and
   Isa. xlix. 8, I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant to the
   people.' David, that is Christ, the seed of David; all the mercies of
   the covenant are exhibited in and by him, in whom the covenant is made
   with us, and made good to us, 2 Cor. i. 20. And he is given for a
   foundation; that is, the foundation of a new and better covenant. And
   partly because of the terms wherein it is dispensed, which is not
   unsinning obedience, but a sincere owning of Christ, unto the ends for
   which God hath appointed him. So that in effect a thankful acceptance
   of a free discharge is all that we do for paying the debt, or to make
   way for our acceptance with God: Rom. iv. 16, Therefore it is of faith,
   that it might be of grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all
   the seed;' and Eph. ii. 8, Ye are saved by grace through faith, and
   that not of ourselves; it is the gift of God.' By the grace of faith we
   lay hold upon or apply to ourselves Christ and all his benefits; and
   that faith God giveth us by his mere grace, not exhibited by any work
   of others. The whole work of salvation, from its first step in
   regeneration to its last step in glorification, doth entirely flow from
   God's free grace, and not from any worth in us. So that this being the
   end, grounds, terms of the new covenant from first to last, mercy doth
   all on which our hope dependeth. We must claim by mercy.

   3. As there is no merit in the best saints, so there is much demerit;
   and as there is nothing to induce God to be good to us, so there is
   much to hinder him, much that standeth in his way; yet God will do us
   good: Isa. lvii. 17, 18, I have seen his ways, and will heal him; I
   will lead him also and restore comforts to him.' He taketh motives from
   himself to pity when he might take occasion to punish. There are many
   sins to be forgiven both before and after conversion. Wo are not only
   undeserving, but ill-deserving. It was much that God would take us with
   all our faults, when he first drew us into acquaintance with himself,
   and intrust us with a stock of grace; but after he hath done that, we
   still are faulting and sinning: Rom. viii. 1, Yet now there is no
   condemnation to them that are in Christ;' notwithstanding the relics of
   corruption, and its breaking out.

   4. From the temper of the saints, their humility. None have such a
   sight and sense of sin as they have, because their eyes are anointed
   with spiritual eyesalve. They have a clearer insight into the law: Jer.
   xxxi. 19, After I was instructed I smote upon my thigh.' They are
   enlightened by God's Spirit; the least mote is espied in a glass of
   clear water. None are so acquainted with their own hearts and ways as
   they who often commune with their own hearts, and use self-reflection.
   Others, that live carelessly, do not mind their offences; but they that
   set themselves do more consider their ways; none have a more tender
   sense of the heinousness of sin. She loved much, wept much, because
   much was forgiven her, Luke vii. Some are of a more delicate
   constitution; the back of a slave is not so sensible of stripes as they
   that have been more tenderly brought up. The beams of the sun shining
   into a house, we see the dust and motes in the sunbeams, which we saw
   not before. They profess as Jacob, I am net worthy of all the mercy and
   truth thou hast showed me. They groan as St Paul, O wretched man that I
   am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'

   Use 1. Information. We learn hence that we should not be discouraged,
   when our hearts are touched with a deep remorse and sense of our
   failings, and are desirous to break off our sins by repentance; that
   mercy which is freely vouchsafed in the covenant, which all God's
   servants have so often experienced, which the best make their only plea
   and ground of hope, will find out a remedy for us. If you have a heart
   to give up yourselves to God's service, and so to get an interest in
   the promises and blessings of the covenant, you may come and sue out
   this mercy, for God desireth to exalt his grace. God saith, Return to
   the Lord your God, and I will heal your backslidings, and love you
   freely,' Hosea xiv. It is the delight of grace to do good, not
   withstanding unworthiness. The worst of sins do not hinder God's help,
   are not above his cure. There is hope for such as are convinced, and
   see no worth in themselves why God should do them any good. God needs
   not, will not be hired by the creatures to do it.

   Use 2. How inexcusable those are that reject the offers of grace. If
   they have any liking to the blessings of the covenant, they have no
   ground to quarrel and differ with God about the price: Isa. lv. i, Ho
   every one that thirsteth, let him come to the waters and drink freely,
   without money and without price.' You have no cloak for your sin if you
   will not deal with God upon these terms. Nothing keepeth you from him
   but your own perverse will.

   Use 3. What reason there is the best of God's servants should carry it
   thankfully all their days. From first to last the mercy of God is your
   only plea and claim. No flesh hath cause to glory in his presence,
   there being no meritorious cause in the covenant of grace, no moving
   and inducing cause, no co-ordinate working cause: Not for your sakes do
   I this,' Ezek. xxxvi. 32; and in 1 Cor. vii. 4, it is said, Who maketh
   thee to differ?' We paid nothing for God's love, nothing for Christ,
   the Son of his love, nothing for his Spirit, the fruit of his love,
   nothing for sanctifying grace and faith, the effects of his Spirit
   dwelling and working in our hearts, nothing for pardon; we have all
   freely; nothing for daily bread, protection, maintenance; and shall pay
   nothing for glory, when we come to receive it: Jude 21, Looking for the
   mercy of God unto eternal life.' It is all without our merit, and
   against merit. We should regard this especially when we are apt to say
   in our hearts, This is for our righteousness; as Haman thought none so
   fit for honour and preferment as himself, Esther vi. 6; Haman thought
   so in his heart. So proud-hearted, self-conceited sinners say in their
   hearts, God seeth more in them than in others. Alas! you are not only
   unworthy of Christ, the Spirit, grace, and glory, but the air you
   breathe in, and the ground you tread upon. What did the Lord see in you
   to judge you meet for such an estate? Gen. xxxii. 10, I am not worthy
   of the least of all thy mercies, and all thy truth.' Did not you slight
   grace, neglect Christ, as well as others? and doth not sin break out,
   and make a forfeiture every day?

   Use 4. That we should carry it humbly as well as thankfully. The best
   of God's children should most admire grace and glorify mercy, set the
   crown on mercy's head. Consider--

   1. What was the first rise of all God's love, what set all a-stirring
   in God's bosom, John iii. 16. There was no cause beyond this. In other
   things we may rise higher, from his power and wisdom to his love. But
   why did he love us? There is no other cause to be given--he loved us
   because he loved us. It was love first moved the business in the
   ancient counsel of God's will. God's love is the measure of itself.

   2. When he came to apply it, he found us in our blood. It was a great
   mercy that God would take us into his service with all our faults. We
   were his creatures, but quite marred, not as he made us. We are not
   what we were when first his; as we came out of his hands we were pure
   and holy, but since the fall quite spoiled: Jer. ii. 21, I had planted
   thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into
   the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?' Strangely changed and
   altered! If a servant run from his master, and is become altogether
   blind, deformed, and diseased, will his master look after him, or care
   for him, or take him again? This was our case.

   3. What is spoken already is common to others; you yourselves knew what
   you were, Titus iii. 3. Every man is soundly affected, more sensible of
   his own case, seeth particular reasons why God should refuse him; yet
   you are as brands plucked out of the burning, who did resist such
   powerful means, such fair advantages; you dallied with God. You know
   the case of others by guess, your own by feeling. You lay not only in
   the common polluted mass, but had your particular offences.

   4. When taken in a fault, that God will pity our weakness and
   infirmities in his service: Mal. iii. 17, I will spare them as a man
   spareth his son that serveth him;' that is, he will continue his favour
   and good-will to them that serve him. So surely they that have a
   conscience, and are privy to their manifold infirmities and failings,
   will admire this.

   5. Though for the main we give up ourselves to live according to the
   will of God, yet consider, notwithstanding our sins, what constant
   humbling considerations there are to keep us sensible of our defects.
   (1.) All that you do is not worthy of God. Who can serve so great a
   majesty as the Lord is, according as he should be served? Josh, xiv.
   29, You cannot serve the Lord, for he is a holy and a jealous God.'
   Alas! such is the poverty of human condition, that they can never
   perform service becoming his majesty. Have you a due sense of his
   purity and holiness? Nay, how jealous he is of the respects of his
   people! (2.) Not worthy of such a pure law, which requireth such
   perfect service at our hands: Ps. xix. 6-8, The law of the Lord is
   perfect, converting the soul,' &c. What doth that speculation produce,
   that a short exposition of the law begetteth a large opinion of our own
   righteousness? (3.) Not worthy such great hopes: 1 Thes. ii. 12, That
   ye walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.'
   Since we have such great wages we should do more work. Is this for
   heaven? Is this for eternity? (4.) Not such as will answer our
   obligations. We are indebted to all the persons of the Trinity; God
   himself for our portion, Christ our Redeemer, the Spirit for our guide
   and comforter. The Gentiles were greatly obliged to God for fruitful
   seasons. The Jews, though acquainted only with God's patience and
   forbearance, the ceremonial law was a testification of guilt, or a bond
   that showed the creature's debt; this bond was not cancelled. (5.) Not
   answerable to the new nature in God's children; they would be in a
   state of perfect conformity and subjection to God. A seed worketh
   through the clods; so they groan under the relics of corruption and
   sin, Rom. vii. 24, longing for the time when they shall be more like
   God, when they shall serve him without spot or blemish; therefore are
   unsatisfied with their present imperfections. These things considered,
   we should ever keep humble and thankful, praising God's grace: Isa.
   lxiii. 7, I will mention the loving-kindness of the Lord, and the
   praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed upon
   us; and the great goodness towards the house of Israel which he hath
   bestowed on them, according to his mercies, and the multitude of his
   loving-kindnesses.'

   Use 5. Directeth us how to pray. Cast yourselves at God's feet,
   pleading his mercy. We have heard the kings of Israel are merciful
   lungs, 1 Kings xx. 31. You have heard so of the God of Israel; try what
   mercy will do for you. Say, as David here, Deal with thy servant
   according to thy mercy.' My prayers have no other foundation of hope
   but thy mercy; I am nothing, and would be nothing, but what I have from
   thee; I have no merits, but thou hast mercy; all that I have, and
   expect to have, floweth and must flow from this fountain. Take heed of
   challenging duty as a debt. No, Lord; thy mercy is all my plea; as all
   thy servants before have done: Lord, remember me in thy mercy; if any
   have other things to plead, let them plead; I am resolved to use no
   other plea: Ps. xiii. 5, But I have trusted in thy mercy.'

   Second branch, teach me thy statutes. This may be considered apart by
   itself, or with respect to the context.

   First, Apart, as an entire prayer in itself. So the doctrine is,--

   Doct. It is God must teach us his statutes.

   This will appear if we consider--

   1. What it is to be taught of God. There is a difference between
   grammatical knowledge and spiritual illumination, or a literal
   instruction and a spiritual instruction; a greater difference than
   there is between teaching a child to spell and read the words, and a
   man to understand the sense. Literal instruction is when we learn the
   truths contained in the word by rote, and talk one after another of
   divine things. But spiritual illumination is when these things are
   revealed to us by the Spirit of' God; as we read of the evidence and
   demonstration of the Spirit, 1 Cor. ii. 4. Others have a form of
   knowledge, Rom. ii. 20. Some have only the report of Christ, have but a
   human credulity, or the recommendation of others, that reveal the
   doctrine of God to them. Others receive a revelation made to their
   souls; their eyes are opened by the Spirit, Isa. liii. 1. Once more,
   there is a difference between the Spirit's enlightening in a way of
   gifts and common grace, and his enlightening in a way of special and
   saving grace. Some that are enlightened by the Spirit fall away, Heb.
   vi. 4. Others are taught of God, so as to come to him by Christ, John
   vi. 45. This latter sort, that are savingly enlightened, have not only
   their minds opened, but their hearts inclined. So to be taught as to be
   drawn to faith and practice, this is proper to God, who is the
   sovereign dispenser of grace.

   2. This will appear if we consider the heart of man, which is naturally
   full of darkness, and oppressed by the prejudices of customs and evil
   habits: 1 Cor. ii. 14, But the natural man receiveth not the things of
   God;' 2 Cor. iv. 4, The god of this world hath blinded their eyes.'
   This veil can only be removed by the Spirit of God. After grace
   received we know but in part, 1 Cor. xiii. 9, and much of the matter
   which beclouded the mind still remaineth with us; and when our lusts
   are awakened by temptations, our old blindness returneth upon us, and
   we strangely forget ourselves and our duty for the present. Therefore
   we have need to go to God to be taught: 2 Peter i. 9, He that wanteth
   these things is blind, and cannot see afar off.'

   3. If we consider the matter to be taught, it is the mysterious doc
   trine that came out of the bosom of God. Every art hath its mystery,
   which strangers cannot judge of: 1 Tim. iii. 16, All scripture is given
   by inspiration.' This was a secret which had not been known without a
   revelation. God hath his mysteries which no man knoweth, but by the
   Spirit of God: Mat. xiii. 11, To you it is given to know the mysteries
   of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given.' Those that have
   scriptures, yet have scales on their eyes, 1 Cor. ii. 14, they have not
   saving knowledge. How sharp-sighted soever graceless souls may be in
   things that concern the present world, yet they are blind in spiritual
   things, so as to be affected and engaged thereby seriously to turn to
   God. Yea, how accurately soever they can discourse in the theory, and
   preach of Christ and his ways, yet they have no transforming light.
   God's mysteries must be seen in his own light, or they make no
   impression upon us: Ps. xxxvi. 9, In thy light we shall see light.' The
   scriptures containing the sum of the Lord's mind, none can of
   themselves attain to the meaning of them; it was not the device of
   man's brain. So none understand by their proper skill and invention.
   There are such knots as cannot be untied and loosed, but by imploring
   the help of the Spirit.

   Use 1. To press us to be often with God for this teaching, and make it
   our great request to him. A gracious heart would fain learn the right
   way to heaven: Ps. xliii. 3, O send out thy light and thy truth.'
   Direction how to carry ourselves is a great blessing.

   2. The blindness of our understandings should make us more earnest with
   God. We are apt to mistake our way, through the natural weakness of our
   understandings, especially when lusts and interests interpose: Jer. x.
   23, Lord, the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that
   walketh to direct his steps.' As man understandeth not events, so
   easily mistaketh present duties.

   3. Our present estate. The world is a dark place, 2 Peter i. 19;
   compared with the light of glory, it is but like a light that shineth
   out of a room where a candle is, and a room where a candle is not seen,
   the glimmerings of the antichamber of eternity. Our own reason, the
   counsel and example of others, will easily misguide us. So the more we
   depend upon God, the more he will undertake to teach us, Prov. v. 6.
   Those that make their own bosoms their oracle, God is disengaged from
   being their guide: they need him not; but the snares they run into will
   soon show them how much they need him.

   4. How unapt we are to see conclusions in the promises, and to apply
   general rules to particular cases and times; which most Christians
   cannot do, en dialogismois auton, in their inferences: Rom. i. 21, Are
   vain in their imaginations, have their foolish hearts darkened.'

   5. To bind all upon the heart, and to lie under the conscience of our
   duty, maketh the difficulty the greater; many imprison the truth in
   unrighteousness. Well, then, beg the constant direction and
   illumination of God's Holy Spirit; cast yourselves upon him in the
   sense of your weakness, and see if he will refuse you; say, I am blind
   and ignorant; Lord, guide me. It is dangerous to be left in any part of
   our duty to ourselves.

   Secondly, If we consider the words with respect to the context. And
   first the remoter context, where David speaketh like a man under
   trouble and oppression, ver. 121. 122, Let not the proud oppress me,'
   &c. Lord, show me what to do in this time of my oppression.

   Doct. Direction how to carry ourselves in trouble, till the deliverance
   cometh, is a great mercy, and should be earnestly sought of God.

   Reason 1. From the parties oppressing. They that oppress watch for our
   halting, as Jeremiah complained, Jer. xx. 10. They accused the prophet
   unto the ruler, and so to work his ruin, if they could find him
   tripping in anything. Now when we are watched we need special
   direction, that God would teach us to walk warily and safely: Ps.
   xxvii. 11, Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path,
   because of mine enemies; or, those which observe me, they watch to get
   some advantage: therefore that they may have no advantage against us,
   we should not trust to our own single wisdom.

   Reason 2. Because the danger of sin is a greater inconvenience than the
   danger of trouble. In times of trials and troubles we are in danger of
   soul-losing and sinning, as well as bodily danger; therefore we have
   need to beg wisdom of God to carry it well under trouble, because we
   are so apt to miscarry, unless God guide us continually in our dark
   condition, and take us by the hand, and help us over our
   stumbling-blocks. There are many sins incident to our condition.

   1. Uncomely passion and unadvised speeches; therefore David prayeth in
   his trouble, Ps. cxli. 3, Set a watch before my mouth, keep the door of
   my lips.' In our oppression, we are under a temptation to hurt our own
   cause by unadvised and passionate speeches. When we have too great a
   sense of the temptation, something or other breaketh out to God's
   dishonour.

   2. Some indirect course to come out of trouble, Ps. cxxv. 3. Men that
   make haste out of trouble carve for themselves, break prison before
   they are brought out. Necessity is an ill counsellor, and will soon
   tempt us to some evil way for our own ease, some sinful compliance or
   confederacy. The devil tempted Christ when he was an hungry. Mat. iv.
   3, hoping to work upon his necessity.

   3. Private revenge, or meeting injury with injuries. We are apt to
   retaliate: 2 Sam. xvi. 9, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the
   king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.' Revenge is
   soon up. No man is troubled if a shower of rain falleth upon us; but if
   any cast a bucket or bason of water upon us, we are in a rage
   presently. We can better bear any trouble from God than injuries from
   men: Oppression maketh a wise man mad.' A revengeful spirit is contrary
   to our heavenly calling.

   4. Waxing weary of our duty, and quite tired and discouraged in God's
   service: Heb. xii. 3, Consider him that endured such contra diction of
   sinners, lest you be weary and faint in your minds.' Weariness and
   fainting belong properly to the body, and they differ gradually.
   Weariness is a lesser, and tainting a higher degree of deficiency; as
   when a man laboureth, hungers, or travelleth, it abateth his strength,
   and abateth the active powers, or toileth the spirits, the principle of
   motion. And from the body it is translated to the mind, to a less or
   higher degree of defection; and it is thus, when troubles are many and
   long continued, we begin to grow faint, and wax weary of the faith and
   service of Christ, and sink under the burden. It is the Devil's design
   to make us weary, and tire us out in the service of God.

   5. Another evil is despairing and distrustful thoughts of God. David,
   after all his experiences of God, though he had conducted him up and
   down: 1 Sam. xxvii. 1, I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul.' He
   had a particular promise and assurance of the kingdom, and had seen
   much of God's care over him; yet, after all this, David doubteth of the
   word of God: Ps. xxxi. 22, I said in my haste, I am cut off from before
   thine eyes; nevertheless thou heardest me.' As if he should say, God
   hath no care of me, nor thoughts of me; and at that instant deliverance
   was coming.

   6. Questioning our interest in God by reason of the cross. Our Lord
   hath taught us to say, My God, my God,' in the bitterest agonies when
   he was upon the cross; but few learn this lesson: Judges vi. 23, If God
   be with us, why hath all this evil befallen us?' Some times we question
   the love of God because we have no affliction, and anon because we have
   nothing but affliction; as if God were not the God of the valleys as
   well as of the mountains. Well, then, seeing all these distempers are
   incident to an afflicted estate, we should the more carefully watch
   against them.

   Reason 3. Because our enemies make a great advantage of our failings,
   and harden themselves in their prejudices if we carry not a holy good
   cause in a holy religious way, and will take the least occasion given
   from a questionable practice to slander the truth: Neh. v. 9, Ought you
   not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the
   heathen our enemies?' If you should trip in anything, you shall soon
   hear of it, to the reproach of religion A holy and wise carriage in
   afflictions is very honourable to the gospel, otherwise your testimony
   is rejected and blasted.

   Use. Well, then, desire the Lord to guide thee in all thy troubles;
   yea, if God doth guide you. let this satisfy you before the deliverance
   cometh about. It is a mercy if you have direction, though you have not
   deliverance; for a godly man should not so much regard the ease of the
   flesh as the performance of his duty to God. If you carry your cross
   regularly with faith and patience, God may have more honour and you
   more profit by your affliction than your deliverance. Yea, to be
   instructed in the word, and be taught your duty, is in itself a greater
   mercy than a deliverance: Ps. xciv. 12, Blessed is the man whom thou
   chastenest, and teachest him out of thy law.' It is a blessed thing,
   yea, it is a deliverance itself; for it delivereth you from, the
   spiritual evil of the rod, which is the curse. Suffering doth not come
   as a curse when instruction goeth along with it; yea, it is the means
   of our great deliverance from the present evil world, 1 Cor. xi. 32, as
   it is a pledge of our future deliverance in due time; for God is not
   unmindful of us, and will not leave us without the conduct of his
   Spirit,

   Secondly, To handle the words with respect to the nearer context in
   ver. 123, Mine eyes fail for thy salvation.' This teaching is begged
   after he had complained of the delay of the promises, and so implicitly
   he complaineth not of the falsity of the word, or the non-performance
   of the promise, but of the weakness of his own faith.

   Doct. When the Lord suspends the promised deliverance, the godly
   suspect not the truth of his word, but the darkness of their own
   unbelieving hearts.

   They think this failing is because they are no more enlightened; they
   are dull in conceiving, and misty and cloudy in their apprehensions,
   and therefore would have a clearer understanding of the promise and a
   more quick-sighted faith; or have failed in the performance of the
   condition required, therefore desire that God would teach them and show
   them their errors, and cause them to profit in sanctification. Thus
   should we do in like cases when there is a seeming contradiction
   between the word and the works of God, betwixt his promises and his
   providence about us. His voice is sweet, like Jacob's, but his hands
   rough, like Esau's. Do not suspect the promise, but your understanding;
   go into the sanctuary, Ps. lxxiii. 16, 17. God will help you to
   reconcile things; otherwise the difficulty will be too hard for you.
   The saints that have suspected or distrusted God have found themselves
   in an error, Isa. xlix. 14, 15 and Ps. lxxvii. 8-10. (1.) You must not
   interpret God's promise by his providence, but his providence by his
   promise; and the promise is the light side, and providence the dark
   side of the cloud: Isa. xlv. 15, Thou hidest thyself, God of Israel,
   the Saviour;' Ps. lxxvii. 19, Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in
   the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.' We cannot trace
   him; a man cannot find out the reason of everything that God doth. (2.)
   You must distinguish between a part of God's work and the end of it. We
   cannot understand God's providence till he hath done his work. In the
   last act of the comedy all the errors are reconciled. Tarry till then:
   Zech. xiv. 7, At evening it shall be light.' We view providence by
   pieces, and we know not what God is a-doing, rending and tearing all in
   pieces. But view God's work in its whole frame and contexture, and it
   will appear beautiful. (3.) We must distinguish between what is best
   for us and what we judge is best for us: Deut. viii. 15, 16, Who led
   thee through the great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery
   serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who
   brought thee forth water out of the rock; who fed thee in the
   wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble
   thee, and prove thee, to do thee good at the latter end.' Other diet is
   more wholesome for our souls than our sick appetite craveth. It is best
   with us many times when we are weakest: 2 Cor. xii. 10, When I am weak,
   then am I strong;' worst, when strongest: 2 Chron. xxvi. 16, When he
   was strong, his heart was lifted up to his own destruction.' Many times
   the buffetings of Satan are better for us than a condition free from
   temptations; so is poverty and emptiness better than fulness. (4.) We
   must distinguish between what things are in themselves, and what in
   their reduction, use, and tendency. All things are for a believer in
   their use, though they may be against him in their nature, 1 Cor. iii.
   18-20, and Rom. viii. 28. All things shall work together for good to
   them that love God.' All their crosses, yea, sometimes their sins and
   snares, God will overrule them for good, and the work of grace
   sometimes goeth back that it may go forward. Many such cases there are
   which look like a contradiction, which we shall not know what to make
   of them, unless we bring it to Christ, an interpreter, one of a
   thousand. But take heed in these confusions and tossings of thy soul
   how thou reflectest on God; a little experience will confute thy
   prejudices.

   Thirdly, With respect to the nearest context, the former clause of this
   verse. After an appeal to the covenant of grace, or a petition for
   mercy, he asketh direction to keep the law.

   Doct. They that would have mercy by the covenant must be earnest to be
   taught God's statutes.

   Mercy and teaching are David's two great requests throughout this and
   other psalms.

   Reason 1. The moral obligation of the law still lieth on God's
   servants, that are taken into the covenant of grace. There is an
   eternal obligation upon the creature to love and serve the creator,
   which cannot be dissolved. We are not redeemed from the service of the
   law by Christ, hut the curse of the law: Luke i. 74, 75, Being;
   delivered from the hands of our enemies, that we might serve God in
   holiness and righteousness before him all our days.' The end of our
   redemption was not to destroy our service according to the law, but to
   fit and enable us to perform it according to the image of God restored
   in us, Eph. iv. 24. The new man is created to restore in some measure
   those abilities we lost in Adam. God never yet gave man a, liberty to
   be free from the obligation of the moral law. He would not pardon any
   sin against it without satisfaction made by Christ, and believed and
   pleaded by sinful man. Christ merited, and God restored the spirit of
   sanctification, that men might keep it. He will not spare his own
   children, when they transgress against it by heinous and scandalous
   sins, as to temporal punishments: Prov. xi. 31, The righteous man shall
   be recompensed upon earth; much more the wicked and the sinner;' Ps.
   xxx. 31, David and Eli both smarted for their sins. No man hath
   interest in Christ unless he return to the obedience of this law: 1
   Cor. ix. 21, To them that are without law, as without law (being not
   without law to God, but under the law to Christ), that I might gain
   them that are without law;' Rom. viii. 1, 2, There is therefore now no
   condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
   flesh, but after the spirit: for the law of the spirit of life in
   Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.' No
   interest in mercy else: Gal. vi. 16, As many as walk according to this
   rule, peace and mercy be upon them.' We cannot have full communion with
   God till we perfectly obey it: Eph. v. 27, That he might present it to
   himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such
   thing, but it should be holy and without blemish.'

   Reason 2. The great privilege of the covenant of grace is to be taught
   God's statutes, or to have a real impress of them upon the heart and
   mind, which is the way of divine teaching: Heb. viii. 10, For this is
   the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel in those days,
   saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in
   their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
   people.' He will cure us of our wickedness, weakness, and carelessness,
   and enable us to keep his law; it is God's undertaking to do so, and
   that out of free grace and favour, for he is not indebted to us; it is
   to give us knowledge of them, and power to keep them. Much of the law
   natural cannot be severed from it, and that is the reason why the
   heathens have the law written upon their hearts, Rom. ii. 15; but the
   writing is very imperfect, both as to knowledge and power to keep it.
   God will imprint them more perfectly; this is the true notion of the
   law. By the mind is meant understanding, by the heart the rational
   appetite. In the mind is the directive counsel; in the will the
   imperial and commanding power. There is the prime mover of all human
   actions; he giveth an apprehensive and perceptive power, whereby we
   apprehend things more clearly, and effectually desire and affect
   spiritual delights.

   Use 1. To refute the claim of them that would plead mercy, but would
   still go on in their own ways, blessing themselves in their sins. Till
   our hearts and minds are suited to God's law by a permanent tincture of
   holiness, we are not fit subjects to ask mercy and the promises of the
   covenant.

   Use 2. If we would have this effect, we must go to God, who alone can
   work upon the immortal soul, to reform, mould, or alter it. A new man
   or angel cannot do it; they may by sense and fancy teach him many
   things; but to make these lively impressions must be the work of the
   Spirit.

SERMON CXXXVII.

   I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
   testimonies.--Ver. 125.

   IN this verse he repeateth his plea and request also. In the former
   verse he mentioneth the relation of a servant, and prayeth, Teach me
   thy statutes.' And here again--(1.) Asserteth his relation to God, I am
   thy servant.' (2.) Reneweth his request, Give me understanding.' (3.)
   The fruit and effect of the grant, That I may know thy testimonies;'
   or, Then I shall know.

   First, This repetition hath its use. This repeating his relation to God
   showeth that where the conscience of our dedication to God, and our
   endeavours to serve him, is clear and sincere, we should not easily
   quit our claim. Deal with thy servant in mercy; yea, Lord, I am thy
   servant: I have my failings; but, Lord, it is in my. heart to serve
   thee; I can and will avow it as long as I live. Our defects and
   disallowed failings do not deprive us of the title of being God's
   servants; we may take comfort in it, and assert our interest in the
   promises as long as we delight to do his will. And though unbelief
   opposeth our claim, we must remove it in the face of all objections.
   Christ puts Peter to a threefold assertion of his love to him, John
   xxi. It is supposed we do not lie, in these redoubled professions of
   our respect and service to God.

   Secondly, This renewing his request showeth his earnestness to increase
   in spiritual understanding. Savoury and powerful knowledge of divine
   things is in itself so excellent a benefit, and our necessity of it is
   so great, that we cannot enough pray for it. Only observe, that in the
   former verse, the notion was statutes, here testimonies. Statutes are
   that part of God's word which we should obey; testimonies that part
   which we should believe, viz., the promises. But this may be too
   critical, the words being taken in this psalm in a greater latitude.

   Doct. That it is a good plea, when we want any mercy, spiritual or
   temporal, to be able to plead that we are God's servants.

   1. That there are a sort of people, that in a peculiar manner are God's
   servants.

   2. These may plead it when they want any mercy, spiritual or temporal.

   First, That some are in a peculiar manner God's servants. The saints of
   God are so called; it was Moses' honour: They sung the song of Moses,
   the servant of the Lord.' So Josh. i. 1, Now after the death of Moses,
   the servant of the Lord.' So Paul asserts it of him self: Acts xxvii.
   23, The God, whose I am, and whom I serve.' Here is a true description
   of a Christian man; he is God's, and serveth God; he is God's by
   special appropriation and communion with God. He serveth God, that is,
   walketh answerable to his relation, and is ever about God's work.
   Elsewhere he describeth himself by his service: Rom. i. 9, My God, whom
   I serve in my spirit;' 1 Tim. i. 3, God, whom I serve with a pure
   conscience.' But to know who in a peculiar manner are God's servants,
   we must distinguish--

   1. God is served actively and passively--by necessity of nature, or
   voluntary choice. Passively, by necessity of nature, all creatures,
   even the inanimate, are his servants: Ps. cxix. 91, They continue this
   day according to thine ordinances, for all are thy servants.' But
   actively, to serve him out of duty and choice; so do only men and
   angels, who were made immediately for his service; the brute and
   inanimate creatures only ultimately and terminatively. They have a
   principle in their nature to incline them to it, are not only overruled
   so to do by the conduct of general providence. The water that driveth a
   mill serveth my purpose, but otherwise than the miller or overseer of
   the work. Fire and water is my servant, much more he.

   2. We must distinguish between those who are God's servants de jure, of
   right, and those who are so de facto, in deed--servants of right, and
   actually his servants. De jure all men are God's servants; God made
   them for himself, Prov. xvi. 4, and Christ bought them for himself:
   Rom. xiv. 9, For to this end Christ both died and rose again, and
   revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.' He is
   despo'tes, a Lord and master, where he is not ku'rios, a covenant
   redeemer and Saviour: 2 Peter ii. 1, They deny the Lord that bought
   them,' agora'santa, a master that bought them for service, and may
   challenge a right and interest in them, having shed his blood for
   mankind. But de facto those are God's servants who yield themselves up
   to God's dominion, to serve and please him in all things with
   cheerfulness and consent. The covenant is represented under divers
   notions; as a covenant of friendship: James ii. 23, Abraham was called
   the friend of God;' as a conjugal covenant: Hosea ii. 19, 20, I will
   betroth thee to me;' as a covenant between king and subjects: Isa.
   xxxiii. 22; as a covenant between master and servants, Isa. lvi. 6,
   that take hold of his covenant, and join themselves to the Lord to be
   his servants. The two former notions imply the sociableness and
   intimacy we have with God in the covenant; the two latter our
   inferiority and subjection. Both must be minded, that as on the one
   side we be not slavish and under bond age, so, on the other, we may not
   behave ourselves too fellow-like with God. We are such servants as are
   also friends, yea, as sons; yea, his spouse. The end of joining
   ourselves to the Lord is not to be partners with him, but servants to
   him.

   3. Some are servants by visible profession and baptismal engagement;
   others really and indeed, by conversion to God, or an actual giving up
   of themselves to his use and service. By baptism we are professed
   servants and subjects to the God of heaven, bound to be so; for it is
   the seal of that covenant of service I spake of before, and so bindeth
   our service in it. We renounce the devil, the world, and the flesh, and
   dedicate ourselves to the Lord. Justin Martyr saith, They did
   anathemati'zein eautou`s to theo; and Ezek. xvi. 8, And entered into a
   covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine;' 1
   Peter iii. 21, The like figure whereunto even baptism doth now save us,
   not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
   conscience towards God.' By profession, all baptized persons are God's
   servants; but in reality all converted persons are so, that are turned
   from idols to serve the living God, 1 Thes. i. 9. Without this, Christ
   will riot be contented with an outside acquaintance and the flattery of
   empty titles, but will the more challenge us by virtue of our
   profession: Mal. i. 6, If I be a father, where is mine honour? if I be
   a master, where is my fear?' Cui res subjecta nomini negatur, is nomine
   illuditur. It was no honour to Christ, but a mere mockery, to be called
   King of the Jews, whilst they buffeted Christ and spat upon him. If God
   be a master, he will have the honour, fear, and obedience that
   belongeth to a master, that we should be afraid to offend him.

   4. There are some that are servants by general relation, to distinguish
   persons, and some by way of special attendance. A servant in general
   relation is every Christian; servants by special attendance are either
   angels, and they are called his ministers, Ps. ciii. 21, as being in
   near and special attendance about their master's person, courtiers of
   heaven, most in grace and favour with God. A man may have one to do his
   business, that yet hath not one to attend his person. Among men, the
   magistrate is the minister of God for good, Rom. xiii. 4. Ministers are
   servants in special attendance, therefore Paul so often calleth himself
   the servant of Jesus Christ: Rom. i. 9, Whom I serve with my spirit in
   the gospel of his Son;' ministers of God, not of the people, but for
   the people, because of their near service about and under God. David
   was both a holy man. and a king, and a prophet. David as a king might
   use this petition: it highly concerneth one in public rank and office
   to say to God, I am thy servant; yea, as private believers. I observe
   it not only to distinguish persons, but to distinguish the work of the
   same person. Christians have, besides their general calling, a
   particular calling wherein to serve God. God hath given us all talents
   to trade withal: Mat. xxv. 14, Who called his servants, and delivered
   unto them his goods;! Luke xxiii. 13, Occupy till I come.' Dona
   talenta. Every one of us, as instruments of providence, are to serve
   God in our generations, Acts xiii. 36, and so not only to mind the work
   of our general calling, but that particular work which he hath given us
   to do in our way and place. The general and particular calling do not
   cross, but help one another. In your particular calling, as instruments
   of God's providence, you provide for jour support during your service,
   and the relief of others: so that, as God's servants, you are not to be
   idle, but to have a lawful employment and calling, that you may not
   cast yourselves upon temptations of using sinful shifts for your
   support and living. It is also a remedy against the evils that flow
   from idleness and too much ease, and that he may promote the good of
   church, family, and kingdom. And then the general calling helpeth the
   particular, by limiting it, and our endeavours therein, that so we may
   have time to save our souls; and directing us, that we do all things
   holily and justly, as become the servants of the Lord.

   Secondly, These may plead it when they want any mercy spiritual or
   temporal.

   1. It is not a plea contrary to grace. Indeed, no such plea can be
   allowed in the new covenant; partly because it is the mere mercy of God
   to advance us to this honour, to make us his servants, and the fruit of
   his goodness, rather than our choice: Rom. ix. 16, It is not of him
   that willeth, nor of him that runneth; but of God that showeth mercy.'
   Willing and running and working and serving are necessary afterwards, 1
   Cor. ix. 24, as our way and qualification. Again, our service is mixed
   with many weaknesses. Mercy there needeth to interpret our best
   actions, Gal. vi. 16. Peace and mercy, when we have done most exactly;
   yea, the very plea of servant excludeth all thought of merit; for a
   servant ipso jure ministerium domino debet: Luke xvii. 9, Doth he thank
   that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I trow
   not.'

   2. It is not contrary to humility. It is not, We are thy children, wo
   are thy saints; but, We are thy servants. It is the meanest of
   relations; it speaketh duty rather than perfection, and pleads not
   property of the house, but propriety and interest in God. The best of
   us are but servants to the high God, and therefore should not carry it
   proudly either to our master or to our fellow-servants. It is a humble
   claim.

   3. It speaketh comfort; for God will provide for his family, and will
   give maintenance, protection, direction, help, and finally wages, where
   he requireth and expecteth service: for the present, necessaries by the
   way; for the future, a blessed reward. For the present, we may depend
   on him as servants on their lord: Ps. cxxiii. 2, Behold, as the eyes of
   servants look to the hands of their masters, and the eyes of maidens to
   the hand of their mistress,' &c. Servants had their dole and portion
   from their masters--the males from the master, the females from the
   mistress; therefore is the expression of looking here used. (1.) God
   will give direction. In the text, David, upon the account of being
   God's servant, beggeth to know his will, as all good servants study
   what will please their masters; and will God appoint us work, and not
   tell us what it is? Ps. cxliii. 10. Teach me to do thy will, for thou
   art my God: thy spirit is good, lead me into the land of uprightness.'
   God doth not only show us what is good in his word, but teacheth us
   also by his Spirit, and directs us in every turn and motion of our
   lives; and we ask it of him as he is our God and Lord. (2.) Help and
   assistance. God is no Pharaoh, to require brick and give no straw; his
   grace is ready to help the endeavouring soul: Gal. ii. 12, 13, Work out
   your salvation; for God worketh in you both to will and to do.' He
   exciteth the first motions, and still carrieth them on to perfection.
   (3.) Protection while he hath a mind to use us; ver. 122. of this
   psalm, Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
   me.' Under the law, if a servant was hurt, the master was to take an
   account, and satisfaction to be made to him for his servant. Deut. xxi.
   32; so God taketh an account of the wrongs of his servants, and will
   demand satisfaction. (4.) Maintenance, 1 Tim. v. 8. Every man hath a
   care devolved upon him, to take care of his family, and provide for
   them, as instruments of God's providence; and will not God provide for
   his own? And then for time to come; God's servants have good wages:
   Heb. xi. 6. He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.' We need
   not seek another paymaster; there is a sure reward. Prov. xi. 18, But
   to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward;' and a great
   reward, Ps. xix. 11, And in the keeping of them is a great reward;' and
   a full reward, 2 John 8, But that we receive a full reward.' No desire
   remaineth unsatisfied.

   Use. To persuade us to become the servants of the Lord.

   1. I will plead with you upon the account of right.

   [1.] You ought to be so jure creationis; you were created by him. As a
   man expecteth fruit from the vine which he hath planted, so may God
   expect from the creature which he hath made; yea, you were made for
   this end. If God had made us for another purpose, our living to that
   end and purpose had been regular. But this was his end, that he might
   be served by us. Let us lay these things together; consider what an
   absolute power God hath by creation; no lord hath such a right over his
   slave or servant as God over us. The slave or servant is either taken
   in battle, or bought and hired with our money; but God made us out of
   nothing: he that made a thing at his own pleasure hath a greater right
   than another can have by purchase, yea, greater right than a master
   over his beast. A master hath a greater right over his beast than over
   his servant: the dominion over the beast is more natural to us than
   over a servant; the servant and master have the same common nature.
   When he gave us dominion over the beasts of the field, the one is
   founded in God's original grant, the other is but a civil right founded
   in temporal accidents. Something is due even to a slave, as our own
   flesh. Yet a man cannot absolutely do with his beast as he will; the
   law of God interposeth: a good man is merciful to his beast. God will
   not allow a cruel disposition, nor give us the absolute disposal over
   the creatures which we made not; nay, more than a potter over the
   vessels which he hath framed, or a work man over his work; he only
   giveth external shape or figure by art, out of matter already prepared.
   But God giveth the whole being out of nothing; nothing but what is his.
   A potter hath power over his work to dispose of it as he pleaseth; here
   the law interposeth not. Surely, if a potter hath power to dispose of
   his vessels, God hath an absolute power to smite or heal, lift up or
   cast down, save or condemn; none can say, What doest thou?' He doth not
   fashion us out of matter prepared, but out of mere nothing. But this
   was his end, that we should love and fear and serve and glorify him.
   Our business was not to eat and drink, and please ourselves and others,
   and live a merry life. All things act to the end for which they were
   created, the sun to shine by day and enlighten the world, the moon and
   stars by night; and they answer their end. Their ultimate end is to
   serve God, their next end is to serve man. All things in the world are
   either subjected to our dominion or created for our use. The heavens,
   though not under our dominion, as beasts, yet are for our use; the
   lower heaven to give us breath, the middle heaven to give us light and
   heat, the highest heaven for our dwelling-place. The sun runneth and
   hasteneth to give us light. The sun shineth for us, the wind bloweth,
   and the water floweth for our use. The earth and air are for our use,
   the earth to tread on, the air to breathe in. And shall not we serve
   him that made the whole course to serve us? All the creatures are at
   work for us day and night, for a poor worm of six foot long! Yea, the
   creator is at work for us: My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.' We
   complain if the creatures do not serve us, and shall not we serve God
   who gave us those servants?

   [2.] A right of preservation. He is Lord alone, because he preserveth
   all things: Neh. ix. 6, Thou, even thou, O Lord, alone; thou hast made
   heaven, and the heaven of heavens with all their host, the earth and
   all things that are therein, the sea and all that is therein; and thou
   preservest them all.' At whose table are we fed? at whose cost and
   expense are we maintained? upon whom do we depend every moment for
   being and operation? Acts xvii. 28, In him we live and move, and have
   our being;' Heb. i. 3, He upholdeth all things by the word of his
   power;' he doth every moment continue what he gave at first. Things
   were not made that they should act and subsist of themselves, as the
   house abideth when the inhabitant is dead and gone. A daily influence
   is necessary. As the beams depend on the sun, so do we every moment
   upon God; every day we are bound to serve him. If God should turn us
   off for preservation to ourselves, how soon should we return to our
   original nothing! God is disengaged if we serve him not. If, out of
   indulgence, he continues our beings, what vile ingratitude is it not to
   serve him! Isa. i. 3, The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his masters
   crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.' Would you
   maintain a servant to do his own work? Since we live upon God, we
   should live to him.

   [3.] A right by redemption: 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20, And ye are not your own,
   for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and
   in your spirit, which is God's.' If a man had bought another out of
   slavery, all his time and strength and service belonged to the buyer.
   Christ hath bought us from the worst slavery with the greatest price,
   and shall we rob him of his purchase? This was his end; he did not
   redeem us to ourselves, but to God; not to live as we list, to exempt
   us from his dominion; that is impossible. Saul promised to make him
   free in Israel that would destroy Goliath, 1 Sam. xvi. 25. But to be
   free from God's dominion cannot be; that was not Christ's end in
   redeeming us, but that we might be put into a capacity to serve God.
   Well, then, when God hath such a right in us, we ought to obey him.

   2. Consider what an honour it is to be God's servants. Servire Deo
   regnare est. The meanest offices about a prince are honourable. No such
   honourable employment as God's service, both in respect of the person
   whom we serve, the great God, and the service itself; it is a service
   of righteousness and holiness, Luke i. 74. This is no drudgery; our
   natures are ennobled; the liberty and perfection of human nature is
   preserved by this service. And then for the quality of our reward,
   there is no such wages, no such reward in any service: John xii. 26,
   And where I am, there shall my servant be: if any man serve me, him
   will my Father honour.' Here is true honour, fitted for great spirits
   that will not stoop to trifles; and indeed God's servant is the only
   great spirit. The most eminent servants in the court of kings have but
   a splendid and more gaudy slavery in comparison of God.

   3. What a happiness, as well as honour, both in respect of our present
   communion with him, and future fruition of him! The Queen of Sheba said
   of Solomon's servants, 1 Kings x. 8, Happy are the men, and happy are
   these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear
   thy wisdom.' Happy those indeed that serve God; they are
   friend-servants: John xv. 15, Henceforth I call you not servants, for
   the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth; but I call you friends, for
   all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.'
   In regard of intimate communion, they are treated as sons, though they
   be servants. Now it is very comfortable to be taken into God's bosom,
   and to have access to him upon all occasions. Besides the reward and
   wages in the life to come, God's servants have great vails. Our earnest
   is better than the world's wages.

   4. Consider what a hard master we were under before: Rom. vi. 17, But
   God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin.' You have obeyed many
   masters: Titus iii. 3, Ye were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
   deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures.' You that were at the
   beck of every brutish lust, and were carried to and fro with so many
   contrary passions and affections, that have left so many wounds in your
   consciences, alarmed by terrors every day, when you denied yourselves
   nothing, thought nothing too much or too dear to spend or part with in
   a sinful course.

   5. If once we come to choose his service, we shall find a difference
   between the Lord and other masters: 2 Chron. xii. 8, Nevertheless they
   shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service
   of the kingdoms of the countries.' The sorrow of the one, the sweetness
   of the other; the misery of the one, the blessedness of the other; the
   bondage of the one, the liberty of the other: they that forsake or
   refuse God's service shall soon find worse masters. God hath ways
   enough to punish our straggling from duty and slighting his service;
   either by putting us under hard taskmasters, some that shall turn the
   edge of authority against us, push with the horns of a lamb, a
   barbarous enemy, making us to be mutual oppressors of each other; or by
   giving us over to Satan's power, or our own hearts' lusts.

   6. Christ's service is not hard nor heavy: Mat. xi. 30, My yoke is easy
   and my burthen light,' notwithstanding all your prejudices against it.
   These men live as they list; they think this a sweet liberty to be
   guided by their own wisdom, and live according to their own wills,
   according to their own ends, and that it is better than to be curbed,
   Ps. ii. 3. But after a little while they have other thoughts, they will
   find the bitterness of such a course. On the contrary, the more we try
   the service of God, the sweeter we shall find it to be: 1 John v. 3,
   And his commandments are not grievous:' and Prov. iii. 17, Her ways are
   ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.' Our work is wages,
   and our very work carrieth a reward in the bosom of it. So sweet and
   comfortable it is. Now for directions.

   [1.] If we would be God's servants, we must sincerely, wholly, and
   absolutely give up ourselves to do his will; and never more to look
   upon ourselves as our own masters, to do what we please, but wholly to
   study what will please God. Isa. lvi. 6, they joined themselves to the
   Lord to serve him, to love the name of the Lord, and be his servants;'
   Rom. vi. 16, Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
   obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?' There is a solemn
   dedication made, we take up his service seriously, not upon example
   barely, or tradition, or fear, or constraint, or some base respects or
   sinister ends, or some sudden pang or motion; but after serious and due
   deliberation, out of judgment rightly informed, and affection thereon
   grounded, do engage themselves to perform humble service to God,
   without limiting or power of revocation, give up themselves wholly to
   follow his directions.

   [2.] God's servants have work to do; none of them must be idle: Mat.
   xx. 6, Why stand ye here all the day idle?' Luke i. 74, 75, That we may
   serve him in holiness and righteousness all our days;' Phil. ii. 12,
   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling;' Acts xxiv. 16, Herein
   do I exercise myself, to keep a good conscience, void of offence.' We
   must not put hands in bosom, having so much work to do. Many presume of
   being God's servants; but it is only in the notion; they do nothing for
   him.

   [3.] This service must not be done grudgingly, but heartily: Isa. lvi.
   6, And the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the Lord, to
   serve him, to love the name of the Lord, and be his servants;' Deut. x.
   12, To love the Lord thy God, and serve him.' God will not be served
   but out of love, not by necessity and constraint. We must yield
   obedientiam servi, but not servilem: we are delivered from a slavish
   spirit: Rom. viii. 15, We have not received the spirit of bond age
   again to fear.' God's service must be gone about with ready affection
   and good-will. The respect which we show to God is called service in
   regard of our strict obligation to it, but obedience in regard of our
   readiness of mind to perform it. Secondly, Not slightly, but with
   reverence and zeal: Mal. i. 6, If I be a master, where is my fear?' Ps.
   ii. 11, Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling;' Phil.
   ii. 12, Work out your salvation with fear and trembling;' and Rom. xii.
   1, I beseech you by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a
   living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable
   service.' God will not be put off with anything by the by, it is a
   lessening of his majesty: I am a great king.' Thirdly, It must be done
   constantly, not by fits. He that is God's servant never ceaseth from
   his work; their feasting, walking, sitting, sleeping, waking, hungry,
   thirsty, hearing, or praying, it is all for God. He that doth any of
   these things merely for himself, to gratify the flesh, doth not act as
   God's servant: Acts xxvi. 16, Serve God instantly day and night.'
   Fourthly, Orderly. All things in God's service must be regarded
   according to their weight: Rom. xiv. 18, For he that in these things
   serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men;' that is the
   main things, not in contests about ceremonies: if others carry these
   matters beyond their weight, let not us; it is not a pin to choose what
   party a man is of, if he doth not mind righteousness and peace and joy
   in the Holy Ghost: as if a servant should provide sauce for his master,
   and neglect to provide meat.

   [4.] Our great end and scope must be to please God. They arc true
   servants that make it their business to please their master: Isa. lvi.
   6, They choose the things that please me, and take hold of my
   covenant;' John viii. 29, The Father hath not left me alone, for I do
   always the things that please him;' 1 Thes. iv. 1, I exhort you all by
   the Lord Jesus Christ, that as you have received of us how to walk and
   please God, so ye would abound more and more;' and 1 John iii. 22. And
   whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments,
   and do the things which please him.' So Heb. xi. 5, Enoch had this
   testimony, that he pleased God.' The property of a servant is not to
   please himself. They that set themselves to please God observe his will
   in all things. There is a great pleasing in the world, but few make it
   their business to please God. All inferiors please their superiors on
   whom they depend; and shall not we please God, who is infinitely
   greater than man, and on whom we depend every moment for all that we
   enjoy?

   Use. Are we God's servants? We all say so; but we speak out of
   conviction of conscience rather than out of inclination of heart; not
   what de facto is, but what de jure should be; and it is well that we
   come so far as to own God's right. Professio ipsa, saith Hilary, habet
   conscientiae necessitatem, non habet confessionis veritatem.

   1. If it be so, then God is our chiefest good and highest lord, whom we
   study to please and gratify. It is certain that is our master which
   hath the greatest part in us, and power and influence over us: Mat. vi.
   24, No man can serve two masters: ye cannot serve God and mammon;' Rom.
   xvi. 18, They serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly;'
   Phil. iii. 19, Whose god is their belly.' It was a speech of Luther,
   Venter in omni religione est potentissimum idolum. It doth all with
   men. Where the belly is served, Christ is neglected. So far as his
   service will comply with the interest of the belly, or a quiet,
   pleasureful life, so far they can be zealous: their religion must feed
   them and maintain them, or else they care not for it--John vi. 26, they
   followed Christ for the loaves--mind religion for outward advantages.
   When our interest and Christ's service go contrary ways, we can
   dispense with our duty to God for the sake of this. It is clear, to be
   servants is to want a power and right to dispose of ourselves, our
   actions, and employments. While any other thing hath an interest in us
   to dispose of us, we are not God's servants; but that thing that hath
   such a power with us is our master.

   2. A servant is chiefly known by obedience: Rom. vi. 16, To whom ye
   yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye
   obey;' Luke xii. 47, 48, And that servant which knew his lord's will,
   and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will,' &c. Men
   may talk high for God, know much; but whom do we ordinarily obey? When
   the flesh bids us go, we go; come, we come. If pride bids us display
   the pomp of wit in our duties, or to hang out the ensigns of our
   vanity, we yield straight. If lust bid us pamper the flesh; we
   presently obey; if coveteousness bid take the wedge of gold, we do it.
   But when a man knoweth anything to be the mind of God, and prepareth
   his heart to do it, he is one of God's servants.

   3. A servant of God is one that the sight of God's will is reason
   enough to him: 1 Thes. v. 18, This is the will of God.' The will of God
   must be the prime and prevalent motive with a Christian; they are
   servants, not to do their own will, but his whose servants they are;
   they do nothing but what their master commandeth, and what he
   commandeth they see reason to obey.

   Second branch, Give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.'
   This is subjoined to the former plea.--(1.) Because David would not be
   a servant in name and title only, but in deed and in truth; and
   therefore would fain know his duty. (2.) To show the difference between
   God's servants and the servants of other lords who command us: Prov.
   xiv. 25, The king's favour is towards a wise servant;' they see them
   wise, find them wise, and then love them: but God must begin with us;
   his favour maketh us wise.

   Doct. God's best servants think they can never enough beg divine
   illumination.

   David doth often enforce this request.

   Reason 1. Our blindness in the matters of God is a great part of our
   spiritual misery: Eph. v. 8, Ye were sometimes in darkness.' There is a
   veil lying upon our hearts, not easily removed and taken away. All the
   mischief introduced by the fall is not cured at once, but by degrees;
   as spiritual strength increaseth we grow up into it; so spiritual
   light. The maim of the understanding, as well as the will, is not
   wholly cured till we come to heaven, for here we know but in part; till
   God give us understanding, we are utterly blind; the best of God's
   servants have cause to acknowledge it in themselves, the remnants of
   ignorance and incredulity. The apostle biddeth them to add to faith
   virtue, to virtue knowledge; that is, skill to manage the work of our
   heavenly calling.

   Reason 2. None are so sensible of this blindness as they. It is some
   proficiency in knowledge to understand our ignorance: Prov. xxx. 2, 3,
   Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding
   of a man.' I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the
   holy.' The most knowing see they need more enlightening. The best of
   our knowledge is to know our imperfections, 1 Cor. viii. 2. He that
   thinketh he knoweth anything, knoweth nothing as he ought to know.

   Reason 3. There is room for increase; for in the best we never know so
   much of God's ways but we may know more: Hosea vi. 3, Then shall we
   know, if we follow on to know the Lord;' Prov. iv. 18, But the path of
   the just is as a shining light, that shineth more and more unto the
   perfect day.' True sanctified knowledge is always growing. If we sit
   down with measures received, it is a sign we do not know things as we
   should know them. Christ grew in knowledge, not in grace, for the
   fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily. Practical knowledge is
   never at a stand; though a man may see round the compass and light of
   saving truth, yet he may know them more spiritually and more feelingly.

   Reason 4. The profit of divine revelation as to these three things:--

   1. A clear discerning of the things of God, not a confused notion; as
   the blind man in the Gospel saw men as trees walking. So 2 Cor. iv. 6,
   For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
   in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,
   in the face of Jesus Christ;' and 1 John v. 20, And hath given us an
   understanding, that we may know him that is true.' Every degree of
   knowledge is God's gift. What other men see confusedly, we see more
   distinctly in this light.

   2. Firm assent. Then shall I know thy testimonies;' know them from
   others that have not divine authority. It is the spirit of wisdom and
   revelation that openeth our eyes to see the truth and worth of heavenly
   things contained in the promise: Eph. i. 17, 18, The father of glory
   may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
   him, the eyes of your understandings being enlightened, that ye may
   know the hope of his calling, and the riches of the glory of the
   inheritance of the saints in light;' and Mat. xvi. 17, Flesh and blood
   hath not revealed these things unto thee.' Human credulity we may have
   upon the report of others, the evidence of the truths themselves; but
   this firm assent is the fruit of divine illumination.

   3. Hearty practice. Let thy testimonies not only strike my ear, but
   affect my heart, command my hand, let me know them so as to do them,
   for otherwise our knowledge is little worth. God doth so direct, that
   he doth also enable us to approve our obedience to him sincerely and
   faithfully. There is a knowledge that puffeth us up, 1 Cor. viii. 1,
   which yet is a gift, and floweth from the common influence of the
   Spirit: Jer. xxii. 16, Was not this to know me? saith the Lord.' But
   there is a greater efficacy in practical knowledge, such as warmeth the
   heart with love to the truths known, John iv. 10, If thou knewest the
   gift,' &c. Such a light as proceedeth from the gracious influence of
   the Spirit.

   Use 1. Let us be often dealing with God in prayer, that our judgments
   may be enlightened with the understanding of the word, and our
   affections renewed and strengthened unto the true obedience of it; beg
   for that lively light of the Spirit.

   1. We need it. In how many things do we err in the things which we
   know! how weak are we both as to sound judgment and practice! The
   apostle saith, We know but in part,' 1 Cor. xiii. 9; We are but of
   yesterday, and we know nothing,' Job viii. 9. Therefore we have need to
   go to the Ancient of days, that he may teach us knowledge, and kindle
   our lamps anew at the fountain of light. Alas! we take it in by drops,
   or by degrees, as a tender and sore eye must be used to the light. We
   have but little time to get knowledge in, and do not improve that
   little time we have.

   2. We have leave to ask it: James i. 5, If any man lack wisdom, let him
   ask it of God;' and why do we not, seeing we have a liberty to ask it?

   3. God hath promised to bestow it; he will give his Spirit to them that
   ask it, Luke xi. 13. And to beget faith in us: If ye then, being evil,
   know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your
   heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?' Here is a
   notable argument; he reasoneth and promiseth. And Prov. ii. 3, we must
   cry for knowledge. Well, then, let us be earnest, that we may not miss
   that which is to be had for asking; beg for a heart to know, Jer. xxiv.
   7, I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord.'

   Use 2. It informeth us that there is somewhat more than the word
   necessary to give us knowledge. God must not only reveal the object,
   but prepare the subject. David having a law, beggeth understanding that
   he might know God's testimonies. The literal sense and meaning of the
   words may be understood by common gifts and ordinary industry, unless
   men be exceedingly blinded and hardened by their own prejudices. But to
   have a spiritual understanding of them, so as to profit and increase in
   sanctification, that is from the Lord. These things may be drawn into a
   system, wherein there will be nothing that exceedeth the understanding
   of a man. But to understand it so as to be affected with and changed by
   it, that is from the Spirit: 1 John v. 20, And we know that the Son of
   God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him
   that is true;' and Eph. v. 8, Ye were darkness, but now are ye light in
   the Lord.' He is the purchaser and author of that light.

   Use 3. Is reproof to those that presume on their own wit to under stand
   divine mysteries. Many think they have eyes in their head, and can see
   into matter as far as other men, and conceive and judge of a thing as
   soon and as well as others can do; and so will not acknowledge their
   dulness and blindness in heavenly things, take it ill to be told of it:
   John ix. 4, Are we blind also?' In a rage scoff at those that talk of
   the enlightening of the Spirit, and being taught of God. Alas! you must
   be blind and be fools before you be wise, 1 Cor iii. 18, in your own
   conviction and feeling.

SERMON CXXXVIII.

   It is time for thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void thy
   law.--Ver. 126.

   IN the words we have--(1.) A prayerful suggestion, it is time for thee,
   Lord, to work. (2.) The reason of it, for they have made void thy law.

   In the first branch take notice of--

   1. The person to whom the address is made, for thee, Lord.

   2. The suggestion itself, what and when; what they would have the Lord
   to do, to work; and when, even now, it is time to work.

   To open these, I begin with--

   1. The person to whom the address is made, the Lord. Some read the
   words, It is time to work for thee, O Lord, because they have made void
   thy law. It is time indeed to work for God, when so many work against
   him, in an evil generation; lest the law should perish and fall to the
   ground, some should keep up the authority of it, and they that fear God
   are to encourage one another, Mal. iii. 16. The Chaldee paraphrase
   reads it, It is time to do the will of the Lord.' But the Hebrew
   original carries it as we do, it is time for Jehovah to do. The
   Septuagint, kairo`s tou poiesai to kuri`o. The vulgar Latin, Tempus
   faciendi, Domine.

   2. Here is the suggestion itself--(1.) What they would have God to do.
   It is expressed by a general word, work; as also Jer. xiv. 7, Do, for
   thy name's sake.' What should he do? Tempus mittendi Filium Dei, saith
   Augustine; to set about the work of redemption, to send the Son of God.
   But that is a work rather to exercise and show forth his justice,
   power, and truth, both in punishing his enemies and delivering his
   people, to work his own proper work of justice, as becometh the judge
   of all the world to do; namely, to punish the wicked, and help his
   servants out of their hands. (2.) When it is time. Then it seemeth to
   be a time when man's wickedness is grown to the height: Gen. xv. 16, In
   the fourth generation they shall come again, for the sins of the
   Amorites are not yet full.' Good men are put to the uttermost of their
   patience, and God's glory abused beyond mea sure, Isa. lii. 5. Lord, it
   is time to work; they are as bad as bad may be; thy people have quite
   spent all their faith and patience; when thine ordinances and word are
   despised and affronted, and thy people trodden under foot, it is time
   for-thee to work.

   Secondly. Let us explain the reason, For they have made void thy law.'
   The law is made void two ways, formaliter et interpretative.

   1. Formally, when any deny the authority of God, as Pharaoh: Exod. v.
   5, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?' Or those rebels, Ps.
   xii. 4, Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?' Or we make void the
   law when we deny it to be given of God, as Marcion and his followers,
   that the law was given by an evil god. Many now question the scriptures
   themselves, or deny the obligation of the moral law to believers, as
   the antinomians and libertines, as the apostle telleth us, Rom. iii.
   31, that we do not make void the law by faith; yea, we establish the
   law.' It was the greatest ratification to it that could be. Or,
   finally, those that take upon them to enact things contrary to the law
   of God, or besides the law, as necessary to salvation, and enforce
   their own traditions beyond and before the law of God. These make void
   the law, as Christ telleth the pharisees that they made the
   commandments of God of no effect by their traditions,' Mat. xv. 6.
   Especially when they obtrude these things upon the consciences of
   others under the highest penalties.

   2. Interpretatively, when men by consequence take away the honour and
   authority that is due to the law, by their wickedness and rebellion
   against God. Though in words they acknowledge the authority of God and
   the obligation of his law, yet they have no respect to it in their
   carriage and practice, doing whatever pleaseth themselves, stand in no
   awe of God and his word, reject it as a thing of nought. Obedience to
   the law is a ratifying and confirming the law by our consent: Deut.
   xxvii. 26, Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law
   to do them.' Our words do not confirm the law so much as our works. So,
   on the contrary, they repeal or make void the law that observe it not
   in their practice. Finis operis is made finis operantis, as if they
   intended to abolish, whilst they make no reckoning of the law. Where
   observe, that this is a notion to make sin odious to us; it is not only
   anomi'a, a transgression of the law, 1 John iii. 4; but a despising the
   law, 2 Sam. xii. 9; a judging or censuring the law, James iv. 11; yea,
   a repealing and disannulling the law, which is the notion of the text.

   Doct. That when a flood of wickedness is broken out, we may put God in
   mind of doing his work of punishing the wicked and delivering his
   people.

   I shall give you the sum of this doctrine in these four considerations.

   1. That God doth for a while hold his hand, and bear with the
   wickedness of his enemies.

   2. Though he doth for a while bear with them, yet he hath his times to
   punish and proceed to execution.

   3. This time is usually when the impiety and insolency of wicked men is
   come to a height.

   4. When it is come to a height, we may and must mind God of doing his
   work, or arising to judgment.

   The first consideration is implied in the doctrine and the text; the
   other three are express.

   First, It is implied that God doth for a while hold his hand, and not
   seem to mind his work. Though the least sin deserveth the greatest
   plagues, even when it is first committed, yet such is God's patience
   and long-suffering, that he wilt not at first punish even the sins of
   his enemies, but will let them ripen and come to a height before he
   smite. This he doth--

   1. To show his bounty and goodness to all his creatures. He will not
   easily destroy the workmanship of his hands, even the provoking wicked;
   but giveth them time to repent and change their course; Rev. ii. 21, I
   gave her space to repent of her fornications, and she repented not.'
   The worst have leave to repent, means to repent, time to repent; and if
   they have not the grace to repent, they may blame themselves: Rom. ix.
   22, He endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath, fitted
   for destruction,' en polle makrothumi'a. The reprobate taste of God's
   common goodness as they are members of the world, are forborne for a
   long time, till they be sear and rotten through, fit for the burning.
   Nay, let me observe this: God, that is very quick with his people, is
   very patient towards them that perish. God is quick with his own
   people; he will visit their iniquities with scourges, and will not
   suffer sin to lie upon them; and therefore they are chastened every
   morning. Yet this God is very patient to them that know no better,
   profess no better, have had no experience of his ways; and though they
   finally perish, it is long first, till their sins do even extort
   vengeance out of his hands.

   2. To chastise, exercise, and prove his own people, he beareth with the
   wickedness of their enemies.

   [1.] To chastise them for their sins, that they may be brought low, and
   their souls be humbled to the dust. Certainly this God expects before
   he will appear for us: 1 Peter v. 6, Humble yourselves under the mighty
   hand of God.' And because his people are backward to this work, he
   permitteth such instruments as will not spare, but lay on to the
   purpose: Isa. x. 5, 6, O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff
   in their hand is mine indignation. I will send him against an
   hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him
   a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them
   down like the mire of the streets.' When God is angry with his people,
   he can easily find a rod for them; yea, not only a rod, but a staff,
   which is a more heavy instrument of correction: he can find instruments
   sufficiently exasperated, and full of malice, severe executioners; and
   he lets them alone till they have done his work, though they manage his
   controversy with cruel minds, and evil and destructive intentions.
   Sometimes God punisheth his people with divisions among themselves; and
   though they are very troublesome one to another, yet a sheep cannot
   worry a sheep, as a wolf will; they do it to the purpose, in a most
   cruel and despiteful manner. Now, though he will reckon with wicked men
   for their violence, for transgressing their bounds, and going beyond
   his revealed will and approbation, Zech. i. 15, yet not till his work
   be done upon Mount Zion and Jerusalem: Isa. x. 12, When the Lord hath
   done his work upon Mount Zion and Jerusalem, I will punish the stout
   heart of the king of Assyria.' He will not cast the rod into the fire
   till we have felt the smart of it, and be thoroughly humbled under his
   mighty hand.

   [2.] To exercise his people, that they may not contract rust, and
   languish and grow idle in heaven's way. Alas! when we live at ease, and
   have nobody to trouble us, God is little owned, loved, and
   acknowledged, the throne of grace lieth neglected and unfrequented; and
   therefore he permitteth enemies to keep us in breath: Ps. lix. 11, Slay
   them not, lest my people forget.' Things in conceit do not leave such
   an impression upon us as things in feeling. Scipio would have Carthage
   stand, to whet and exercise the Roman valour. We need vigilant enemies
   as a guard upon us, that we may be kept aweful, serious, mindful of
   God, constantly in the exercise of faith and dependence. Wicked men
   have their ministry and service, to be as goads in our sides and
   scourges on our backs, to whip us to our duty, and make us mend our
   pace heavenward: Ps. xciv. 12, Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest,
   and teachest him out of thy law;' chastened by the molestations of the
   wicked, for all along he complaineth of the delay of vengeance on the
   persecutors; and in the next verse he saith, Until the pit be digged
   for the wicked;' as condemned men are suffered to live till their
   gallows and grave be made ready: if they trouble us in the meanwhile,
   it is to reduce us to a sense and practice of our duty; and that we may
   not securely go on in a course of vanity and sin. Till that be done,
   the pit is not ready for the wicked and ungodly oppressors; they dig
   their own pit by their sin and oppression.

   [3.] To prove his people as well as to exercise them. To prove their
   faith and their patience; their faith, to see whether they can live by
   faith, and not by sense and present appearance; whether we are
   persuaded that there is a just and righteous God, that is the supreme
   governor of the world, notwithstanding all the oppositions and
   confusions they groan under: Hab. ii. 3, 4, Because it will surely
   come, and will not tarry. Behold, his soul that is lifted up is not
   upright in him, but the just shall live by his faith;' that is, the
   Lord's purpose in delaying to perform the vision is to try and discover
   who are the lofty and unsound, and who can subsist and hold out by
   faith on God's being, and providence, and promises, and world to come,
   and so wait upon God in hard times without fainting. If God should
   smite as soon as his enemies provoke him, faith would be of no use, and
   the whole world would be governed by sense. To believe the justice and
   mercy of God, though for the time we do not see any manifestation of
   it, that is the trial of faith. We know there is one that sits above
   and seeth all. Though the world be in an uproar, and they that work
   wickedness are set up, and God's servants persecuted, yet we know that
   God will reckon with them in due time. And secondly, to prove their
   patience, in bearing the present difficulties, and tarrying the Lord's
   leisure: Rev. xiii. 10, Here is the patience and faith of the saints;'
   that is, a sensible proof of it, when a powerful enemy carrieth. all
   before him: there would be little use of such a grace but for such
   times. This is submission to God, when we are resolved to tarry for his
   season, though we know it not, and will wait as long as God will have
   us wait, when all human probabilities are taken away, and we have
   nothing but God's providence to live upon.

   Second consideration. Though he bear long, yet he hath his times to
   punish and arise to judgment.

   1. With respect to himself and his own glory: Ps. ix. 16, The Lord is
   known by the judgment which he executeth.' Little of God would be taken
   notice of in the world unless he did now and then give out sensible
   demonstrations of his power and justice, and mindfulness of human
   affairs. What strange conceits would men else have of God! as if no
   God, no providence, no distinction between good and evil; but as if God
   were indifferent to either, and did favour good and bad alike: and
   therefore it is in vain to trouble ourselves about the worship and
   service of God, no reward nor punishment. These are the uses the wicked
   make of God's forbearance, either to deny God and providence: Ps. lv.
   19, Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.' If they
   have shifted from vessel to vessel, they corrupt and settle upon the
   lees, Zeph. i. 12; they say God will not do good, neither will he do
   evil, nor interpose; but suffereth enemies to trample upon his people
   and glorious name. Or else pervert the interpretation of providence:
   Ps. l. 21. Thou thoughtest I was altogether such a one as thyself;' as
   if he did favour their ways. They misinterpret providence, and make the
   sun go according to their dial, or else ascribe the act of providence
   to themselves; Deut. xxxii. 27, Lest they should say, Our hand is high,
   and the Lord hath not done all this.' When long permitted to prosper,
   they think they have mastered heaven, that there is no power superior
   to theirs, and they can carry all before them at their pleasure.
   Therefore God must vindicate himself by his works, and give out some
   demonstrations to sense that there is a distinction between good and
   evil; that God is differently affected to either, that he hateth the
   evil and loveth the good, and accordingly there is a reward and
   punishment: Ps. lviii. 11, Verily there is a reward for the righteous.'
   God is fain to teach them by briers and thorns, or else the stupid
   world would not take notice of it, but think the world is governed by
   chance, not administered by an almighty, all-wise, and most just
   providence. They knew not what to think of providence when they saw the
   godly oppressed and the wicked high in power.

   2. With respect to his people. Surely God will not always chide; for
   God considers the weakness of man: Ps. ciii. 14, He remembers we are
   but dust.' The hearts of his people would fail and faint, and they
   would be tempted to some forbidden course to ease themselves, Isa. lix.
   16. He knows our spirits would fail; God would not have us utterly to
   be discouraged. We are liable to temptations: Ps. cxxv. 3, The rod of
   the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the
   righteous put forth their hands to iniquity.' Therefore he hath his
   breathing times, and times of intermission from trouble. The spirits of
   a poor creature would soon be drunk up if there were not some well
   days; therefore he will show himself to his people.

   3. With respect to the wicked, who would grow excessive and outrageous
   in sin: Rom. ii. 5, But after thy hardness and impenitent heart,
   treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath;' Eccles.
   viii. 11, Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
   speedily, therefore the hearts of the sons of men are fully set in them
   to do evil;' grow bold, resolute, and settled in an evil way; go on
   without remorse, because they go on without trouble, and so grow to be
   monsters in sin. It is only faith that can see afar off, but infidelity
   and atheism mind not what is to come, and look only to what is present.
   Well, then, lest wicked men should thus continue themselves in sin, God
   hath his time to reckon with them; his justice is not asleep all this
   while, but God keeps a petty sessions in this world before the general
   assizes. Now concerning this time, let me tell you four things:--

   [1.] There is a time appointed. There is an end of all things, not only
   an expected end. but also an appointed end: Hab. ii. 3, The vision is
   for an appointed time;' things are not left to their own hazard and
   chance to work out their own end; but ordered and appointed by the wise
   God: Dan. xi. 27, Yet the end shall be at the time appointed;; ver. 35,
   To try them, and purge them, and to make them white, even to the time
   of the end; because it is yet for a time appointed.' There is a course
   of providence set by God which shall at length come to its end and
   period.

   [2.] This is the best time: 1 Peter v. 6, That he may exalt you in due
   time.' There is a due time, as well as a set time. There is nothing in
   the whole administration of God preposterous, unseasonable, or
   disorderly. Wait but a little, and you shall see the reason of all this
   course of dispensations; for God doth all things in number, weight, and
   measure. If it had come sooner or later, it would not have come so
   seasonably: Eccles. iii. 11, He hath made everything beautiful in its
   time.' When God's work is done, and all things are put together, you
   will see a marvellous beauty in it. It is just with the work of
   providence as with the work of creation, every day's work was good;'
   but when God saw all his works together, in their frame and
   correspondence, all was very good,' Gen. i. 31. We would think that God
   should come sooner to our deliverance: God is not slack, but we are too
   hasty; if he should come sooner, it would be the worse for us. We would
   have thought God should have owned Joseph in the pit. No; God stays
   till he be cast into prison; and in prison Joseph would fain come out
   as soon as Pharaoh's butler was come out, but he forgot him. God would
   not have it so; he must tarry there till God's time was come, and then
   had not only deliverance out of prison, but preferment. So many times
   we would be contented with half a deliverance, and would have it now,
   but God will give it us in the best season.

   [3.] It is but a short time. Say sense what it will, it is but mikro`n
   o'son o'son, a little little while, and he that shall come will come,
   and will not tarry,' Heb. x. 37. It is not so long as enemies would
   make it, for they would root out the memorial of God's children; not so
   long as sin would make it, or as fancy would conceive it. Suffering
   hours pass tediously; we count quarters and minutes when we are in pain
   or anxious expectation; we think an hour a week, a week a month, a
   month a year, and every year seven. Yea, not so long as reason would
   make it as to probabilities and the course of second causes. When
   things are fortified and backed with a strong interest, to reason it
   will be a long time. It is not so long as sense would make it; though
   we count the years, the winter is over, and the spring is come, and yet
   we are not saved, and can say, It is thus long; yet this is not long in
   comparison of eternity, 2 Cor. iv. 17. It is not long to faith, for to
   the eye of faith things future and afar off are present, Heb. xi. 1.
   Not long to love, Gen. xxix. 20: seven years are as a few days; they
   that believe an eternity, and have any love to God, will say it is
   short. But a short walk is a long journey to the sick and weak; the
   impatience of our flesh makes it seem long.

   [4.] When the time is come, God will make speedy work: Isa. lx. 2, The
   Lord will hasten it in his time;' Luke xviii. 7, Shall not God avenge
   his own elect?' Rev. xviii. 7, Her plagues shall come in one day;' Isa.
   lxvi. 8, A nation born in a day.' All these places show (and it is a
   comfort to us) that no difficulty shall hinder when the season calls
   for it. He that produced heaven and earth at once, what cannot he do?
   We are dismayed when we consider an evil party fortified with combined
   interests, strength of opposite factions, force of laws and worldly
   powers; but God can make a nation be born in one day. It will be quick
   work when God once begins.

   Third consideration. This time is usually when the impiety and
   insolency of wicked men is come to a height. Indeed there are other
   notes; as when his people's hearts are prepared to receive and improve
   deliverance, when God's glory calleth for it. But this is the season
   mentioned in the text; therefore I shall show you--

   1. That this is a season.

   2. Inquire when iniquity is come to a height.

   3. Why then God doth usually interpose.

   1. That this is a season: Gen. xv. 16, The sins of the Amorites are not
   yet full.' God showeth his patience to that wicked people, till the
   measure of their sins were filled up. So wrath came upon the
   persecuting Jews when they had filled up the measure of their fathers,
   Mat. xxiii. 32. While the enemy's cup is a-filling, God delayeth, and
   we must wait. So Dan. viii. 23, When the transgressors are come to the
   full.' Once more, Joel iii. 13, Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest
   is ripe; come, get ye down, for the press is full, the fats overflow,
   for their wickedness is great.' The Lord compares sinners to a field of
   ripe corn ready to be cut, full fats and wine-presses to be trod out.
   When sin is ripe, the execution of vengeance will not be long forborne.

   2, When doth iniquity come to a height? I answer--Their iniquities may
   be considered as to the two branches of it--their rebellion and
   disobedience to God, and their injuries and vexation of the saints.

   [1.] Their disobedience and contempt of God.

   (1.) When this is general. All orders and ranks of persons have
   corrupted their way, as the Sodomites compassed the house, Gen. xix. 4;
   both young and old, all the people from every quarter. Usually in
   making a judgment upon the state of a people, you will find it thus: If
   any part be right, it keeps off the judgment from the rest; if a
   zealous magistracy, though a corrupt people, or an unsavoury ministry,
   and a praying, mourning people, God holds his hand, and will not
   proceed to judgment. They are the salt of the earth,' Mat. v. 13; and
   Isa. vi. 13, The holy seed shall be the substance thereof.' But when
   all join in one, in a neglect of God, and common enmity to his ways;
   then, I say, the judge of the earth will do his work, then wrath
   breaketh out.

   (2.) When it groweth impudent and outrageous, as if they would
   obliterate and extinguish the law of God, or take away all force and
   authority from it by their perverse actions and pernicious examples.
   They do not obliquely, and under the show of divers pretences, break
   God's laws, but openly set themselves against him, and break a
   commandment without any shame: Isa. iii. 9, They declare their sin as
   Sodom, and hide it not;' yea, they glory in their shame,' Phil. iii.
   19; as if they would out-face heaven and religion at once, and all
   honesty and ingenuity by their debaucheries. Bold-faced sin doth not go
   long unpunished.

   (3.) Desperate incorrigibleness. All remedies are unprofitable, and
   hope of amendment taken away, Jer. vi. 3; Ezek. xxiv. 13, When God
   would have purged them, they would not be purged.' He trieth them with
   several conditions, he hath a love for them as they are his creatures;
   judgments and mercies they had, yet they are no change lings, but go on
   as wicked as ever. God trieth key after key, one providence after
   another, yet not a whit the better or wiser; but are like men that have
   slept: still abuse his patience, and defeat all the methods of his
   grace, show the same corruption they did before.

   (4.) When they run into unnatural sins, and the corruption of human
   society is endangered: Lev. xviii. 27, 28, For all these abominations
   have the men of the land done,' &c.; when men are so wicked and filthy
   that a man needs to be a criminal to be acceptable to them; they think
   it strange that others run not into the same excess of riot, 1 Peter
   iv. 4; certainly then God needeth to strike in, that virtue may be
   upheld in some kind of reputation.

   [2.] Their violence and vexation of the saints. It was Bede's
   observation, Odium in religionis professores, &c.--that hatred of the
   professors of religion was that undid his country. God is angry when
   his people are wronged; the world is kept up for their sakes. Were it
   not for the elect to be gathered, time would be no more; for their
   sakes kingdoms and churches are preserved; they are the staff and stay,
   the chariots and horsemen of Israel. God is tender of them as the apple
   of his eye; therefore, when they are wronged, and men are not only evil
   themselves, but haters of those that are good, and do not only break
   God's laws themselves, but would force others to do so, God will hold
   no longer. As their violence increaseth, so doth their ruin hasten,
   Rev. xii. 12. When they abuse their power to such an end, though God
   may bear with them for a time till they have done their work, yet he
   will reckon with them: Zech. i. 15, I am sore displeased with the
   heathen that are at ease; for I was a little displeased, and they
   helped forward the affliction.' God will not forget his relation to his
   sinning people, and will not suffer them to be abused out of measure.
   When they would destroy and root out whom God would only correct and
   purge, it is a sign of their approaching ruin. Now these things should
   be considered by us to a good end; not to feed an evil humour, or to
   increase our hatred and exasperation against a party, whom, it may be,
   we hate too much already with a carnal hatred; but to a good purpose.
   Partly that we may not be too confident of carnal ease too soon. God
   will, it may be, have the enemies' cup yet fuller, and that they shall
   appear more in their own colours. And so our trials may be greater. We
   know not the bounds of the Lord's patience. We, that are apt to
   extenuate our own sins, are apt to aggravate the sins of others, look
   upon them in the glass of fashion, and cry too soon, It is time. But of
   this by and by. And partly that we may see the greatness of our
   transgressions, by which we have provoked the Lord to give us up into
   the hands of such men as blaspheme his name every day, Isa. lii. 5. Our
   sins were full in our kind, in the abuse of God's truth and worship;
   and though not such moral wickedness, yet a great deal of spiritual
   wickedness. And God is more quick and severe upon us, and will not bear
   that in a professing people that he beareth in others: Judgment begins
   at the house of God,' 1 Peter iv. 17. The cup of trembling goes round,
   and his own people drink first, and our staggering is not yet over; in
   time they shall pledge us. God beareth with Balaam, though he tempted
   him again and again, when he would not bear with the young prophet whom
   the lion slew. He bore with the Philistines a long time ere they were
   plagued. We feel the smart of the rod sooner, Zech. xii. Yet it is
   apparent our kind of sins were grown to a ripeness, our self-seeking,
   factions, turbulency, unquietness under government, abuse of Christian
   liberty, uncharitable divisions among ourselves, vexing one another,
   vain opinions, slighting God's ministers and ordinances. And partly
   that we may be humbled for their sins. It should be a grief to us to
   see men break God's laws, to see men out-dare heaven. David fasted for
   his enemies, Ps. xxxv. 14-16; and Ps. cxix. 136, Rivers of tears run
   down mine eyes, because men keep not thy law;' because God is so much
   dishonoured, human nature so much corrupted. If more of this spirit
   were stirring, it were the better for us. And partly that we may fear
   ourselves. We are bound up in the same community, and when God judgeth
   them, how shall we escape? The Jews have a proverb, that two dry sticks
   may set a green one on fire. The meaning is, the godly man may fall in
   the common calamity: wheat is plucked up with the tares. God saith in
   Deut. vii. 22, that they should not destroy all the Canaanites, lest
   the beasts of the field should increase upon them.' The safety of his
   people are involved in the safety of their sinning and persecuting
   enemies. A hedge of thorns may serve for a fence to a garden of roses,
   and all the relief we have is, The Lord can make a distinction: 2 Peter
   ii. 9, The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and
   to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.'

   3. Why doth God take this time? (1.) For his own glory. His justice is
   more discovered when men have filled up their measure: Ps. li. 4, That
   thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou
   judgest.' It justifieth God's proceedings, and maketh us the more
   inexcusable. So also his power; it is God's time to send help and
   remedy, when all things are gone to utter confusion; when things are at
   the most desperate pass, Ps. cxxiv. 3-5, in our low estate, then is God
   seen. (2.) Hereby God's work upon Mount Zion is promoted. His people
   are humbled when their adversaries are chief, and rage against them:
   Ps. cxxiii. 4, Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of
   those that are at ease, and with contempt of the proud.' When things
   come to extremity their prayers are quickened: Ps. cxxx. 1, Oat of the
   depths I cried unto thee, O Lord.' They are fitted to prize mercy, Ps.
   cii. 13, 14. They that thought it no great matter to have a standing
   temple, delight in the dust of a ruinous heap. Then shepherds' tents
   look lovely, we set a higher rate on despised ordinances. In short,
   they are waiting and praying, and humbling their souls before God.

   Fourth consideration. When a flood of wickedness is thus broken out, we
   may mind God of the deliverance of his people. But what needs that?
   Doth not God know his seasons, and will not he exactly observe them? In
   the answer I shall show you why and how.

   1. Why? (1.) Because God loveth to be awakened by the prayers of his
   people; and when he hath a mind to work, he sets the spirit of prayer
   a-work: Jer. xxix. 11, 12, I know the thoughts that I think towards
   you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an
   expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto
   me, and I will hearken unto you.' So thus and thus will I do: Ezek.
   xxxvi. 37, Yet for this will I be inquired of by the house of Israel.'
   We are to give a lift by our prayers; it is a time of finding, Ps.
   xxxii. 6. (2.) He hath put an office upon us. God acts the part of a
   judge, we as solicitors and remembrancers: Isa. lxii. 6,7, I have set
   watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their
   peace night nor day. Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not
   silence, and give him no rest till he make Jerusalem a praise in the
   earth.' We are to put God in mind, so that we but do our duty.

   2. How? The principle and manner must be right.

   [1.] The principle; be sure it be not the impatiency of the flesh, or
   love to our own ease, or a mere tediousness and irksomeness of the
   cross. Be sure it be not passion and a principle of revenge, but a
   desire of promoting his honour and vindicating his glory. David doth
   not say how troublesome they were to himself, but, They make void thy
   law; as if he had said, Lord, if my own interest were only concerned, I
   would not open my mouth, nor ever call upon thee to revenge my private
   quarrels; but it is my zeal for thy honour and ordinances; not that I
   have received injury, but thy worship is corrupted. Work, else what
   will become of thy name and poor people? Offences done against God
   should grieve us more than our own injuries, and we should rather
   regard the general interest of religion than any personal offence done
   to us. There is often a carnal spirit breathing in our prayers, and our
   zeal is fleshly; the people of God beat it back: Ps. cxv. 1, Not unto
   us, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory;' and Ps. lxxiv. 10, O
   Lord, how long shall the adversary reproach, and the enemy blaspheme
   thy name for ever?' The godly can endure their own troubles better than
   they can bear the open dishonouring and blaspheming of God. This is the
   true sense, but because the heart is deceitful--(1.) Be sure your cause
   be good, your adversaries evil, that ye may say, Ps. lxxiv. 22, Arise,
   O Lord, plead thine own cause.' It is not for your sins, but your
   righteousness; the hatred is not against the body. Indeed they pretend
   some little faults. It is as if a leper should hate a man because he
   hath some pimples in his face. Some thing they would lay to their
   charge. (2.) That we use all means with God and men to reclaim them,
   praying for them: Mat. vi. 44, Pray for them that despitefully use
   you.' Mourning for their sins: Jer. xxiii. 19, My soul shall weep in
   secret for your pride.' Heaping coals of fire upon their heads by all
   acts of kindness, condescending to them as far as possibly we can, Rom.
   xii, 18. These arts become his kingdom, that is not to be planted by
   force, but consent, them that would have the zeal of God, not of a
   party. (3.) Be sure your principle be zeal for God's glory, not a
   desire to establish your own interest, and to see revenge on a party
   that differeth from you: Luke ix. 54, 55, You know not what spirit you
   are of.' Religious affections overset us, and fleshly zeal puts on a
   holy spiritual guise and mask, and we think it is for the honour of
   Christ. (4.) Not against particular persons, but the opposite faction
   to godliness. In general, destroy all the enemies of Christ, &c.

   [2.] For the manner how. We must seek to God, first, with submission,
   not prescribing to God, nor making a snare to ourselves. We, that have
   short and revengeful spirits, cannot judge aright of God's patience,
   which is infinite, out of fleshliness and affection to our own ease.
   And so our times, John vii. 6. Your time is always ready; if none of
   these be, yet we are limited creatures, and great is the wisdom of God
   and his power admirable; it doth not belong to us to guide the affairs
   of the world, Ps. lxxviii. 41. We must not prescribe opportunity to
   him, fixing times. Besides that, it argueth a spirit too much addicted
   to, and eyeing of, temporal happiness. It doth much unsettle us and
   harden others. The devil maketh advantage of our disappointment.
   Therefore not only when it seemeth seasonable to us we may seek to him
   for deliverance. Once more, there are other things concur besides the
   enemies' ripeness for judgment,--preparing his people's hearts, fitting
   those instruments for his work; therefore all is left to God's will,
   and let him take his time.

   Use of all is--

   1. To teach us how to behave ourselves in these times with patience,
   and yet with hope and waiting. It is the time of Jacob's trouble, but
   there will be a time of deliverance, Jer. xxx. 7. With patience; God
   will have a time to chastise his people. We must bear it patiently; it
   will make crosses sit easy; they may be greater and longer than our
   joys: Ps. xc. 15, Make us glad, according to the days wherein thou hast
   afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.'

   2. With hope let us expect it. Certainly it will not exceed the time
   limited by God. That time is not long: Isa. xiii. 22, Her time is near
   to come, and her days shall not be prolonged;' Ezek. xii. 21-28, And
   the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, what is that
   proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are
   prolonged, and every vision faileth? Tell them therefore, Thus saith
   the Lord, I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use
   it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and
   the effect of every vision. For there shall be no more any vain vision
   nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. For I am the
   Lord: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass;
   it shall be no more prolonged.' Faith should see it as present,
   approaching; and then let us wait his leisure, minding God in prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXXXIX.

   Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine god.--
   Ver. 127.

   IN the words we have--

   1. A note of inference, therefore.

   2. The duty inferred, I love thy commandments.

   3. The degree of that love, above gold; amplified by the repetition,
   with some advantage, in the expression, yea, above fine gold.

   Gold, by a synecdoche, is put for all worldly things, the comforts and
   profits of this life, as in many other places; as Ps. xix. 10, More to
   be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also
   than honey and the honeycomb.' The two bastard goods with which the
   world is enchanted are pleasure and profit. Old people are all for
   profit, young people are all for pleasure. Now both these, truly so
   called, are found in the word of God. So in Prov. viii. 10, 11, Receive
   my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
   For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that are to be
   desired are not to be compared to it.' So Prov. viii. 19, My fruit is
   better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenues than choice
   silver.' So Prov. iii. 14, For the merchandise thereof is better than
   gold; and the gain thereof than fine gold.' So Prov. xvi. 16, How much
   better is it to get wisdom than gold? and to get understanding rather
   to be chosen than silver?' This comparison is used so often for two
   reasons:--

   1. Because it is more prized in the world. All things that have a
   goodness in them have a certain bait suitable to the several appetites
   of men; but in most men's opinions gold seemeth chiefly to be desired,
   partly for its beauty, but chiefly for its use, it being the great
   instrument of commerce that doth all things in the world. The
   corruption of man's heart addeth a greater price to it, and therefore
   is the thirst of it so unsatisfied, Now the word, and that wisdom and
   godliness which it teacheth, is far above gold and fine gold,

   2. Because it is the usual temptation to draw off men from the love and
   study and obedience of the word. Babylon's abominations are offered to
   the world in a golden cup: Rev. xvii. 4, And the woman was arrayed in
   purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and
   pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and
   filthiness of her fornication.' Preferments are the baits of that black
   religion. True Christianity consists in sound graces;
   pseudo-Christianity in pomp and state and worldly advantages; and the
   apostle telleth us, 1 Tim. vi. 10, That the love of money is the root
   of all evil; which while some have coveted after, they have erred from
   the faith.' Therefore doth the Spirit of God so often compare spiritual
   things to gold; and here David preferreth his love to the word before
   the worldling's love to gold, yea, fine gold. For mark, it is not, More
   than I love gold, but, More than any man. Some have an ardent desire of
   it, however it be mortified in God's children.

   First, For the note of inference, together with the duty inferred,
   Therefore I love thy commandments.' Some refer it to God's taking his
   time to work, as the judge of the world in punishing the wicked for
   their disobedience and contempt of his law; as if he had said, Lord,
   though thou dost connive, and hold thy hands for a time, yet I know
   thou wilt undertake the defence of the righteous, and not let the
   wickedness of the wicked go unpunished; it will cost them dear in the
   issue, therefore I love thy commandments,' &c. This sense I cannot
   exclude. If I thought fit to prosecute it, it would yield this
   doctrine, that a little faith would help us to continue our affection
   to the word of God, notwithstanding the wickedness of those that oppose
   it. For in truth here this wickedness doth soon come to an end: Ps.
   lxxiii. 18, Surely thou didst set them in slippery places, thou
   castedst them down into destruction.' But I rather refer it to the
   latter clause, They have made void thy law; therefore I love thy
   commandments.'

   Doct. The more others despise the ways and laws of God, the more should
   a gracious heart love and esteem them.

   So doth David profess that his love to God's ways was so far from
   ceasing that he found it increased rather.

   Reason 1. Because the ways of God are still the same they were before.
   If there be any difference, they only need to be more owned by us with
   greater zeal and cheerfulness because they are despised and forsaken by
   others. God is the same still, heaven the same, and the scriptures the
   same, whether we have company to walk with us in heaven's way, yea or
   no; and therefore, why should not a Christian be the same he was
   before? Their contempt and hatred of God's ways doth not make void our
   obligation to God and the bonds of our duty to him. If God had only
   required us to be good when we may be so with safety and ease, and
   would dispense with us at other times when religion is in disgrace,
   then indeed a Christian might change his course, and run with the cry
   as others do. But God had required in the worst times we should take
   God's part, and stand for him in the worst places, and keep his name
   even there where Satan's throne is, Rev. ii. 13, and be saints, though
   in Nero's household, Phil. iv. 22, under the nose of a raging
   persecutor. And as God is the same, so his ways are the same. Their
   contempt and hatred of holiness doth not hinder the loveliness of it to
   a spiritual eye. There is a beauty in God's despised ways: Heb. xi. 25,
   Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to
   enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.' He saw more excellency in the
   tents of Jacob than in the courts of Pharaoh. When the outward glory of
   his ways is darkened, and they are put under reproach and trouble, yet
   their inward beauty still remaineth, and may be seen by a spiritual,
   though not by a carnal eye; by those that will not judge according to
   appearance, but judge righteous judgment, John vii. 24. The external
   glory, which is the favour of the world, out ward prosperity and
   countenance, is foreign and accidental; but this is essential, and ever
   remaineth. And as holiness is the same, so the scriptures are the same;
   they do not speak one thing to-day and an other to-morrow, and leave us
   at a latitude to put ourselves into all changes and postures: 2 Cor. i.
   19, For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us,
   was not yea and nay,' saith the apostle, but in him was yea.' The
   scripture doth not allow saying and unsaying, and building again the
   things which we have destroyed: Gal. ii. 18, For if I build again the
   things which I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.' Truth is
   the same in all ages; not like an almanack, to be changed every year,
   or calculated peculiarly for one meridian. Nor is it always the same.
   Indeed, in some lesser things, that serve only for the conveniency of
   religion, we may upon weighty grounds change practice, and do that
   which is good where best may not be had. So heaven is the same still;
   it not only serveth us as an antidote in prosperity, but as a cordial
   in adversity, and is at all times to be regarded. Well, then, since
   God, and holiness, and scripture, and heaven are always the same, why
   should not we? If there be change, it should be in the degree of our
   love, that it be greater than it was before, to repair God in point of
   honour, and to testify against the defection of others, that we are not
   of their stamp, who do not see by their eyes, nor walk by their
   principles, nor allow of their warpings.

   Reason 2. God expects more from gracious hearts, because of their
   relation to him and acquaintance with him; and therefore, if others
   despise the laws of God, they should esteem them the more: John vi. 66,
   67, From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more
   with him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will you also go away?' It
   goeth nearer to Christ's heart that those should forsake him that are
   trained up in his bosom, that the devil should steal away souls under
   his own arm. Whatever defection others make, yet that those who have
   tasted of his mercy, drunk of his cup, feasted with his loaves, have
   had experience of his grace, will ye also? He stood not upon the
   multitude's going so much as his disciples'. Therefore they should
   rouse up themselves in evil times.

   Reason 3. The good and the bad do exercise and keep one another in
   breath and vigour. When there are but two factions that stand in
   opposition to one another, one apparently for God, the other apparently
   for Satan, it addeth zeal and indignation to both sides, and they
   mutually inflame one another, and are as Jeremiah's two baskets of
   figs, the good figs very good, and the evil figs very evil, Jer. xxiv.
   3. When others are so very bad, it should not quench zeal but inflame
   it; we should be not only good, but very good. Corruption, the more it
   is opposed, the more it stormeth and groweth outrageous, as a river
   swelleth by opposing dams and banks against it, they rage upon
   restraints now the floods break loose. So on the other side, should
   grace be more earnestly and zealously exercised the more it is opposed,
   as the casting on of water sets the lime on fire. To be sure, their
   malice will put us to a great deal of trouble, and trouble is a time to
   exercise grace. To be much in prayer, and faith, and patience, and
   mortifying corruptions, and watchfulness, and wary walking, that we may
   neither take infection ourselves, nor give occasion to others to
   stumble at the ways of God: Col. iv. 3, Walk in wisdom towards them
   that are without, redeeming the time.' When they lived among
   unconverted heathens they should carry it wisely towards them, that
   they might not be occasions of stumbling or hardening. So by proportion
   those who profess the ways of God should carry it wisely towards such
   as they live amongst, who declare their non-regeneration by a profane
   life, and live like heathens, that they give no occasion to such
   adversaries of truth and holiness to speak reproachfully; but they
   should observe the apostle's rules, 1 Peter ii. 12, 15. Christians
   should be good in bad times, that the times may not be worse for them,
   nor they the worse for the times. They should labour to live down the
   vices and errors of the age wherein they live, and labour to save
   themselves from this untoward generation, and should cut off occasions
   from them that watch for occasions against them, and, like fishes, keep
   their freshness in salt water. Ham will scoff to surprise a Noah in a
   fault; when their foot slippeth, they will magnify themselves against
   them. Experience of the madness and fury whereby others are carried on
   in the ways of sin should more confirm others in the ways of God that
   are opposed by them. Surely such men would not hate what is evil, and
   so earnestly persecute what is good. Non nisi grave bonum a Nerone
   damnari. A good man would not choose by their liking and loathing. If
   any argument may be taken from them, it is to like the things the
   better because they slight them, and to love them because they
   persecute them. For it is to be presumed they will hate what is good,
   and love what is evil; and though no certain argument can be concluded
   thence, yet their love is but an ill token; for Christ telleth us, The
   world will love its own,' John xv. 19. All things love what is suitable
   to themselves.

   Reason 4. Unless our love be increased when men oppose and despise the
   laws of God, it will not hold out against so great a trial. Sin is very
   infectious at all times, and when it is common it is less odious. But
   the force of example is great; we think we may do as others do: a cold
   neutral love, or loose and general owning of the ways of Christ, will
   not bear us out. I confess this is a very great temptation that
   prevaileth with many: Mat. xxiv. 12, When iniquity aboundeth, the love
   of many will wax cold.' Loose professors are soon shaken off, and dead
   fish swim with the stream. Yea, some of notable eminency in the church
   may miscarry, but yet always they are such as had their worldly
   affections unbroken and unmortified: 1 Tim. vi. 11, 12, Some through
   the love of money, have erred from the faith; but thou, O man of God,
   follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, and patience, love,
   meekness, fight the good fight of faith.' There needs great diligence
   and fervency to increase in solid grace, or else we shall not dare to
   own God and his ways; yea, I confess the soundest may be sorely shaken,
   and therefore need warning and confirmation. The godly have seeds of
   the same evils which draw away others. Evil example is very forcible,
   especially when it is general. In a time of public infection it is hard
   to preserve health. And then usually sin is disguised and carried on
   under plausible pretexts, and evil men blinded by their interests may
   easily warp, Ingeniosa res est esse Christianum, as Hierom of an Arian
   time. It is a matter of skill to discern God's interest, and by
   consequence our duty. The prophet complaineth, I am a man of polluted
   lips, and I dwell among a people of polluted lips,' Isa. vi. 5. We
   contract some contagion and taint from those among whom we live; grow
   careless of sabbaths by general profanation; take more liberty for the
   flesh when others wallow in all filthiness, and are given up to all
   manner of vanity. Therefore, as the force of example is great, the
   force of zeal should be greater, that we may stand for God, though we
   stand alone. As Elijah did: 1 Kings xix. 14, And he said, I have been
   very jealous for the Lord God of hosts; because the children of Israel
   have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy
   prophets by the sword; and I, even I only am left, and they seek my
   life to take it away.' We must keep up our savour in a corrupt age, as
   Noah did: Gen. vi. 9, Noah was a just man, and perfect in his
   generation, and Noah walked with God.' Lot lived more upright in Sodom,
   where he was besieged with temptations that made him constantly to
   stand upon his watch, than he did in the cave, when he neglected and
   grew secure. As fire burns hottest in the coldest weather, so a
   Christian's zeal, by a holy antiperistasis, should flame most in a
   corrupted, debauched age.

   Reason 5. Because it is very acceptable to God, and a note of sincerity
   to hold out against trials, yea, to increase in zeal when others desert
   him. Many will flock to Christ, and resort to him in his prosperity.
   When religion is befriended, painted butterflies and gaudy carnalists
   will prove summer friends to him; but when winter frosts and blustering
   storms come, they are gone; like those that go to sea, not for a voyage
   to ride out all weathers, but for recreation: Christ maketh little of
   their friendship. But now, Luke xxii. 28, 29, Ye are they that have
   continued with me in my temptations; and I appoint unto you a kingdom,
   as my Father hath appointed unto me.' When David was crowned king in
   Hebron, then those that followed him in the wilderness were not
   forgotten, but preferred by him. To serve God in a crowd, and with
   store of company, is not so praise worthy. Every one will be in the
   fashion, and there is a revolution of fashions in religion; but to own
   him in a time of defection, when others look strange upon him; then to
   keep our zeal and strictness i& commendable. Temporibus malis ausus
   esse bonus.

   Use 1. Information. That the general corrupt custom and example of
   those with whom we live is not a sufficient excuse for our sinning. It
   is so in the minds of many, but it is not so indeed. It is indeed a
   temptation, and a strong incitement; but temptations to the contrary do
   not excuse from duty. This will appear to you if you consider--

   1. The state of a Christian; he is not of this world: John xv. 19, If
   ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are
   not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
   world hateth you.' He was separated for God's use in baptism, and must
   make good his baptismal vow, live as one that is separated from the
   world and their course of life, that he may act for God: Ps. iv. 3,
   Know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself;'
   therefore it is no excuse for him to say, I do but as others do; he is
   to reckon his hours by the sun, not the town-clock; to take God's
   direction, not the voice of the multitude, as one of their stamp, and
   at liberty to comply with their fashions.

   2. The course of God's dispensations, which is to exercise and try his
   children before he crowneth them. None go to heaven without their
   trials.

   3. The duty of God's children, intimated in the cautions and
   descriptions and injunctions of the word: Exod. xxiii. 2, Not to follow
   a multitude to do evil; nor to walk according to the course of this
   world;' Eph. ii. 2, The lust of men,' 1 Peter iv. 2; nor the
   corruptions of the times: Rom. xii. 2, Be not conformed to this world,'
   &c. Many such hints everywhere, that show it a crime, &c.

   4. The opposition of the wicked should make us more courageous; for
   then it is put to a plain contest, who shall have the better, Christ or
   Satan? Therefore we should discover that he that is in us is stronger
   than he that is in the world, 1 John iv. 4. Wicked men have their end
   and purposes if they can overcome the disciples of Christ, and
   discourage them from owning their profession. We are to be more than
   conquerors, Rom. viii. 37.

   Use 2. We ought to be so far from being involved in the conspiracy of
   others against God, that our zeal should increase by others declining,
   and we should love religion when it is commonly despised. That is our
   commendation, esse bonum facile est, &c. Till we are in termino, we
   have our difficulties, till we are gathered to angels, e'xo be'lous,
   out of gunshot. Our business is not to give way to evils, but to resist
   them with the greater courage. Indeed it is hard for a man to keep
   himself free from the infection of the times he lives in. We all
   complain of the badness of the times; but let us not make them the
   worse for us. If we would be good in bad times, we need--

   1. Much holiness and heavenly-mindedness, that we may be burning and
   shining lights, conducting men to Christ, as the star that shone at
   Christ's birth: Phil. ii. 15, That ye be blameless and harmless, the
   sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse
   generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.' Noah, by
   preparing an ark, condemned the world, Heb. xi. 7. This is the way to
   appear for God in the lustre of real grace, when we are taken off from
   other means.

   2. Much faith or foresight of things to come: Heb. xi. 7, By faith
   Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear,
   prepared an ark.' To see the ruin of the wicked when prosperous, this
   kept David in his integrity: Ps. lxxiii. 17, I went into the sanctuary,
   then understood I their end.' When he was once able to look through
   their honours and greatness and riches by the light of the sanctuary,
   he overcame the temptation which did so greatly press and shake him. So
   here in the text, It is time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have
   made void thy law; therefore I love thy commandments above gold, yea,
   above fine gold.' There is a worm in the root; they are under God's
   curse: Job v. 3, I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I
   cursed his habitation;' which predicteth their ruin, though little
   appearance of their fall.

   3. There needs much zeal and strong love to God. When profaneness is in
   fashion, let us give check to it in our place, either as magistrates by
   appearing against evil-doers, as Nehemiah contended for God: Neh. xiii.
   11, Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God
   forsaken?' and ver. 17, Then I contended with the nobles of Judah. and
   said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the
   sabbath-day?' Not like Gallio, that cared for none of these things. As
   ministers, more active against sin: Isa. lviii. 1, Cry aloud, spare
   not; lift up thy voice as a trumpet, and show my people their
   transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.' As governors of
   families, careful of ourselves and families: Josh. xxiv. 15, As for me
   and my house, we will serve the Lord.' As private Christians, give out
   more of the lustre of grace: Mat. v. 16, Let your light so shine before
   men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which
   is in heaven;' 1 Peter ii. 12, Having your conversation honest among
   the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they
   may by your good works which they shall behold, glorify God in the day
   of visitation.' Not only stop the mouth of iniquity, but bring about
   the conversion of wicked men. Thus should every one of us in our place
   glorify God, and strive to make the times better: Rom. xii. 11, Not
   slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.' That is a
   good time; serving the Lord can make a change, if we would ply this
   means. Thus did David serve his generation: Acts xiii. 36, For David,
   after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell
   asleep.' When you die, people will be able to say, We miss such a man;
   he was zealous against sabbath-breakers, and drunkards, and swearers;
   one that owned the people of God, a friend to religion.

   4. Caution, that we be not carried away with the deluge of corruption:
   Gal. ii. 13, The other Jews dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that
   Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.' Example hath
   a kind of compulsion in it; the best men can hardly stand out against
   it. It secretly insinuateth itself, weakeneth our love to God, abateth
   our care; therefore we cannot be enough watchful, that we be not
   secretly tainted, as a man in the sun tans unawares. As in times of
   common contagion, every man is careful of his diet and company, so
   should we watch to keep our garments clean and unspotted of the world.

   5. Sincerity, not dissembling; as Josh. xiv. 8, I wholly followed the
   Lord my God;' not loving the ways of God on foreign respects, but their
   own internal reasons; otherwise a man soon miscarrieth, for these
   motives will be changed, and those very inducements that moved him to
   take up religion will move him also to cast it off. None but the solid
   Christian will hold out, whilst light chaff is carried about with every
   wind, and the carnal-minded cuts the coat of his profession to the
   fashion of the times. A false heart cannot long hold out: Prov. x. 9,
   He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely; but he that perverteth his
   ways shall be known;' that is, to his shame; cannot long dissemble his
   nature.

   6. A fixed resolution, that we may not be easy, and merely do as others
   do. It is the resolved man that encounters temptations, and maketh them
   fly back, as arrows shot against a brazen wall. Though others fall, I
   will serve the Lord, whatever others do: Josh. xxiv. 15, And if it seem
   evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom you will
   serve, whether the gods which your fathers served, that were on the
   other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye
   dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.' If he meet
   with reproaches and scorns: 2 Sam. vi. 22, And I will yet be more vile
   than thus, and will be base in mine own sight.' If enticed by evil
   company: Ps. cxix. 115, Depart from me, ye evil doers, for I will keep
   the commandments of my God.' If threatened: Acts iv. 19, But Peter and
   John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of
   God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.' Thus they stood
   by a self-denying resolution; whereas the unresolved man, James i. 8,
   is unstable in all his ways;' is turned like a weathercock with every
   wind, fitteth his religion to every interest. God biddeth us thus
   unmovably to fix our selves: Jer. xv. 19, Thus saith the Lord, Let them
   return unto thee, but return not thou to them.' A man that would live
   quietly must either bring himself to the times, or expect the times
   should come over to him. A resolved man stayeth God's leisure, doth not
   serve his conscience to fit the times, but waiteth till God fit the
   times to his conscience.

   7. A true sight of the worth of spiritual things above carnal. This in
   the text, More than gold, yea, fine gold.' Till a man cometh to this,
   his conscience will not be guided by his religion, but his interest,
   and give up all for the world's sake: 2 Tim. iv. 10, Demas hath
   forsaken us, and loved the present world;' Phil. iii. 19, 20, Whose end
   is destruction, whose god is their belly, whose glory is in their
   shame, who mind earthly things. For our conversation is in heaven, from
   whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.' Loath to
   suffer, turn themselves into all shapes. God doth not command them, but
   themselves.

   Secondly, The degree of his affection; whence this doctrine--

   Doct. We ought not only to love the word, but to love it above all
   worldly things whatsoever.

   1. Let me explain the grounds of our love to the word.

   2. Speak of the degree of it.

   1. Let me explain the grounds of our love to the word. We love the
   word, as it is the charter of our hopes and the rule of our duty. We
   have both respects in this psalm. As the charter of our hopes, ver.
   111, Thy testimonies have I taken for an heritage for ever, for they
   are the rejoicing of my heart.' As a rule of our duty, ver. 14, I have
   rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches;' and
   ver. 140, Thy word is very pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.' So
   that--

   [1.] To love and esteem the word as the charter of our hopes is to love
   and esteem spiritual privileges, such as the favour of God, pardon of
   sins, peace of conscience, taking away the stony heart, and eternal
   life. To have a deep sense and value for such things is the fruit of
   faith. It is true that some loose velleities and general inclinations
   men, as men, have to their own happiness; but being but weakly
   persuaded of these things, they are but slightly affected with them and
   the promises that reveal them. Men that have no faith, but altogether
   live by sense, know nothing more excellent than gold or riches, which
   do all in the world. If God would let them alone here, to have their
   portion in Paris, they would part with their share in paradise, such
   dunghill-souls have they. Let God keep spiritual things for whom he
   will, so they may live at ease in the world, they never mind communion
   with God, or enjoyment of God; but gracious hearts love the word, as
   offering and revealing these things.

   [2.] To love the word as a rule of duty is in effect to love holiness,
   loving things as suitable to our necessities, and as suitable to our
   dispositions. I love thy commandments,' saith David in the text, as
   urging and directing us to our duty. This is also proper to gracious
   souls, to them all outward things are but toys and trifles for our
   senses to play withal. The least grain of grace seemeth better to them
   than a mountain of gold. They have a spiritual discerning, and love
   things according to the nature and worth of them. The things themselves
   are not to be compared together, so should not our affections to them.

   2. The degree of it, more than all riches, Therefore I love thy
   commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold.' Take riches as riches,
   in that notion as the word implies happiness, abundance, contentment.
   The word of God containeth the true riches, both in the promises and
   precepts of it.

   [1.] In the promises, to us are given, ta` ti'mia kai` me'gista
   epange'lmata, exceeding great and precious promises,' 2 Peter i. 4.
   There the great controversy is decided about the true happiness and
   salvation, God or the creature; there you have the unsearchable riches
   of Christ;' Eph. ii. 7, That in the ages to come he might show the
   exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness towards us, through
   Christ Jesus.' The riches of the glory of the saints' inheritance: Eph.
   i. 18, That ye may know what is the hope of your calling, and what the
   riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.' These are things
   that make us truly rich: Rev. iii. 18, I counsel thee to buy of me gold
   tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich.' He is not rich that
   floweth in wealth and plenty, but he that hath Christ, and an interest
   in his benefits. They are possessors of all things, though they have
   nothing: 2 Cor. vi. 10, As having nothing, yet possessing all things.'
   A little serves the turn; they have the good things purchased by
   Christ, happiness enough if he can make them happy.

   [2.] So in the precepts, they are means to work grace, the least dram
   of which is more worth than all things in the world. He is rich enough
   that is rich in faith: James ii. 5, Hearken, my beloved brethren; hath
   not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of a
   kingdom,' in paradise, which he hath promised to them that love him?'
   It is more precious than the trial of gold: 1 Peter i. 7, That the
   trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that
   perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and
   honour and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ.' The smallest
   measure of saving faith, or love to God, or fear of God, or repentance,
   is of more worth than what is most precious. The word of God does more
   enrich a man; and true benefit is to be preferred before counterfeit.

   Reasons for the degree of our love.

   1. From the worth of the word, the reward, and those benefits that are
   gotten by studying and obeying it; they exceed worldly things, as will
   appear, because the one suits with our bodily necessities, the other
   with our spiritual. Our bodily necessities are supplied by gold, our
   spiritual necessities by grace. Gold will not comfort a distressed
   conscience, no more than nosegay flowers a condemned man. Quod si
   dolentem, &c., saith Horace: Prov. xi. 4, Riches avail not in the day
   of wrath.' The one renders us acceptable to men, the other to God. The
   world knoweth all things after the flesh; they measure men by splendour
   and pomp of living; but it is grace that God approveth most, and
   accepteth most. Grace is of great price in the sight of God: 1 Peter
   iii. 4, But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
   corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in
   the sight of God of great price.' The one much embaseth our nature; it
   is something more vile than us, therefore that affection is debased.
   But grace always ennobleth our nature, and is something above us. A
   greater affection is due to things above us than to things beneath us.
   The one is useful to us in via, the other in patria. Surely that which
   is of eternal use and comfort to us is better than that which is only
   of a temporal use. In our passage to heaven, we need gold and silver
   for the supply of our bodily necessities, and the support of outward
   life, so far as we have to do in the world; but with respect to the
   world to come, gold doth nothing; there we leave our wealth behind us,
   but our works follow us. Our treasure we quit when we die, but our
   grace we carry with us. Once more; the price by which things may be
   purchased showeth the worth of them. Wisdom is of so great a price,
   that all the treasures of the world cannot purchase it: Job xxviii.
   15-20, It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
   for the price thereof; it cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with
   the precious onyx, or the sapphire; the gold and the crystal cannot
   equal it, and the exchange of it shall not he for jewels of fine gold:
   no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls; for the price of wisdom
   is above rubies: the topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither
   shall it be valued with pure gold.' What cannot money do in the world?
   yet it can do nothing as to the procuring of grace. The apostle telleth
   us this is a dear-bought blessing: 1 Peter i. 18, 19, Forasmuch as ye
   know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and
   gold, from your vain conversations, received by tradition from your
   fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish, and without spot.' To despise the favour of God, the image of
   God, is to despise the price that was paid for these things, to have
   lessening thoughts of the blood of Christ. To conclude; those we count
   lesser [15] gifts which we bestow upon friends than upon enemies. A man
   would give meat and drink unto enemies when they hunger and thirst; but
   other gifts of a greater value to friends and relations. God giveth his
   Christ, his Spirit, his grace to his friends, children, servants; but
   corn and wine and oil, these he giveth promiscuously, yea, to his
   enemies a larger portion. Surely, then, these are better than gold. Our
   love should be according to the value of things.

   2. Because if the word be not preferred before earthly things, it is
   not received with any profit and good effect. Christ saith, He that
   loveth anything more than me, is not worthy of me,' Mat. x. 37. He that
   studieth to please his friends rather than Christ, or to gratify his
   interest more than his conscience, within a very little while his
   Christianity will be worth nothing. It is not a simple love, but a
   greater love that we show to worldly things: Mat. xiii. 44-46, Again,
   the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field, the which
   when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth
   all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven
   is like unto a merchant-man seeking goodly pearls, who, when he had
   found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and
   bought it.' We must part with all, rather than miss of his grace, all
   that is pleasant and profitable, renounce all other things. When Christ
   propounds his terms, he would have us surrender all to his will and
   pleasure: Luke ix. 23, If any man will come after me, let him deny
   himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.' He must not avoid
   the cross by sinful shifts: we are ready to do so every day. These are
   the necessary terms, else we are not fit for the master's use: 2 Tim.
   ii. 21, If any man therefore purge himself from these, lie shall be a
   vessel unto honour, sanctified and meet for the master's use, and
   prepared unto every good work.'

   3. Unless we love the word above riches, we cannot possess riches
   without a snare; then it will be not only hard, but impossible, to
   enter into the kingdom of heaven: Mark x. 23-27, And Jesus looked round
   about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have
   riches enter into the kingdom of God! And the disciples were astonished
   at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children,
   how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom
   of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
   than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. And they were
   astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be
   saved? And Jesus looking about him, said, With men it is impossible,
   but not with God; for with God all things are possible.' Riches will so
   prevail over us, and wholly sway us, if they be our chief good and
   portion, and we have not a higher end to check our love to them. If a
   man would have all things cleave [16] to him, he must be sure the world
   doth not sit nearest his heart; for if they do, such a man, as he is
   unfit for heaven, so he is unfit for the world too. If they be your
   good things, Luke xvi. 25, Son, remember thou in thy lifetime
   receivedst thy good things;' you will get and keep and use them
   otherwise than the word doth allow.

   4. From the fruit of grace; where it is planted in the heart and
   prevaileth, the desire of wealth is mortified, worldly lust denied:
   Titus ii. 12, Teaching us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts;' and
   desires of grace enlarged and increased: 1 Peter ii. 2, As new-born
   babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.'
   And when it prevaileth further, and to a higher degree, they come to
   Moses* frame, to count the worst of Christ better than the best of the
   world: Heb. xi. 26, Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches
   than the treasures in Egypt.' Not only the graces of Christ, or the
   benefits of Christ, but the reproaches of Christ. So much is the world
   lessened, and the desires of grace increased. The heaviest part of
   Christ's cross is sweeter than the worldly plenty, where sin
   accompanieth it.

   Use 1. To press us to get this esteem and love of the word above all
   earthly things: by what names soever they are called, whether gold or
   fine gold. Consider--

   1. The word of God containeth the true riches, in comparison of which
   all other things are but a shadow.

   2. Except God's word be clearly esteemed above earthly things, it is
   highly contemned. You would think yourselves highly slighted if once it
   should be put to the question whether you or an ass or a swine be
   better. The case is as clear whether it be better to have a child's toy
   or land of inheritance. You think it a disparagement of their reason.
   It is so to compare spiritual things with carnal: Prov. xvi. 16, How
   much better is it to get wisdom than gold, and to get understanding
   rather to be chosen than silver!'

   3. The word of God observed and obeyed bringeth all earthly things
   along with it; gold and fine gold, so far as they are necessary and
   good for us: Mat. vi. 63, But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
   righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you;' and 1
   Tim. iv. 8, Godliness is profitable unto all things; having a promise
   of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.' It hath all
   kind of promises, it doth not come empty-handed; it bringeth in a
   portion in this life, and blessing in these outward things.

   4. How constant the word is, and in one tenor: 2 Cor. i. 20, All the
   promises of God in him are Yea, and in him Amen; unto the glory of God
   by us.' But worldly things are uncertain: 2 Sam. xix. 43, And the men
   of Judah answered the men of Israel, and said, We have ten parts in the
   king, and we have also more right in David than ye.' Compare this with
   the next words, 2 Sam. xx. 1, Sheba blew a trumpet, and said, We have
   no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse.' The
   people cry Hosanna to Christ, and presently after, Crucify him. Peter
   once made a glorious confession of Christ, and afterwards a gross
   denial. Paul was received as an angel by the Galatians: Gal. iv. 14, My
   temptation which was in my flesh, ye despised not, nor rejected; but
   received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus;' but afterwards
   accounted an enemy; ver. 16, Am I therefore become your enemy, because
   I tell you the truth?' Nebuchadnezzar flourishing in a palace of gold,
   Dan. iv. 30, Is not this great Babylon that I have built, for the house
   of my kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the glory of my
   majesty?' But a voice came to him from heaven, ver. 31, O king
   Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken, The kingdom is departed from
   thee.'

   Use 2. Have we such an esteem and affection to the word of God? Then--

   1. We will do that which in other cases a greater love would incline us
   to do; otherwise it is but a compliment; we will diligently exercise
   ourselves in the word of God. Labour is the fruit of love: Remembering
   your labour of love,' 1 Thes. i. 3. He that doth not take more pains in
   the pursuit of heavenly things than of carnal, doth not love the one
   above the other; for love is industrious: John vi. 27, Labour not for
   the meat that perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto
   everlasting life.' What a deal of pains do men take for a little pelf,
   to heap up treasure, and fill their houses with the good things of this
   world, and spend all their time and wit, their care and strength, on
   outward things! The stream runneth stronger for the world when there is
   no proportionable care taken for the benefits which the word offereth.
   God maketh offer of grace and glory. Men are as those that travel by
   water, and see buildings ashore, and praise them as they pass by, but
   never enter into them, never look after them more. If you are ready and
   earnest in the pursuit 0f the one, careless and cold in the other; you
   think no time enough for the one, but grudge all time for the other: it
   is a sign the one hath a greater share in our hearts than the other. We
   are to seek worldly things in some measure, because God hath appointed
   every one some work to do; but when there is such a manifest
   disproportion between our seeking the one and the other, it showeth
   which way our souls bend; if a nice difference, that hardly
   distinguished it, give suspicion, more especially when such a manifest
   disproportion.

   2. We will part with the one for the other's sake, if carnal things can
   withdraw us from the pursuit of heavenly things: Heb. xii. 16. As Esau,
   who for one morsel of bread sold his birthright;' and heavenly things
   cannot make us to part with carnal things. Many make void the law to
   seek riches and wealth: 2 Tim. iv. 10, Demas hath forsaken us, having
   loved this present world;' break God's commands for a small hire, and
   do so constantly, frequently, easily; it is a sign they do but
   compliment, and speak from their judgments, not from their hearts, when
   they say they love God better than the world, or fine gold, the
   chiefest excellency of it. Would a man dispense with his obedience to
   the word, and be thus affected? What is deliberately, habitually
   preferred, that hath the greater love. We can neglect our duty to God,
   trample upon God, Christ, heaven, scripture, conscience, duty, in the
   way to make speed after worldly things.

   3. Wherein do we place the happiness of us and ours? To carnal men
   nothing is so dear as their present prosperity. Do you value yourselves
   to be more happy when you have a little grace and sense of God's love
   than if you had all the world: Ps. iv. 6, 7, There be many that say,
   Who will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy
   countenance upon us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in
   the time that their corn and their wine increased.' And for your
   children, do you rejoice to see them great or good? Many are delighted
   to see their children thrive in the world, do well in the world, but
   careless whether they have grace, yea or no. If you take the world
   still as a great part of your felicity, it is a sign you have low
   thoughts and respects for the word of God.

SERMON CXL.

   Therefore, I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right;
   and I hate every false way.--Ver. 128.

   IN this verse a child of God is set forth by two marks:--

   1. His approbation and esteem of the law of God in all the parts and
   points thereof, I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be
   right.

   2. His hatred of all sin as contrary thereunto, and I hate every false
   way: the one as the effect of the other.

   First, In the first branch, take notice of--(1.) The illative particle,
   therefore. (2.) His respect to the word, I esteem thy precepts to be
   right. In the Septuagint it is pro`s pa'sas ta`s entola's sou
   katorthou'men, I was directed or set right unto all thy laws. But it
   maketh no difference in effect from our translation; for they that
   esteem the law will embrace and practise it. (3.) The extent and
   universality of this respect: there is a double universal particle, all
   thy precepts concerning all things; the general drift of them, and
   every particular matter and circumstance that falleth under this law,
   it is all right; I approve of whatsoever thou commandest, without any
   reservation and exception; all, even all, have I approved.

   1. Something might be observed from the illative particle: it is
   inferred from their making void of God's law.

   Doct. In times of defection, when others slight, contemn, and for sake
   the ways of God, we should approve and esteem them the more.

   The reasons are--

   1. To make amends for the contempt of others: 2 Peter iv. 14, On their
   parts he is evil spoken of; on your part glorified.' Let not God want
   his glory; if he be dishonoured by their sins, he should be the more
   honoured by your obedience. It concerneth us to look that God be no
   loser. As the sea, what it loseth in one place, it gaineth in another;
   or as a river, what it loseth in breadth, and is pent within narrow
   channels, it gets in depth; so you should give him the more respect the
   more it is denied him by others; the sincere professors of the name of
   God should be the more earnest.

   2. To show that we do not choose the ways of God upon foreign reasons,
   as public countenance and consent. Many men owe their religion not to
   grace, but to the favour of the times; it is in fashion; they may
   profess it at a cheap rate, because none contradict it. Indeed it
   showeth they are extremely bad, that are bad when they may be good
   without any loss to themselves; but it doth not show they are good,
   that are only good in good times. Dead fish swim with the stream. They
   do not build upon the rock, but set up a shed leaning to another man's
   house, which costs them nothing; carried with a multitude, are not able
   to go alone in a good way; if they be religious, it is for others'
   sakes. Then is integrity discovered when persons dare be good in bad
   times, as Noah was said to be an upright man, because he was perfect in
   his generation: Gen. vi. 9, When all flesh had corrupted their way.'
   And so it is said, Job vii. 9, The righteous shall hold on his way, and
   he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger;' that is,
   when there are discouragements and oppressions, as a resolved traveller
   holdeth on his journey, whether he meeteth with fair way or foul, good
   weather or bad.

   3. There is an antiperistasis in grace as well as nature. Every
   quality, when it is pent up, is the stronger. Stars shine brightest in
   the darkest night. Fountain-water is hottest in winter, when the heat
   is pent up. In bad times good men are best; wicked men's badness
   exerciseth and increaseth good men's graces. The more odious sin
   appeareth in them, the more grace is strengthened in the saints; their
   looseness maketh you strict; their vanity and carelessness maketh you
   serious; their intemperance maketh you sober; their worldliness and
   sensuality maketh you spiritual; as they are instances of the cursed
   vigour of nature, you are instances of the sacred power of grace, Phil.
   ii. 15, shining as lights in the world in the midst of a crooked and
   perverse generation;' to be eminently holy among a company of profane,
   godless, atheistical spirits, showing forth the lovely beauty of
   holiness.

   4. To show the difference between the people of God and others; and
   this is a fruit of God's eternal choice. God hath made a difference in
   the purposes of his grace, and they discover the difference in the
   course of their conversations: John xvii. 25, The world hath not known
   thee, but these have known thee, that thou hast sent me, and hast
   chosen them out of the world.' The opposite ignorance and obstinacy of
   the world showeth their acknowledgment of Christ was of more value and
   acceptation. When the world neither knew nor believed on him, but
   rather opposed and persecuted him, they owned Christ, and so walked in
   a countermotion to the times.

   5. To defeat the enemies' purpose, which is to hinder the success of
   the gospel, and destroy all affection and respect to the word and ways
   of God, and that the service of God should fall to the ground; as we
   hold a staff the faster, when one would wrest it out of our hands:
   Titus i. 9, Holding fast the faithful word.' The pastor of the church
   should be good at holding and drawing, as the word signifieth; so
   people's zeal should be the more kindled in the worst times. God hath a
   number that do fear him; Christ is never a king without subjects, nor a
   head without a church; he ruleth in the midst of his enemies, Ps. cx.
   1; therefore he hath some to rule over. Where Satan's throne is, there
   he hath some to confess his name. Elijah thought himself left alone,
   yet then God had reserved to himself seven thousand that had not bowed
   the knee to Baal.

   Use. It is very seasonable for us in these times to mind this;
   therefore--

   1. That we may increase in practical godliness. Now wickedness is
   broken loose and the law is made void, this should not damp our zeal,
   but quicken it. You should walk with God, as Noah and David did, in the
   worst of times: yea, the badness of the age you live in should make you
   the more wise, more circumspect, more humble, more heavenly; as fire
   burneth hottest in the coldest weather. Study to serve God in thy
   generation. A man that is not good in the age he liveth in, would never
   be good. A lily will thrive in a wilderness, and a brier is but a brier
   though it grow in paradise. Their fury in sin should warn you of your
   duty to God. Shall a lust prevail more with them to damn themselves,
   than the love of God and the hope of salvation with you? shall they act
   more regularly to their ends? What zeal and earnestness have they in
   their course, and how open and bold-faced in sin! We read that Pambo
   wept when he saw a woman dressing herself curiously to please her
   wanton lover, to see her take so much pains to undo her soul, and that
   he had not been so careful to please God, and provide things honest in
   the sight of God, as she to please herself.

   2. They are set up as warnings to us, as a beacon on fire warneth all
   the country to be in arms. You see what it is to give way to the
   beginnings of sin, not to be under the blessed conduct of God's Spirit.
   Some are notoriously wicked, judicially given up to be more visibly
   under the dominion of sin, that others may take warning how they come
   into that woful slavery: Phil. iii. 19, 20, For many walk, of whom I
   have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are
   enemies to the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is
   their belly, who glory in their shame, who mind earthly things; but our
   conversation is in heaven.'

   3. It should make us fly to God for grace when the whole world lieth in
   wickedness: Isa. vi. 5, I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a
   people of unclean lips.' It is hard to converse with defiled ones and
   not be defiled, to keep ourselves unspotted from the world: Ps. cvi.
   35, They were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.' The
   contagion of sin overspreads presently, as a man by touching that which
   was unclean became unclean. We easily catch a sickness from others, but
   we cannot convey our health to them.

   Use 2. Teacheth us to keep up our profession even in lesser truths: I
   esteem all thy precepts concerning all things.' When men would wrangle
   us out of our duty, we are to be pistoi` en oli'go, faithful in a
   little. Great matters depend on little things. We are tried, en te
   parouse alethei'a, 2 Peter i. 12, by the present truths,' whether we
   will own the ways of God: Rev. xiv. 13, Blessed are the dead which die
   in the Lord,' or for the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit,
   that they may rest from their labour.' Why from henceforth?' Why!
   before the sufferings of Christians were from heathens and professed
   enemies, and they were acknowledged blessed as dying for the Lord. But
   now, when antichrist and false Christians came up, they did pretend to
   be for Christ, and friends to him, and this might be a discouragement
   to them in their suffering; but saith the Holy Ghost, From henceforth
   blessed are they which die for the Lord,' when pseudo-Christians begin
   to come up, and persecute the heavenly Christians. It is as blessed a
   thing to suffer under pseudo-Christians and antichristianism as it was
   to suffer under heathens and pagans, professed enemies to Christianity.
   I speak of this, because the orthodoxy of the world is usually an age
   too short. In things publicly received, it is easy to be right Christ
   is forced to gain upon the world by inches. A man may acknowledge the
   Trinity, the satisfaction of Christ, among Papists; but it is exceeding
   praiseworthy to own Christ when others scorn and reject him. The world
   will allow us to esteem the ways of God in some lesser things, that are
   out of controversy and are not maligned; but this esteem must have that
   extent as becometh the people of God, to have a hearty esteem of all
   the precepts of God, and all things contained therein.

   Secondly, Let me come to his respect to the ways of God; and from his
   respect, with the extent, I shall observe this doctrine:--

   Doct. That it becometh the people of God to have a practical
   heart-engaging esteem of all the precepts of God, and all things
   contained therein.

   Let me show you what is this esteem the children of God have for his
   precepts.

   1. There is something implied and presupposed.

   2. Wherein it doth formally consist.

   3. The qualifications of a right and saving esteem of the ways of God.

   1. There is something implied and presupposed before we can come to
   esteem the precepts of God. As--

   [1.] Knowledge and a right discerning. This is necessary, partly that a
   man may be able to make a distinction between good and evil, otherwise
   he cannot esteem the good and eschew the evil, for without knowledge
   the heart is not good,' Prov. xix. 2. If we should stumble blindfold
   upon a good way, we are not the more accepted with God, nor advantaged
   in our spiritual course. The clearer our light, the warmer our love.
   The more clear and; certain apprehension we have of spiritual things,
   our faith is more steadfast, love more vehement, joy more sound, hope
   more constant, patience more sublime, our pursuit of true happiness
   more earnest. And partly because a man cannot esteem that which he
   knoweth not. The will being caeca potentia, blind in itself, followeth
   the direction and guidance of the understanding. The ignorance of the
   nature and necessity of holiness is the cause of the neglect of it:
   John iv. 10, If thou knewest the gift,' &c. Many condemn good for evil,
   take evil for good, boldly rush into sin, reject the ways of God for
   want of knowledge. But then it is spiritual illumination that begets
   estimation, 1 Cor. ii. 14. The truth and worth of spiritual things must
   be seen by a spiritual eye. When the Spirit enlighteneth a man, he
   beginneth to see that which he knew not before, to see things in
   another manner.

   [2.] Advertency, or application of the mind to the object or things
   esteemed; that he seriously consider the matter, and what it is best to
   do; it is not a sudden, rash undertaking. The scripture speaketh of
   applying our hearts to wisdom,' Ps. xc. 12; and Prov. ii. 2, Apply thy
   heart to understanding;' Prov. xxiii. 12, Apply thine heart to
   instruction, and thine ears to the ways of knowledge.' Make it your
   business seriously to consider things that differ. But then--

   2. Wherein lies this esteem, or wherein doth it formally consist?
   Esteem is an approbation of the will, or a hearty love. There is the
   approbation of the understanding, and the approbation of the will. The
   approbation of the understanding is a naked sense, or an acknowledgment
   of what is good: Rom. ii. 18, Thou knowest his will, and approvest the
   things that are more excellent.' There is an excellency in holiness
   that winneth esteem, even there where it is not embraced. All convinced
   men see the evil of sin, and are half of the mind to quit it; they
   approve the law which they violate by a bare naked approbation. But
   then there is the approbation of the heart or will; there is love and
   liking in it, and this is called esteem. This is seen in two
   things--consent and choice: consent, to take this law for our rule; and
   choice, whatever temptation we have to the contrary. Men choose what
   they highly esteem. In short, it is such an approbation as doth engage
   affection, such an affection as doth engage practice. Esteem is the
   fruit of love.

   [1.] There is a consenting to the law that it is good, Rom. vii. 16.
   There is a difference between assent and consent. A man may assent to
   the truth and goodness of the law that doth not consent to the goodness
   of it; as the devils assent to the truth of God's being, that do not
   consent to take him for their portion, James ii. 19. Therefore, besides
   the advertency of the understanding, there is the consent or
   approbation of the will. Paul speaketh good words of the law: Rom. vii.
   12, The law is holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good,'
   no'mos and entole`--the law in general, and that commandment which
   wrought such tragical effects in his heart, that rifled all his
   confidence and hopes, and left him wounded with the sense of sin; it is
   holy in teaching duty to God, just in prescribing duties to our
   neighbour, good in respect to ourselves; a law becoming God to give and
   us to receive, suitable and profitable. Thus should we approve and like
   the law of God.

   [2.] Choice, whatever temptation we have to the contrary; a preferring
   or prevailing love, a heart-engaging approbation, that doth
   prevailingly determine the soul to the ways of God. Non differunt re
   consensus et electio, saith Aquinas, sed ratione tantum, ut consensus
   dicatur, secundum quod placet ad agendum; electio autem secundum quod
   praefertur his quae non placent--consent to the law and choice of the
   law are all one and the same act, distinguished by divers respects and
   considerations. It is called consent to the law, as it approveth of
   what the law adviseth; and it is called choice or esteem, as it
   preferreth the law and our obedience to it above other things. It is
   actualis praelatio unius rei prae altera, a preferring one thing above
   another.

   Thirdly, I come to the properties or qualifications of this esteem.

   1. It is not a simple, but comparative approbation. There is a twofold
   act of judgment--the first act and the second. The first act is that
   whereby I distinguish good from evil, and pronounce the one to be
   embraced, the other eschewed; approve the one, disapprove the other.
   But there is a comparative approbation; that is, that which the
   understanding judgeth best, all circumstances considered, better than
   all other things that can be represented. This is the proper notion of
   esteem: Heb. xi. 26, Esteeming the reproach of Christ,' &c. We approve
   of many things simply, and in the first act, which we disallow in the
   second, when we consider them as invested with some difficulty and
   unpleasantness, or overpoised with contrary desires, when we compare
   them with the pleasure and profit which we must forsake; it consents to
   walk in the ways of God, as Orpah will follow Naomi into the land of
   Israel, if she may do it without inconveniency, Ruth i. 14. The young
   man esteemed salvation worthy to be inquired after, Mark x. 20, but is
   loath to forego his earthly possessions to purchase that inheritance.
   When the judgment that we make of the thing simply considered in
   itself, and of the thing as considered with all circumstances, as it
   cometh in comparison with other things that must be endured or
   foregone.

   2. There is a judgment of general estimation, and a judgment of
   particular application. By the one I bind duty upon others; by the
   other I engage my own heart, as the expression is, Jer. xxx. 21, Who is
   he that engageth his heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord;' to
   engage his heart to take God for his portion. An instance we have in
   David: Ps. lxxiii. 28, But it is good for me to draw near to God.' I
   may approve many things as good, for which I have no appetite my self.
   Many will yield that it is good to serve God that cannot work, or do
   not engage their heart to it. Many approve piety in the general; it is
   good to be religious, to live a holy life; but when it cometh to our
   own case, when we are to abstain from this or that sin, we draw back.
   Many know what things are more excellent, but do not practise or
   embrace them; commend those that are religious, but do not imitate
   them. Acts v. 13, the people highly esteemed the Christians, but yet
   would not become Christians themselves: Ps. xlviii. 14, This God is our
   God for ever and ever.' Many a wicked man judgeth it best for him to
   continue his evil courses, and thinketh religion is good for other men,
   but it is not good for him; but God's children are of another mind.

   3. It is not a slight and superficial esteem, but such as is deep and
   solid: Mat. xiii. 20, He heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth
   it.' It is a blessed thing to hear of the pardon of sin, Heb. vi. 5, to
   taste of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come;
   as they that cheapen wines taste, though they do not go through with
   the bargain; some inclination of heart, half a mind to be thoroughly
   godly and religious: John v. 35, They rejoiced in his light for a
   season.' They were much taken with John for a while, and the novelty
   and excellency of his doctrine. But when is this esteem deep and solid?
   It may be known--(1.) By the root of it; (2.) The ground and formal
   object of it; (3.) The manner or way how we come by it.

   [1.] The root of it When the root of this esteem is a vital principle
   of grace: Mat. xiii. 21, He hath not root in himself.' The word is not
   ingrafted, James i. 21. The people had a good inclination: All that the
   Lord hath spoken, we will do,' Deut. v. 29. But, Oh! that there were
   such an heart in them, that they would fear me and keep all my
   commandments always,' &c. They had a mind to do well; but where faith,
   fear, and love are not planted, there may be some stirrings of
   conscience, but not a full purpose of heart. There is the approbation
   of an awakened and enlightened conscience, and the approbation of a
   renewed heart. A convinced man approveth, and a converted man
   approveth, but in a different manner. The one is but a flash, like fire
   in straw, the other hath a durable affection.

   [2.] When the ground and formal object of it is not a temporal,
   natural, or carnal motive, but the moral goodness of the law; because
   it is the pure and holy word and will of God, who is the lawgiver,
   whose authority is absolute. There may be carnal motives to incline us
   to esteem the word, as the novelty of John's doctrine: John v. 35, They
   rejoiced in his light for a season;' delight to hear a plausible and
   rational discourse, as Ezekiel's hearers, Ezek. xxxiii. 32, And lo thou
   art to them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice,
   that can play well upon an instrument; for they hear thy words, but do
   them not.' Or carnal motives, as they Gen. xxxiv. 22, 23, Herein will
   the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among
   us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. Shall not their cattle and
   their substance be ours? Only let us consent unto them,' &c. And so
   temporal interests. Religion hath a portion for which it is courted.
   The consent of many to the law is the same which Mahometans have to the
   Alkoran; education in it, ancestors embracing of it, the countenance of
   the law, the custom of the country, &c.

   [3.] The manner or way how we come by it, by much prayer and serious
   deliberation. Some by chance are surprised and affected with a good
   motion, suddenly good, but habitually bad; they will in all haste
   become religious, but, alas! this estimation or approbation of God's
   ways is entertained but for a time, but afterwards vanisheth and cometh
   to nothing. There must be a clear distinct knowledge of the excellency
   of God's ways: otherwise in a fit, or in a good mood, we choose that
   which is good; but the interest in evil not being renounced in heart,
   it causeth an easy retreat into the former sinful course.

   4. It must be such an esteem as hath a lively and effectual influence
   upon our hearts and ways. There is a liking that only produceth a
   velleity and wish, and doth not engage the soul to prosecute the things
   willed, or forsake the things nilled; but there is such an effectual
   liking and esteem as will produce a constant, habitual willingness,
   that will have the authority of a principle, and hath a powerful
   command over the whole soul, to set it a-working to do the will of God,
   and will admit of no contradiction by contrary desires, but maketh us
   act with life, power, and earnestness. Cold and inconstant wishes
   produce no fruit in the heart. The general course of most men's lives
   is as if they had no liking to the law of God. It may be they may
   dislike and sacrifice some of their weaker lusts and smaller interests,
   which they can well spare, but corruption doth ordinarily bear sway in
   their hearts and lives. In the text it is, I esteem all thy precepts,
   -and hate every false way.' It is true, a man that approveth the law is
   not wholly freed from sin. There are sins of ordinary infirmity, that
   cleave to us while we are in the world, yea, taint our best actions:
   Isa. lxiv. 6, But we are all as an unclean thing, all our
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags.' And sometimes, though there be a
   principle of grace, a child of God may be overborne by the violence of
   a temptation, carried into presumptuous sins, which may make strange
   havoc in the soul. David prayeth, Ps. xix. 14, that God would keep him
   from presumptuous sins; but for the most part the children of God are
   influenced by their consent and esteem of the law of God. And the
   renewed part for the generality hath the upper hand, and prevaileth,
   and the flesh is weakened; as the house of David grew stronger and
   stronger, 2 Sam. iii. 1, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

   5. It must be a universal, not partial esteem: I esteem all thy
   precepts concerning all things to be right;' Ps. cxix. 6, When I have
   respect to all thy commandments;' Luke i. 6, Zachary and Elizabeth
   walked in all the commandments and ordinances of God blameless;' Acts
   iii. 22, Him shall you hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto
   you;' and he shall fulfil all my will. It is not enough to be right in
   commands in general, or the lump, but in this and that particular; not
   in some, but in all. We pretend to give up ourselves to the will of God
   in the general, but particulars we stick at. Men are convinced that
   holiness is necessary, that they must have some religion; therefore
   when they take up duty in the lump, and abstract notion or naked
   consent, it doth not exasperate opposite propensions: Ye cannot serve
   the Lord,' &c., saith Joshua, Josh. xxiv. 18, 19; but when they come to
   particulars, and see what it is to wait upon a holy and jealous God,
   they tire and grow weary: so that there must be a consent and purpose
   to obey, not some, but all and every one, without exception; not
   partial, like that of Herod to John: Mark vi. 20, He did many things.'
   The worst man in the world loveth some good and hateth some evil, but
   he doth not esteem all God's commandments in every point. Nay, the
   great enemy of our salvation, Satan, can be content to let us yield to
   God in many things, if he would be contented with half our duty: one
   sin reserved keepeth afoot his interest in our hearts, as a bird tied
   by the leg is fast enough. The devil will suffer men to do many things,
   but if he hath them fast by one lust, be it an inclination to
   sensuality, or love to the world, he is contented. The world likes many
   things in religion; they are good and profitable for men; but sticketh
   at others. To live godly in Christ Jesus will draw on persecution, 2
   Tim. iii. 12. The flesh will dispense with us to do many things, for
   the more cleanly conveyance of others, if it can but get us to spare
   the bosom lust which the soul delighteth in. Every man, as he is
   enslaved by his own customs, opposeth one this law, another that; the
   proud man doth not approve of that law that doth forbid his pride, nor
   the sensual man that which toucheth his intemperance and unbridled
   appetite, nor the worldly man his covetousness, cannot endure that part
   of the law that would abridge him of his gain. Nothing more common than
   to cast off what liketh us not in the law of God, and to wish there
   were no precept given in that kind. But our consent must be to all in
   general, and to this and that in particular. Many could be content with
   God's law, so far as it doth not cross their carnal interest, or hinder
   their corrupt desires; but we must esteem all the laws of God; they are
   all holy, just, and good, not one excepted; all conduce to perfect our
   nature, and make us happy creatures; they all conduce to the benefit of
   human nature; they are all enjoined by the authority of the same God:
   God spake all these words.' They are linked as rings in a chain; one
   preserveth another; they are all necessary for our eternal happiness;
   not one given in vain. So much thou continuest thine own misery, and
   art defective in the way that leadeth to true happiness, as thou art
   willing to indulge in any one sin. They are all written in the hearts
   of God's children, Heb. viii. 10, all suited to the new nature; and he
   hath given grace to keep all, 1 Peter i. 15, perfection of parts, not
   of degrees. The new creature is not maimed in the birth. A child hath
   not the bulk and strength of a man. Want of perfection of parts cannot
   be supplied by any after growth. Nay, all are necessary to our
   communion with God: Ps. lxvi. 18, If I regard iniquity in my heart, the
   Lord will not hear me;' Mat. v. 19, Whosoever shall break one of these
   least commandments,' &c. If we dispense with ourselves in the least
   things, we are not fit for communion with God, 2 Cor. vii. 1; having
   such promises of God's being in us, and dwelling in us, and maintaining
   communion with us, then let us cleanse our ourselves from all
   filthiness both of flesh and spirit;' Col. i. 10, that ye might walk
   worthy of the Lord to all pleasing,' eis pasa`n are'skeian. If you do
   not consent to keep all, you can keep none; for the same reasons that
   move us to break one, will move us to break all. Herod, that heard John
   gladly, when his lust moved him to it, put him to death. To be sure it
   must be total.

   Reasons of this esteem.

   1. From the excellency of God's law. The law of God deserves it: Deut.
   iv. 6, Keep, therefore, and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
   understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these
   statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding
   people.' We should esteem the law, because it doth not infringe our
   natures, but makes them perfect, puts an excellency upon us. But of
   this in other verses.

   2. This esteem and approbation is the ground of practice. When we are
   convinced of the ways of God, and the excellency that is in them, the
   heart consenteth and embraceth them, and then followeth a ready
   practice; we will observe what we do approve. Whereas, on the contrary,
   if we have no esteem for the ways of God, we shall take no care to walk
   in them, but could wish such laws expunged; for still these two go
   together--hearty embracing and diligent practice. The will is the great
   master-wheel. Now esteem implieth the bent of the will or heart; it
   implieth consent and election; it is the act of the will, is the act of
   the man: Prov. xxiii. 26, My son, give me thy heart.' The man is never
   overcome till then. You may kill him, but you cannot conquer him till
   he give his consent. There may be a kind of force and violence offered
   to the other faculties; the understanding may be overcome with light,
   which though it would, it cannot keep out. The conscience may be
   awakened, though men endeavour to lull it asleep; but the will is free,
   and is not conquered, but by its own consent and choice. The Lord will
   not force himself upon any; he dealeth with the reasonable creatures in
   a covenant way, to which our consent is required. It only bindeth as a
   law, till we consent to yield to it as a covenant: 2 Chron. xxx. 8,
   Yield yourselves to the Lord.' Now bring your hearts once to consent,
   and heartily approve of the ways of God, and the rest will succeed
   without difficulty. It will not be hard to give a law to the tongue, to
   restrain the hand, govern the body; our affections will more easily
   come to hand if we have a will to the things of God. The smallest
   matters against our wills are grievous to us. It was no great matter
   for Haman to lead Mordecai's horse, but it was an unwelcome and
   unpleasant service; he had no mind to it. It is no great matter for men
   to do the things that God requireth; but they have no mind to it, and
   therefore are off and on: James i. 8, The double-minded man is unstable
   in all his ways.'

   3. This is some comfort to a child of God, that though he faileth in
   some part of his duty, yet he esteemeth all; for where this approbation
   is, you may use the apostle's plea,; Not I, but sin that dwelleth in
   me;' Rom. vii. 15, For that which I do, I allow not; for what I would,
   that I do not; but what I hate, that do I.' The allowance or
   approbation of the will is there spoken of; he speaketh of willing and
   nilling, loving, delighting, and hating. Though you cannot do that good
   you would, in that purity and perfection which love requireth, and the
   renewed heart intendeth, yet your hearts are upon your work: The evil
   which I hate, I do.' The new nature hates and dislikes what the carnal
   part prompts to.

   Use. Learn to approve the law of God in all things, as right and good
   for you.

   1. Do not dispense with yourselves in anything. In two cases we are apt
   to do so:--(1.) In small things; it is nothing, we think; it is but a
   little one. Nothing that cometh from God should be light and
   contemptible; though the matter be never so small, if God hath inter
   posed, it should be regarded by us. There may be great obstinacy in
   small sins, as a slender line may be very crooked, or as in some cases
   the dye is more than the cloth. Will you break with God in a small
   matter? If some great matter were required, would you not have done it?
   as 2 Kings v. 13; dare you offend this holy God for trifles? (2.) Do
   not dispense with yourselves, though never so contrary to your humour
   and interest. This is to set up a toleration in your own hearts, or a
   court of faculties without God's leave: God be merciful to me, if I bow
   in the house of Rimmon.'

   2. Do not so much as wish there were no such law. It is a contra
   diction of the law when you could wish there were no law to put a
   restraint upon your beloved lusts and darling corruptions. Carnal men
   wish there were no God, not as a creator and preserver, but as a
   lawgiver. There may be much enmity in such a thought. Every thought
   must be brought into subjection to Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. x. 5. Not a
   disallowing thought of God's government but doth much prejudice your
   hearts. God hath given such laws, that if all things were left to our
   own option and choice, nothing better could be devised to preserve the
   liberty and perfection of the human nature. It is an ill note to count
   the command grievous. Holiness is so amiable in itself, that men are
   not frightened unto God's laws, but choose them.

   3. Bring thy heart to approve the law by mortifying that distemper that
   ariseth against it, be it pride, self-conceit, sensuality,
   covetousness. Appetite that is lost to wholesome food is restored by
   purging the stomach; there is a preparation of mind required to
   receiving of moral things. So in divine things: 1 Cor. ii. 14, But the
   natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit.' We are
   prepossessed, intus existens prohibet exitum. Therefore bring your
   heart to approve God's law removendo prohibens, by mortifying those
   corruptions that rise against it.

   4. When you see no other reason to yield to God's law, let his will and
   sovereign authority be reason enough to you. This is reason enough for
   God to use to his creatures: I am the Lord,' Lev. xviii. 4, 5, Ye shall
   do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the
   Lord your God. Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments;
   which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.' This is the
   will of God. We owe God blind obedience. This should silence all
   perverse reasonings against God, both as to his laws and providence.
   His will is supreme, and our will must be yielded up to his.

   Secondly, We come to the other branch, and I hate every false way.
   Where we have--the act, hate; the object, false way; the extent, every,
   whatsoever is contrary to the purity of God's word.

   Doct. That it is a good note of a renewed and obedient heart to hate
   every false way.

   This will appear from--

   1. The sorts and kinds of hatred.

   2. The causes.

   3. The effects, or the comparison of hatred with anger.

   1. From the sorts and kinds of hatred, which are reckoned up to be
   two--(1.) Odium abominationis; (2.) Odium inimicitiae.

   [1.] Odium abominationis, a hatred of flight and aversation, called by
   some odium offensionis, the hatred of offence. It is defined by Aquinas
   to be dissonantia quaedam appetitus, ad id quod apprehenditur ut
   repugnans, &c. It is a repugnancy of the appetite to what is
   apprehended, as contrary and prejudicial to it. Such there is in the
   will of the regenerate, for they apprehend sin as repugnant and
   contrary to their renewed will; to the unregenerate it is agreeable and
   suitable, as draff to the appetite of a swine, or grass and hay to a
   bullock or horse. Now this hatred is a good sign, that cannot be found
   in another that is not born of God. The mortification of sin standeth
   principally in the hatred of it. Sin dieth when it dieth in the
   affections; when we look upon it as an offence to us, destructive to
   our happiness, and as it is truly grieved for and hated by us. The
   unregenerate may hate sin, materially considered; that is, the thing
   which is a sin; but they cannot hate it formally considered, as sin
   under the notion of a sin; for then they would hate all sin, a quatenus
   ad omne valet consequentia. As, for instance, thus: A covetous man
   hateth prodigal and riotous courses, not as they are sinful and
   contrary to God's law, but as contrary to his humour and covetous will.

   [2.] Odium inimicitiae, or the hatred of enmity. This enmity is nothing
   else but a willing of evil or mischief to the thing or person hated,
   and that out of mere displacency, dislike, or distaste of the person
   hated. This is a sure note; the regenerate hate their sins, in that
   they would have them arraigned, crucified, mortified; they would fain
   see the heart-blood of sin let out; therefore they oppose, watch
   against, and resist it as their mortal, deadly enemy. When a man
   pursues sin, would have the life of it, this enmity cannot be quiet; it
   is an active enmity, diligent in praying, mourning, watching, striving,
   using all holy means to get it out of our hearts, wishing, groaning,
   waiting, complaining, that we may get rid of it: Rom. vii. 24, O
   wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death?' They follow their work hard.

   2. The causes of this hatred. There are three causes of it:--

   [1.] Spiritual knowledge and illumination, that is one cause of hatred:
   Ps. cxix. 104, Through thy precepts I get understanding; therefore I
   hate every false way.' When the heart is thick-set, and well fraughted
   with divine knowledge, a man cannot sin freely. Those that are
   exercised in the word of God find some consideration or other to
   quicken to the hatred of sin. The word is a proper instrument to
   destroy sin: Ps. cxix. 11, Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I
   might not sin against thee;' Eph. vi. 13. Our affections follow our
   apprehensions. We come to the heart by the mind: Jer. xxxi. 19, After I
   was instructed, I smote upon my thigh.' In the word of God are the most
   proper reasons and arguments to kill sin.

   [2.] The love of God: Ps. xcvii. 10, Ye that love the Lord hate evil.'
   He doth not say forbear it, but hate it. The cause of hatred is the
   love of that good unto which the thing or person hated is contrary and
   repugnant. Love to the chiefest good is accompanied with hatred of sin,
   which is the chiefest evil. The one is as natural to grace as the
   other. The new nature hath its flight and aversation, as well as its
   choice and prosecution, to things that are hurtful to it, as well as
   good and profitable.

   [3.] A filial fear of God: Prov. viii. 13, The fear of the Lord is to
   hate evil: pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth
   do I hate.' Certainly this is to fear God, to hate what God hateth, and
   as God hateth, and because God hateth. Now God hateth all sin, pride,
   and arrogancy; that is, sins of thought, which put us upon vain and
   foolish musings. And then the sins of the tongue are expressed by
   froward mouth.' Nothing so natural to us as filthy and evil speaking.
   And then the sins of practice, the evil way.' They that fear God will
   hate all these sins. These graces are strangers to unrenewed hearts. It
   argueth a divine nature when we hate when, what, and as, and because
   God hates it. Eadem velle et nolle est summa amicitia.

   3. A third argument is from the comparison of hatred with anger.
   Unregenerate men may be angry with sin, because anger is consistent
   with love. One may be angry with his wife, children, friends, whom yet
   he tenderly affects.

   [1.] Anger is a sudden and short, hatred a lasting and durable passion.
   Anger is furor brevis, curable by time; hatred incurable by the
   greatest tract of time. The unregenerate are displeased with their sins
   for a spurt, but the regenerate constantly disaffected towards them.
   There is, 1 John iii. 9, spe'rma, there is a constant principle of
   resistance in the renewed heart. Passion is a casual dislike, but the
   new nature a rooted enmity, a habitual aversation to what is evil.

   [2.] Anger is only against singulars, but hatred is eis ta` ge'ne, to
   the whole kind. Thus we hate every wolf and every serpent, every thief
   and every calumniator. So is this universal; it respects sin as sin,
   and hateth all sin, though never so profitable and pleasant. Not upon
   foreign and accidental reasons; as, Esther iii. 16, Hainan thought
   scorn to lay hands upon Mordecai alone, but sought the destruction of
   all the Jews. The same reasons that incline us to hate one sin, incline
   us to hate all sin. The violation of God's law is a contempt of God's
   authority, a breach of spiritual friendship; one grieveth the Spirit of
   God as well as the other. Every sin is hateful to God, so it is to
   those that are made partakers of the divine nature.

   [3.] Anger may be pacified or appeased with the sufferings of the thing
   or person with which we are angry, but hatred is implacable; nothing
   can content and satisfy it but the ruin or not being of the thing and
   party hated. David was angry with Absalom, but loath to have him
   destroyed, only corrected and reduced: when he sent out forces against
   him, Deal gently with the young man.' So many deal with their sins; we
   reason, pray, strive, complain; but it is but an angry fit; we are
   displeased with them at present, but could easily be reconciled. They
   seek not after the death, but the restraint and imprisonment of their
   corruptions and lusts, that they may not disgrace or otherwise
   prejudice them. Nothing contents the regenerate but the killing and
   mortification of them; they would have them dealt with as Samuel by
   Agag, hewn in pieces; therefore they study revenge upon their sins:
   Gal. v. 24, Crucifying the flesh, with the affections and lusts.'

   [4.] From the state of the regenerate. They have sin in them, but yet
   they hate it. Their will and consent to sin is always abated, and made
   remiss by a contrary principle, the grace that is in their wills: Gal.
   v. 17, The spirit lusteth against the flesh.' Sin cannot reign in them
   with a full and uncontrolled dominion: Rom. vi. 14, Sin shall not have
   dominion over you.'

   Use 1. How few are there that are God's children, for how few are there
   that hate sin! Some love it, Job xx. 12, 13, and the love of sin is the
   life of it; and what is it they hate? They hate the word that discovers
   sin, John iii. 20; they hate God's messengers that do cry aloud against
   sin, and do rub their sores; as Ahab said of Micaiah, He doth never
   prophesy good of me.' They hate the magistrate that would reform them,
   they hate God's image in his saints; they cannot endure the lustre of
   holiness that shineth forth in them.

   Use 2. Do we indeed hate sin? We had need look after this.

   1. Because this is the true principle of resistance against sin. Till a
   man hateth it, the soul is not thoroughly resolved against it, as a man
   is never thoroughly gained to God till he love holiness for holiness'
   sake: his affections may be bribed with other considerations, but then
   he is rooted in godliness. So a man is not resolved against sin till he
   hate it for its own sake. He may be frightened out of sin for a fit,
   put out of humour with it, but his heart is in again with his old
   lusts, till there be a detestation of sin; but when once he cometh to
   hate it, per suasions cannot easily move him, nor example draw him, nor
   difficulties compel him, to that which is evil; nor allurements, that
   have a great force upon us: Straightway he followed her.' But they cast
   away sin with indignation: Hosea xiv. 8, What have I any more to do
   with idols?'

   2. This is a true distinctive note between good and bad. Men may
   forbear sin that do not hate it: they forbear it by constraint, for
   fear of punishment, shame, worldly ends; but regard it in their hearts,
   Ps. lxvi. 18. The dog hath a mind to the pail, but feareth the cudgel.
   But God judgeth not as man judgeth.

SERMON CXLI.

   Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.--Ver.
   129.

   IN the words are two parts--

   1. The dignity and excellency of God's testimonies, thy testimonies are
   wonderful.

   2. The effect it had upon David's heart, therefore doth my soul keep
   them.

   Accordingly two points--

   Doct. 1. That the testimonies of God, when duly considered and
   thoroughly understood, will indeed be found to be wonderful.

   Doct. 2. The wonderful excellency of the word should beget in our
   hearts a readiness and diligent care to keep it.

   Doct. 1. The testimonies of God are wonderful.

   1. The word in itself is wonderful, as containing truths of a sublime
   nature.

   2. It is wonderful in its effects; as it produceth effects rare and
   strange.

   1. In itself considered, it is sometimes called the mystery of faith,
   as it containeth principles of faith; and sometimes a mystery of
   godliness, as it containeth rules of practice. As it is a mystery of
   faith, there are many strange doctrines in it above the reach of man's
   capacity, which we could neither invent nor understand, unless we be
   enlightened by the Spirit of God; as that three to be one, and one to
   be three; God to be made man, &c.; these are riddles to a carnal mind.
   And as it is a rule of faith, still it offereth matter of wonder, the
   duty of man being represented with such exactness and
   comprehensiveness: Ps. cxix. 96, I have seen an end of all perfection:
   but thy commandment is exceeding broad.'

   2. What rare effects it produceth: where it is entertained it maketh a
   Christian become a wonder to himself and others.

   [1.] A wonder to himself: 1 Peter ii. 9, He hath called us out of
   darkness into his marvellous light.' There is no man converted by the
   word of God but hath cause to wonder at his own estate, at the
   condescension of God in plucking him as a brand out of the burning, or
   that woful condition wherein he was before, when others are left to
   perish: John xiv. 22, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself
   to us, and not unto the world?' And then that we are brought into the
   possession of such excellent privileges as we enjoy in our new estate,
   peace that passeth all understanding, Phil. iv. 7, joy unspeakable and
   full of glory, 1 Peter i. 8; privileges greater than can be imagined or
   expressed. So are their hearts ravished in the sense of their
   reconciliation with God and communion with him. So also in giving them
   such an undoubted right to an everlasting blessed estate in the
   heavens: 1 Cor. ii. 9, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
   entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
   them that love him.' He hath promised them a happiness which they can
   never think of, but every day they must fall a-wondering anew; and all
   this wrought by an exceeding great power working together with the
   word, Eph. i. 19; as Peter wondered at his own deliverance, when chains
   and gates and bars did all give way to the power of the angel that
   brought him forth: Acts xii. 9-11, And he went out, and followed him,
   and wist not that it was true that was done by the angel, but thought
   he saw a vision. When they were past the first and the second ward,
   they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city, which opened
   to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one
   street, and forthwith the angel departed from him. And when Peter was
   come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath
   sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and
   from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.' So may every one
   that is converted to God stand wondering, when he considereth how, from
   whence, and to what he is called by God; all this is wonderful indeed.
   There is more of God seen in inward experiences than in outward; in
   converting, comforting, quickening, and carrying on the work of grace
   in our own hearts, than in governing the courses of nature; therefore
   the apostle appealeth to this internal power, Eph. iii. 20, Unto him
   that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
   according to the power that worketh in us.' He instanceth in that which
   God hath done for us in Christ, which is beyond our prayer,
   conceptions, and hopes; transcending the hopes and apprehensions of the
   most enlarged hearts. Thus is a Christian a wonder to himself.

   [2.] He is a wonder to the world, if he keep up the majesty and vigour
   of religion: 1 Peter iv. 4, Wherein they think it strange that you run
   not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you.' It was
   strange to them that they should be altered so of a sudden, that of
   filthy puddles they should become clear as crystal waters; a sink
   turned into a pure fountain. That men should live above interests of
   nature, row against the stream of flesh and blood, this is all strange
   to the world; and this is the fruit of the word; for the word of God is
   perfect, converting the soul,' Ps. xix. 8. Every grace is a mystery and
   wonder; especially faith, for a man to believe that which he
   understandeth not, to hope for that he seeth not, to have that which he
   wants; to be tossed with tempests, and yet to enjoy a sweet calm in our
   own hearts; to be destitute of all things, and yet be as little anxious
   as if we indeed had all things; as poor, yet making many rich; as
   having nothing, yet possessing all things; to be a rock in the midst of
   a storm; as dying, and yet we live: 2 Cor. iv. 8, 9, We are troubled on
   every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
   persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;' 2 Cor. vi.
   10, As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich;
   as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.' Thus is a believer
   the world's wonder, a very riddle to carnal sense. So in other graces;
   he can hate father and mother for Christ's sake, can also love enemies
   at Christ's command. He that doth even break his heart for the least
   sin can bear up against the greatest trouble.

   Thus I might exemplify the point, but I must go a little largely to
   work.

   1. God's testimonies are wonderful in their majesty and composure,
   which striketh reverence into the hearts of those that consider; it
   speaketh to us at a God-like rate. Jesus Christ leaves a character of
   his divine Spirit upon his words: Mark vii. 28, 29, And it came to pass
   when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his
   doctrine; for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the
   scribes.' There was an impression of his authority upon his word, his
   hearers were convinced of a sovereign majesty proper to the dignity of
   his person. Those that went to take him returned this account, John
   vii. 46, Never man spake like this man,' for authority, power, and
   evidence. Now the scriptures being Christ's doctrine, why should they
   not have the same power, authority, and divine character in them? It is
   the same doctrine; the voice could add nothing to it, and the writing
   take nothing from it. Could not God discover his sovereign majesty in
   writing as well as speaking? Look into the scriptures; are you not even
   compelled to say, This can be no other but the word of God? They speak
   not as conscious of any weakness, or as begging assent, but as
   commanding it. Thus saith the Lord, hear it, or ye are undone for ever.
   The wisdom, majesty, authority of the author showeth itself in every
   line almost of scripture. Longinus, a heathen, admired the majesty of
   that passage, gene'stho kai` ege'neto. Indeed, everywhere there is
   great authority mixed with simplicity and plainness of speech, such as
   moveth reverence and awe in the consciences of men. It may be it is not
   seen in every phrase and clause of a sentence, but it is clearly
   discovered in the whole frame; as the majesty of a man's countenance is
   not so fully discovered in any one part of the face as in the whole
   visage taken jointly together. Scriptura sic loquitur, saith Austin, ut
   altitudine superbos irrideat, profunditate attentos terreat, veritate
   magnos pascat, affabilitate parvos nutriat--scripture so speaketh that
   it laughs proud and lofty men to scorn with the height of it; with the
   depths of it it terrifieth those who with attention look into it; with
   truth it feedeth men of greatest knowledge and understanding; with
   affability and sweetness it nourisheth babes and sucklings. Let a man
   have but anything of a prepared mind, and he cannot contain his wonder
   and reverence, but will tremble at the word of God: Isa. lxvi. 2, To
   this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite
   spirit, and trembleth at my word.'

   2. It is wonderful for the matter and depth of mystery, which cannot be
   found elsewhere, concerning God and Christ, the creation of the world,
   the souls of men, and their immortal and everlasting condition, the
   fall of man, &c. Here God is set forth to us in the clearest
   representation that we are capable of in this mortal state. God is in
   part seen in the creatures: Rom. i. 20, For the invisible things of him
   from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by
   the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.'
   Everything that hath passed his hand discovereth some what of the
   author and maker of it. But as imperfectly as God is discovered there,
   we cannot behold him without wonder and reverence, if we use never so
   little of an attentive mind; those strictures of God that are seen in
   man's body--Galen wondered when he saw a man's hand--the sun, moon, and
   stars; yea, a gnat, yea, a pile of grass: but these discoveries are not
   to be compared with the scriptures revealing the glory of God in the
   face of Christ: 2 Cor. iv. 6, For God, who commanded the light to shine
   out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give us the light of the
   knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.' If we
   wonder at so much of God as we find in a gnat, shall not we wonder much
   more at so much of God as we find in his law, in his gospel, in the
   whole economy and frame of his gracious dispensations? Besides that,
   the scriptures help us to interpret the book of the creatures: they
   show forth more of God than all the creatures can do; the book of
   nature is an imperfect piece in regard of the book of scripture. You
   cannot look upon the book of the creatures, but in every page and line
   of it you will find this truth presented to your eyes, that there is an
   infinite eternal power that made all things; this is enough to leave
   the world without excuse. But in the book of the word, you may see more
   of God, and the way how to enjoy him. In the 19th psalm David doth
   first admire the glory of God by the beauty of the heavens, then by the
   light of the word. By reason the heathens found out proton ai'tion tou
   ko'smou kai` tes taxeos pa'ses, a first mover and a first cause; but
   when and how the world was made they were left in uncertainties, which
   was first, the egg or the hen, the oak or the acorn: Heb. xi. 3,
   Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of
   God, so that things which are seen were not made of things that do
   appear.' A child is taught more than they could find out by their
   profound researches. So concerning the fall of man, conscience will
   inform us of a distinction between good and evil; and heathens, by the
   light of nature, could speak of virtue and vice as moral perfection and
   a deordination; but nothing of sin and righteousness relating to a
   covenant; and whence this mischief began they knew not. They complained
   of nature as of a stepmother, observed an inclination to evil more than
   to good, that vices are learned without a teacher, that man is born
   into the world crying, beginneth his life with a punishment; but the
   first spring and rise of evil was a secret to them, but clearly
   discovered to us: Rom. v. 12, Wherefore as by one man sin entered into
   the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that
   all have sinned.' Man's restitution and redemption by Christ is
   wonderful indeed: 1 Tim. iii. 16, And without controversy, great is the
   mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the
   spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
   world, received up into glory.' This could not be found by man; how
   could they know the free purposes of God's grace unless God revealed
   them? This is the mystery of mysteries, which angels desire to pry
   into, 1 Peter i. 12. So excellent and ravishing a mystery is this plot
   of salvation of lost sinners by Christ incarnate, that the very angels
   cannot enough exercise themselves in the contemplation of it. So union
   with Christ, and communion with him, a mystery that nature could never
   have thought of. God's keeping a familiar correspondence with his
   creatures, God's dwelling in us, our dwelling in God: 1 John iv. 13,
   Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath
   given us of his Spirit.' Words we should not dare to have used if God
   had not used them before us; it would have looked like blasphemy to
   speak so, if we had not the warrant of scripture. So the resurrection
   of the body, and life eternal, they are all wonders: 2 Tim. i. 10, But
   is now made manifest by the appearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who
   hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light,
   through the gospel.' Heathens might dream of a life after death, but
   could never under stand it distinctly. It is brought to light. Their
   wise men saw it, like the blind man who saw men walking like trees, or
   a spire at a distance, no clearness, no certainty: Lord, thy
   testimonies are wonderful.'

   3. It is wonderful for purity and perfection. The decalogue in ten
   words compriseth the whole duty of man, and reacheth to the very soul
   and all the motions of the heart. All the precepts of morality are
   advanced to the highest perfection. Those fragments and sorry
   remainders of the light of nature, that have escaped out of the ruins
   of the fall, will show us the necessity of a good life. But the word of
   God calleth for a good heart, a regeneration as well as a reformation,
   not only abstaining from acts of sin, but lusts: 1 Peter ii. 11, Dearly
   beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, that ye abstain from
   fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.' Not only the outward work,
   but the spirit, that is weighed in the balance of the sanctuary: Prov.
   xvi. 2, All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord
   weigheth the spirits.' It mightily establisheth faith, fear, and love
   to God, as the essential graces. When we consider duty in the lump, we
   have no admiring thoughts; but when we look abroad into all the parts
   and branches of obedience whereunto the law diffuseth itself, then the
   holiness which the law requireth is admirable; then we see it no easy
   matter to serve this holy and jealous God; it is no easy matter to go
   to the bottom of this perfection.

   4. It is wonderful for the harmony and consent of all the parts. All
   religion is of a piece, and one part doth not interfere with another,
   but conspireth to promote the great end of subjection of the creature
   to God. The law hath a mighty subserviency to the gospel, and the first
   covenant shutteth up the sinner immediately under the curse, that mercy
   may open the door to him. The gospel is first darkly revealed, and
   still it groweth as the light doth till noonday. At first an obscure
   intimation, The seed of the woman;' to Abraham, In thy seed,' which
   after was repeated to Isaac to cut off Ishmael; then to Jacob, to cut
   off Esau; yet not what tribe: Gen. xlix, 10, The sceptre shall not
   depart from Judah, nor the lawgiver from between his feet, till Shiloh
   come;' yet not what family of Judah; to David: 2 Sam. vii. 13, I will
   establish the throne of his kingdom for ever;' then Isa. vii. 14,
   Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and call his name
   Emmanuel;' then John the Baptist, John i. 29, Behold the Lamb of God
   which taketh away the sin of the world,' points with a finger to
   Christ. Thus while in short the scriptures do so set forth the mercy of
   God as that the duty of the creature is not abolished, so offers grace
   as not to exclude our care and use of means; justification and
   sanctification promote one another, all is ordered with good advice: 2
   Sam. xxiii. 5, Although my house be not so with God, he hath made with
   me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure.' Thus the
   wonderful harmony, order, and consent of all the parts with respect to
   the great end, which was the glorifying of God and the subjection of
   the creature, demonstrates the wonderfulness of God's testimonies, the
   glorifying of God's grace and mercy in those that are saved, and his
   justice in those that are damned. With respect to this, God made man
   upright, furnished with abilities to do his will; but mutable, and, in
   case of a fall, to begin with a new covenant. He will have his mercy
   honoured without prejudice to his justice; the comfort of the creature
   established, so as duty not abolished; not all of commands, nor all of
   promises, but these inter woven, that they may serve one another. A
   promise at the back of a command, to make it effectual; command besides
   a promise, to cause humbling; neither looseness nor rigour. If the
   covenant had been left to our ordering, it had been a confused
   business. Now it is wonderfully suited; God keepeth up his dominion and
   sovereignty, notwithstanding his grace and condescension; justice hath
   full satisfaction, yet grace glorified.

   5. Wonderful for the power of it.; There is a mighty power that goeth
   along with the word of God, and astonisheth the hearts of those that
   consider it and feel it: 1 Thes. i. 5, Our gospel came to you not in
   word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghost.' By this power it doth
   not only fill the head with notions, but pierceth the heart, alarms the
   conscience, awakens the affections: Heb. iv. 12, The word of God is
   quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to
   the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and joints and marrow, and is
   a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.' This power was
   seen in the wonderful success of that doctrine and religion which the
   scriptures do establish. It hath diffused and spread itself like leaven
   in the mass and lump, through out all parts of the known world, within
   the space of thirty or forty years or thereabouts. Hesterni sumus,
   saith Tertullian, et tamen omnia vestra implevimus, urbes, insulas,
   castella, municipia, conciliabula, castra, tribus, decurias, palatium,
   senatum, forum; sola vobis relinquimus templa--We are but of yesterday,
   and yet how are we in creased! Christians are found in all places,
   cities, villages, isles, castles, free towns, councils, armies, senate,
   markets; everywhere but in the idol temples. Such a wonderful increase
   and success was there in a short time! The apostle: Col. i. 6, The word
   of the truth of the gospel is come unto you, as it doth to all the
   world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you.' The doctrine
   itself is contrary to nature; it doth not court the senses, nor woo the
   flesh; it offereth no splendour of life, nor pleasures, nor profits;
   but biddeth deny all these things, and expect persecution: Mark xvi.
   21, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up
   his cross and follow me.' It only telleth us of spiritual comforts, and
   the recompenses of another world. Mahomet allures his followers with
   fair promises of security and carnal pleasure; there wind and tide went
   one way. Man is credulous of what he desireth; but Christ telleth us of
   denying ourselves, taking up the cross, cutting off right hand, and
   plucking out right eye, rowing against the stream of flesh and blood,
   bearing out sail against all the blasts and furious winds without: here
   is nothing lovely to a carnal eye. This was the doctrine. It taught the
   proud world humility: the uncharitable world love of their enemies; the
   unchaste world that a glance is adultery: Mat. v. 25, Whosoever looketh
   on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already
   in his heart;' the revengeful world to turn the other cheek to the
   smiter; the covetous man to be liberal, not to cark and take thought
   for worldly things, but to lay up treasures in heaven; the dissolute
   world to walk circumspectly in all godliness and honesty. The persons
   and instruments that were to manage the doctrine were in the world's
   eye contemptible: a few fishermen, destitute of all worldly props and
   aids; of no power, wealth, secular wisdom, authority, and other such
   advantages as are apt to beget a repute in the world; yet they
   preached, and converted many nations, though they had no public
   interest, were not backed with the power of princes, as superstitions
   are wont to prevail by their countenance and example: Every one seeketh
   the ruler's face;' but the gospel had gotten firm footing in the world
   long ere there was a prince to countenance it; there were many to
   persecute it, none to profess it. As the instruments were poor, so the
   persons that received their message: James ii. 5, Hearken, my beloved
   brethren, hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith,
   and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love
   him?' 1 Cor. i. 26, Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many
   wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.'
   When destitute of worldly succours and supports, it held up head. Ne
   videretur authoritate traxisse aliquos, et veritatis ratione, non
   pompae gratia praevaleret, saith Ambrose. It was much it should hold up
   head; yea, the powers of the world against it, bonds and sufferings and
   deaths did abide for them everywhere that professed this way. Horrible
   tortures; never did war, pestilence, and famine sweep away so many as
   the first persecutions; poor Christians were murdered and butchered
   every where; yet still they multiplied, as the Israelites did in Egypt,
   under oppression; or as a tree lopped sends forth more sprouts. As
   without worldly interests; they had not such gifts of art, eloquence,
   and policy as the world with whom they had to deal; all was carried on
   in a plain way, without pomp of words. Paul was learned, but he laid
   aside his ornaments, lest the cross of Christ should he of none effect:
   1 Cor. ii. 4, 5, And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing
   words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power;
   that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power
   of God.' They were to deal with men of excellent parts and learning,
   some of which received the gospel. This plain doctrine was set afoot in
   that part of the world where arts and civil discipline most flourished
   at that time, and were in their akme'. Thus as Aaron's rod devoured the
   magicians' serpents, so was the gospel too hard for the wisdom of the
   world: it prevailed not by force of arms and the power of the long
   sword, as all dotages do, and superstitions are planted; but overcame
   by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they
   loved not their lives unto the death,' Rev. xii. 11. Christ's sword is
   in his mouth: Ps. viii. 2, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
   hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies, that thou
   mightest still the enemy and the avenger.' This way seemed to the world
   a novel way; they were leavened with prejudices, and bred up by long
   custom, which is a second nature, in the worship of idols: 1 Peter i.
   18, Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible
   things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation, received by
   tradition from your fathers.' Men keep to the religion of their
   ancestors with much reverence. Christ did not seize upon the world as a
   waste is seized upon for the next owner. The ark was to be set up in
   the temple that was already occupied and possessed by Dagon. Before
   Christ could be seated in the government of the nations, first Satan
   was to be dispossessed, and superstitions received by a long tradition
   and prescription of time were to be removed, the wolf hunted out. Thus
   the power great.

   But this is past and gone. There is a wonderful power that goes along
   with the word.

   [1.] A power to humble and terrify those that scoffed at the miracles:
   Acts ii. 37, When they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts,
   and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren,
   what shall we do?' The word can do that which a miracle cannot; make
   the stoutest hearts relent and yield. One instance more: Acts xxiv. 25,
   And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come,
   Felix trembled.' Mark the disadvantage; the prisoner maketh the judge
   tremble, the man none of the tenderest, a pagan, and to boot an
   obdurate sinner; but Paul by his power caused these. Terrors of
   conscience, which are raised by the word, all wicked men feel not, but
   soon may; they fear them that feel them not: John iii. 20, For every
   one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest
   his deeds should be reproved.' Conviction in one of these spiritual
   agonies exceeds all natural passions; fears of the wrath of God scorch
   more, and breed more restlessness and disquietness to the soul, their
   thoughts become a burden to them: He is convinced of all, and judged of
   all; and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so
   falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in
   you of a truth,' 1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25. His sins revived, the poor
   creature lieth grovelling.

   [2.] There is a converting and transforming power in the word of God:
   Rom. i. 16, For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the
   power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth,' Thes. i. 9,
   For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto
   you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true
   God;' from a false to a true, a bad to a better. Men brought up in a
   false religion, there is much ado to take them off: Have any nations
   changed their gods?' Though their worship be never so vain and foolish,
   yet this power the word hath, even over those that have been rooted and
   habituated in superstitious customs. The gods they had prayed to in
   their adversities, praised in their prosperity, deprecated their anger
   when any judgment upon them, magnified their goodness when any good
   received, built them temples, offered them gifts; must they break those
   images, destroy those temples, deny those gods? How dear idols are,
   Rachel's stealing away her father's images clearly showeth, Gen. xxxi.
   34. She was one of them that built God's Israel, yet she hath a
   hankering after her father's idols. No humours so obstinate and stiff
   as those that are found in religious customs. They accused Stephen for
   changing the customs Moses delivered, Acts vi. 14; and Paul, that he
   taught customs which were not lawful for Romans to observe, Acts xvi.
   21. Certainly it is a very hard thing to bring men out of an old
   religion into a new one. Again, the converting of man from a state of
   nature to a state of grace, so that they are, as it were, born again:
   James i. 18, Of his own will begat he us, with the word of truth; that
   we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creation.' It is a hard
   matter to change natures, to turn a lion into a lamb: Isa. xi. 6, The
   wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down
   with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together,
   and a little child shall lead them.' Yet this will the gospel do, make
   him that resembleth the devil in his contempt of God, envy, revenge, to
   be like Christ; I say the gospel doth it: 2 Cor. iii. 18, But we all
   with open face beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are
   changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit
   of the Lord.' To bring us to love what we naturally hate, and to hate
   what we naturally love; that the heart should be turned from all
   creatures, himself and all, to God; that they should be induced to turn
   from the creature to God, to seek out happiness in him; from self to
   Christ, from sin to holiness; that God's desires should be our desires,
   his will our will, his delights our delights; the natural heart is
   averse from this: Rom. viii. 7, The carnal mind is enmity against God,
   for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.' That
   the hearts, spirits, dispositions of men should be turned upside down:
   1 Cor. vi. 9-11, Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
   nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
   nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
   extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of
   you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in
   the name of our Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God;' Isa. lv. 13,
   Instead of the thorns shall come up the fig-tree; and instead of the
   brier shall come up the myrtle-tree.' A mighty change wrought, to be
   changed not only in their lives, but natures.

   [3.] In comforting poor distressed souls. Their sore runneth upon them,
   and their soul refuseth comfort, when they have all things in the
   world; but yet as there are no sorrows like wounds of conscience for
   degree, so no comforts: groans unutterable, so joys unutterable:
   nothing left that will comfort; it is as the whole of their joy. The
   reviving of poor wounded spirits is one of the greatest wonders in the
   world. Creatures can do nothing, reason and human discourse can do
   nothing; it proceedeth from the apprehension of God's wrath provoked by
   sin: Job xxxiii. 23-25, If there be an interpreter, one among a
   thousand, to show unto man his uprightness, then he is gracious unto
   him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a
   ransom: his flesh shall be fresher than a child's; he shall return to
   the days of his youth.' Nothing but the covenant of his peace will
   still such a soul; a scripture wound will only be cured by scripture
   plasters. He that puts the soul on the racks of conscience can only
   release us: I create the fruits of the lips to be peace;' Jer. vi. 16.
   Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the
   good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls;' Mat
   xi. 28, 29, Come unto me. all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
   meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.'

   [4.] The confirming and strengthening power of the word, that we may
   despise the world, encounter all difficulties and discouragements, and
   to be cheerful as the martyrs were in the midst of flames, all the
   oppositions of Satan: 1 John ii. 14, I have written unto you young men,
   because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have
   overcome the wicked one;' Acts xx. 32, And now, brethren, I commend you
   to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up,
   and to give you an inheritance among them that are sanctified.' In the
   word of his grace God hath assured us of the great privileges of
   Christianity, support and defence here, and glory here after; and that
   is a mighty strengthening to the soul, and maketh a Christian also
   glorious and becoming all those hopes and promises that are given him.

SERMON CXLII.

   Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore doth my soul keep them.--Ver.
   129.

   USE 1. Reproof to several sorts.

   1. Of those proud carnalists that scorn the simplicity of the word.
   Many wit themselves into hell by lifting up the pride of reason against
   the word of God; think all respect to the word to be fond credulity. To
   them the gospel seemeth a base and a mean doctrine, whereas it is
   indeed wonderful. They never studied it, and therefore think nothing
   but plain points in it, have no spiritual eyes, and are looking on what
   is uppermost. There is nothing vulgar. The angels prize what they
   contemn: Eph. iii. 10, To the intent that now unto the principalities
   and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
   wisdom of God.' They despise the word, as if it were too low a
   discipline for their wit and parts, scoff at that as mean which a
   gracious heart findeth to be mystery; they see none of this sublimity
   that we speak of; this pearl of price seemeth to them but as a common
   stone. This is pride not to be endured, for the foolishness of man to
   contemn the wisdom of God. The excellency of scripture can never be
   sufficiently understood; they never pierced the depths of scripture,
   else they would find it sublime and subtle enough; but they are
   ignorant of what they seem to understand so well: 1 Cor. viii. 2, If
   any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he
   ought to know.'

   2. Others that give up themselves to the itch of curiosity must have
   mysteries made more mystical, and therefore fly from the letter of the
   scriptures to ungrounded subtleties and spiritualities, as if all the
   written word were an allegory: Rev. ii. 24, But to you I say, and unto
   the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have
   not known the depths of Satan.' Men must have ba'the, but ba'the tou
   Zatana, are loath to be tethered, and tied up to a few common truths.
   The bait to our first parents was the fruit of the tree, it is good for
   knowledge: Gen. iii. 5, 6, God doth know that in the day ye eat
   thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,
   knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good
   for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
   desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat.'
   If any be of such a rigid temper and constitution as not to be moved
   with the pleasures of the senses, Satan draweth them to nice and
   ungrounded speculations; they would be wise above the rate which God
   hath allowed, run into strange and uncouth notions; and so many,
   otherwise of a sober life, have an unsound judgment.

   3. Those that would fathom these mysteries by the line and plummet of
   their own reason, believe God's word, and the things contained in it,
   no further than they can see natural reason for it, these are not
   disciples of the doctrine of Christ, but judges, and set a prince at
   the subject's bar; the scantling of their own private senses and reason
   is made the standard for the highest mysteries to be measured by. They
   come to judge the word rather than to be judged by it. Mysteries are to
   be admired, not curiously searched and discussed by mere human reason.
   Every light must keep its place; sense, reason, faith, light of glory.
   If sense be made the judge of reason, there is wrong judgment. Some
   things we apprehend by reason that cannot be known by sense, as that
   the sun is bigger than the earth. So faith corrects reason. Shall we
   doubt of that to be true which droppeth from God's own mouth, because
   it exceedeth our own understanding?

   4. Those that prostitute their wonder to every paltry, carnal vanity.
   Oh, what trifles are these to the wonders of God's law! If we see a
   fair building, we cry out, Oh wonderful! as the disciples: Mark xiii.
   1, Master, see what manner of stones, and what buildings are these.'
   Oh! there are God's testimonies; a more noble nature, the person of
   Christ: Col. ii. 9, In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead
   bodily.' Oh, wonderful! at an heap of money: what are these to the
   unsearchable riches of grace? Rare plot! me'ga muste'rion: all in and
   about Christ is rare; his name is Wonderful. He that found out the
   causes of things by philosophy could say, Nihil admirari; but he that
   hath the most knowledge of religion as to divine things may say, Omnia
   admirari--the transcendent goodness of God in the pardon of sins,
   riches of everlasting glory, purity of divine commands; but as to the
   world, Nil admirari. You know better things in God's testimonies.

   5. Those that find more favour and more matter to wonder at in other
   books, in Plato, in Aristotle, or heathen writers, they have a savour
   there, a wonder there; but are not affected with those mysteries and
   those notions which are in the gospel. They like those books where they
   find flowers of rhetoric, chemical, experiments, philosophical notions,
   maxims of policy, but they slight the word.

   6. Those that admire more what man puts into an ordinance than the word
   of God. The further off anything is from the majesty of the scriptures,
   the more it taketh with unregenerate men, taken with toys and baubles
   of delight more than the substantial goodness of Christianity. We are
   apt to say of the labour of man, excellences of man, admirable! but we
   little regard the truths of God; as in a field of corn, prize the
   poppies and well-coloured weeds, but slight and overlook the more
   valuable corn.

   Use 2. Instruction. To instruct us how to entertain the word of God. We
   never entertain it rightly till we entertain it with wonder.

   Considerations.

   1. We have not a true sight and sense of the word if we admire it not.
   There is such transcendent love, admirable depths of wisdom,
   unsearchable treasures of happiness, raised strains of purity, a
   harmonious coincidence of all parts. What would we admire but that
   which is great and excellent? Why are not we then transported and
   ravished with those wonderful felicities, as the favour of and
   fellowship with God, everlasting enjoyment? Nothing is of such weight
   and importance as this is; all is nothing to this: Phil. iii. 8, Yea,
   doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the
   knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.' Would we admire what is rare and
   strange? As the object of wonder is inauditum et insperatum, it could
   not enter into the heart of man to conceive what God hath done for us
   in Christ; unheard of, unlocked for: 2 Sam. vii. 19, And this was yet a
   small thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also of thy
   servant's house for a great while to come; and is this the manner of
   man, O Lord God?' If we wonder at what is wise and deep, the terms upon
   which salvation is dispensed and propagated are with excellent wisdom:
   1 Cor. ii. 2, We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
   wisdom, which God ordained before the world, to our glory.' These are
   mysteries that lie out of the road of vulgar understandings.

   2. Upon every new looking, it argueth some distemper unless we wonder.
   Either carelessness of soul-necessities, or stupidness, and
   inattentiveness, or else carnal savour, prevailing too much.

   3. It is a great help to practice. The more the word is admired, the
   more reverence it striketh into the conscience; the more it is
   submitted unto, the more should we frame our practice. In the text,
   Therefore doth my soul keep them.' The word must be kept; not only
   affected with it, but our esteem must last, and we must ever be tender
   of doing anything contrary to it. It must be kept by the soul; there is
   the directive and commanding power; it must be preserved or kept there,
   not confined there. If not kept there, it will not be kept elsewhere.
   There understanding is clear, conscience aweful, heart ready. Human
   authority reacheth no further than to bind men to conform to order in
   the course of their practice; but divine authority bringeth under the
   heart and thoughts to the obedience of Christ, 2 Cor. x. 5. It bindeth
   the conscience to approve of God's commanded will, to choose it with
   affection, to embrace it with the whole man. to follow on with strength
   and constant endeavours. Therefore wonderful, partly because a renewed
   esteem is the beginning of a pure and entire subjection to it. Why did
   any give up themselves to the discipline of it? Plato and Zeno's
   doctrine was admired. Sc to God; reverence is the mother of obedience.
   If we have not a slight esteem of the word, we shall look more after
   keeping of it. And partly because wonderfulness of promises evidenceth
   them to be of God; it commendeth itself to the consciences of men.

   Means.

   1. A spiritual gust to relish knowledge and spiritual things. A brutish
   soul admires the sweetness of carnal things; the sober part of the
   world, that prize intellectual food, the perfections of the mind, they
   have a taste and relish for those things: Ps. cxix. 103, How sweet is
   thy word to my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.' A sensual
   heart is not affected with these things.

   2. A diligent search: Eph. iii. 9, And to make all men see what is the
   fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath
   been hid in God.' The more diligently we search into these things, the
   more we admire them. A superficial view satisfieth and contenteth
   sooner than a deep search. Herein they differ from other things, for
   the more they are searched into, the less they are admired;
   imperfections which formerly lay hid then come in view.

   3. A thorough insight or spiritual illumination: Ps. cxix. 18, Open
   thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law;' and
   ver. 27, Make me to understand the way of thy precepts; so shall I talk
   of thy wondrous works.' The testimonies of God have more in recess than
   in open view.

   4. Experience; if we have felt the wonderful power, majesty, and
   authority of the word: John viii. 32, Ye shall know the truth, and the
   truth shall make you free.' Where there is no such effect they have no
   experience.

   5. Show forth the wonderfulness of God's testimonies by the raisedness
   of your conversations. They disparage the word that live at a mean
   rate: 2 Tim. iii. 5, Having a form of godliness, but denying the
   power;' 1 Peter iv. 14, If ye be reproached for the name of Christ,
   happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on
   their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXLIII.

   The entrance of thy word giveth light; it giveth understanding to the
   simple.--Ver. 130.

   IN the former verse, David had commended the word from the
   wonderfulness and mysteriousness thereof; here from its clearness and
   perspicuity, Thy testimonies are wonderful;' yet they give light, The
   entrance giveth light to the simple.' The one property doth not hinder
   the other, upon a twofold account:--

   1. Because the truths revealed in scripture are of two sorts: some are
   plain doctrines, fit for the entertainment of novices, and may be
   called the porch and entrance; others are deep mysteries, to exercise
   the wits of the strongest. In the waters of the sanctuary in some
   places the elephant may swim, in others the lamb may wade. The penmen
   of the scripture acknowledged themselves to be debtors to wise and
   foolish, learned and unlearned: Rom. i. 14, I am debtor both to the
   Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.' And
   accordingly were made use of to discover truths of all sorts. There are
   dusno'eta' tina, not all things, nor the most material, but some things
   hard to be understood, 2 Peter iii. 16. God hath expressed his mind in
   some points so, that the sharpest-sighted will not at first glance
   easily take up the meaning of it. Other things are plain and easy and
   obvious, so that the very entrance or first sight of them giveth
   understanding.

   2. From the manner; because though there are mysteries, and things
   naturally unknown to us, yet they are not obscurely delivered, so as
   that we should despair to understand them; but in a plain and familiar
   style, depths of mystery in plainness of words. Therefore the simplest
   who desire to know so much as may comfort and save their souls, ought
   not to be hindered and discouraged in the study of the scriptures. The
   sum is: some things are open and clear, other things dark and
   mysterious; but though hard to be understood, yet not impossible to be
   understood; most things plain, none impossible: The entrance of thy
   word giveth light; it giveth understanding to the simple.' In these
   words--

   1. What, or the benefit we have by the scriptures, set forth by two
   words, the one metaphorical, giveth light; the other literal, it giveth
   understanding. That is it which is meant by light.

   2. How or whence we have this light, from the entrance of the word.

   3. To whom, to the simple.

   The first thing is explained in the text; it giveth light, that is, it
   giveth understanding. Two questions then remain by way of
   explication:--

   1. What is meant by the entrance of thy word'? Some render it ostium,
   the door, as Jerome; the Septuagint, de'losis; the vulgar, the
   declaration; we, the entrance. The word petack signifieth door, gate,
   or opening. The expression giveth us occasion--

   [1.] To distinguish of truth in scripture. There is ostium and
   penetrale, the porch of knowledge and the secret chambers of it. The
   porch I should take for the first vital essential necessary truths that
   concern faith and practice: those are obvious to every one that looketh
   into the scriptures. The inner chambers are those more abstruse points,
   that do not so absolutely concern the life of grace, but yet conduce ad
   plenitudinem scientiae, serve for the increase of knowledge. Those that
   are in the porch, and have not as yet pierced into the depths of
   scripture, may yet have so much light as to direct them into solid
   piety.

   [2.] Every door hath a key belonging to it, so hath this a key to open
   it, which Christ hath in his keeping: Rev. iii. 7, He hath the key of
   David, which openeth and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man
   openeth.' The officers of the church are in part intrusted with it for
   the good of the church. Christ saith, Luke xi. 52, The lawyers had
   taken away the key of knowledge, and entered not into the kingdom of
   God themselves, and them that were entering in they hindered.' Such
   unfaithful ones hath every age almost afforded; that shut the door of
   knowledge against the people. Papists, that lock up the scriptures in
   an unknown tongue, are grossly guilty of it. Others that hinder plain
   and powerful preaching, cannot excuse themselves from being accessory
   to this guilt; yea, those that obscure the plain word of God by
   philosophy, traditions of men, or careless handling: Tertullian
   complained long ago of those, qui Platonicum et Aristotelicum
   Christianismum procudunt Christianis.

   [3.] By this door opened there is entrance, and so cometh in our word.
   This entrance may be understood actively or passively; when the word
   entereth into us, or we enter into it.

   (1.) Actively, when the word entereth upon a man's heart, and maketh a
   sanctified impression there; as the expression is, Prov. ii. 10, When
   wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleasant to thy soul.'
   This entrance of the word bringeth light with it. The first creature
   God made was light, so in the new creature; therefore it concerns us to
   know what manner of entrance the word had upon us: 1 Thes. i. 9, For
   they themselves know of us what manner of entering in we had unto you,
   and how ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God.

   (2.) Passively, when men do first enter upon the study of the word. It
   may be read the entrance into thy word,' as well as of thy word.' When
   once acquainted with it, and the first rudiments of knowledge, we
   should soon discern the Lord's mind in the necessary truths that
   concern faith and practice.

   2. The other question is, what is meant by the simple? The word is
   sometimes used in a good sense, sometimes in a bad.

   [1.] In a good sense. (1.) For the sincere and plain-hearted: Ps. cxvi.
   6, The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped
   me;' 2 Cor. i. 12, For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our
   conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
   wisdom, but by the grace of God, we had our conversation in the world,
   and more abundantly to you-wards.' (2.) For those that do not oppose
   the presumption of carnal wisdom to the pure light of the word: so we
   must be all simple, or fools, that we may be wise: 1 Cor. iii. 18, If
   any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a
   fool, that he may be wise; that is, in simplicity of heart submitting
   to God's conduct, and believing what he hath revealed The Septuagint in
   the text, photi'zei kai` suneti'zei nepi'ous, it enlighteneth and
   giveth understanding to the babes; and so they often translate this
   word, babes or little ones: thence Christ's saying, Mat. xi. 25, I
   thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid
   these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
   babes.' Not to worldly wise, but babes in comparison; not to
   conceitedly wise, but those that are sensible of their own ignorance.

   [2.] In a bad sense, for the ignorant. (1.) In the general, every man
   is naturally dull and ignorant in divine things: Job xi. 12, Vain man
   would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt;' for
   grossness as well as untamedness. So every man is simple. (2.) Those
   that are naturally weak of understanding, or of mean capacity: Prov. i.
   4, To give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
   discretion;' Prov. viii. 5, O ye simple, under stand wisdom, and ye
   fools, be ye of an understanding heart.' In all these senses may the
   text be made good. I take the last chiefly intended.

   Observations.

   1. Observe somewhat from that word the entrance.'

   Doct. 1. That in getting knowledge there is a porch and entrance that
   we must pass through before we can attain to deeper matters.

   As in practice there is a gate and a way: Mat. vii. 14, Because strait
   is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to life.' An entrance
   and a progress. An entrance by conversion to God, and a progress in a
   course of holy walking. So in knowledge there ta` stoicheia tes arches
   to logi'on tou Theou, the first principles of the oracles of God;' or
   some elements and afterwards deeper i milk for babes as well as meat
   for stronger men: Heb. v. 12-14, For when for the time ye ought to be
   teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first
   principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of
   milk, and riot of strong meal. For every one that useth milk is
   unskilful in the word of rightness; for he is a babe: but strong meat
   belongeth to them that full age, even those who by reason of use have
   their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.' There is an
   order in bringing men to knowledge.

   [1.] There is something obvious and lies uppermost, in all truths, that
   is soon understood, and this we put into catechisms. We must teach as
   able to bear; Mark iv. 33, And with many such parables spake he the
   word unto them, as they are able to hear it.' Indeed, afterwards we
   come to die into the mines of knowledge, and to dive deeper, as choice
   metals do not lie on the surface, but in the bowels; therefore we
   should not content ourselves with a superficial search, but dig as for
   treasure in a mine: Prov. ii. 4, If thou diggest for her as silver, and
   searchest for her as for hid treasures.' So Paul, 1 Cor. iii. 1, 2, And
   I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
   carnal, even as unto babes in Christ: I have fed you with milk, and not
   with strong meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet
   now are ye able.' By milk, he meaneth the plain handling of the
   doctrines of Christian religion, according to the capacity of those
   that are weak in knowledge; and by meat, the more exact and curious
   handling those points. Our weakness enforceth that we begin with the
   one, but we must go on to the other, for several reasons. Partly
   because we are to grow in knowledge, as well as other graces: 2 Peter
   i. 5, Give all diligence to add to your faith virtue, to virtue
   knowledge.' Besides that knowledge that maketh way for faith and
   virtue, there is a knowledge to be added to it, a great skill in divine
   things. Partly because those obvious truths will be better improved and
   retained when we look more into them : after notions do explain and
   ground the former. First we receive the truth, and after we are rooted
   and grounded in it: Col. i. 23, If ye continue in the faith grounded
   and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel.' A half
   light makes us very unsettled in our course; but, when we grow
   judicious, have a fuller and clearer apprehension of truths, we are the
   more confirmed against the error of the wicked; whereas otherwise light
   chaff is carried about with every wind. Partly because the more we
   understand a truth, the more dominion it hath over our faith and
   practice; for God beginneth with the understanding, and grace is
   multiplied by knowledge: 2 Peter i. 2, Grace and peace be multiplied
   unto you, through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.' A truth
   simply understood hath not such operation and force as when it is
   soundly and thoroughly understood. Love aboundeth with judgment: Phil.
   i. 9, And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more, in
   knowledge and in all judgment.'

   [2.] There are first principles and fundamental doctrines that must be
   first taught in a plain and easy way. I say, some things are initial
   and fundamental, others additional and perspective; we must regard
   both--the one in our entrance, the other in our growth. The one are
   called the first principles of the oracles of God, Heb. v. 12, &c.,
   partly, because they are first in order, and first to be taught and
   learned; partly, because they are chief and fundamental truths of the
   gospel, upon which the rest depend, most conducing to salvation: the
   foundation laid well, the building will stand the stronger. They are
   reckoned up, Heb. vi. 1, 2, Therefore, leaving the principles of the
   doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the
   foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of
   the doctrine of baptism, and of laying on of hands, and of the
   resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.' In the general he
   calls them the principles of Christ. The doctrine of Christ is the sum
   of religion; he that hath learned it well hath learned all. In
   particular, repentance from dead works is made the first, or that a
   sinful creature must turn to God by Christ before he can be happy. The
   next is faith towards God, believing the promises and privileges of the
   gospel, and depending on him till they be accomplished. Indeed, in
   these two is the sum of religion sometimes comprised: Acts xx. 21,
   Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward
   God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.' So Acts v. 31, Him hath
   God raised up to be a prince and a saviour, for to give repentance to
   Israel, and remission of sins.' Doctrine of baptism is the initiating
   ordinance, what it signifieth, to what it obligeth. Laying on of hands,
   the way of Christ's officers entering the church. Resurrection and last
   judgment bindeth all. Again, because the prime truths are few and
   clear, ignorant and unlearned people may know them; they are milk,
   babes and ignorants may swallow them, as most easy of digestion, God's
   end in the scripture being to guide his people to true happiness. Those
   truths that are necessary to this end are few and clear, and plainly
   set down, that he that runneth may read them. Though we reach not other
   points, yet if we get but to this door, there is a great deal of
   profit.

   [3.] They which do not first learn these, cannot profit much. Some
   confused knowledge they may acquire, but distinct, clear, and orderly
   understanding they never grow unto. When men run before they can go,
   they often get a knock. They that were never well grounded are always
   mutable; therefore before We are brought into the chambers of
   knowledge, we must stay in the porch, begin with most necessary things,
   which are most clear and plain, and thereby we are made capable of
   higher mysteries.

   2. Though all Christians must come to this pitch, to know what is
   necessary to salvation, yet we must not stay here, nor always stay in
   the porch, nor always keep to our milk, nor be always infants in
   understanding: 1 Cor. xiv. 20, Brethren, be not children in
   understanding.' Other things must be regarded, or why hath God revealed
   them? No part of scripture is expressed in vain, or at random, but all
   by divine direction; though the first points are most necessary, yet
   the rest are not superfluous, but have their use: 2 Tim. iii. 16, All
   scripture is given by inspiration, and is profitable for doctrine, for
   reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;' one part of
   scripture as well as the other, and maketh much for the increase of
   spiritual knowledge, comfort, and godliness. One part is milk, another
   stronger meat; but all is food for the soul. The grown are more ready
   to every good work, more strong in the resistance of sin, more stead
   fast in the truth; therefore we should improve our knowledge. If a man
   layeth the foundation, and doth not carry on the building, he loseth
   his cost; therefore let us go on to perfection.

   Use 1. Let us bless God for this door and porch, that the scriptures
   are so plain and clear in all things necessary to salvation. Many
   complain of the difficulty and obscurity of religion, and the many
   controversies that are about it, and they know not what to choose, nor
   where to find the truth, till the world be more of a mind. It is true,
   in some things there is difficulty, but not in the most necessary
   things. Pascimur apertis, exercemur obscuris; ibi fames pellitur, hic
   fastidium. God has made his people's way clear and sure in necessaries,
   for which we have cause to bless his name, for exercising our diligence
   and dependence. Something is difficult: if those that complain of this
   difficulty would enter into the porch that standeth open, other things
   would soon be understood. Whatever differences there are in
   Christendom, all agree that there is one God, Jesus Christ his only
   Son, who died for the world, and accordingly must be owned by his
   people; that a man must be converted to God, and become a new creature,
   and walk holily, or else shall never see God; all are agreed in this.
   Pre pare thy heart for entertaining the light and power of these
   truths, and in due time God will show thee other things. In the
   meantime bless God that whatever is necessary is plain to them that are
   docile and heedful, and willing to do the will of God. As in the world,
   the most necessary things are at hand, the less necessary are hidden in
   the bowels of the earth; so in scripture, necessaries are facile and
   easy.

   Use 2. Let us use this method in learning, and teaching of others. In
   learning ourselves, first, be sure to get a clear understanding of, and
   firm assent unto, the main plain truths of scripture; that there is one
   God: Heb. xi. 6, He that cometh to God must believe that he is;' that
   Jesus Christ is the Son of God: John xvii. 3, This is life eternal,
   that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
   hast sent.' It is a corner truth, that enliveneth all religion: Mat.
   xvi. 16, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God; 7 then, Upon this
   rock will I build my church;' John vi. 69, We believe and are sure that
   thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.' This is the great
   enlivening truth, that hath influence both on faith and obedience. We
   must believe that he is able to bring us to God, John xiv. 6, Heb. vii.
   25, and must be obeyed, Heb. v. 9; that every man needeth this Christ
   to bring him to God, Acts iv. 12. There is a necessity of his merit,
   that God may be propitious; of his Spirit, as the foundation of a new
   life, that we may be reconciled to God; that we should live holily,
   because there is a day of account when every one shall receive
   according to his works. We should bestow more cost upon the main
   truths, to get a clear distinct knowledge of them; there must be a
   removing of rubbish, and digging, to lay the foundation of the
   knowledge of the principles of the doctrine of Christ, before there can
   be any safe building or going on unto perfection, Heb. vi., and firm
   assent to them; for he is the best Christian that doth most clearly
   understand and firmly believe these things, not the opinionist, the
   disputer, he that best promotes the interest of his party or side,
   which are the distempers now afoot in Christendom. Those truths well
   accepted would so purify the heart as we should sooner discern God's
   interest in other things, and be able to find out that. So for teaching
   our children, God reckons on it from his people: Gen. xviii. 19, For I
   know Abraham, that he will command his children and his household after
   him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and
   judgment;' Deut. vi. 6, 7, And these words that I command thee this day
   shall be in thy heart, and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy
   children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and
   when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou
   risest up.' Train them up in wholesome truths, in the nurture and
   admonition of the Lord, Eph. vi. 4; how to carry themselves towards God
   in matters of religion; how towards men, in righteousness, civility,
   and good manners; chiefly that _they may be instructed in the knowledge
   of Christ, and salvation by him.

   Use 3. Let the entertainment we have upon our first entrance into the
   study of religion encourage us to follow on to know the Lord, that we
   may see more into his mind and counsel concerning us. When we are first
   serious, we have notable experience of light and comfort and power;
   this is a bribe to draw us on farther; more light, for it is a growing
   thing: Prov. iv. 18, The path of the just is as the shining light, that
   shineth more and more to the perfect day;' more taste, 1 Peter ii. 3,
   4, If so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious, to whom
   coming as to a living stone,' &c. It should sharpen and put an edge
   upon our desires; more power: James i. 18, 19, Of his own will begat he
   us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of
   his creation; wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
   hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.' You saw the entrance, and your
   first acquaintance with the word succeeded well.

   Doct. 2. By the word of God we get light, or our understandings m-e
   enlightened: Prov. vi. 23, For the commandment is a lamp, and the law
   is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.'

   1. Light is a great benefit. This is the perfection of the rational
   nature, the benefit that we have above the beasts: He teacheth us more
   than the beasts of the field.' They are guided by instinct, ruled by a
   rod of iron; we have reason, and in it more resemble God, who is light,
   and in him is no darkness at all, 1 John i. 5; we come nearest to our
   happiness in heaven; it is called The inheritance of the saints in
   light,' Col. i. 12. Our knowledge is perfected, and the vision of God
   is our happiness: 1 Cor. xiii. 12, For now we see through a glass
   darkly, then face to face; now I know in part, then I shall know even
   as also I am known.'

   2. This light hath excellent properties.

   [1.] It is lux manifestans; it manifesteth itself and all things else.
   How do I see the sun but by the sun, by its own light? How do I know
   the scripture to be the word of God, but by the light that shineth in
   it, commending itself to my conscience? So it manifests all things
   else. By this light a man may see everything in its own colours; it
   layeth open all the frauds and impostures of Satan, the vanity of
   worldly things, the deceits of the heart, the odiousness of sin: Eph.
   v. 13, All things that be reproved are made manifest by light, for
   whatsoever doth make manifest is light.' It sets out the odiousness of
   sin as a breach of God's most holy law, enmity against the great God,
   the procurer of his eternal wrath. Nothing manifests things as this
   light doth.

   [2.] It is lux dirigens, a directing light, that we may see our way and
   work. As the sun lighteth man to his labour, so doth this direct us in
   all conditions: Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a
   light unto my path.' It directs us how to manage ourselves in all
   conditions, in prosperity, adversity; in all affairs, paths, steps; in
   all the particular actions of our life; it filleth us with spiritual
   prudence; the wayfaring, the fool, the man of parts that is a stranger,
   the man of mean parts, all may meet with plain and clear directions
   hence to guide them in the way to heaven.

   [3.] It is lux vivificans, a quickening light, lux est vehiculum
   influentiarum: John viii. 12, I am the light of the world: he that
   followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
   life;' Eph. v. 14, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
   and Christ shall give thee light.' That light was the life of men, so
   is this spiritual life; it not only discovereth the object, but helpeth
   the faculty, filleth the soul with life and strength.

   [4.] It is lux exhilarans, a comforting, refreshing, cheering light:
   Eccles. xi. 7, Light is sweet, and it is a comfortable thing to behold
   the sun.' It is so in two respects:--

   (1.) It presents us with excellent grounds of comfort, not only against
   afflictions, but against distress of conscience, which is the greatest
   trouble that can befall the creature, such as the sense of God's love
   in Christ; so it rejoiceth the soul: Ps. xix. 8, The statutes of the
   Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandments of the Lord are
   pure, enlightening the eyes.' It doth good to the heart. Others tickle
   the senses, but are not affliction-proof, stead us not when God
   rebuketh us for sin. The light of God's countenance is displayed in the
   word: Ps. iv. 6, 7, There be many that say, Who will show us any good?
   Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Thou hast put
   gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and wine
   increased.'

   (2.) Because it is a soul-satisfying light, as light easeth of trouble
   and restlessness of mind, which we always lie under till we find a safe
   way of salvation, which we never do till we give up ourselves to the
   conduct of the word: Jer. vi. 16, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and
   ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye
   shall find rest to your souls.' There we find enough to satisfy
   conscience, though, it may be, not to satisfy curiosity, which is
   libido intellectus--thirst of a sober man and thirst of a drunkard, the
   one satisfied, the other mortified.

   Use 1. Information.

   1. That without the word men lie in darkness, whatever learning they
   have, if they want the gospel. As the Ephesians, before it came to
   them, though given to curious arts, the apostle telleth them they were
   sometimes in darkness,' Eph. v. 8. The wisest heathens could only grope
   and feel about for happiness. If they neglect the light, though it be
   among them, it is not excusable: John i. 5, And the light shineth in
   darkness, but the darkness comprehendeth it not.' But if they refuse
   the light, and this carelessness groweth obstinate, their condition is
   the worse: John iii. 19, This is the condemnation, that light is come,
   and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.'

   2. If we get not understanding of the mysteries of salvation, we may
   blame ourselves: 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4, But if our gospel be hid, it is hid
   to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the
   minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel
   of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.' If thou
   miss the way to heaven, accuse thine own blindness; thou canst not
   accuse the gospel, plead its darkness. The true cause of their
   non-proficiency is unbelief, they believe not; the superadded cause is
   spiritual blindness.

   Use 2. Exhortation to look after this light, without which we shall be
   in the dark as to comfort: Isa. l. 10, Who is among you that feareth
   the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in
   darkness, and seeth no light?' Either under actual horrors or
   doubtfulness and uncertainty. Every wicked man is troubled, as the
   leaves of the trees of the wood are shaken with the wind. Now who would
   live in such a condition, to be at the mercy of the tempter? You are in
   the dark as to duty; our own reason, the counsels and examples of
   others, will mislead us; and we shall be unsteady, carried away with
   every deceit of sin, at least unsatisfied whether in God's way or not:
   1 John ii. 11, He that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh
   in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness
   hath blinded his eyes.' Oh! study the word.

   But who have this light? He that heartily desireth knowledge: Prov. ii.
   3, If thou criest after wisdom, and liftest up thy voice for
   understanding;' he that diligently labours for it: Ps. i. 2, His
   delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day
   and night.' That propoundeth a right end, to be Christ's disciple, to
   do God's will: John vii. 17, If any man will do his will, he shall know
   of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.'
   That humbleth himself for his ignorance. John got open the book with
   weeping: Rev. v 5. And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not;
   behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath
   prevailed to open the book.' Those Bereans were pro'thumoi: Acts xvii.
   11, They received the word with all readiness of mind,' eupeithe`s;
   James iii. 17, Easy to be entreated.' The opposite on the one side is
   slowness of heart: Luke xxiv. 25, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
   all that the prophets have spoken!' Or obstinacy on the other, a
   sluggish easiness, when light of belief, to believe anything without
   searching into the reason of it, or given up to a foolish credulity:
   Eph. iv. 14, That ye be not as children, tossed to and fro. and carried
   about with every wind of doctrine and cunning craftiness, whereby they
   lie in wait to deceive;' like a reed shaken with every wind. But he
   that is endued with this light is one that doth not depend on his own
   wit, but submits his reason to God: Prov. iii. 5, 6, Trust in the Lord
   with all thine heart; and lean not to thine own understanding. In all
   thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.' Well, then,
   this earnest desire in the next verse, I opened my mouth and panted: I
   longed for thy commandments.' This painful seeker will find out this
   treasure; this humble trusting soul will have it.

   Doct. 3. That the scriptures are written so that plain and private men
   may get this light and spiritual understanding by them: Ps. xix. 7, The
   law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the
   Lord is sure, making wise the simple.'

   1. From the author, God, who is the fountain of light; and surely he
   was able and willing conveniently to express his mind to his creatures.
   Cannot God speak plainly? Deus et mentis, et linguae, et vocis artifex,
   as Lactantius calleth him. He that is so wise, so loving of mankind,
   our supreme judge and king, would he hide this light under a bushel?
   Would he conceal his mind, and leave thee in the dark? Micah vi. 8, He
   hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord thy God
   require of thee, but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly
   with thy God?'

   2. For whom the scriptures were written; not for ministers or professed
   students. God speaketh to all sorts of men in the scripture, and
   therefore would have all understand them. He wrote the scripture that
   it might be read of all, young and old: Deut. xxx. 11, 12, This
   commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee,
   neither is it far off: it is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say,
   Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear
   it and do it,' &c. Rich and poor; the king was to read in it all the
   days of his life: Deut. xvii. 18, 19, It shall be that when he sitteth
   upon the throne of his kingdom, he shall write him a copy in a book out
   of that which is before the priests the Levites: and it shall be with
   him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life.' Every good
   man is to meditate in it: Ps. i. 2, His delight is in the law of the
   Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night;' Deut. vi. 6, 7,
   These words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart: and
   thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of
   them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way,
   and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.' The apostles wrote
   epistles to the whole church, spake to old men, youth, little children:
   1 John ii. 13, I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him
   that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye
   have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children,
   because ye have known the Father.' To kings, judges, men, women,
   husbands, wives, fathers, children, masters, servants, was it written
   for their use; nor must it be taken out of their hands, nor is it above
   their reach.

   3. The end why it was written, to be a sure and infallible direction to
   guide us to eternal life, and make us wise unto salvation: 2 Tim. iii.
   15, And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which
   are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in
   Christ Jesus.' Not only so, but it is our food and means of growth: 1
   Peter ii. 2, As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word,
   that ye may grow thereby.' Every life hath food convenient for it. It
   is our weapon in temptation: Eph. vi. 17, And take the helmet of
   salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.' To
   be read by all in this spiritual warfare they are all engaged in. It is
   God's testament, therefore should be viewed by his children; the
   epistle of the creator to his creatures, therefore to be read by them
   to whom it is sent. God's letter must not be intercepted upon all these
   reasons. There is enough to make wise the simple in scriptures.

   But is there nothing difficult in scriptures? Ans. Yes, to subdue the
   pride of man's wit, to quicken us to wait and depend upon him for
   knowledge, to prevent contempt, to exercise our industry and diligence,
   and to fasten truths on our minds. There is some difficulty, but not
   such difficulty as that the people neither can nor ought to read them
   with profit, which is the dispute between us and papists. There is no
   difficulty but what is conquerable by that grace that God ordinarily
   dispenseth, and the means of explaining or applying; not a whole loaf,
   but a dimensum, his share; for it distributes to every man his portion.

   Use 1. For the confutation of them that forbid the simple use of the
   word. The papists say, God's word is dark and hard to be understood;
   therefore they lock it up from the people in an unknown tongue, as if
   none could profit by it but the learned sort. Yea, many among us are
   ready to say, What should simple men do with scripture? and think that
   all the confusions and troubles of the world come from giving people
   this liberty. Ans. Though in the word there are mysteries to exercise
   the greatest wits, yet there are plain truths to edify the simple. This
   text is a notable proof against them. It is good to have a text against
   every error of theirs. They are injurious to God; as if he had revealed
   his mind so darkly, or his word, that it were so doubtful and harmful
   that there were danger in reading it: injurious to the scriptures,
   while they tax them with obscurity; injurious to the people of God,
   while they despise those whom the Lord inviteth with their pharisaical
   pride: John vii. 49, But this people who know not the law are cursed;'
   hinder them of their comfort; the simple have souls to save, therefore
   have need to see with their own eyes, to consider God's charter. They
   pretend they do it in mercy to the people, lest by their mistakes they
   should ruin themselves, and introduce confusion into the world. They
   should as well say all must be starved, and deny meat and drink because
   some surfeit. But certainly they do it for their own interest; they
   have false wares to vend, and to keep the people from discovering the
   errors they impose upon them, they would conceal the scriptures from
   them. Ignorance is a friend to the devil's kingdom. The blind go as
   they are led. They are afraid of the scriptures as a thief of a candle
   or the light which would discover his villany and hinder his design,
   John iii. 20.

   Use 2. Of encouragement to poor Christians that have a sense of
   weakness. Before Plato's school was written, Let none but the learned
   come in hither;' but Christ inviteth the simple. That none might be
   discouraged, he speaketh to all sorts: Prov. viii. 4, 5, Unto you, O
   men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men: O ye simple,
   understand wisdom; and ye fools, be of an understanding heart.' That
   which is spoken to all is thought to be spoken for none. Christ
   speaketh to men under their several distinctions, noble, base, young or
   old, rich or poor. If any earthly profit be offered to any that will
   take it, who will exempt themselves? None are so modest. But in
   spiritual things persons are more stupid. Let none be discouraged by
   weakness of parts; all are invited to learn, and here they may be
   taught, of any capacity. Oh! but how many will say, I am so weak of
   understanding, that I shall make no work of such deep mysteries as are
   contained in the scriptures. I answer--

   1. Many times this objection cometh from a sluggish heart; to ease
   themselves of the trouble of a duty, as meditation or prayer, they
   pretend weakness, they would have a rule that would make knowledge.

   2. If it be serious, God is able to interpret his own book unto thee.
   He must indeed open the door, or we cannot get into the knowledge of
   truths there. If you had better parts you would be but groping about
   the door. He that hath not the right key is as far from entering the
   house as he that hath none. If the Spirit of God be thy master, thou
   shalt learn, though never. so blockish.

   3. Wisdom stands upon the threshold, or at the door of God's word, as
   ready to open the treasures of knowledge: The entrance of thy word
   giveth light.' No sooner is a soul entered into the Spirit's school but
   he becometh a proficient; on first acquaintance with scriptures he
   seeth great light. Yea, she sendeth abroad to invite comers: Prov. ix.
   3-5, She hath sent forth her maidens, she crieth upon the highest
   places of the city, Whoso is simple let him come in hither: as for him
   that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, Come eat of my bread, and
   drink of the wine which I have mingled.' Therefore go on with thy duty.
   He that sent an interpreter to the eunuch to guide him, when reading
   part of Isaiah's prophecy which he understood not, will direct and
   guide thee in the knowledge of all necessary truths, Ps. xxv. 8, 9;
   Prov. ii. 2-5.

   4. It is a good advantage to be sensible of our blindness: Rev. iii.
   17, 18, Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
   stand in need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
   miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me
   gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment,
   that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not
   appear; and anoint thee thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see.'
   The first thing a man seeth is his own blindness, nakedness, and
   wretchedness: John ix. 39, And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into
   the world, that they which see not might see, and that they which see
   might be made blind.' Many times they which conceitedly think they see
   are made blind. Those that are ignorant and humbled under the sense
   thereof, Christ will open their eyes; but they that are conceited of
   their own parts and knowledge, their hearts are darkened more and more,
   and they are given up to follow their own fancies. The simple may see
   further than others, because they swell not with the presumption of
   their own wit. Surgunt indocti, et rapiunt coelum, cum nos doctrma
   nostra detrudimur in gehennam. Sometimes simple people are more forward
   and earnest than others, and men of weak parts and small breeding may
   have strong affections. A blunt iron, when heated, may enter deeper
   into a board than a sharp tool when cold. Great doctors and rabbis are
   proud and careless, and poor broken-hearted sinners are warm and
   serious. Your labour will not be in vain.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXLIV.

   I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.--Ver.
   131.

   HERE is the use that the Psalmist maketh of the former commendation of
   the word; it is wonderful and mysterious, clear and perspicuous; now he
   declareth his great affection to it. These words were used by Nazianzen
   when his father committed to him the care of the church of Nazianzum;
   he beginneth his speech with it, Orat. viii., as being a word of more
   than ordinary comfort and grace and direction. David was in a fainting
   condition through the passionateness of his desire, I longed;' and that
   longing caused a languor, as all strong desires do. His affection
   wrought upon his body, or else affected his soul, as bodily
   refreshments desired and wanted do the body, I opened my mouth, and
   panted: for I longed for thy commandments.' In the words there are--

   1. The vehemency of his passion, I opened my mouth, and panted.

   2. The reason or cause of it, for I longed for thy commandments.

   First, I opened my mouth, and panted;' a metaphor taken from men
   scorched and sweltered with heat, or from those that have run
   themselves out of breath in following after the thing which they would
   overtake. The former metaphor expressed the vehemency of his love, the
   other the earnestness of his pursuit; he was like a man gasping for
   breath and sucking in the cool air. Judea was a hot country, and
   therefore such expressions are frequent. The like expressions, that
   come somewhat near it, are those: 2 Cor. vi. 11, O ye Corinthians, our
   mouth is opened to you, our heart is enlarged;' when he did vehemently
   desire their profit. And Job saith, They waited for my speech as the
   rain; they opened their mouth wide, as for the latter rain,' Job xxix.
   22. A vehement, passionate desire affects the mind as an insatiate
   thirst the body. Thus will they be affected that are sensible of the
   wonders of the law, and enlightened by it. The reason of this passion:
   I longed,' noteth a high degree of desire. What did he long for? God's
   commandments; that is, the saving knowledge of the doctrine of
   salvation, or to find the use, benefit, light, comfort, and power of
   the word of God.

   Doct. That God's children have strong and vehement affections and
   desires after the comfort and benefit of the word of God.

   Here is--(1.) Opening the mouth; and (2.) Panting, as for fresh air;
   and (3.) Longing for the commandments. All three expressions imply an
   intensiveness of affection. Surely David prized holiness at a greater
   rate than we do, or else he would not use expressions so strange to us!
   See the like, Ps. cxix. 20, My soul breaketh for the longing it hath
   unto thy judgments at all times.' Desire is the stretching forth of the
   soul to the thing desired. Now his soul did so stretch towards these
   spiritual comforts, that it did even break and crack again in the
   stretching. So Ps. xlii. 1, As the hart panteth after the water-brooks,
   so panteth my soul after thee, O God.' Harts are thirsty creatures,
   especially when chased, or having eaten serpents.

   Considerations.

   1. The soul never worketh better than in the strength of some eminent
   affection. In all things that we take in hand we do but so-so, act but
   chilly and weakly, while we have a listless and remiss will; but when
   the force of affection is upon us, the soul is carried on strongly,
   either in abomination or prosecution; for affections are the forcible
   and vigorous motions of the will. Now the soul never doth well but
   under such an affection. Were it not for affections, our nature would
   be sluggish and idle; as Plutarch, o'sper kuberne''tes pneu'matos
   ekli'pontos, like a pilot at sea without a wind. The ship moveth slowly
   when there are no winds stirring to fill the sails; or like a chariot
   without wheels or horses, or a bird when her wings are clipped. They
   spur us on to what we affect. Men are heavy and lazy because they have
   no affection: Exod. xxxvi. 2, And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab and
   every wise-hearted man, in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, even
   every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it.'
   Man findeth a force within himself, his heart maketh him willing; the
   stronger the affections, the better the man acteth, with greater
   strength and vivacity; for they are the vigorous motions of the will.

   [2.] Of all affections, desires are most earnest and vehement, for they
   are the vigorous bent of the heart to that which is good, the motion
   and endeavour of the soul after it. As to good, the will chooseth it,
   and the heart affects a union with it, or desires to obtain it. This
   affection of union, simply considered, is love, which is an inclination
   of the soul to good, it presseth the heart to it; but as it is an
   absent good, it is desire, which exciteth to pursue it earnestly.
   Desire doth all that is done in the world, for it lifteth up the soul
   to action, that we may possess those things that we desire; I desire
   it, and therefore I labour for it. Therefore the main thing that God
   craveth is the desire: Prov. xxiii. 26, My son, give me thy heart,'
   which is the soul of desires; and therefore the people of God plead
   their sincerity: Isa. xxvi. 8, 9, The desire of our soul is to thy
   name, and to the remembrance of thee; with my soul have I desired thee
   in the night, yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early.'
   Get but a desire to good things, to God, to his word, and it will be a
   great help to you in spiritual things: Prov. xi. 23, The, desire of the
   righteous is only good.' It is well when the soul is set right; this is
   a strong, active, commanding faculty.

   3. Of all desires, those which carry us out to holy things should bear
   sway, and be the greatest; for affections are not rationally exercised
   unless they bear proportion to the objects they are conversant about.
   Now the word and things contained therein are the most noble objects,
   and so most suitable for our desires, if we would act ration ally. That
   appears upon these accounts:--

   [1.] Spiritual things are more noble; partly because they concern the
   soul, whereas carnal things concern only the outward man. Our liveliest
   affections should be exercised about the weightiest things. Can we
   desire riches and honours and pleasures, which only concern the body,
   and shall we not desire comforts and graces, which are necessary for
   the soul? It is irrational, for by this means we grow brutish and
   sensual. If our appetite desire only food and good pastures, and
   propagation of our kind, these desires soon exceed, and grow
   tempestuous and hurtful to the soul: Rom. xiii. 14, Make not provision
   for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.' There is a lawful care for
   the body, but this desire should not be chief, because the body is not
   the chief part of a man: Mat. vi. 33, Seek ye first the kingdom of God
   and the righteousness thereof, and all these things shall be added unto
   you.' The ennobling of the soul with grace, the settling of our
   conscience, the assuring of our everlasting estate, these things
   deserve our chiefest care. Partly because these things are only useful
   to us in our passage, and so for a time; they are not useful to us in
   our home, and so for ever: Deut. xxiii. 24, When thou comest into thy
   neighbour's vineyard, thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own
   pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.' We have these
   things for our use when here, but we carry nothing with us when we go
   hence. They who did occasionally pass through their neighbour's
   vineyard, might take for their necessity, but they must carry none
   home; and therefore as to these things all our acts must be non-acts: 1
   Cor. vii. 30, 31, Rejoice as if we rejoiced not,' desire as if we
   desired not. Affections here need a great deal of guiding, and a great
   deal of curbing, lest we sin in these less noble things; but in
   spiritual, heavenly things we can never do enough.

   [2.] Common and ordinary affection will not become God, or any thing
   that cometh from God, or concerneth our enjoyment of him, or our
   communion with him. Surely we are to love the Lord our God with all our
   hearts, and with all our might, and with all our souls,' Deut. vi. 5.
   And as we are to love God, so in proportion his word, which is the
   means to enjoy him; therefore here we should stretch our desire to the
   utmost.

   [3.] An earnest bent will only do us good, and make us hold out in the
   pursuit of heavenly wisdom. It doth us good for the present., as it
   fits us to improve the word, as an appetite to our food. To eat with a
   stomach maketh way for digestion: 1 Peter ii. 2, As new-born babes
   desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.' And it
   is zeal will only bear us out. Besides the difficulties and oppositions
   from without, our hearts are full of contrary qualities and desires,
   The flesh lusteth against the spirit;' so that nothing but a strong
   affection is for our turn. The greatest vehemency is but enough to bear
   us up in the prosecution of what is good; a weak desire will be soon
   chilled. Herod had some good desire; so have many, but not strong
   desires. He that affects grace, should affect nothing so much as grace.
   A carnal man may be affected with what is good, but there is something
   that he affects more, vanities, profits, pleasures. Well, then,
   spiritual desires should be drawn out to the utmost, because the object
   is more noble. These desires cannot degenerate, nor this affection be
   corrupted, and a common and ordinary affection doth not become these
   things. Nothing else will serve the turn.

   [4.] Wherever these desires bear sway it will be sensibly discovered by
   the effects, both to ourselves and others. A man may have a little joy,
   or a little grief, or a little anger, and nobody see it; but none of
   these affections can be in any strength and vigour but we shall feel it
   and others will observe it; for strong affections cannot be hid. Can a
   man carry fire in his bosom and hide it? So there will be some
   expression of what thy heart affects. Can a man be under terrors, and
   not show it in his face? A concealed affection is no affection. Men may
   hide their hatred, but cannot hide their love: Prov. xxvii. 5, Open
   rebuke is better than secret love.' These things tie body and soul
   together, move the spirits. So desire will show itself, yea, spiritual
   desire. What desire doth in other things, it will do in this. If there
   be longing, there will be fainting, gaping, breathing; for strong
   desires are hasty and impatient of satisfaction. Ahab's eager desire of
   Naboth's vineyard cast him upon his bed. The spouse was sick of love:
   Cant. v. 8, I charge ye, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my
   beloved, that ye tell him that I am sick of love.' What! desire, and
   nobody see it? What! desire, and you never feel such a strong urging
   affection? Surely there will be secret, deep, and frequent sighs, there
   will be a striving with God in prayer, and constant attendance upon
   God. Such an active affection cannot be hid. Most men desire so little,
   it cannot be known whether it be desire or no.

   [5.] God's children have these desires, because they see more in the
   word than others do or can do. Spiritual discerning is a help to
   spiritual affections. They whose eyes are anointed with spiritual
   eyesalve see wonders in the law, and so are wondrously affected with
   them. But why should God's children see more?

   (1.) They look through the spectacles of faith, they believe the
   commands to be the commands of the great God, the promises to be the
   promises of God, and therefore as good as performance; and so what to
   others seem fancies and fine dreams, to them are the chiefest
   realities: Heb. xi. 13, These all died in faith, not having received
   the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of
   them, and embraced them.' Who would, having the promises, be so
   strangely transported, but they that are strongly persuaded? Faith,
   that looketh upon the things promised as sure and near, maketh them
   more active and lively. They that have not faith, or do not exercise
   faith, have but cold affections; but they who believe these wonderful
   felicities which the word of God speaketh of, long to enjoy what they
   are sure is true.

   (2.) They look into it with an eye of love, and love sets a price on
   things: they see more of the loveliness of spiritual things than others
   do. Men's affections are according to the constitution of their souls,
   or the end they propound to themselves. They that are carnally disposed
   know all things after the flesh, and value them by the interests of the
   flesh, as that is gratified; and they that are spiritually disposed are
   affected accordingly as men's genius lieth. And that is the reason why
   eminent grace hath strong affections, which carnal men are not
   competent judges of. It seemeth improbable to them that a man should
   have such fervent desires of holiness, and be able to speak thus to
   God, I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.'
   The constitution of their souls is quite otherwise, and their hearts
   hang world-ward; they have not such a sense of their duty, and do not
   make it their business to please God; and so, having no deep sense and
   conscience of their duty, they do not see such a need of the word as
   their guide and help. They have no love to these things, therefore no
   passionate desire; for this is the order--the will chooseth, love
   desireth the union, desire presseth to endeavours after it. But now a
   godly man, that maketh it his business to please God, the principal
   desire and choice of his will is to be what God would have him to be,
   and to do what God would have him to do.

   (3.) Because they have experience. Two things quicken our affection to
   anything that is good, viz., the knowledge of the worth and use of
   things, and our want of them. And the children of God know both of
   these by experience, in the course of that life wherein they are
   engaged; and nothing is known so intimately and pressingly as what is
   known by experience. By experience they see the want of the word of
   God, and its comforts and helps; not only when God first touched their
   hearts with care of saving their souls, and they were humble, and
   parched with a sense of sin and wrath; all things were then unsavoury,
   as the white of an egg; then they longed, they panted for one
   comfortable word from God, one passage of scripture to give them ease;
   and the word becometh as necessary as meat to the hungry, and drink to
   the thirsty, and cool air to the weary: Mat. xi. 28, Come unto me, all
   ye that are weary and heavy laden, and ye shall find rest to your
   souls.' But still they are sensible of their spiritual necessities, so
   as they cannot breathe without it, nor thrive without it, they find
   such a necessity of it. It is the food of their souls, the seed and
   principle of their being, the rule of their lives, the means of their
   growth, the charter of their hopes, their defence and strength in
   temptations and assaults. Christ himself guarded himself with the word
   when he was assaulted. Now, being practically convinced of this, they
   must needs have vehement longings after it; and after a more full
   understanding of it, they find by experience that the soul is apt to
   faint as well as the body: Heb. xii. 3, Lest ye be weary, and faint in
   your minds;' and that in all these things nothing relieveth them but
   the comfort and direction God giveth them in his word.

   [6.] The more godly any are, the more they feel these strong
   affections. All that have life, their pulses do not beat alike
   strongly; some are weak, others more robust. So it is in grace; some
   have larger souls than others, and so, as they are more in action for
   God, they must have more supplies, and a greater measure of spirit and
   grace; these long and pant. In others there is a greater sluggishness
   and narrowness of mind, and they rest satisfied with what they have,
   their spiritual affections are not so raised; and therefore every one
   that is godly is not acquainted with this panting and breathing and
   longing; they have so much appetite as is necessary to maintain the new
   creature, but not these enlarged desires. I confess you are to judge by
   your willingness rather than the passionate stirrings of your
   affections. It is the heart which God requireth, and if he hath the
   will he hath the heart. But yet affectionate workings of the soul
   towards spiritual and heavenly things are very sweet, and such as all
   Christians should strive for, but not the best marks by which to judge
   of our estate. There may be a solid and sincere intention and choice,
   when there is little stirring perceived in the affections. If the will
   be fixedly set for God, the man is upright. Yet you are to endeavour to
   raise your affections to that height which is suitable to the
   excellency of the object; especially when it is movingly represented to
   us, our desires should be upon the wing. It is a duty; as far as we can
   reach it, we should. The more the soul is refined from the dregs of
   carnal longings and worldly lusts, the more are they enlarged towards
   God; and as their passionate desires of earthly things are abated, so
   their spiritual desires are enlarged. David saith, Ps. cxix. 36,
   Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.' And
   the apostle, Col. iii. 2, Set your affections on things above, and not
   on things on earth.' The more the heart is given to the one, the more
   it is taken off from the other. Riches, honours, and pleasures, as
   these are loved, they hinder this noble working of the soul, this
   breaking, longing, panting for better things. Worldly things have a
   great ad vantage over our affections, because they are sensible and
   near us, and our knowledge of them is clear, and by the senses obtrude
   and thrust themselves upon the soul. Therefore use them with a guard
   and restraint.

   [7.] Though this desire should always continue in some degree, yet
   there are some seasons when it is more vehement, and more notably
   stirred and raised. In some degree it should always continue, for our
   necessities and work are ever the same; and if it be only a qualm or
   fit, it is not right: Ps. cxix. 20, My soul breaketh for the longing it
   hath unto thy judgments at all times.' Appetite followeth life; but at
   special times it is more notably raised, as when we are to meet with
   God in solemn duties; it is whetted when disappointed, and stirred upon
   some restraint or delay, when we meet not with what we expected, that
   light and comfort and strength that we looked for, but are kept off
   from satisfaction. When some deep distress makes spiritual comforts
   more seasonable, or in some great affair or temptation, we need more
   than ordinary strength, or in some doubt we need light and direction;
   in all these cases, spiritual desire is more stirring, and a strong
   affection is kindled in us. David panted as an hart: Ps. xlii. 1, As
   the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee,
   O God.' It was when he was in some distress. So Ps. lxiii. 1, O God,
   thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my
   flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is.'
   Oh! the sighs and groans that are sent up at such a time! Troubles will
   sharpen our appetite and rouse us out of security. We cannot always
   subsist under strong affections; they are very mutable, yet something
   of them should continue.

   Use 1. For reproof.

   1. Many are acquainted with the passionateness of sin, but know little
   of the passionateness of spiritual desire: 1 Thes. iv. 5, me` en
   pa'thei epithumi'as, not in the lust of concupiscence.' Some think it
   should rather be rendered thus, Not in the passion of lust. Many times
   lust groweth to violence, men neigh like fed horses after their
   neighbours' wives; they feel an ardency and a burning heat in their
   evil passions and lusts, but none of this gasping and panting for
   spiritual refreshings and the comforts of the soul. They are acquainted
   with passionate wrath and fury, passionate envy and spitefulness,
   passionate lust and filthy desires, passionate covetousness, as Ahab
   after Naboth's vineyard; the boilings of sin they know, but were never
   acquainted with these gaspings after grace, as Amnon lusted for Tamar:
   Rom. i. 27, They burned in lust one towards another.' When any sin
   groweth so headstrong as to admit of no restraint, but men are wedded
   to their own inclination, that is the passionateness of sin.

   2. Some that have affectionate desires for worldly things, and their
   souls are pained and grieved, and are sick within them if they have
   them not. These differ from the former, for there the object was
   sinful, but here the object is lawful, but the desire is irregular;
   they are sick of pleasures, their hearts run on them, and they cannot
   refrain: As the fool's heart is in the house of mirth,' Eccles. vii. 4.
   All their longings are for balls and dancings and plays and merry
   meetings; these are suitable entertainments to the hearts of fools,
   vain and sottish epicures, that know no higher delights than the
   tickling of the senses; their love runneth that way, and their hearts
   are wholly estranged from God. So some sick of riches and wealth, they
   gape and gasp for them with an impatient longing: 1 Tim. vi. 9, They
   that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
   foolish and hurtful lusts, that drown men in destruction and
   perdition.' The more they have, the more they covet, as the laying on
   of more fuel increaseth the flame; they are impatient, making haste to
   be rich, run themselves, yea, their consciences, out of breath, to
   overtake the prey. The world is their element, out of which they cannot
   live, but spend their time, wit, strength of their souls upon it. They
   are sick for honour, credit, esteem; as Mordecai's stiff knee cast
   Haman upon his bed: Esther iii. 5, And when Haman saw that Mordecai
   bowed not the knee, nor gave him reverence, then was Haman full of
   wrath;' chap. vi. 12, Mordecai came again to the king's gate, but Haman
   hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. How do men
   tire their spirits, waste their strength, to compass honour and esteem
   in the world! and if they find it not, how are they troubled! Ambition
   is a restless thing; how doth Absalom court the people, sick for rule
   and government!

   3. It reproveth them that have only a cold approbation, but no earnest
   affection to the things of God. Oh, how this instance should shame us
   that we have no more affection! David speaketh of longing and panting;
   we thirst not, we pant not; their fervency reproveth our lukewarmness,
   we are indifferent whether we have this light, comfort, and grace, yea
   or no. God's children thirst for it as dry ground for rain. We have
   some loose and straggling thoughts about holy things, or weak and
   ineffectual glances of device, some lukewarm motions; but for these
   strong affections, admire them we may, feel them we do not. Wicked men
   may have slight apprehensions of spiritual things, which may produce
   some slight desires and wishes, which yet are so feeble and weak that
   every carnal desire overcometh them.

   Use 2. Information why the people of God press through so many
   difficulties to enjoy his word. They are urged and pricked on by a
   strong desire; they would fain enjoy more of God, and therefore press
   after the means, where it is most clearly and powerfully revealed: John
   xi. 12, From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of
   heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.' Where the
   gates of heaven stand open they will break through hindrances to get
   in.

   Use 3. It should quicken our dulness, and exhort us to get this
   affection. If the heart were as it should be, a little bidding would
   serve the turn.

   1. These good desires discover a good frame, for a man is as his
   desires are. Such motions, when they are in their strength and
   liveliness, are signs of heroical grace, when your hearts are sick of
   love; yea, in a more temperate degree, where there are strong and
   prevailing desires, they show truth of grace, where there is such an
   affection as is industrious and unwearied, and keepeth us hard at work:
   Acts xxvi. 7, Unto which promise the twelve tribes, instantly serving
   God day and night, hope to come.' Such an affection as is troubled when
   we are interrupted in our main design of bringing the heart into
   complete subjection to God, or being capable of the fruition of him:
   Prov. xiii. 12, Hope deferred maketh the heart sick, but when the
   desire cometh it is a tree of life.' If you come for grace, and are
   troubled and grieved when you are interrupted, if you are refreshed
   when you have tasted anything of God's graciousness, any increase of
   light and grace is as welcome to you as bodily refreshment to a weary,
   panting traveller, or water to one that is in a great thirst; this is
   that the heart mindeth most, studieth most, remembereth most, that you
   never have enough of it, and are longing for more; if there be such an
   affection, it is a good sign, for sensitive stirring is not so great an
   evidence as a settled constitution of spirit.

   2. These holy desires, as they have something of burthen, so some thing
   of pleasure in them. Though the absence of the thing desired be a
   trouble, yet the exercise of holy desire is a pleasure to us, because
   it is an act of love; the more our hearts are enlarged in them, the
   greater it is, even before satisfaction. While we are hungering and
   thirsting we are blessed. It is a blessed thing to be a desirer: Mat.
   v. 6, Blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for
   they shall be filled.'

   3. This is a desire which God will satisfy: Ps. lxxxi. 10, Open thy
   mouth wide, and I will fill it;' Isa. xliv. 3, I will pour water upon
   him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.' This insatiate
   thirst of grace and comfort shall be satisfied: John vii. 37, 38, In
   the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
   saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that
   believeth on me, as the scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow
   rivers of living water.' The soul is prepared by it for fruition: Isa.
   lv. 1, Ho every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that
   hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk
   without money and without price.'

   If we would get it--(1.) We must get a new heart, which is the soul of
   these desires, and is God's promised gift in the covenant: Ezek. xxxvi.
   26, A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
   you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will
   give you a heart of flesh.' (2.) Mortify and mode rate your affections
   to the world and worldly things, and meddle sparingly with the comforts
   thereof; otherwise your hearts will be apt immoderately to leak out
   after them, to the interruption of the spiritual life.

SERMON CXLV.

   Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto
   those that love thy name.--Ver. 132.

   THE prophet having praised the word, and expressed his affection to it,
   presents his petition to God for a favourable look from him, upon the
   account of his grace and mercy, according to the manner and law of his
   dispensations towards others of his people. They that love the word may
   with the like confidence expect the grace of God. Observe in the
   words--

   1. The petition or favour asked, look thou upon me.

   2. The ground of asking, or the cause of that favour, and be merciful
   unto me.

   3. The terms according to which it is dispensed, as thou usest to do,
   secundum judicium, according to the law, or according to thy custom
   towards those that love thy name.

   4. The description of God's people; they love his name.

   These are the especial objects of grace and favour. I shall explain the
   words as I go over the several branches.

   First, I begin with the petition, Look thou upon me.' The Septuagint
   reads it, epi'blepe epi` e7me'. Other translations, aspice me, or
   respice me. Ainsworth, Turn thy face unto me: Ps. xxvi. 16, Turn thou
   unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.' God
   seemeth now and then to turn away from his people in their distresses,
   to turn the back upon them, and not the face; as it is, Jer. xviii. 17,
   I will scatter them as with an east-wind before the enemy; I will show
   them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.' They
   had dealt so first with God: Jer. ii. 17, Hast thou not procured this
   unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God when he led
   thee by the way?' So David, God might have seemed to have turned the
   back upon him. Our translation cometh to the same effect, Look upon
   me.' God's looking implieth two things, viz., his favour and his
   providence.

   1. His favour; as Isa. lxvi. 2, To this man will I look, that is of a
   contrite heart;' that is, I will be gracious unto him, smile upon him,
   give him evidences of my love.

   2. His providence. The providence of God is usually set forth by his
   eye: Prov. xii. 3, The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding
   the evil and the good.' Now God hath a double eye--an avenging eye and
   a gracious eye. The avenging eye: Amos ix. 4, I will set mine eyes upon
   them for evil, and not for good.' The other: 2 Chron. xvi. 9, The eyes
   of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself
   strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him.'
   Accordingly this act of looking is either--

   [1.] With a revengeful eye. So upon their enemies: 1 Chron. xii. 17,
   The God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it;' 2 Chron. xxiv. 22,
   The Lord look thereon, and requite it,' said Zachary the son of
   Jehoiadah the priest. This is the look of anger. But--

   [2.] There is the look of love and benign aspect, as astrologers speak.
   So Exod. iii. 7, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which
   are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters,
   for I know their sorrows;' and Lam. iii. 50, Till the Lord look down
   and behold from heaven.' So doth he beg here that God would look upon
   him with a gracious eye. In this gracious aspect two things are
   notable, viz., his observation and his compassion.

   (1.) His observation. He taketh notice of their condition and oppressed
   innocency: Neh. i. 6, Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes
   open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray
   before thee now day and night.' What have eyes to do with hearing? To
   behold their pitiful and desolate condition. So 2 Sam. xvi. 12, It may
   be that the Lord will look upon mine affliction, and that the Lord will
   requite me good for his cursing this day.'

   (2.) His compassion. God doth take to heart the distresses of his
   people, and hath a tender pity and compassion over them: Ps. xxv. 18,
   Look upon mine affliction, and my pain.' He doth not only take notice
   of, but take to heart their sorrows, as appeareth by some gracious
   effect and deliverance wrought for them. So looking implieth both his
   affection and actual providence for them.

   Doct. The children of God apprehend it as a great favour if he will but
   look upon them.

   So saith David, Look thou upon me.' Which request expresseth his
   modesty; one short glimpse of God's favour, a look of kindness, would
   be a great matter to him in this vale of tears. A look is welcome to a
   broken and contrite heart; they are thankfully affected with the least
   discoveries and manifestations of God's love to the soul. If they could
   have but the least glimpse of his love, it would be very reviving: Ps.
   lxxxvi. 17, Show me a token for good.' The returning prodigal could go
   no higher than, Make me as one of thy hired servants,' Luke xv. 19, any
   place in the family, so he might be no more absent from his father.
   God's people would have a nail in his holy place. This shows--

   1. His necessity. God seemed to look from him, no sign of his favour
   appeared. Thus it is often with God's children here in the world; the
   sense of his love is gone and lost, we sometimes have not so much as a
   look from him: Isa. lix. 2, Your sins have hid his face from you.' In
   heaven our communion is more full, and it is uninterrupted: 1 Cor.
   xiii. 12, For now we see through a glass darkly, then face to face.'
   Here God often hideth his face, and we walk in darkness, and see no
   light;' Ps. civ. 29, Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou
   takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.'

   2. His value and esteem of God's, favour: Ps. iv. 6, 7, There be many
   that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of
   thy countenance upon us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than
   in the time that their corn and their wine increased.' Esteem of
   spiritual privileges is a great means to continue them to us. We feel
   no more of God's love, because we are not thankful for the enjoyment of
   it. It must be a practical esteem, such as moveth us to seek it
   earnestly, as David professeth here it would satisfy him if God would
   look upon him. We count ourselves most miserable in the want of it; but
   if we have it, it allayeth all worldly discontents, abateth our desires
   of worldly comforts.

   3. His confidence. One look from God is enough, it is all he beggeth;
   as the saints in like cases, if their God would but look upon them:
   Deut. xxvi. 15, Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and
   bless thy people Israel.' So Isa. lxiii. 15, Look down from heaven, and
   behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory.' Without
   any labour, only by this look thou canst help all our evils; and will
   not God cast a look upon us, especially when we call him by his name?

   Reason 1. Because in our distresses the main thing we should look on is
   not so much, the removal of God's anger, and the removal of the evil,
   as the renewed sense of his love, to be reconciled to them: 2 Chron.
   vii. 14, If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
   themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wickedness,
   then will I hear from heaven, and forgive their sins, and will heal
   their land.' It is a part of the prescribed remedy to seek the face of
   God, or a favourable look from him; that is put in among the
   conditions, otherwise we are not affected with our true misery, and the
   cause of all our trouble, though we may seriously enough desire to be
   rid of the trouble, or the effects and the strokes of God's anger. The
   brute creatures can feel pain as well as we, and howl when they find
   anything inconvenient to that nature which they have, as well as we cry
   to God: Hosea vii. 14, And they have not cried unto me with their
   hearts, when they howled upon their beds.' God accounts it as howling
   when we do not seek God's favour and grace, as well as the supply of
   our outward necessities. It is an easy matter to be sensible of the
   evil of trouble; nature will teach us that.

   2. Because that bringeth other things along with it. If God look upon
   us he will help us; his love and power are set a-work for us, for his
   eye affecteth his heart. When his heart is affected, he will stir up
   his strength, and come and save us.' So that, go to the fountainhead of
   all mercies, when you beg a favour, look for it from God, for God's
   favour is the fountain of all blessings, and without it all your other
   comforts will do you no good: Ps. lxxx. 19, Turn us again, O Lord of
   hosts; cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.' When God once
   showeth the evidences of his favour and reconciliation to them, other
   mercies come of their own accord. Oh! then, be assured of the favour of
   God.

   3. If we continue in our misery, a look from God will sweeten all: We
   glory in tribulation also, because of the love of God shed abroad in
   our hearts, by his Spirit given to us,' Rom. v. 3-5. To be in favour
   with God is enough, and sweetens the bitterest of all our troubles. The
   comfort of the creature may be supplied with this greater comfort, that
   if affliction be not removed, it is made light to us.

   Use 1. Beg earnestly for God's look. It is an ill sign to be careless
   and regardless of it. Surely the heart is too much carried to earthly
   comforts, if you care not how God standeth affected to you. God deliver
   us from such a sottish spirit, that we should neither care for God's
   frowns nor smiles, nor be sensible of his coming and going. David said,
   Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord,' Ps. xxv. 15, to observe him and
   his postures; but most men, their eyes are ever towards temporal
   accidents, how the times smile or frown upon them; or if they think of
   God, they judge of his respect to them by outward things, but have not
   any regard to his favour, whether God be reconciled to them or angry
   with them.

   2. Improve it to hope: Ps. lxxx. 14, Return, we beseech thee, O God of
   hosts, look down from heaven, and behold and visit this vine.' Will God
   love his people, and take notice of their sorrows, and not help them?
   God will manifest his respects and kindness to his people by some
   visible deliverance, when it shall be good for them.

   3. Be such as God will regard, and have an eye unto. Such are--

   [1.] The broken-hearted, that have a tender conscience, affected deeply
   with what the word speaketh concerning their everlasting condition:
   Isa. lxvi. 2, To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of
   a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.' The word of God passeth
   sentence upon men; most regard it not. Now whilst they look not after
   God, they have no promise God will look after them. Indeed by his
   preventing grace he is found of them that look not for him; but then
   before they have any smiles from God's countenance, they are first
   humbled and brought to trouble: Isa. lvii. 15-18, For thus saith the
   high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy, I
   dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite
   and humble spirit, to revive the spirits of the humble, and to -revive
   the heart of the contrite ones. For I will not contend for ever,
   neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit should fail before me,
   and the souls which I have made. For the iniquity of his covetousness I
   was wroth, and smote him, I hid me and was wroth; he went on frowardly
   in the way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him; I
   will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him.' When the spirit is
   softened by a deep and serious remorse for sin, and a tender sense of
   their condition, with these will God dwell, to comfort, relieve,
   restore them.

   [2.] The believer: Ps. xxxiii. 18, Behold the eye of the Lord is upon
   them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.' They that look
   for God shall find him.

   [3.] The sincere: Ps. xi. 7, His countenance doth behold the upright.'
   He hath a singular care of them, to manifest his love to them, both
   inwardly and outwardly. A good conscience presents itself to God; none
   but such will say. Look upon me. Adam hid himself upon his
   transgression. Hypocrites cannot trust him.

   [4.J Such as love his name. It is the description and mark of God's
   people in the text, they love God, and all that by which God is
   especially made known. To these God will look, that he may bless them,
   and comfort them with his love: Eph. vi. 24, Grace be with them that
   love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.' God's grace and free favour
   is to them: they love the name of God that rejoice to see God honoured,
   known, and had in request in the world, to be owned to be such as he is
   by themselves and others: Isa. xxvi. 8, The desire of our soul is to
   thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.' Their great desire is, that
   God may be exalted in their own hearts, and in the hearts of others. To
   these God will look, who take care to honour God, love Christ, and keep
   his commandments: John xiv. 21, He that hath my commandments and
   keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me, shall be
   loved of the Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to
   him.'

   Secondly, The ground and cause of that favour he expects, Be merciful
   unto me.' David begs what he begs upon terms of grace.

   Doct. God's mercy is the cause of all his favour to us, or gracious
   dealing with us.

   All that we have or would have cometh only and wholly from his mercy,
   and mere mercy. If God cast but a look upon us, or visit us with one
   glimpse of kindness, we can ascribe it to no other cause. Only mercy,
   and never a word of merit should be in the mouth of a believer.

   1. Because there was nothing in us to move him to be thus gracious to
   us: Gen. xxxii. 10, I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies,
   and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant.' Let us
   ask the reason, and debate the cause with ourselves. Why doth or should
   God do this for me? What moveth him? Is he necessitated? Then he could
   do no otherwise, and should be kind to all. Would he be unjust if he
   did not? Whereby have I obliged him? Who hath given to God first, and
   it shall be recompensed to him again?' Rom, xi. 35. Could you enter
   your action and plea against him? Before what bar and tribunal? And
   with what arguments will you manage your cause? How will the beam plead
   against the sun, the stream against the fountain? Is it a debt to your
   kind and rank of being? How many of the same flesh and blood are equal
   in nature, but unequal in condition? nay, in the same vicinity and
   neighbourhood, not only Americans, but of your own nation and country?
   What did God see more in you than in them of the same calling and
   profession? Two grinding at a mill, one shall be taken and the other
   left,' Luke xvii. 35. Of the same parentage? Was not Jacob Esau's
   brother?' Indeed, what did God see to move him to give you the first
   grace? Rom. ix. 16, So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him
   that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.'

   2. There is much to the contrary, a manifest unworthiness and contrary
   desert to what God bestoweth on us.

   [1.] A general unworthiness in all the sons of Adam. Man was left as a
   condemned malefactor in the hands of the law, without all hope and
   possibility of recovery, under sin: Rom. vii. 14, I am carnal, sold
   under sin.' Under a curse: Eph. ii. 3, We were by nature the children
   of wrath, even as others.' And that God should regard such!

   [2.] A particular unworthiness, before conversion and after.

   (1.) Before conversion: Titus iii. 3, For we ourselves also were
   sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and
   pleasures,' &c. We deserve to be abhorred and cast out of God's
   presence, and might justly expect his vengeance rather than his bounty
   and goodness, his anger and frowns rather than the light of his
   countenance.

   (2.) Since conversion: James iii. 2, In many things we offend all;'
   Eccles. vii. 20, There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good,
   and sinneth not.' There are mixtures of evil, imperfections of holy
   things. Well, then--

   1. Let mercy be all your plea when you have any favour to seek from
   God. We cannot claim any good upon any other right and title. Justice
   will except against you, and conscience will take its part. What have
   you to say but on that: Dan. ix. 18, We do not present our
   supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great
   mercies.' We have no other motive that will become God, nor bear weight
   in our own consciences, but only God hath set up a court where grace
   taketh the throne, and giveth out pardons and blessings to sinners.

   2. When you have once tasted one pledge of God's love vouchsafed to
   you, let this kindle coals in your bosoms, and warm your hearts with
   love to God. It is not only his condescension to take notice of you,
   but his mercy to show any favour and kindness to you: 2 Sam. vii. 19,
   Is this the manner of men, O Lord God?' Is this the manner of men, to
   requite good for evil? Who am I?

   3. Be contented with your measures. Where nothing is deserved, anything
   should be kindly taken. Grace communicateth itself to whom and in what
   measure it will: Mat. xx. 15, Is it not lawful for me to do what I will
   with mine own?' If we are kept under, and in great extremities, he
   might have dealt worse with us: Lam. iii. 22, It is of the Lord's
   mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.' If
   we had a price in our hands to procure better, we might complain. Now
   all is free and undeserved, we should admire and submit.

SERMON CXLVI.

   As thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.--Ver. 132.

   HERE you have--

   Thirdly, The terms of the dispensation, As thou usest to do unto those
   that love thy name.' The word is--

   1. According to the law and right.

   2. According to the use and custom, according to the mercy promised,
   and usually bestowed upon those that love thee. Both senses not
   improper.

   First, The first sense, according to the law and right. Prout est jus
   diligentium nomen tuum, so some. The vulgar, Secundum judicium.
   Amyraldus glosseth thus, Pro illa misericordia quam inter te et
   timentes nomen tuum constituisti. Others, Secundum jus, et foedus
   illud. Take it thus, and it beareth a good sense; for there is the
   obligation of justice, and the obligation of grace; a judgment of
   righteousness, and a judgment of mercy. This merciful judgment the
   saints appeal unto. I cannot exclude this; for otherwise this verse
   would not have one of those ten words which express the word or law of
   God.

   Doct. That there is a gracious way of right established between God and
   his people, according to which they may expect mercies.

   This will be best understood by comparing the two covenants, their
   agreement and disagreement, not in all things, but such as are
   pertinent.

   1. Let us see how the two covenants agree.

   [1.] They agree in their author. God appointed both, and man is y to
   accept or take hold of what is offered. Man was not thinking of any
   such thing when God instituted the first: Gen. ii. 17, But of the tree
   of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day
   thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die;' or revealed the second:
   Gen. iii. 15, It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
   heel.' For God to enter into a covenant with the creature, either of
   works or grace, was an act of condescension; and who is he that could
   bid the Almighty humble himself, and prescribe conditions and laws of
   commerce between God and us, but only God alone? Man did not give the
   conditions, or treat with God about the making of them, what they
   should be; but only was bound to submit to what God was pleased to
   prescribe. In the covenant of works God gave forth the conditions of
   life, and a law and a penalty; and in the covenant of grace, man is
   bound to submit to the conditions without disputing. They are not left
   free and indifferent for us to debate upon, and to modify, and bring
   them down to our own liking and humour; but to yield to them, and take
   hold upon them, not to appoint them: Isa. lvi. 4, Thus saith the Lord
   unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that
   please me, and take hold of my covenant;' Rom. x. 3, For they being
   ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own
   righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of
   God.'

   [2.] They agree in the moving cause, which in both was the grace of
   God. The first covenant, it was grace for God to make it. It was the
   grace of God to accept of man's perfect obedience, so as to make him
   sure of eternal life on the performance of it. Though the last covenant
   hath the honour by way of eminency to be styled the covenant of grace,
   yet the first was so, though the condition of it was perfect obedience,
   and the reward had respect to personal righteousness. It was of grace
   also that God would at all covenant and enter into bonds with man, who
   was not his equal, and give his word to any of the works of his hands.
   It was grace that endowed man with original righteousness, and fitted
   him, and enabled him to keep that covenant. His absolute sovereign owed
   him no more than the rest of the creatures which he had made. Grace
   engaged the reward, there was no more merit in Adam's obedience than in
   ours: Luke xvii. 10, So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those
   things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we
   have done that which was our duty to do.' Nor did his work bear
   proportion to the eternal reward.

   [3.] They agree in the parties, God and man in both covenants, not any
   other creatures superior or inferior to man, rational or irrational;
   the principal contracting parties were public persons, Adam, Jesus:
   Rom. v. 18, Therefore as by the offence of one man judgment came upon
   all to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift
   came upon all men unto justification of life;' 1 Cor. xv. 47, The first
   man is of the earth earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.'
   The first and second Adam, for them and all their heirs.

   [4.] That God giveth sufficiency of strength in both these covenants to
   the parties with whom he made them to fulfil the conditions thereof. To
   Adam: Eccles. vii. 29, Lo this only have I found, that God hath made
   man upright, but they have sought out many inventions.' To Adam
   natural, to us supernatural strength: Ezek. xxxvi. 27, And I will put
   my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye
   shall keep my judgments and do them;' Heb. viii. 10, This is the
   covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,
   saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in
   their hearts.'

   [5.] In both God kept up his sovereignty, and by his condescension did
   not part with anything of his dominion over man. In the covenant of
   works he ruled by a law written on men's hearts: Rom. ii. 15, Which
   show the work of the law written in their hearts, their consciences
   also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else
   excusing one another.' So by grace the believer is not freed from the
   law of nature, which being almost obliterated and blotted out of the
   heart of man, and become very illegible, it pleased God to set it forth
   in a new edition, and to write it over again in the heart of a renewed
   man: Heb. viii. 10, I will put my law into their minds, and write it in
   their hearts;' Eph. iv. 24, And that ye put on the new man, which after
   God is created in righteousness and true holiness.' Though God admitted
   us to new conditions of favour, yet he still requireth subjection on
   our part, and that we own him as Lord and sovereign, requiring
   obedience and service at our hands, or else he taketh a liberty to
   visit our transgressions with rods: Ps. lxxxix. 31, 32, If they break
   my statutes, and keep not my commandments, then will I visit their
   transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with, stripes.'

   [6.] In both covenants there is a mutual obligation on both parties;
   this ariseth from the very nature of a covenant. Contractus est
   consensio ad constituendam obligationem, qua alter alteri fit obnoxius.
   In every covenant there is a tie on both sides, and some reason of
   right. There is no obligation of debt between God and us, but an
   obligation of grace. Deus non est debitor, saith Aquinas, quia non est
   ad alia ordinatus; reddit debita, nulla debet. His covenant doth infer
   a debt of favour, not of justice. We may challenge him upon his
   promise: Ps. cxix. 49, Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which
   thou hast caused me to hope.' But God doth it not with respect to our
   work, but his own promise. In covenants of justice between man and man,
   there is a proportion and correspondence between the conditions on the
   one part and the other. In the covenant between God and us is a deed of
   favour, containing large grants of privileges, and noble conditions,
   upon terms and re-stipulations, which had no proportion to the favours
   granted. As if some prince or person of honour should, out of pure love
   to a poor mean virgin that hath no portion, covenant to give her a rich
   dowry and jointure, suitable to his own degree; so doth God with us in
   the covenant of grace: Ezek. xvi. 8, Now when I passed by thee and
   looked on thee, behold thy time was a time of love, and I spread my
   skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness, yea, I sware unto thee, and
   entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou
   becamest mine;' Jer. xxxi. 3, The Lord hath appeared of old unto thee,
   saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with
   loving-kindness have I drawn thee.' Indeed, in the covenant of works,
   justice hath a greater predominant influence than grace; though in
   exact justice, God is not bound to remunerate us there neither.

   [7.] The conditions in both covenants were suitable to the ends and
   scope appointed. In the first covenant God would show forth justice in
   rewarding man's works and his own obedience. Now what more suitable
   condition than works, without the least indulgence in case of failing?
   Gal. iii. 10, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
   which are written in the book of the law to do them.' And what more
   suitable to show forth grace than the condition of faith required by
   the covenant of grace? Rom. iv. 16, Therefore it was of faith, that it
   might be of grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the
   seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is
   of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.' So he would make
   it full of comfort to the creature, and honour to his justice.

   2. The differences between these two covenants.

   [1.] They differ in the ends, both as to man and God.

   (1.) As to man. The end of the first covenant was to preserve and
   continue man in that happiness wherein it found him, and in which he
   was created; but the covenant of grace was for the reparation and
   restitution of mankind to that happiness which he had lost, and from
   which he had fallen. The law saith to man in his best, his pure and
   perfect estate, Continue in it. It speaketh to the innocent, that they
   may continue in their original happiness. The gospel saith, Be ye
   reconciled and renewed: 2 Cor. v. 20, Now then we are ambassadors for
   Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's
   stead, be ye reconciled to God;' for it speaketh to the fallen and
   miserable: it is a restitution of what was lost, and redeeming us from
   misery and sin. The one was made with man in statu instituto, as he
   came out of God's hand, in his primitive integrity, when he was a
   lively resemblance of God, and his abilities for obedience not yet
   broken. The other covenant was made with him in statu destituto, when
   at the worst, sinful and wretched, in his fallen estate, disabled for
   obedience to God: Rom. viii. 3, For what the law could not do, in that
   it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness
   of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh.' In the one
   there was perfect amity between the confederates, God and Adam, and
   this covenant was made for the continuance and standing thereof; but
   there was enmity and distance between the parties when the new covenant
   was set afoot; and this was to be taken away, and the breach made up;
   and therefore it is called a covenant of peace: Isa. liv. 10, For the
   mountains shall depart, and the hills shall be removed, but my kindness
   shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be
   removed, saith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee.'

   (2.) As to God. In the one, God is considered as a gracious and
   merciful redeemer, who being displeased with them for the breach of the
   first covenant, did enter into a new covenant to show the riches of his
   grace and mercy: Eph. i. 6, Unto the praise of the glory of his grace,
   wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.' Man fallen was not a
   suitable object of God's love, as man in innocency; he was then lovely,
   and an alluring object, because of the beauty God had put upon him; but
   now he was loathsome, like an infant in his blood and filthiness: Ezek.
   xvi. 6-8, When I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
   blood, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood. Live; yea, I said
   unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live. I have caused thee to
   multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxed
   great; and thou art come to excellent ornaments; thy breasts are
   fashioned, and thy hair is grown, whereas thou wert naked and bare. Now
   when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the
   time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy
   nakedness; yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with
   thee, and thou becamest mine, saith the Lord.' Therefore God had a
   different end as to himself. The glory of his creating bounty was the
   end in the old covenant, the glory of his redeeming grace and pardoning
   mercy was the end in the new covenant, showed in the recovery of lost
   sinners. In the one, he intended the advancement of those attributes
   that were known to man by the law and light of nature, as wisdom,
   power, goodness, bounty, and justice: Ps. viii. 9, O Lord our Lord, how
   excellent is thy name in all the earth!' The end of the covenant of
   grace was to set forth redeeming mercy: Rom. v. 21, That as sin hath
   reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness
   unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.' If the creature had
   never been in misery, mercy had never been known, and grace had not
   been so glorious, as in giving Christ. All the natural attributes of
   God receive a new lustre in Christ.

   [2.] They differ in their nature. The covenant of works stood more by
   commands, and less by promises; but the covenant of grace standeth more
   by promises, and less by commands: therefore called the promise, Gal.
   iii. 18, For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of
   promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.' The commands and
   promises were not commensurate. There was not a promise in that
   covenant for every command of the law of nature, but in the gospel God
   promiseth what he requireth. In the covenant of works, justice is the
   rule of God's dealing; for though he entered into that covenant, and
   promised a reward out of grace; yet being entered into it, justice
   holdeth the balance, and weigheth the works of men, and giveth to every
   man according to his works, what is due to him: Rom. ii. 6-8, Who will
   render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient
   continuance in well-doing seek for life, and glory, and immortality,
   eternal life. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the
   truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,' &c. But the
   rule of God's dealing in the new covenant is grace. The covenant of
   works was more independent on God and grace without man, and more
   dependent on man and grace within himself. In it man was left to stand
   by his own strength, to be justified upon his own righteousness, God
   having furnished him with a stock at first, or a sufficiency of power
   to keep that covenant. But the covenant of grace findeth us without
   strength; therefore we are kept in dependence upon another: Ps. lxxxix.
   19, I have laid help upon one that is mighty;' and Phil. iv. 13, I can
   do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.' Man was to keep
   the first covenant, but here in effect the covenant keepeth us: 1 Peter
   i. 5, Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation;'
   Jer. xxxii. 40, And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that
   I will not turn away. from them to do them good; but I will put my fear
   in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.'

   [3.] In the terms. Unsinning obedience is the condition of the covenant
   of works. The covenant of works is wholly made void, and the promise
   thereof of none effect, by any one sin, without any hope of cure or
   remedy. Once a sinner, and for ever miserable; as the angels for one
   sin were thrown down from heaven, and reserved in chains of darkness
   unto the judgment of the great day,' Jude 6. It admitteth of no such
   thing as repentance, neither doth it offer any provision for such; it
   speaketh much to the whole, nothing to the sick; it maketh a promise to
   the righteous, but none to sinners. But the covenant of grace is
   otherwise: Mat. ix. 13, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice; for I am
   not come to call the righteous,' but sinners to repentance: Acts v. 31,
   Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a prince and a saviour,
   for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.' Every
   failing doth not make void the covenant, no not every grosser fault:
   Ps. lxxxix. 33, 34, Nevertheless my loving-kindness I will not utterly
   take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail: my covenant will I
   not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.' The first
   covenant is an uncomfortable covenant to a sinner, and can be only
   comfortable to a perfect righteous person; for in case of the least
   failing it speaketh nothing but wrath and the curse. But the covenant
   of grace is comfortable to sinners, it offereth pardon to them. As to
   the first covenant, it is impossible to be fulfilled by man in the
   state of corruption: Rom. viii. 3, What the law could not do, in that
   it was weak through the flesh.' Since the day that Adam fell, never did
   nor could any man fulfil this covenant. Well, then, the demands of this
   covenant cannot be satisfied without a continuation in all things
   written therein, in height of exactness and perfection. But the gospel
   admits of a sincere, uniform obedience as perfect: 2 Cor. viii. 12, But
   if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a
   man hath, and not according to that he hath not.' There is a merciful
   lenity as to acceptance, though the rule is as strict: Mal. iii. 17,
   And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in the day when I make
   up my jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son, that
   serveth him.'

   Use 1. Then enter into this covenant. You have no benefit by it till
   you personally enter into the bond of it. The covenant of works was
   made with man generally, universally considered, with Adam as a public
   person, representing all his posterity; but the covenant of grace is
   made with man particularly, and personally considered, and his consent
   is expressly required, or else it can convey no benefit to us. That was
   a law, and so did bind whether man did consent or no. This is a
   privilege, Christ draweth to consent to him, doth not force us against
   our will: John i. 12, But as many as received him, to them gave he
   power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
   name.' Will you own him as the Son of God, and Redeemer of the world?
   Every man must consent for himself. The effects of the first covenant
   are uncomfortable for the present, the spirit of bondage: Heb. ii. 15,
   And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
   subject to bondage.' But dreadful hereafter: James ii. 13, He shall
   have judgment without mercy.' When none to mediate for them, they have
   to do with justice, strict justice. The least sin is enough to rain
   you, it will pass by no transgression, remit no part of your
   punishment, it will have satisfaction to the utmost farthing, admits of
   no pardon, no advocate, regardeth no tears. What justice can give you,
   that you may look for. If justice speak no good, promise no good, you
   are to look for none; for justice doth all in the covenant, under which
   you stand: Ps. cxxx. 3, If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O
   Lord, who shall stand?' What you may claim as a due debt, that you may
   look for; that covenant gives no gift. Oh! then, give the hand to the
   Lord: 2 Chron. xxx. 8, But be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers
   were, but yield yourselves to the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary,
   which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve the Lord your God.'
   Receive God's condition: Acts ix. 6, Lord, what wilt thou have me to
   do?' You have not leave to choose and refuse.

   Use 2. Let us bless God, and admire his grace in bringing about this
   new covenant.

   1. Man irreparably had broken the first covenant, fallen from his state
   of life; so that all the world is lost under guilt and a curse: Rom.
   iii. 19, That every month may be stopped, and all the world may become
   guilty before God.'

   2. Upon this fundamental breach, the Lord was acquitted and ab solved
   from the promise of life, in this way of works; for man could never
   stand in that court: Rom. viii. 3, For what the law could not do, in
   that it was weak through the flesh,' &c. Then--

   3. God taking occasion by this miserable estate, opened a door of hope
   by Christ: 2 Cor. v. 19, God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
   himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.' God hath set up a
   new court of righteousness and life, where sinners may appear, where
   grace taketh the throne, and the judge is Christ, and the gospel the
   rule, and faith and sincere obedience accepted.

   4. The Lord giveth notice to fallen man, and sendeth him word, that if
   he will come to this court, and put himself under the laws thereof, he
   shall be delivered from the curse: Luke i. 77-79, To give knowledge of
   salvation to his people by the remission of their sins, through the
   tender mercies of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high hath
   visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the
   shadow of death, to guide their feet into the way of peace.'

   5. Because men are backward, he hunteth and pursueth them by the curse
   of the law, and the sense men have of it, to take sanctuary at his
   grace: Heb. vi. 18, That by two immutable things, in which it was
   impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have
   fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.'

   6. When a poor creature cometh, he receiveth him graciously: Jer. iii.
   12, 13, Return thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not
   cause mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, saith the Lord,
   and I will not keep anger for ever: only acknowledge thine iniquity,
   that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God;' 1 John i. 9, If
   we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
   and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' If he had not set up
   another court of righteousness, no tears, no repentance could have
   helped us; there had been no help that way. Now he is willing to
   receive you, he standeth with his arms open. From first to last he
   dealeth with us upon terms of grace.

   Secondly, Judgment is put for manner and custom or course: Gen. xl. 13,
   Thou shalt deliver Pharaoh his cup after the former manner, k?mspt. So
   Josh. vi. 15, They compassed the city after the same manner.' The same
   word again: 1 Sam. ii. 13, The priest's custom with the people was,'
   &c.; 1 Sam. viii. 11, mspt hmlk, This will be the manner of the king
   that shall reign over you;' 1 Sam. xxvii. 11, So did David, and so will
   be his manner.' So in other places.

   Doct. 1. That it is God's constant method to encourage all those that
   serve him, by showing to them all manner of expressions of favour and
   mercy.

   The proposition is often expressed in scripture: Ps. xxv. 10, All the
   paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto such as keep his covenant
   and his testimonies;' Ps. lxxxiv. 11, For the Lord God is a sun and a
   shield; the Lord God will give grace and glory; no good thing will he
   withhold from them that walk uprightly;' Ps. xxxiv. 10, The young lions
   do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek the Lord shall not want
   any good thing.' David presumeth it: Ps. xxiii. 6, Surely goodness and
   mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.' And many other places.

   Object. But it seemeth to be contradicted by sense. They that love God
   most are most calamitous, and have many afflictions.

   Ans. 1. These belong to God's covenant, and are expressions of his
   good-will and faithfulness: Ps. cxix. 75, I know, Lord, that thy
   judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.'
   God were not faithful nor merciful if he did not now and then take the
   rod in hand; our need, our good requireth it: Heb. xii. 10, For they
   verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure, but he for
   our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.' Discipline is
   necessary for a child as food, winter as necessary as summer, rainy
   days as fair days, to curb the wantonness of the flesh, and to withdraw
   the fuel of our lusts.

   2. He useth to show mercy to people in their afflictions, to cause
   light to rise to them in darkness: 2 Cor. i. 5, For as the sufferings
   of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.'
   We are not capable of taking in spiritual comforts till we are
   separated from the dregs of worldly affections.

   3. God will sanctify afflictions: Rom. viii. 28, All things shall work
   together for good to them that love God.' And he will finally deliver
   when the season calleth for it: 1 Cor. x. 13, There hath no temptation
   taken you, but such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will
   not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the
   temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.'

   Object. But he dealeth more hardly with them than others; he doth not
   punish the gross iniquities of his adversaries, when the lesser
   failings of his people are severely chastised.

   Ans. It is meet judgment should begin at the house of God,' 1 Peter iv.
   17, that it may be known God doth not favour any in their sins: Amos
   iii. 2, You only have I known of all the families of the earth;
   therefore will I punish you for all your iniquities.' Their sins,
   though small, have more aggravations, being committed against clearest
   light, dearest love: Ezra ix. 13, And after all that is come upon us
   for our evil deeds, should we again break thy commandments?' Isa. xxvi.
   10, Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
   righteousness.' God is jealous over his people, and careful to have
   them reclaimed from every evil course: 1 Cor. xi. 32, But when we are
   judged we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned
   with the world.' In the bitterness of the rod God discovereth the
   vileness of their sin; for he will reclaim them when he suffereth
   others to walk in their own way.

   4. His enemies shall in time taste the dregs of the cup, whereof his
   own people taste a little: Ps. lxxv. 8, For in the hand of the Lord
   there is a cup; the wine is red, it is full of mixture, he poureth out
   of the same: but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall
   wring them out and drink them;' Jer. xxv. 29, For lo, I begin to bring
   evil on this city that is called by my name, and shall ye be utterly
   unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished, for I will call for a sword
   upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.' They
   shall have the bottom.

   5. In the meantime God's people have his love, their sins are pardoned,
   they are admitted into communion with him; and God's mercy and favour
   to his people must not be judged by temporal accidents: Ps. xvii. 14,
   15, From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which
   have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy
   hid treasures; they are full of children, and leave the rest of their
   substance to their babes. As for me, I will behold thy face in
   righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.'
   Christ gave his purse to Judas, but his spirit to the other disciples.

   Object. But God desert eth them; his people complain of it: Isa. lix.
   14, But Zion said, the Lord hath forsaken me, and my God hath forgotten
   me.' Yea, Christ himself, Mat. xxvii. 46, My God, my God, why hast thou
   forsaken me?'

   Ans. 1. There is a distinct consideration of Christ, for he was to bear
   our sorrows: Isa. liii. 4, Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried
   our sorrows;' to be forsaken for a while, that we might be received for
   ever.

   2. God's people are mistaken; the saints complain without a cause.
   Sense maketh lies of God: Ps. xxxi. 22, For I said in my haste, I am
   cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheless thou heardest the voice of
   my supplication when I cried unto thee;' Ps. lxxvii. 9, 10, Hath God
   forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?
   And I said, This is my infirmity; but I will remember the years of the
   right hand of the Most High.' The disciples had Christ near them when
   they knew it not: Luke xxiv. 16, Their eyes were holden, that they
   could not know him.'

   3. Though they are forsaken for a while, yet not for ever: Isa. liv. 7,
   8, For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercy will I
   gather thee. In a little wrath I have hid my face from thee for a
   moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith
   the Lord thy Redeemer.'

   Use. Do not say God is a hard master. When the compute is rightly made,
   and you trace his providence through all the passages of your lives,
   there is more good than evil. Jacob giveth an account of his life: Gen.
   xlviii. 15, 16, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk,
   the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the angel which
   redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads.' So may others say.

   Doct. 2. God's accustomed goodness and gracious dispensations to his
   people throughout all ages should encourage us in waiting upon him and
   praying to him.

   This emboldeneth me, that all thy servants in all ages have found thee
   gracious and merciful unto them.

   1. From God's unchangeableness. He will not leave his old wont; he is
   where he was at first: Isa. lix. 1, Behold, the Lord's hand is not
   shortened, that he cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot
   hear;' Mal. iii. 6, For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons
   of Jacob are not consumed.' He is the same that ever he was.

   2. All his people stand upon the same terms; therefore what he will do
   for one, he will do for another. God's love is the same; he is alike
   affected to all his children; his saints now are as dear to him as
   ever: Ps. cxlix. 4, For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will
   beautify the meek with salvation.' They have the same covenant, it is a
   common charter: Acts ii. 39, For the promise is unto you, and to your
   children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our
   God shall call.' The same Redeemer: 1 Cor. i. 2, To them that are
   sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every
   place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and
   ours;' Rom. iii. 22, Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith
   of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is
   no difference.' One hath not a more worthy Christ than another; faith
   is as acceptable as ever: 2 Peter i. 1, To them that have obtained like
   precious faith.' They are interested in the same privileges, promises,
   gifts, and rewards.

   Use 1. Examples and instances of God's mercy should confirm us. It is
   not agreeable to God's nature and practice to forsake his people, or to
   be deaf to their prayers: Ps. xxii. 4, 5, Our fathers trusted in thee,
   they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them; they cried unto
   thee, and were delivered; they trusted in thee, and were not
   confounded.' None of his people ever sought him in vain. From the
   beginning of the world to this day, God hath been gracious: Ps. ix. 10,
   For they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou,
   Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.' No age can give an
   instance to the contrary; therefore mark the usual dealings of God with
   his children: What was said to them was for the establishment of our
   comfort and hope: Rom. iv. 23, 24, Now it was not written for his sake
   alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us also to whom it shall be
   imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the
   dead;' compared with Gen. xv. 6, And he believed in the Lord, and lie
   counted it to him for righteousness.' God's word is a book of
   precedents, as a painter's masterpiece is hung out to invite custom.

   2. Let us be sure we be of this number. If there be conformity to them
   in affection, there will be in consolation; if in grace, then in
   privileges: Ps. cxlv. 18-20, The Lord is nigh unto all them that call
   upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He shall fulfil the
   desire of them that fear him, he also will hear their cry, and will
   save them. The Lord preserveth all them that love him.'

   Doct. 3. We should beg the favour of God's people.

   Common things should not satisfy a child of God. He must have what is
   peculiar to the saints: Ps. cvi. 4, 5, Remember me, O Lord, with the
   favour thou bearest unto thy people; O visit me with thy salvation;
   that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the
   gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.'
   Nothing will satisfy the people of God but his special love; they have
   a new nature that must be pleased, a great, noble, and divine end to be
   promoted, which is to enjoy God; the creatures serve not for that.
   Common men are put off with common mercies; these they may have and
   perish.

   Use. Let us be of this temper. Men commonly think that God looketh upon
   those whom he blesseth with a large increase of temporal things, that
   he is merciful to those that never see evil, nor feel pain or want.
   David was not of this mind; he would have God deal with him as with his
   friends and favourites; he leaveth it to God how to express his mercy,
   who only knoweth what is best for us; only he beggeth the fruits of his
   special love. The heart is earthly and worldly when spiritual things
   are not valued above all the glory and plenty of the world. Our
   condition is under a curse without these; in these Christ showed his
   love: Acts iii. 26, Unto you first God having raised up his Son Jesus,
   sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
   iniquities.' He died not to make us rich, honourable, great, but for
   remission of sin. This is a solid ground of rejoicing; this abideth for
   ever.

   Doct. 4. We must not affect singularity of dispensations, but be
   content to be dealt with as others of God's children have been dealt
   with before us.

   We must not expect to go to heaven without difficulties:1 Peter v. 9,
   Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren
   that are in the world.' We are not alone; our lot is no harder than
   others of God's holy ones. All have gone to heaven this way. God will
   so manifest himself to us, that still there may be room for faith and
   patience.

SERMON CXLVII.

   Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over
   me.--Ver. 133.

   IN the former verse the prophet had begged for a comfortable look from
   God, and some renewed taste of his mercy; he now amplifies his request,
   and as he there prayed for pardoning mercy, so now for sanctifying
   grace. Many that seek mercy to deliver them from the guilt of sin, do
   not desire grace to deliver them from the power of it; and yet the one
   is as necessary as the other, that we may not offend God, as well as
   that sin may not hurt us. To pray only for pardoning mercy would seem
   to be a praying only for our own interest, and not for God's. God's
   interest lies in our subjection, our interest lies in impunity and
   freedom from the curse of the law and the flames of hell; and let me
   tell you that our interest is not sufficiently provided for till the
   heart be sanctified as well as sin pardoned; for an unholy creature can
   never be happy, that is clear against the course of all the Lord's wise
   proceedings. He hath settled everything, and put it into its proper
   place, and a sinful creature can never enjoy impunity; therefore, as we
   need to pray, Lord, be merciful to us, so, Lord, order my steps in thy
   word,' &c.

   In this prayer there are two branches:--

   1. A petition for grace for the regulation of his life, order my steps
   according to thy word.

   2. A deprecation of the contrary evil, and let not any iniquity have
   dominion over me.

   The first part of his prayer is by way of prevention, the second is by
   way of reserve; and the connection of both doth in effect speak thus,
   Lord, if thou dost not order my goings, surely iniquity will have
   dominion over me. Therefore he first prays that God will not permit him
   to err; or if the Lord should by his righteous providence permit him to
   fall, that he might return again to his duty, that sin may not wholly
   and clearly carry it in his heart, and have a full power over him:
   Lord, order my steps according to thy word;' but if I should fail, Let
   not any iniquity have dominion over me.' The same method is used Ps.
   xix. 13, Keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins.' He doth desire
   absolutely to be kept from presumptuous sins; but then he adds by way
   of supposition and reserve, that if he could not by reason of his
   naughty heart be kept from them, yet that they might not have full
   power and dominion over him. Rabbi David Kimchi indeed refers the
   former branch to the affirmative precept, order my steps according to
   thy word;' and the latter branch to the negative precept: and so he
   makes the meaning to be this, Let me neither break thy laws by omitting
   any duty or committing any sin. You may take that division of the words
   if you will.

   In the former branch observe the act of grace, order; the subject, my
   steps; the rule, thy word.

   In the latter branch observe the evil deprecated, the dominion of sin,
   the universality or degree of the deprecation, let not any iniquity,
   neither great nor small sins, take the throne by turns.

   To explain these circumstances, the act of grace, order.' The
   Septuagint, kateuthunon, direct or set straight my steps. Junius hath
   it, institue, frame or appoint; and Ainsworth hath it, firmly direct;
   for indeed the word signifies to instruct, order, and establish. We are
   ignorant and apt to err, therefore God must instruct us; we are various
   and uncertain in our motions, therefore God must order us in a way of
   obedience, and reduce us into a settled course and method, that all may
   be done in a subordination to our great end; for order respects that.
   And we are soon discouraged, therefore God must support and establish
   us: so firmly direct, that thou mayest establish our steps according to
   thy word.

   The subject is, my steps.' Because the affections are the seat of the
   soul, by which it walks out after the object represented, the
   understanding represents and the will chooseth; therefore some would
   limit these steps to the affections. I think it compriseth all the
   actions of the reasonable creature, that no thoughts, no deeds, no
   counsels, no enterprises of his might transgress the limits of God's
   word.

   For the rule, In thy word.' The Septuagint, kata` to` lo'gio'n sou,
   according to thy oracle. However the phrase is to be noted, In thy
   word;' not only according to this rule, but in this path. The sum is
   this: Lord, thou hast invited me to walk in thy word; now direct me,
   strengthen me to walk in it, and let all my motions and my actions keep
   within the compass of it.

   For the other part, Let not any iniquity have dominion over me.'
   Because the Septuagint reads, me` katakurieusa'to mou pasa anomi'a; and
   out of them the vulgar, Let not all iniquity tyrannise over me,' some
   have conceived the sense to be, let me not be trampled upon, not
   oppressed by all kind of wrong and all kind of injustice; as if he
   pleaded here to be kept from the tyranny of his enemies. But this is
   not probable, and other scriptures that are parallel to this, where the
   like expression is used, will not permit such a sense; and therefore he
   saith, Let not any or every iniquity have dominion over ne. Why?
   Because sins take the throne by turns. Sometimes a man finds this sin
   and sometimes that sin in the throne, and sometimes strange sins that
   we little think of may get a great power over the heart, even those
   that we fear least many times may steal into the throne.

   From the first branch observe--

   Doct. 1. That there is a constant daily necessity of grace to direct
   and order our motions and actions according to the word of God.

   Now, that there is a daily and hourly necessity of grace, is a point
   that frequently offereth itself in this psalm. I shall briefly dispatch
   it, therefore, in these propositions:--

   1. It appears from the strictness of Christianity. He that would please
   God had need of a tender conscience, that he may wholly frame himself
   to do the will of God; and not only take care to be right for the main
   of his course, but that every particular action should be orderly and
   regular: for the man of God does not beg grace here to choose a right
   path, but that his steps may be ordered. This is the strictness of
   Christianity, that a man should make conscience of every step, that
   every action should be under the power of grace, and fall within the
   rules of the word. It needs to be so. Why? Because the word of God is
   not only a general rule to show us our path, but a particular direction
   to order our steps: Ps. cxix. 105, Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and
   a light unto my path;' to my feet as well as my path. Every action or
   step of ours is morally considered in its own tendency, either a step
   to heaven or hell; if good, a step to heaven; if evil, a step to hell:
   therefore we had need make conscience of our steps. Besides, if we do
   not make conscience of our steps, we shall not make conscience of our
   way; for he that is not faithful in a little, will not be faithful in
   much. Every wry step is so far out of the way, and the more we persist
   in it the more we wander. Therefore see what is required of Christians:
   1 Peter i. 15, Be holy,' en pa'se anastrophe, in every creek and
   turning of your lives, In all manner of conversation.' A man that would
   approve himself to God, must be good in all conditions, in all his
   businesses, affairs, all ages of his life, young or old, in actions
   civil, sacred; if his condition be prosperous or adverse; when in
   adversity or prosperity, he must carry himself as a Christian; he ought
   still to approve himself to be a hater of sin, and a lover of what God
   loves. In all his affairs, not only in his religious actions, but in
   his civil and common actions. Godliness is not a holiday suit, but an
   apparel that is of constant wearing; and therefore a Christian is to
   show himself a Christian in all things, though especially in those
   things which are solemn and most weighty; a Christian in his prayers, a
   Christian in his business, in his recreation, in his meals, a Christian
   in the disposal of himself and condition, a Christian in all his
   converses. I lay this for a foundation. Certainly here are steps spoken
   of. The holy man would have them ordered, and that by the strictness of
   Christianity; so that no one particular action must allowedly be
   sinful. You see what need there is of direction. Care less and slight
   spirits, that only look upon Christianity in the lump, they think that
   truths are few and easy, and that the art of holy living, is soon
   learned, and they do not see a need of this ordering our ways, and to
   be willing to please God in all things. But those that count the least
   sin to be a very heavy burthen, a greater evil than the greatest
   temporal loss, that make it their business to approve themselves to God
   in all things they put their hands unto, will be earnest and
   importunate with him for his grace.

   2. The necessity of the word of God. Whoever will please God in all
   things, and will purge his own soul and his life from sin, must take
   the word of God for his rule and direction. Our lives are not to be
   framed according to our own fancies, but God's word, where the genuine
   holiness is recommended to us, and which is the only proper means to
   work the heart to it. I shall prove that the word of God is the great
   rule both to warn us of our dangers and to instruct us in our duties;
   and so it is the great means to sanctify the heart. I say it is the
   great rule to warn us of our dangers: Ps. xix. 11, More over, by them
   is thy servant warned.' This discovers temptations, inconveniences,
   snares, which otherwise we should never discern. There are many dangers
   that wait for us on every side. So Ps. xvii. 4, Concerning the works of
   men, by the word of thy lips, I have kept me from the paths of the
   destroyer.' It is the only proper means to keep us from the paths of
   the destroyer. Alas! otherwise if we do not strictly consult with his
   statute and rule, we shall cry up a confederacy with those that cry up
   a confederacy against God; we shall embrace the temptation which
   opportunity offers, if he follow the guidance of his deceived and
   deceiving heart. And the word of God doth only discover our duties to
   us: Prov. vi. 23, For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light,
   and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.' Mark, whatever
   condition we are in, whether in the night, or whether in the day,
   whether in this or that condition, here we have a lamp and light; here
   is that which will show us what God requires of us in every state and
   condition. Now, as this is the only rule, so it is the only appointed
   means with which God will associate the operation of his grace for the
   converting and curing of the souls of men; for when God had stated a
   rule for the creature, it is fit the knowledge of that might be a means
   of sanctification; so the word is commended to us: John xvii. 17,
   Sanctify them by thy truth; thy word is truth;' if the Holy Ghost will
   sanctify, if he will beget not an apocryphal and bastardly holiness
   (that may be by the institutions of men, and rules men prescribe), but
   a genuine, true holiness, which is acceptable to God; put them into a
   capacity to serve, love, and enjoy God: Ps. cxix. 9, Wherewith shall a
   young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy
   word.' A young man, that is in the heat of his lusts, and in the ruff
   of his sin, is impetuously carried away. How shall he do to break this
   boisterous violence, and bring his heart into some competent way of
   obedience to God? Why, the word of God is the only means; the Lord
   interposeth by his word, and blesseth his word. Let a man read Seneca,
   Plato, Plutarch, all the philosophers, he will have but cold and faint
   respects to holiness and to better things, until he come to be
   exercised in the word of God. Man is not a vessel that comes newly out
   of the potter's shop, but he hath a smatch of the old infusion of sin;
   and he cannot have this taste and tang put out but by the word of God
   sanctifying his heart and breaking the power of his lusts: Ps. xix. 7,
   The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.' We are out of
   joint, unfit to please and serve God. Now, how shall a man do to get
   his soul set in joint again, that he may be in a capacity to serve and
   enjoy God? Why, this restores the soul to a capacity; the Lord blesseth
   this institution and this means; for it is not bare truth, but
   instituted truth, with which God will associate the operation of his
   Spirit. By this word of his, that was indited by the Spirit, and penned
   by holy men that were moved by the Holy Ghost, he doth join his virtue
   and power and efficacy of his Spirit to sanctify the souls of men.

   3. They that make it their scope and business to please God in all
   things, and take his word for their rule, their souls will soon see a
   need for divine direction, and the establishment of his grace. This
   reason is taken from the temper of the persons that are to walk in this
   strict way, according to his strict rule; they are such as are
   naturally blind, and naturally opposite to God: now certainly such need
   to go to God for direction. I gather that from these words, Order my
   steps.' Every man is a poor blind creature, and hath a heart opposite
   to the ways of God; he need beg this grace of God, Lord, incline my
   heart. Every man is a blind creature, partly because our own spirits
   are blind, crooked, and unstable, that we shall neither consult our
   rule nor understand our duty, nor like it when it is represented to us,
   until the Lord doth enlighten us. A man's heart is naturally blind: 2
   Peter i. 9, He cannot see afar off,' he hath no skill in spiritual
   things, 1 Cor. ii. 14. The heart is naturally full of darkness, and
   then this darkness grows upon us, partly by prejudice or custom, and
   many evil habits: 2 Cor. iv. 4, The god of this world hath blinded
   men's eyes.' There are many inordinate affections that increase upon
   us. So it is then that a man is blind by nature, more blind by custom
   and inordinate affection, is exceedingly blinded; which have a great
   influence upon our judgments in all practical cases. Though we should
   know general rules, yet to bring them down to every particular action
   is very grievous, and hard to bring the heart to. But you will say,
   When we have received the Spirit, God hath put his law into our minds,
   this blindness is cured; therefore why should such as David pray, Lord,
   order my steps,' &c.? Yes, we are cured, but in part, non totaliter.
   Grace doth heal us but in part, much of the matter that clouded the
   mind before is yet upon us; and when lusts are awakened by temptations,
   we strangely forget ourselves, our own reason, our senses, and examples
   of others; we are misled, so that we know not what to do, unless the
   Lord order our steps. Well, as we are blind, so we are opposite too.
   When we know our way, what we should do, yet we are apt to stumble at
   every stone. Naturally the wisdom of the flesh is opposite: Rom. viii.
   7, The carnal mind is enmity against God.' And so much as the wisdom of
   the flesh still remains, we are apt to be discouraged from walking with
   God according to his strict rule, and in the way that he hath given us,
   and we are extremely slack, that unless we be quickened by the lively
   and strengthening light of the Spirit, alas! how soon shall we
   miscarry! Therefore this ordering is a strengthening against the
   reluctances of the flesh: Ps. xvii. 5, Hold up my goings in thy paths,
   that my footsteps slip not.' Alas! when a man finds a good way, he is
   either apt to lie down out of laziness, or to stumble and fall, and we
   cannot keep our footing against temptations. Every man of experience
   seeth the need of this. Therefore, Lord, direct me, Order my steps.'

   4. The reason is taken from the value of the blessing here asked. It is
   one of the chiefest blessings of his grace and favour to have his
   illuminating. After he had said, Lord, be merciful unto me,' presently
   follows, Lord, order my steps.' To prove this must needs be a great
   blessing and favour. It will appear out of the words of the text;
   partly from the word order;' it makes our lives orderly and regular.
   Alas! what a confused, disproportionable thing is a man that is half in
   and half out with the ways of God! His conversation is not all of a
   piece, sometimes right and sometimes wrong; there is not that beauty,
   that harmony, that holiness to be found in them. Solomon tells us,
   Prov. xxvi. 7, The legs of the lame are not equal; so is a parable in
   the mouth of fools.' Baines on the place saith thus, The man hath
   knowledge to speak well, but he lives ill; so his conversation is
   halting, like the legs of the lame. Sometimes his speculative light
   will incline him to do easy things, but his practical endeavours will
   carry him another way; there is no even and uniform strain of
   godliness. Then is a man's conversation ordered, when all is carried on
   with a fair respect to his last end; for it is the last end that fixeth
   a man's mind, and cuts off impertinences and inconsistencies, and makes
   a man's conversation beautiful; otherwise the man is tossed up and down
   in a various uncertain motion, distracted by a multiplicity of ends and
   objects that his will is in no composed and settled frame. I remember
   David prays: Ps. lxxxvi. 11, Unite my heart to fear thy name.' It is a
   blessed thing when a man is united, when his conversation is all of a
   piece; and James i. 8, A double-minded man is unstable in all his
   ways.' A divided mind will beget an uncertain life. I say, the last end
   of our lives doth unite all the parts of it, and there is a regularity
   and harmony between them. But others, their life is a mere lottery; the
   fancies by which they are governed are jumbled together by chance, and
   they live at peradventure and haphazard, and there is not a comely,
   entire, uniform order to a blessed end. Again, partly, too, from the
   reason here, Order my steps according to thy word; and let no iniquity
   have dominion over me.' This will prevent the dominion of sin. Perverse
   affections are apt to sway us, but when the Lord supplies fresh
   directions, the tyranny and dominion of sin is prevented and crushed in
   the egg. Sin usually steals into the throne by insensible degrees;
   temptations and occasions reduce us to some evil practice. Well, and
   that produceth another, then do multiplied acts get strength, then they
   ensnare us; and when once the soul is ensnared then this bondage daily
   increaseth, and is hard to be broken; for by multiplied acts custom
   creeps upon us, and that is another nature, and that which was but
   indifferent at first grows more difficult. As diseases looked to at
   first are easily cured, otherwise they grow desperate; so sins when
   they come to a slavish tyranny and custom, they cannot help it. All
   this is prevented by the seasonable warnings of the Holy Spirit.
   Partly, too, because this is only vouchsafed to God's special people.
   God, as he loves any, so he manifests himself to them. This appears out
   of the text; for in the verse before the text the words run thus, Look
   upon me, and be merciful unto me; as thou usest to do unto those that
   love thy name;' and what then? Order my steps in thy word.' Oh! this is
   to do good to us, as he useth to do good to them that fear his name.
   Mark, some have only providence and natural conscience; there are
   others that have the word, and have an enlightened conscience, that
   plead God's interest in them; but there are others are honoured so far
   that they are his people, that have not only his word, but Spirit, to
   enforce his word upon their hearts. How did Christ declare his love to
   his people? John xv. 15, I call you friends, for all things that I have
   heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.' There is God's love
   declared, when he shows us his whole will, when he doth guide us in all
   his ways; this is the favour of his people: Ps. xxv. 14, The secret of
   the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his
   covenant.' There is the great privilege that God vouchsafes to his
   peculiar people; they know the mind of God more than others do, and in
   all doubtful debates and uncertain controversies they are not left in
   the dark: Mark iv. 11, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the
   kingdom of God.' David surely found such direction to be a very special
   blessing. Again, another argument from the text that this must needs be
   a very great blessing, partly because it helpeth us in our way to true
   happiness. I gather that from the word steps;' for all motion hath a
   term to which it tends, and every journey hath its period. Now, whither
   doth the path of the word lead us, but to God, and to the everlasting
   enjoyment of him? Oh! here they have an infallible direction that they
   cannot miscarry in so great an affair as this is, as the getting home
   to God. Surely that is a great blessing. I remember David saith, Ps.
   lxxiii. 24, Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel, and afterwards receive
   me unto glory.' They that wait upon God's direction are sure to be
   received into his heavenly glory; their steps are directed for the
   present, and they may be confident that at length they shall get home
   to God; for God will accept of what he hath ordered. You are sure God
   will take pleasure in you when you walk according to his direction. So
   you see the need from the value of this blessing.

   5. Consideration, that the children of God are sensible of their need
   of it, that they cannot choose but pray for it. I take this from the
   very form of the words: Lord, order my steps.' It is a prayer from the
   man of God. They seek it humbly and earnestly, therefore they shall
   find it. They that make their bosom their oracle, and wit their
   counsellor, God is disengaged from being their guide; they need him
   not, but the snares they run into will soon show how much they need
   him. But the children of God need him, therefore they shall find it:
   Prov. iii. 6, In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.' You should ever go to God for the direction of your way, then
   God will not disappoint you, nor defeat your expectations: Ps. lxxxv.
   13, Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of
   his steps.' Sometimes we wander, turn aside, and walk out of the right
   way; at other times we fall and stumble in the right way; but the Lord
   will set us in the paths of his steps.

   Use. To press us to seek this great privilege of God, beg of the Lord
   continually to order your steps according to his word. Alas! evil may
   surprise you before you are aware. Little did David think danger was so
   near him when he walked upon his terrace; he gave leave to his eye to
   wander, and his eye fired his heart. Every morning be with God about
   this business: Ps. v. 3, O Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer
   unto thee, and will look up.' You need not only protection against
   dangers, but direction against evils and snares. As we seek for
   protection in the night, so in the morning, prayer is for the direction
   of the day. Nay, we need not go to God in the morning, but all the day
   long: Ps. xxv. 5, On thee do I wait all the day.' Beg of him that you
   may not miscarry, but carry yourselves humbly and prudently, and may do
   nothing that is contrary to the will of God and his grace, but that the
   Lord would support and guide you continually. There is one argument
   that may mightily encourage you in praying. Consider your covenant
   interest in God doth establish this blessing, as the saints always
   plead the relation: Ps. xxv. 5, Lead me in thy truth, and teach me; for
   thou art the God of my salvation;' Ps. cxliii. 10, Teach me to do thy
   will, for thou art my God;' Ps. xlviii. 14, For this God is our God for
   ever and ever; he will be our guide even unto death.' To be a God to
   any is to be a guide; for to a people in covenant, God makes over his
   whole self. Now in God there are considerable these three great
   attributes--his wisdom, power, and goodness. Look, as God by virtue of
   his power is all-sufficient against all dangers, and by virtue of his
   goodness is a fountain of everlasting happiness, so also by his wisdom
   is a fountain of all goodness to guide and direct us. Now as God hath
   engaged all his goodness to make us as happy as heart can wish, and his
   power to defend and maintain us, so all his wisdom to guide and direct
   us.

SERMON CXLVIII.

   And let not any iniquity have dominion over me.--Ver. 133.

   FOR the second branch of the prayer I observe--

   Doct. 2. That the dominion of sin is a great evil, and ought earnestly
   to be deprecated, even by the children of God.

   1. What is the dominion of sin.

   2. That it is a great evil.

   3. Why the saints should deprecate this evil.

   First, What is the dominion of sin? It may be known by some
   distinctions.

   1. There is a dominion of sin that is gross and sensible, and a
   dominion of sin that is more secret and close.

   [1.] More gross and sensible. For though sin do reign in every one by
   nature, yet this dominion more sensibly appears in some than others,
   who are given up to be visibly under the dominion of sin, as the just
   fruit of their voluntary living under that yoke; and usually these are
   set forth as a warning to the rest of the world; God hangs them up in
   chains of darkness in the sight of men, as an instance of this woful
   slavery, that every man that seeth them, and is acquainted with their
   course of life, may say without breach of charity, There goes one that
   declares himself to be a servant of sin. This is either to sin in
   general, or to some particular sin.

   (1.) To sin in general. He, whosoever he be, that, instead of trembling
   at God's word, scoffeth at it, and maketh more account of this world
   than of the will of God, of the fashions of men than of God's word, and
   thinketh the scorn of a base worm that would deride him for godliness a
   greater terror than the wrath of God, and the love of his carnal
   company a greater happiness than communion with Christ, and instead of
   working out his salvation with fear and trembling, runneth into all
   excess of riot, and carelessly neglecteth his precious soul, while he
   pampereth his frail body, and doth voluntarily and ordinarily leave the
   boat to the stream, give up himself to serve his corruption without
   resistance or crying to Christ for help, this man is without dispute,
   and in the eye of the world a slave to sin: Rom. vi. 16, Know ye not
   that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are
   to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto
   righteousness?' It is an apparent case. A man that giveth up himself to
   go on in the ways of his own heart, restraining himself in nothing
   which it affects, he is one of sin's slaves. So saith our Lord Christ:
   John viii. 34, Verily, verily I say unto you, whosoever committeth sin
   is the servant of sin.' He needeth no further doubt nor debate about
   the matter. He that goeth on in a trade of sin, and maketh that his
   work and business in the world, without serious looking after the
   saving of his soul, is one in whom sin reigneth.

   (2.) So some particular sins. As we have instances of carnal wretches
   in general, so of some poor captive souls that remain under the full
   power and tyranny of this or that lust, and are so remarkable for their
   slavery and bondage under it that the world will point at them and say,
   There goeth a glutton, a drunkard, an adulterer, or covetous worldling,
   a proud envious person; Their sin is broken out into some filthy sore
   or scab that is visible to every eye, either their covetousness or
   gluttony or ambitious affectation of worldly greatness, one whose god
   is his belly, who is a slave to appetite: 2 Peter ii. 19, For of whom a
   man is overcome, of the same he is brought in bond age.' They grow
   proverbial for giving up themselves wholly to such a conquering and
   prevailing lust. As in the natural man several men have their distinct
   excellences, some are famous for a strong sight, some for a quick ear,
   some for a nimble tongue, some for agility of body; so these for
   notable excesses in some corruption. Or as the saints of God are
   eminent for some special graces, as Abraham for faith, Moses for
   meekness, Job for patience, and Joseph for chastity, and Paul for zeal,
   Timothy for temperance; so these have their notorious and contrary
   blemishes.

   [2.] There is a more secret and close dominion of sin, that is
   varnished over with a fair appearance. Men have many good qualities and
   no notorious blemishes; but yet some sensitive, good, and created thing
   sitteth nearest the heart, and occupieth the room and place of God,
   that is loved, respected, served instead of God, or more than God. That
   which is our chiefest good and last end is our god, or occupieth the
   room of God. So our Lord telleth us, Mat. vi. 24, No man can serve two
   masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or will
   hold to the one and despise the other: ye cannot serve God and mammon;'
   and John v. 44, How can ye believe, that seek honour one from another,
   and not the honour that cometh from God only?' and Luke xiv. 26, If a
   man come to me, and hate not father and mother,' &c. We must be dead
   not only to carnal pleasure but to credit, estate, yea, life and all.
   It must not sit nearest the heart, nor bring it under its command and
   power: 1 Cor. vi. 12, All things are lawful for me, but I will not be
   brought under the power of any.' We are besotted and bewitched with
   some created thing, that we cannot part with it. or leave it for God's
   sake, or notwithstanding all the mischief it is to the interest of his
   soul. Though a man serveth it cunningly, closely, and by a cleanly
   conveyance, yet all his religion is but either to hide or feed his
   lust.

   2. Distinction. There is a predominancy of one sin over another, and a
   predominancy of sin over grace. In the first sense, renewed men may be
   said to have some reigning corruption or predominant sin, namely, in
   comparison of other sins. That such predominant sins they have
   appeareth by the great sway and power they bear in commanding other
   evils to be either committed or forborne, accordingly as they
   contribute to their advancement; as a wen or a strain draweth all the
   noxious humours to itself. So it appeareth by the violent and frequent
   relapses of the saints into them, or their unwillingness to admit of
   admonition and reproof for them, or their falling into them out of an
   inward propensity, when outward temptations are none, or weak, or very
   few; some sins that are less mortified than others, or unto which they
   are carried by a natural inclination, constitution, or education. Thus
   David had his iniquity, Ps. xviii. 23, whether it were hastiness or
   distrust of the promise, or an inclination to revenge him self. Some
   sins that men favour most, and are most urgent and importunate upon
   them, and steal away their hearts most from God; the great pond into
   which other rivulets or streams of iniquity do empty themselves; that
   sin that outgroweth all the rest, as the tall tree taketh away the
   nourishment from the under shrubs; that which is loved and delighted in
   above other sins; and when other sins will not prevail, the devil sets
   this a-work; as the disciples looked upon the disciple whom Jesus
   loved; when Christ told them that one of them should betray him, Simon
   Peter beckoned to him that he should ask who it was of whom he spake,
   John xiii. 23, 24. Well, then, in regard of other sins, one may reign
   and sit in the throne of the heart, be beloved more than another, but
   not in regard of predominancy over grace; for that is contrary to the
   new nature, that sin should have the upper hand constantly and
   universally in the soul: for any one thing, though never so lawful in
   itself, habitually loved more than God, will not stand with sincerity,
   Luke xiv. 26. If not our natural comforts, certainly not our carnal
   lusts. To love anything apart from Christ, or against Christ, or above
   Christ, is a dispossessing Christ, or casting him out of the throne.

   3. Distinction. There is a twofold prevalency and dominion of
   sin--actual or habitual; actual is only for the time, habitual for a
   constancy. Though a regenerate man be not one that lets sin- reign over
   him habitually, yet too often doth sin reign over him actually as to
   some particular act of sin.

   [1.] The habitual reign of sin may be known by the general frame and
   state of the heart and life, where it is constantly yielded unto, or
   not opposed, but breaketh out without control, and beareth sway with
   delight. Men give the bridle to sin, and let it lead them where they
   will. That is peccatum regnans, cui homo nec vult, nec potest
   resistere, so Coppen. The sinner neither can nor will resist, non
   potest, because usually after many lapses God giveth up men unto penal
   or judicial hardness of heart. But he is willingly taking these bonds
   and chains upon himself. Such are said, 2 Peter iii. 3, To walk after
   their own lusts;' to live in sin,' Rom. vi. 2; to be dead in trespasses
   and sins,' Eph. ii. 1; to serve divers lusts and pleasures,' Titus iii.
   3; to draw on iniquity with cart ropes,' Isa. v. 18. Such as addict and
   give over themselves to a trade of sin with delight and full consent.

   [2.] Actually, when we do that which is evil against our consciences,
   or yield pro hic et nunc to obey sin in the lusts thereof; when it
   gaineth our consent for the time, but the general frame and state of
   the heart is against it. In short, when sin is perfected into some evil
   action, or (in the apostle's speech) when lust hath conceived and
   brought forth sin, James ii. 15; that is, some heinous and enormous
   offence. At that time, no question it hath the upper hand, and carrieth
   it from grace, and the flesh doth show itself in them more than the
   spirit. A man may please a lesser friend before a greater in an act or
   two. Every presumptuous act doth for that time put the sceptre into
   sin's hand. Note, that both predominants spoken of in the former
   distinction, and the actual reign of sin in this, do much prejudice a
   Christian, waste his conscience, hinder his joy of faith; and if not
   guarded, and we do not take up in time, or if often, cannot be excused
   from habitual reign. They are rare by the violence of a great
   temptation, unlikely acts, as for a hen to bring forth the egg of a
   crow.

   4. The next distinction is of sins reigning with a full and plenary
   consent, and with reluctancy and contradiction; as Herod reigned over
   the Jews for many years by mere force, they opposing him and
   contradicting him, but afterwards willingly consented to his
   government: so sin reigneth in some, who readily, willingly obey the
   lusts thereof, and take its bonds and chains upon them. And on the
   godly it doth sometimes prevail, yet not quietly and without blows: The
   evil which I hate that do I,' Rom. vii. 15. They are in combat and
   conflict with it. The virgin that cried out was innocent; it was a
   ravishment, not a consent, peccatum patitur, non facit, as Bernard. The
   seed of God is disliking and opposing, 1 John iii. 9. They are
   sometimes foiled, but they keep up their resistance. Sin gets the
   mastery in some acts, but as a tyrant, not a lawful possessor. They
   groan under that oppression, ever strive for liberty and freedom, and
   in time recover it. Chrysostom hath an expression on that of Rom. vi.
   12, Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies,' &c., ouk eipe
   me` turanneito, alla` me` basileueto. Sin will play the tyrant in the
   best heart, but let it not have a quiet reign. It will take advantage
   of present distempers and difficulties; it may encroach upon us, but it
   hath not our hearts: whereas it is otherwise if a man be not in arms
   against it, but liveth in peace and good contentment under the vigour
   and life of his lusts; there is no opposition unless it be some checks
   of a natural conscience, or a few thoughts of fear and shame, or some
   temporal mischief and inconvenience; no opposition of a renewed heart,
   no hatred of it and opposition as it is an offence to God; then your
   condition is evil.

   Secondly, That it is a great evil, &c. It must needs be so--

   1. Because it is a renouncing of the government of Christ. We transfer
   the kingdom from him to Satan, and take the sceptre out of his hands,
   when we give way to the reign of sin. What though we do not formally
   intend this, yet virtually we do so, and so God will account it. It is
   finis operis, though not operantis. Look, as the setting up of a
   usurper is the rejection of the lawful king, so the setting up of sin
   is the setting up of Satan, John viii. 44, and by consequence a laying
   aside of Christ; for every degree of service done to him includeth a
   like degree or portion of treason and infidelity to Christ. For a man
   cannot serve two masters, Mat. vi. 24, cannot have two chief goods at
   the same time; therefore he that cleaveth to the one refuseth the
   other. If you cleave to sin, you renounce Christ; and though we profess
   Christ to be our Lord, that will not help the matter, Mat. vi. 21; we
   are, for all that, as true bondmen to Satan as the heathen that offered
   sacrifice to him. A drunken or wanton Christian giveth the devil as
   much interest in him as those that sacrificed to Bacchus or Priapus or
   Venus; for he doth as absolutely dispose and command your affections as
   he did theirs: you are his by possession and occupation; the bond of
   your servitude to Satan is altogether as firm and strong as their rites
   of worship. Now we that know Christ's right both by purchase and
   covenant, cannot but know what a great sin this is. By purchase we are
   his: 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20, Ye are not your own; ye are bought with a
   price.' The buyer hath a power over what he hath bought. We were lost
   and sold; we sold ourselves against all right and justice, and Christ
   was pleased to redeem us, and that with no slight thing, but with his
   own blood, 1 Peter i. 18, 19. How can you look your Redeemer in the
   face at the last day? If you have any sense and belief of Christian
   mysteries, you should be afraid to rob Christ of his purchase: 1 Cor.
   vi. 15, Shall I take the members of Christ, and make them the members
   of an harlot? God forbid.' He hath bought you to this very end, that
   you may be no longer under the slavery of sin, but under his blessed
   government and the sceptre of his Spirit: Titus ii. 14, He hath
   redeemed us from all iniquity.' This was his end, to set us at liberty,
   and to free us from our sins; therefore, for us to despise the benefit,
   and to count our bondage a delight, yea, to build up that which he came
   to destroy; this is as great an affront to Christ as can be. But we are
   not only his by purchase, but his by covenant: Ezek. xvi. 8, I entered
   into a covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine.' This was ratified
   in baptism, where we dedicated ourselves to the Lord's use and service;
   and shall we rescind our baptismal vows, and give the sovereignty to
   another, after we have resigned ourselves to Christ, and the hands of
   consecration have passed upon us? When Ananias had dedicated that which
   was in his power, and kept back part for private use, God struck him
   dead in the place, Acts v. 5. And if we alienate ourselves, who were
   Christ's before the consecration, of how much sorer vengeance shall we
   be guilty? God's complaint was just: Ezek. xvi. 20, Thou hast taken thy
   sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast born unto me, and these hast
   thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured.' And if Satan hath a full
   interest in you by doing his lusts, as he had in them by that rite of
   worship, is not the wrong done to God the same?

   2. It is a sure note of a carnal heart; for it is not only incongruous
   that a renewed man should let sin reign, but impossible. De jure it
   ought not, de facto it shall not be. The exhortation and promise: Rom.
   vi. 12, with xiv. 12, Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies.' There
   is the exhortation; while you have these mortal bodies, sin will dwell
   in you, but let it not reign over you. God suffereth it to dwell in us
   for our exercise, not our ruin. Then the promise, ver. 14, Sin shall
   not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under
   grace.' Let not, shall not. It is true sin remaineth in the godly, but
   it reigneth not there. It is dejectum quodammodo, non ejectum tamen.
   Cast down in regard of regency, not cast out in regard of inherency.
   Like the beasts in Daniel, chap, vii. 12, They had their dominion taken
   away, though their lives prolonged for a season;' some degree of life,
   but their reign broken. The Israelites could not wholly expel the
   Canaanites, yet they kept them under. There will be pride, earthliness,
   unbelief, and sensuality dwelling, moving, working in them; but it hath
   not its wonted power over them. Christ will not reckon men slaves to
   sin by their having sin in them, nor yet by their daily failings and
   infirmities, or by their falling now and then into foul faults by the
   violence of a temptation, unless they make a constant trade of sin, and
   be under the dominion of it without control, and set up no course of
   mortification against it.

   3. The reign of sin is so mischievous. Sin, when it once gets the
   throne, groweth outrageous, and involveth us in many inconveniences ere
   we can get out again. Therefore they that know the service of sin, as
   we all do by sad experience, should use all caution that it never bring
   them into bondage again. The work and wages of sin are very different
   from God's work and wages. The apostle compareth them when he
   dissuadeth them from the reign of sin: Rom. vi. 21, 22, For when ye
   were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit
   had you then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of
   those things is death. But now, being made free from sin, and become
   servants to God, ye have your fruit to holiness, and the end
   everlasting life.' You have had full experience of the fruits of sin,
   of Satan's work; what fruit then? Before you had tasted better things,
   before you had a contrary principle set up in your hearts; you are
   ashamed now to think of that course, now you know better things. But
   what fruit then? Satan's work is drudgery, and his reward death. The
   devil hath one bad property, which no other master, how cruel soever,
   hath--to plague and torment them most which have done him most
   continual and faithful service. Those that have sinned most have most
   horror, and every degree of service hath a proportionable degree of
   shame and punishment. He is an unreasonable tyrant in exacting service
   without rest and intermission. The most cruel oppressors, Turks and
   infidels, give some rest to their captives; but sin is unsatisfiable.
   Men spend all their means and all their time and all their strength in
   pursuit of it; yet all is little enough. And what is the reward of all
   but death and destruction? Now judge you to whom should we yield
   obedience, and who hath most right to be sovereign? He who made us and
   redeemed us, and preserveth us every day, none but he can claim title
   to us; he to whom we are debtors by so many vows, so many obligations;
   or else Satan, our worst enemy, who is posting us on to our own
   destruction?

   4. It is so uncomely, and misbecoming the new estate, wherein we have
   so many helps and encouragements to resist sin.

   [1.] For helps, you have an opposite principle to give check to it, the
   seed of God, or new nature. Since Christ hath put grace into your
   hearts to resist sin, it is your duty not to suffer it to be idle and
   unfruitful: Rom. vi. 11, 12, Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto
   sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin
   therefore reign in your mortal bodies, that ye should obey it in the
   lusts thereof.' You want no. ability to encourage; you have an
   observing witness to give check to it, the Spirit of God, who will help
   you in this work, Rom. viii. 13. He will be your second; neither we
   without the Spirit, nor the Spirit without us. There is a life and
   power goeth along with every gospel truth. Laziness pretendeth want of
   power; but what is too hard for the Spirit? Then--

   [2.] For encouragement. In every war are two notable
   encouragements--goodness of the quarrel, and hopes of victory; as
   David? 1 Sam. xvii. 36. We have these in our conflict and combat with
   sin. (1.) Our quarrel and our cause is good; it is the quarrel of the
   Lord of hosts which you fight. We stand with Christ our redeemer, who
   came, i'na lu'se, that he might destroy the works of the devil. He hath
   begun the battle; we do but labour to keep under that enemy which
   Christ hath begun to slay and destroy. Sin is not only an enemy to us,
   but to him. It is against him, and hindereth his glory in the world,
   and the subjection of his creatures and servants. Were it not for sin,
   what a glorious potentate would Christ be, even in the judgment of the
   world? (2.) Hope of the victory. Our strife will end, and it will end
   well. Those that are really, earnestly striving against sin, are sure
   to conquer: Rom. vi. 14, Let not sin reign,' &c. And it shall not; if
   there be but a likelihood of victory, we are encouraged to fight. Here
   a Christian may triumph before the victory. Non aeque glorietur
   accinctus, ac discinctus. 1 Kings xx. 11, Let not him that girdeth on
   his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.' There will come a
   good and happy issue in the end, even a conquest of sin. For the
   present we overcome it in part; it shall not finally and totally
   overcome us in this world; and shortly all strife will be over: Rom.
   xvi. 20, The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.'
   It is but a little while, and we shall receive the crown, and triumph
   over all our enemies.

   Thirdly, Why the saints should deprecate this evil.

   1. Because there is sin still in us all. It is a bosom enemy, that is
   born and bred with us; and therefore it will soon get the advantage of
   grace, if it be not watched and resisted; as nettles and weeds that are
   kindly to- the soil, will soon choke flowers and better herbs that are
   planted by care, and grow not of their own accord, when they are
   neglected, and continually rooted out. We cannot get rid of this cursed
   inmate till this outer tabernacle be dissolved, and this house of clay
   crumbled into dust. Our old nature is so inclinable to this slavery,
   that if God subtract his grace, what shall we do?

   2. It is not only in us, but always working and striving for the
   mastery; it is not as other things, which, as they grow in age, are
   more quiet and tame; but, Rom. vii. 8, Sin wrought in me all manner of
   concupiscence; the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy.' It is
   not a sleepy, but a working, stirring principle. If it were a dull and
   inactive habit, the danger were not so great; but ft is always
   exercising and putting forth itself, and seeking to gain an interest in
   our affections, and a command over all our actions; and therefore,
   unless we do our part to keep it under, we shall soon revert to our old
   slavery. Sin must be kept under as a slave, or else it will be above as
   a tyrant, and domineer.

   Once more, the more it acts, the more strength it gets; as all habits
   are increased by action: for when we have once yielded, we are ready to
   yield again. Therefore any one sin let alone, yea, that which we least
   suspect, may bring us into subjection and captivity to the law of sin,
   Rom. vii. 23. It doth not only make us flexible and yielding to
   temptations, but it doth urge and impel us thereunto.

   Again, this bondage is daily increasing, and more hard to be broken;
   for by multiplied acts a custom creepeth upon us, which is another
   nature; and that which might be remedied at first groweth more
   difficult. Diseases looked to at first are more easy to be cured,
   whereas otherwise they grow desperate; so sins before hardened into a
   custom, before they bring us under the power of any creature or comfort
   which we affect, 2 Cor. vi. 12; for then afterwards it cometh to a
   complete dominion and slavery, so that if a man would, he cannot help
   it. It behoveth, then, every child of God to do his part, that sin may
   not reign; for where care is not taken, it certainly will reign.

   Use 1. To reprove the security and carelessness of many. David
   suspected himself, else he would never have made this prayer to God:
   Lord keep me; Let not any iniquity have dominion over me.' And we
   should all do so that would be safe: Prov. xxviii. 14, Happy is the man
   that feareth alway; but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into
   mischief.' A constant watchfulness and holy jealousy and self-suspicion
   will be no burden to you, but a blessing. Sin deceiveth us into
   hardness of heart for want of taking heed. Many that are secure do not
   consider their danger, and therefore they are not so careful to watch
   over themselves, nor so humble as to implore the divine assistance,
   because they do not consider how soon they may be transported by a
   naughty heart, and brought under the power and reign of sin. Surely
   were we as sensible of the danger of the inward man as we are of the
   outward, we would resist the first motions, and not nourish and foster
   a temptation as we do. The saints do not tarry till the dead blow
   cometh, but resist the first strokes of sin; they do not tarry till it
   pines to death, but resist the first inclinations. An evil inclination,
   if it be cherished and gratified, gets ground; the longer we let it
   alone, the harder will our conflict be, for sin secureth its interest
   by degrees.

   2. It showeth the fearful estate of them that lie under the dominion of
   sin. But who will own it?

   [1.] It is certain that all men in their natural estate are in this
   condition. Sin doth reign where there is no principle of grace set up
   against it. The throne is always filled; man's heart cannot lie empty
   and void. If grace doth not reign, sin reigneth. Natural men are under
   the power of darkness, Acts xxviii. 18, and Col. i. 13; living in a
   peaceable subjection to sin; till Christ come to trouble it, all is
   quiet; wind and tide go together.

   [2.] It appeareth by your course. Many will say, There is not a just
   man on earth, that doeth good and sinneth not;' you are sinners as well
   as we. Ans. There is a difference; though there be not a good man upon
   earth, that sinneth not, Eccles. vii. 20, yet there is a difference.
   Some have not the spot of God's children, Deut. xxxii. 5. There is a
   difference between sins: Lev. xiii. 24-26. God gave the priest under
   the law direction how to put a difference between leprous persons. So
   still there is a great deal of difference between numbness and death,
   and between dimness of sight and blindness, want of sense and want of
   life, between stumbling into a ditch and throwing ourselves headlong
   into an ocean. And so there is a difference between infirmities and
   iniquities, a failing out of ignorance and weakness, or some powerful
   temptation, and a running headlong into all ungodliness. God's children
   have their failings, but a burning desire to be freed from them, though
   others wallow in their sin without any care of a remedy. In one there
   is a failing in point of duty, in the other a rebellion. Take Judas and
   Peter; both sinned against their Master; the one denied, the other
   betrayed him; the one denied him out of fear, the other betrayed him
   out of covetousness and greediness of gain; the one plotted his death,
   the other was surprised on a sudden. There is a great deal of
   difference between purpose and a surprise; the one wept bitterly, the
   other is given up to a raging despair. David did not make a trade of
   adultery, and bathe himself in filthy lusts. Noah was drunk, but not
   knowing the power of the juice of the grape. They dare not lie in this
   estate, but seek to get out by repentance.

   [3.] Some things may beget caution, and move you to suspect yourselves;
   that is, when your souls readily comply with the temptation, you are at
   sin's beck. If it saith, Go, you go; if it saith, Come, you come. It is
   of great concernment to know what goes to the determining a man's
   condition, to know at whose beck he is, whether he is at the flesh's or
   spirit's beck. Ps. ciii. 20, the godly are described that they hearken
   unto the voice of his word; so the wicked are those that hearken to the
   voice of sin. If sin but make a motion, it is a match presently. If
   ambition bid Absalom rise up against his father, then he will trouble
   the whole kingdom, it will hurry him to run his father down; if envy
   bid Cain kill his brother Abel, he will not stick at it; if
   covetousness bid Achan take a bribe of that which was devoted to the
   flames, and must be offered as a burnt-offering to God, yet Achan obeys
   his covetousness; if adultery bids Joseph's mistress tempt her servant,
   presently she yields. So when a sinner yields, and is led away like a
   fool to the correction of the stocks. Meadow ground may in a great
   flood be drowned, but marsh ground is overflown by every return of the
   tide; so they cannot cease to sin, every temptation carries them away.
   When men are impatient of reproof, when they have a privy sore they
   cannot endure should be touched, if a man speak to them anything to
   help them on to interpret their condition. Herod must not have his
   Herodias touched, though he heard John the Baptist gladly in many
   things. Or when men set up a toleration and court of faculties in their
   hearts, and they will have a dispensation: if God will be contented
   with obedience in some things, they will dispense with other things,
   pardon for some sins, but not break them off; have an indulgence that
   they may continue in them, or in vain practices. This shows the reign
   of sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXLIX.

   Deliver me from the oppression of man; so will I keep thy
   precepts.--Ver. 134.

   IN the former verse, the man of God had begged grace with respect to
   internal enemies, to the bosom enemy the flesh, that no sin might have
   dominion over him; now he beggeth deliverance from external enemies.
   The saints are not only exercised with their own corruptions, but the
   malice of wicked men. We have to do both with sin and sinners, with
   temptations and persecutions; and therefore he desireth first to be
   kept from sin, and after that from danger and trouble; first from the
   dominion of sin, and then from the oppression of sinners. Both are a
   trouble to us; they were a trouble to David; and God can and will in
   time give us deliverance from both, deliver me from the oppression of
   man, &c.

   In the text we have--

   1. A prayer for mercy.

   2. A resolution, vow, and promise of duty. The one is inferred out of
   the other, so will I keep thy precepts.

   First, A prayer for mercy, Deliver me from the oppression of man.' In
   the Hebrew it is, from the oppression of Adam, the name of the first
   father, for the posterity. This term is put either by way of
   distinction, aggravation, or diminution.

   1. Man by way of distinction. There is the oppression and tyranny of
   the devil and sin; but the Psalmist doth not mean that now. Hominum non
   daemonum, saith Hugo.

   2. Man by way of aggravation. Homo homini lupus; no creatures so
   ravenous and destructive to one another as man. It is a shame that one
   man should oppress another. Beasts do not usually devour those of the
   same kind, but usually a man's enemies are those of his own household,
   Mat. x. 36. The nearer we are in bonds of alliance, the greater the
   hatred. We are of the same stock, and reason should tell every one of
   us that we should do as we would be done to. Nay, we are of the same
   religion. Eodem sanguine Christi glutinati. We are cemented together by
   the blood of Christ, which obliges to more brotherly kindness; and if
   we differ in a few things, to be sure we have cords of alliance and
   relations enough to love one another more than we do. But for all this
   there is the oppression of man.

   3. Man by way of diminution. And to lessen the fear of this evil, this
   term Adam' is given them, to show their weakness in comparison of God.
   Thou art God, but they that are so ready and for ward to oppress and
   injure us are but men; thou canst easily over rule their power and
   break the yoke. I think this consideration chiefest, because of other
   places: Ps. x. 18, Thou wilt judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
   that the man of the earth may no more oppress.' The oppressors are but
   men of the earth, a piece of red clay, earth in his composition, earth
   in his dissolution, frail men, that must within a while be laid in the
   dust. But it is more emphatically expressed, Isa. li. 12, 13, Who art
   thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the
   son of man that shall be made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy
   maker, which hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations
   of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury
   of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is now the
   rage of the oppressor?' When thou hast the immortal and almighty God to
   be thy protector and saviour, shouldest thou be afraid of a weak mortal
   man, that is but Adam, a little enlivened dust? Within a little while
   he and all his fury is over and gone.

   Secondly, The promise of duty, I will keep thy precepts.' Which is a
   constant observation of all God's commandments, if God would interpose
   for his rescue. But did David do well to suspend his obedience upon so
   uncertain a condition? I answer--No; we must not understand it so as if
   he did indent with God upon those terms and no otherwise; or as if
   before he had not kept them; and would then begin. No; he would keep
   them, however, and had kept them; only this would be a new engagement
   to press him to keep them more constantly, more accurately. Look
   throughout this psalm, and you shall find David still at his duty
   whatever his condition be: ver. 51, The proud have had me greatly in
   derision; yet have I not declined from thy law.' There he is scorned,
   but not discouraged. Ver. 61, The hands of the wicked have robbed me;
   yet have I not forgotten thy law.' There plundered, wasted, stripped of
   all, yet not discouraged. Ver. 69, The proud have forged a lie against
   me; but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.' There falsely
   accused, but not discouraged. Ver. 83, I am become like a bottle in the
   smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.' There dried up and shrunk
   into nothing, yet not discouraged. Ver. 87, They had almost consumed me
   upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.' Ver. 141, I am small and
   despised; yet I do not forget thy precepts.' So that his meaning was,
   not that he would serve God no longer unless he would deliver him; but
   the meaning is, he should have a new obligation and encouragement: this
   will engage me afresh. He doth aforehand interpose a promise that he
   would walk with God more closely. From the words thus opened, we have
   three points:--

   1. Deliverance from oppression is a blessing to be sought from the
   hands of God in prayer.

   2. When God delivereth us from the oppression of man, we should be
   quickened and encouraged in his service.

   3. When we are praying for deliverance, we may interpose a promise of
   obedience.

   First, For the first point, that deliverance from oppression is a
   blessing to be sought from the hands of God in prayer. I shall show it
   first by answering the question why, and then show you how.

   1. Why? The point may be strengthened by these reasons:--

   [1.] We have liberty to ask temporal things. Many think it too carnal
   to pray for health, food and raiment, long life, temporal deliverance.
   What God hath promised we may lawfully pray for; for a prayer is but a
   promise put in suit. Now these blessings are adopted into the covenant,
   as being useful to us in our passage; and therefore we may ask them.
   What Christ has taught us to pray for, that we may pray for; for he
   said, After this manner pray ye,' Mat. vi. 9; and one request is, Give
   us this day our daily bread.' Protection and maintenance we ask, as
   well as pardon and grace. It conduceth to the honour of God that we
   should ask these things of him, that we may testify our dependence, and
   acknowledge his inspection and government over the affairs of the
   world: Ps. ix. 7, He hath prepared his throne for judgment.' Courts of
   justice among men are not always open to hear the plaintiff, but the
   Lord holdeth court continually; we may come to the Lord every day. No
   man's petition and complaint is delayed for an hour. He hath prepared
   his throne for this end and purpose, to hear the complaints of his
   people when they are oppressed; therefore we may pray for temporal
   things.

   [2.] Our spiritual welfare is concerned in such temporal deliverances,
   that we may serve God without impediment, and without distraction. (1.)
   The oppression of man is an impediment; it taketh us off from many
   opportunities of service and bringing honour to God; and though God
   will dispense with us at such a time, yet it is uncomfortable; as God
   dispensed with David when he was hunted up and down the wilderness: Ps.
   lxiii., lxxxiv., xlii. As Christ biddeth them pray, Mat. xxiv. 20, Pray
   that your flight be not in the winter, or on the sabbath-day.' Though
   it was lawful, it was grievous; as grievous to the body to have their
   flight in winter, and grievous to the soul to have it on a sabbath-day,
   that might call to mind their pleasant opportunities of conversing with
   God by prayer. When God denieth liberty and opportunity of enjoying and
   performing the exercises of religion, we are excused from positive
   duties. But yet it is a great mercy to have our liberty restored, to
   serve God in peace without distraction, to have a little
   breathing-time: Acts xix. 31, Then had the churches rest.' The
   oppressions and persecutions of men are among the temptations, and may
   weaken obedience to God; and if not altogether drive us from his
   service, yet clog our spirits and hinder our cheerfulness and readiness
   in it: Eccles. vii. 7, Oppression will make a wise man mad.' It will
   strangely shake and discompose our spirits, especially as it may be
   circumstantiated; that is, when we have base indignities put upon us,
   as when exposed to all manner of insolency and contempt: Ps. cxxiii. 4,
   Have mercy upon us, for we are filled with contempt.' Our friends
   afraid to pity us, Eccles. iv. 1. Take it at best, it is no small
   discouragement and trial to a godly man. Therefore it being so that
   oppression is ever reckoned among the temptations, we may pray not to
   enter into temptation; as Theophylact observeth well on the place, the
   rather because one way by which God helpeth his people is by taking
   away the temptation, as well as ministering a supply of grace: Ps.
   cxxv. 4, The rod of the wicked shall not always rest upon the lot of
   the righteous;' 1 Cor. x. 13, But will with the temptation also make a
   way to escape, that we may be able to bear it.'

   [3.] The glory of God is concerned. His people will honour him more if
   one, especially an eminent one, be delivered from the oppression of
   man: Ps. cxlii. 7, Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy
   name: the righteous shall compass me about, for thou shalt deal
   bountifully with me.' They will be flocking about him, and inquiring
   what experiences of God and his goodness he hath found: 2 Cor. i. 11,
   Helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us,
   by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our
   behalf.' Much more when the whole church is delivered: Ps. li. 18, 19,
   Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion; build thou the walls of
   Jerusalem: thou shalt be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness,'
   &c. Every heart will be thinking of honour and praise to God. And
   besides the honour done to God by his people, God will more discover
   himself to the world, his justice will be more evidenced: Ps. ix. 16,
   The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth.' The world is led
   by sense; he will not be taken to be a friend to persecutors and
   oppressors. In short, it is not for the honour of God that his people
   should be left under oppression, as if he sought not, and cared not for
   their welfare. You shall see the afflicted condition of the church is
   called the reproach of the heathen,' Ezek. xxxvi. 30; and Ezek. xxxiv.
   29, Thou shalt not bear the reproach of the heathen any more.' The
   heathen would cast this in their teeth, as if their God had no respect
   to them, or were not able to help them.

   [4.] Prayer engageth us to constancy. God's deliverance will be better
   for us than our own; that is, than those sinful shifts and ways of
   escape that we can find out. What we ask of God must be had in God's
   way. It bindeth us to seek no other way of escape than we can commend
   to God's blessing in prayer. It is said of the saints, Heb. xi. 35,
   That they were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might
   receive a better resurrection.' Would any refuse deliverance when it is
   tendered to them? Yes, upon such spiteful conditions: they were
   commanded to do something contrary to the laws of God; therefore they
   would have God's deliverance, not their own. Every one of them was
   offered release in the midst of their torments and tortures, if they
   would yield to the eating of swine's flesh, or that which was forbidden
   by God.

   [5.] Seeking deliverance at the hands of God doth ease the heart of a
   great deal of trouble, and deliver it from those inordinate affections
   and afflicting and tormenting passions which otherwise the oppression
   of man might raise in us; as fear, grief, sorrow, anger, envy, and
   despair; fear and dread to suffer more, grief and sorrow for what we
   suffer already, anger and envy against those oppressors by whom we
   suffer, and despair and impatience because of the continuance of our
   molestations and sufferings. All these are mischiefs to the soul, and
   all these are cured by prayer.

   (1.) Fear, because of the mightiness of them that oppress, or threaten
   to oppress. The fear of man we are told is a snare: Prov. xxix. 25, The
   fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord
   shall be safe.' We are full of distracting and perplexing thoughts, and
   if we cherish them they will weaken our trust in God and dependence
   upon his promises; for fear of man and trust in God are there opposed.
   Nay, the mischief will not stop there; for they that trust not God can
   never be true to him: it will destroy our trust in God, and then we
   shall run to carnal shifts, and so fear men more than God, do things
   displeasing to God for fear of being oppressed by men; so that you may
   be soon sensible of the mischief of carnal fear. But how shall we ease
   our hearts of this burden by prayer? Partly because then we use our
   fear aright when it only driveth us to seek his protection; that is the
   commendable use of fear: 2 Chron. xx. 3, Jehoshaphat feared, and set
   himself to seek the Lord.' When Jacob feared Esau, he set himself to
   wrestle with God, Gen. xxxii. And partly because prayer discovereth a
   higher object of fear: Eccles. v. 8,. There is a higher than the
   highest regardeth, and there be higher than they.' And so the fear of
   God driveth out the fear of man, as a great nail driveth out the less.
   In God's strength we may defy enemies: Ps. xxvii. 1, The Lord is my
   light and salvation, whom shall I fear?' The Lord is the strength of my
   life, of whom shall I be afraid?' We can set God against the creature,
   and this will quell our fears of them. When we set ourselves against
   them, our interest against theirs, we may see cause to fear; but set
   God against them and engage him, and you have no cause to fear. Then--

   (2.) For grief and sorrow. It cloggeth the heart, and stayeth the
   wheels, so that we drive on heavily in the spiritual life. Worldly
   sorrow worketh death, 2 Cor. vii. 10. It brings on deadness and
   hardness of heart, and quencheth all our vigour: Prov. xv. 13, By
   sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.' A dead and heavy heart doth
   little to the purpose for God. Now how shall we get rid of this? The
   cure is by prayer; for vent giveth ease to all our passions: Phil. iv.
   6, Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
   supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto
   God.' As when wind is gotten into the caverns of the earth, it causeth
   terrible convulsions and earthquakes till it get a vent; so the mind is
   eased when we can pour out our care into the bosom of God, and wait
   till deliverance cometh from above. Prayer showeth there is some life
   in our affairs, that our right for the present is not dead, but sleeps;
   there is a God in heaven, that heareth our groans, and is sensible of
   our sorrows, and then we may say, Ps. xlii. 5, Why art thou cast down,
   O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for
   I shall yet praise him,' &c. Prayer is the old refuge of the saints,
   and the blessed means to pluck up their spirits. Whilst there is a God
   in heaven, we are not at an utter loss. So ver. 9, I will say unto God,
   my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the
   oppressor?' David first reasoned with him self, yet the distemper
   continued; but when he comes to reason the case with God in prayer,
   then he gets ease.

   (3.) The violent passions of anger, envy, and revenge against
   oppressors, these are all naught, and do a world of mischief. Anger
   discomposeth us, and transports the soul into uncomely motions against
   God and men, makes us fret and malcontent; it tempts us to atheism, Ps.
   lxxiii., maketh us weary of well-doing, Ps. xxxvii., tempts us to
   imitation of their wicked course. The devil worketh much upon spleen
   and stomach and discontent, and we are apt to run into these disorders.
   Now how shall we do to get rid of these distempers? By prayer, in which
   we get a sight and prospect of the other world, and then these things
   will seem nothing to us; acquaint ourselves with God, and the process
   of his providence, and so we shall see an end of things, Ps. lxxiii.
   17; then all is quiet. And as for revenge, too, that is an effect of
   the former; when we plead before God, we see the justice of what is
   unjust, and hard dealing from men to be justly inflicted by God; and so
   the heart is calmed: The Lord bid him curse,' 2 Sam. xvi. 11. There is
   reason enough for this dispensation in the upper tribunal, whereunto
   when we appeal we should render no man evil for evil, Rom. xii. 17. We
   ought not, we need not, it is God's work: Deut. xxxii. 35, Vengeance
   and recompense are mine.' Nay, our very praying is a committing
   ourselves to him that judgeth righteously, 1 Peter ii. 23. In prayer we
   vent our zeal, and that hindereth us from venting our carnal passions.
   It is a resignation of our person and cause to him under unjust
   sufferings, not out of malice, desiring judgment and vengeance on
   persecutors; that is to make God the executioner of our lusts, to
   establish that which we would prevent in prayer. But saints in prayer
   labour only to show their faith and meekness, and to leave things to
   the righteous judge, to do what is for his own glory, and their good.

   (4.) For the other evil, impatience and despair, it is a very great
   evil, and contrary to faith and hope and dependence, which the
   Christian religion doth mainly establish; and maketh way for the worst
   evils, either total apostasy from God, or atheism, or self-destruction.
   Now this is very incident to as when oppressions lie long upon us: 2
   Kings vi. 33, This evil is from the Lord: why should I wait on the Lord
   any longer?' So Jer. ii. 25, But thou saidst, There is no hope.'
   Desperately! No; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go;'
   I will take my own course; there is no hope; it is in vain to wait upon
   the Lord any longer. And if things do not grow to that height, yet the
   children of God grow weary and faint in their minds, Heb. xii. 3. Now
   we keep afoot some hope while we have a heart to call upon God. The
   suit is still depending in the court of heaven when it seems to be over
   on earth; and we see there is cause to wait for God's answer. He that
   shall come, will come, Hab. ii. 3. God may tarry long, but will never
   come too late. Thus why.

   2. But how is this to be asked?

   [1.] This is not to be asked in the first place, as our main blessing:
   Mat. vi. 33, First seek the kingdom of God.' If we seek our ease and
   temporal felicity only, that prayer is like a brutish cry: Hosea vii.
   14, They howled upon their beds for corn and wine.' A dog will howl
   when he feels anything inconvenient. You will never be freed from
   murmuring and quarrelling at God's dispensations, and questioning his
   love, if this be the first thing that you seek, and so your prayers
   will become your snare. Besides the great dishonour to God, it argues
   the great disorder of your affections, that you can be content to have
   anything apart from God: Ps. cv. 4, Seek ye the Lord and his strength;
   seek his face evermore.' In all conditions that must be our great
   request, that we may have the favour of God.

   [2.] It must be asked with submission. It is not absolutely promised,
   nor intrinsically and indispensably necessary to our happiness, but if
   the Lord see it fit for his own glory and our good. We cannot take it
   ill if a friend refuse to lend us a sum of money which he knoweth we
   will lay out to our loss and detriment. God seeth it fit sometimes, for
   his own glory and our good, to continue us under oppression, rather
   than take us out of it. There are two acts of providence--relieving and
   comforting the oppressed, and punishing the oppressors. Sometimes God
   doth the one without the other, sometimes both together. Sometimes God
   will only comfort the oppressed; we cry to him in our afflictions, and
   God will not break the yoke, but give us a supply of strength to bear
   it: Ps. cxxxviii. 3, In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and
   hast strengthened me with strength in my soul.' He giveth you strength
   to bear the burden, if you continue in your integrity. Sometimes God
   doth punish the oppressor, yet that is no relief and reparation to you;
   you must bear it, for you are to stand to God's will, and to wait his
   leisure to free you from it.

   [3.] Your end must be that God may be glorified, and that you may serve
   him more cheerfully. So it is in the text, Deliver me from the
   oppression of man,' then shall I keep thy precepts;' Ps. ix. 13, 14,
   Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider my trouble which I suffer of them
   that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; that I
   may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Sion: and
   I will rejoice in thy salvation.' So David beggeth salvation in order
   to praise. Temporal mercy should not be loved for itself, nor sought
   for itself; but as we may glorify God by it; that is to be our end.
   Lord, I seek not my own interest, but thine. If you have a carnal end,
   you miss: James iv. 3, Because you ask to consume it upon your lusts,'
   that we may please the flesh as sweetly and quietly as we did before,
   live in the height of pomp and splendour, gratify our lusts without
   disturbance, or see our revenge; or if a mere natural end, the mere
   conveniency of the outward man, we bespeak our own denial.

   [4.] We must pray in faith that God can and is ready to deliver from
   the oppression of man, and will do so in due time, when it is good for
   us.

   (1.) God can deliver us. Though our oppressors be never so mighty and
   strong, God can break their power, or change their hearts, or determine
   their interests, because the omnisciency of God is a great deep. It is
   a great relief to the soul to consider the several ways that God hath
   to right us, either by changing the hearts of the persecutors and
   oppressors: Acts ix. 31, Then had the churches rest throughout all
   Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified; and, walking in the fear
   of the Lord and the comforts of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.' They
   had nothing to do but to build up one another. When was that? When Paul
   was converted. He was an active instrument against the church, and God
   turned his heart; then had the churches rest. Or else the Lord may do
   it by determining their interests that they shall show favour to his
   people though their hearts be not changed: Prov. xvi. 7, When a man's
   ways please the Lord, he maketh his enemies to be at peace with him.'
   Enemies, while enemies, may be at peace with us. Please men, and you
   cannot say God is your friend; but please God, and he maketh your
   enemies at peace with you. There is much in the secret chain of
   providence: Dan. i. 9, Now the Lord brought Daniel into favour and
   tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.' What was that favour? To
   wink at him for doing that which was contrary to the law of their
   religion. Or else he can break the yoke by some apparent ruining
   judgments, by which he will defeat all their advantages, either by
   power or law, rescuing his people out of their hands: Isa. xlix. 24,
   25, Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
   delivered? But thus saith the Lord, The captains of the mighty shall be
   taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: he will
   contend with him that contendeth with thee, and will save thy
   children.' Whether they plead might or right, when God goeth that way
   to work, nothing shall let, no power shall be able to detain what God
   will have delivered and restored. Or it may be by some secret ways God
   will bring on some judgment: Job xx. 26, A fire not blown shall consume
   him;' that is, the oppressor; a curse not invented by those he hath
   wronged, or any man else, but sent immediately by God. It shall come
   nobody knoweth how. Therefore we should not be discouraged with
   unlikelihoods when we go to God, who hath many ways which poor
   short-sighted creatures cannot foresee.

   (2.) He is ready. The love which the Lord hath for his afflicted people
   will not suffer his justice to be long at quiet. That God is ready to
   help and deliver, three things will evidence:--

   (1st.) It is his nature to pity and show mercy to the oppressed, and to
   revenge the oppressor. He pitieth the afflictions of them that suffer
   most justly, and far beneath their desert, from his own hand: Judges x.
   16, And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the
   Lord, and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel;' and 2 Kings
   xiv. 26, For the Lord saw the exceeding bitter affliction of Israel.'
   How much more will he pity them that are unworthily oppressed! Isa.
   lxiii. 9, In all their afflictions he was afflicted;' Acts vii. 34, I
   have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and have heard
   their groaning,' &c. And the Lord's pitiful nature doth incline him to
   deliver his people: And when the oppressed cry, I will hear them; for I
   am gracious,' Exod. xxii. 21-27.

   (2dly.) It is his usual practice and custom: Ps. ciii. 6, The Lord
   executeth judgment and righteousness for all that are oppressed.' If
   for all, surely for his people. He sits in heaven on purpose to rectify
   the disorders of men. So Ps. xxxiv. 19, Many are the troubles of the
   righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all.' God hath a
   plaister for every wound; God's people plunge themselves into trouble,
   and his mercy delivereth them out of it.

   (3dly.) It is his office as judge of the world: Ps. xciv. 2, Lift up
   thyself, thou judge of the earth; render a reward to the proud: shall
   not the judge of the earth do right?' Look upon him only in that
   notion, according to our natural conceptions, as the supreme cause and
   judge of all things. Again, his office as protector of his people; he
   is in covenant with them, he is their sun and shield, he is the refuge
   of the oppressed, his people's refuge in time of trouble, Ps. ix. 9;
   when they have none else to fly to, he will be their refuge.

   (3.) He will do it when it is good and necessary; for God hath made
   promises and repeated promises of deliverance, and surely these are not
   in vain. If God had spoken but once, we had no reason to doubt; but he
   telleth us over and over again we should cast our care upon him, and
   refer all things to him without despondency and distraction of mind:
   Ps. ix. 18, For the needy shall not always be forgotten; the
   expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.'

   Use. Instruction to teach us what to do when we are oppressed.

   1. Patience. It is the lot of God's children to be often troubled by
   the world, and hardly used. Satan is the ruler of the darkness of this
   world, the blind, carnal, malicious, superstitious part of the world;
   and they cannot away with those that would overturn Satan's kingdom.
   The good are fewest, and therefore we must look to be oppressed; if
   there be any breathing-time it is a mercy: 2 Tim. iii. 12, Yea, and all
   that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;' Gal.
   iv. 29, For as he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was
   born after the spirit, even so it is now,' and will be so; we should
   want our way-mark without it.

   2. Let us be prepared to commend our cause to God: Ps. x. 17, 18, Lord,
   thou hast heard the desire of the humble; thou wilt prepare their
   heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear; to judge the fatherless and
   the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.' God
   prepares the hearts of the humble. How so? The trouble continueth till
   we are sensible of the misery of the sin, of the cause: Hosea v. 15, I
   will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offences,
   and seek my face; in their affliction they will seek me early.' It is a
   long time before men can be sensible of the hand of God upon them.
   Slight spirits are not grieved, but lull themselves asleep, Jer. v. 3.
   If they have a natural sense of the judgment, they have no sense of sin
   as the cause; then they fly to human help to be eased of the trouble:
   Jer. iv. 14, Wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved;
   how long shall vain thoughts lodge within thee?' When past human help,
   then seek the favour of God to take up the controversy, 2 Chron. vii.
   14; when driven to an earnest attendance upon God, and all
   probabilities spent; we have no help but what heaven and a promise can
   afford, and upon these terms continue our importunity, Luke xviii.
   7-18. It is a long time ere men will lay it to heart, to see his hand
   and seek to him for relief.

   3. When you have prayed, then wait. It is a good sign when we are
   enlarged in prayer, and encouraged to wait. Enlarged to pray; for when
   God hath a mind to work, he sets the Spirit of prayer a-work. God will
   not pour out his Spirit in vain; the Spirit knoweth the deep things of
   God: Ps. l. 15, Call upon me in a time of trouble, and I will deliver
   thee.' So when we are encouraged to wait. How can our prayers be heard
   when we regard them not ourselves, and expect no issue? How should God
   hear when we pray out of course, and do not think our prayers worth the
   regarding? Ps. lxxxv. 8, I will hearken what God the Lord will speak,'
   &c.; Ps. xl. 1, I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined unto me
   and heard my cry;' Hab. ii. 1, I will watch to see what he will say.'
   Look for an answer. God doth not usually disappoint a waiting people.

   Secondly, When God delivereth us from the oppression of man, we should
   be quickened and encouraged in his service.

   1. Because every mercy inferreth an answerable duty: 2 Chron. xxxii.
   25, But Hezekiah rendered not according to the benefit done unto him.'
   There must be rendering according to receiving.

   2. This is the fittest return, partly because it is real, not verbal.
   The Lord cares not for words; he knows the secret springs of the heart,
   Isa. xxxviii. 9; and see Ps. l. 23. It is good to be speaking good of
   God's name. This is one way of glorifying, but ordering the
   conversation aright is that which is most pleasing to him. And partly
   too because our clogs of fear and sorrow and other impediments are
   taken away: Ps. cxix. 32, I will run the ways of thy commandments when
   thou shalt enlarge my heart.' This was God's end, to deliver us out of
   the hands of our enemies, that we may serve him without fear, Luke i.
   74, 75. Those wretches that said, Jer. vii. 10, We are delivered to do
   all these abominations,' to return to the practices of their vile
   courses afresh, did pervert God's end in their deliverance. What use
   shall we make of such a point in our deep sorrows?

   Ans. 1. We are not altogether without this benefit: 2 Chron. vii. 12,
   The Lord said, I have heard thy prayer.' Many times God maketh his love
   conspicuous to his people in a low condition; they are oppressed sore,
   but not grinded to powder; it is a blessing we are not quite destroyed.
   Exod. i. 12, The Israelites, the more they were afflicted, the more
   they multiplied; and the Egyptians were grieved for the children of
   Israel, that they were not extinguished. God dealeth with us as then he
   did with them, 2 Sam. xii. 7. But I will grant them some deliverance.

   2. We are now under the sad effects of our former unthankfulness, and
   by remembering our duty we may see our sin, Hosea iv. 3, 4. Ingratitude
   and walking unanswerably to received mercy is the great and crying sin
   of God's people; therefore we should humble ourselves that we did so
   little good in former times of liberty, that God had so little glory
   and service from us. Now God by his present providence showeth us the
   difference: Deut. xxviii. 47, 48, Because thou servest not the Lord thy
   God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of
   all things; therefore thou shalt serve thine enemies,' &c.; 2 Chron.
   xii. 8, Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my
   service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.' First we
   must be humbled for the abuse of former mercies before we seek new.

   3. That we may know what to have in our eye, when we are asking for
   mercies. The end is first in intention, though last in execution. Do
   not pray to serve thy lusts more freely, nor think how to execute
   revenge, be quits with those that hate us, nor how we shall be provided
   for; but what glory and service we may bring to God: Ps. lxxv. 2, When
   I shall receive the congregation, I will judge uprightly.' These
   mercies must not be abused to licentiousness, or to nourish our selves
   in sin or stupid security; but in duty and service.

   4. It teacheth us how to make our promises, and oblige ourselves to
   God. When you come to promise duty and obedience to God, be sure to be
   sincere and holy; make due provision that it may be so by mortifying
   the roots of such distempers as will betray us. When a people in a low
   condition have a real inclination to praise and glorify God by their
   mercies as soon as they shall receive them, it is an argument God will
   hear and grant.

   Thirdly, But when we are praying for deliverance, we should inter pose
   promises of obedience, as David doth here, Deliver me from the
   oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.' (1.) To show there is
   the ratio dati et accepti, to show the law of giving and receiving is
   natural to us; it is an ingrafted principle in men's minds. When we
   think of God's giving, we should think of returning something. An
   intercourse between God and us is maintained by mercies and duties: not
   that God needeth, or that we can oblige him, but this qualifieth us.
   Intercourse is lost when we would receive all and return nothing. (2.)
   A solemn promise is necessary to excite and quicken our dulness, or a
   bond upon us, or a bridle to our inconstancy. We cannot unbind
   ourselves again from our strict obligation to obedience.

   Use. Well, then, let us make good the vows of our distress; they must
   be paid, or else God is mocked: Eccles. v. 4, When thou vowest a vow
   unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay
   that which thou hast vowed;' Job xxii. 27, Thou shalt make thy prayer
   unto him, and he shall hear thee; and thou shalt pay thy vows.'
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CL.

   Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
   statutes.--Ver. 135.

   THIS verse is wholly precatory. Most of the verses of this psalm have a
   prayer with an argument, but here both the branches are petitory.
   Observe in the words--

   1. The blessings prayed for.

   2. The order of these petitions.

   3. The connection that is between them.

   1. The blessings he prayeth for are two--(1.) For God's favour; (2.)
   For his direction in God's ways; spiritual consolation and increase of
   sanctification. David could not live out of God's favour nor without
   his direction; therefore he prays heartily for both.

   2. The order of these petitions--first, Make thy face to shine;' and
   then, Teach me thy statutes.' God's favour is the fountain of all
   goodness to his children and servants; and until we have that we can
   have nothing: there we must begin. They that have not the favour of God
   are left to their own sway, and their own hearts and counsels; but
   those whom he loves know his secrets and are guided by his Spirit.

   3. The connection. He prays not for one, but for both; for God giveth
   both together, consolation and direction, and we must seek both
   together; for we cannot expect God should favour us while we walk in a
   wrong way and contrary to his will.

   Let me speak of the first petition. Where I might observe--

   1. The matter of the petition, make thy face to shine.

   2. The person, upon me.

   3. The character by which he describeth himself, thy servant.

   1. As to the matter, Make thy face to shine.' It is a metaphor taken
   from the sun. When the sun shines, and sheds abroad his light and heat
   and influence, then the creatures are cheered and revived; but when
   that is obscured, they droop and languish. What the sun is to the
   outward world, that is God to the saints. Or else here is a metaphor
   taken from men, that look pleasantly upon those in whom they delight;
   and so the Lord gives a smile of his gracious countenance upon his
   people: indeed it alludeth to both; for the allusion to the light and
   influence of the sun is clear in the word shine;' and the allusion to
   the pleasant countenance of a man upon his child is included in. the
   word face.' The phrase may be understood by what is said, Prov. xvi.
   15, In the light of the king's countenance is life, and his favour is
   as a cloud of the latter rain.' That place will illustrate this we have
   in hand. Look, what the smiling and pleasing aspect of the king is to
   those that value and stand in need of his favour, that is the favour of
   God to the saints. The same form of speech is used in other places; as
   in the form of the priest's blessing: Num. vi. 25, The Lord make his
   face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee;' and in that
   prayer, Ps. lxvii. 1, God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause
   his face to shine upon us, Selah.' Well, then, the thing begged is a
   sense of God's love.

   2. For whom doth David beg this? For himself, Cause thy face to shine
   upon me;' David, a man after God's own heart. But did he need to put up
   such a request to God? (1.) Possibly God might seem to neglect him, or
   to look upon him with an angry countenance, because of sin; and
   therefore he begs some demonstration of his favour and good-will. David
   had his times of darkness and discomfort as well as others, therefore
   earnestly beggeth for one smile of God's face. (2.) If you look not
   upon him as under desertion at this time, the words then must be thus
   interpreted: he begs the continuance and increase of his comfort and
   sense of God's love. God's manifestations of himself to his people in
   this world are given out in a different degree, and with great
   diversity. Our assurance or sense of his love consists not in puncto,
   an indivisible point; it hath a latitude, it may be more and it may be
   less, and God's children think they can never have enough of it;
   therefore David saith, Lord, cause thy face to shine.' If it did shine
   already, the petition intimates the continuance and increase of it.

   3. He characterised himself by the notion of God's servant; as Ps.
   xxxi. 16, Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me, for thy
   mercies' sake.' We must study to approve ourselves to be the Lord's
   servants by our obedience. If we would have his face shine upon us, we
   must be careful to yield obedience unto him.

   The points are four:--

   1. The sense of God's favour may be withdrawn for a time from his
   choicest servants.

   2. The children of God, that are sensible of this, cannot be satisfied
   with this estate, but they will be praying for some beams of love to be
   darted out upon their souls.

   3. They that are sensible of the want or loss of God's favour have
   liberty with hope and encouragement to sue out this blessing, as David
   did: Lord, make thy face to shine upon thy servant.'

   4. God's children, when they beg comfort, they also beg grace to serve
   him acceptably.

   First, The sense of God's favour may be withdrawn for a time from his
   choicest servants. David puts up this petition in point of comfort.
   There is a twofold desertion--in appearance and in reality.

   1. In appearance only, through the misgivings of our own hearts. We may
   think God is gone, and hides his face, when there is no such matter, as
   through inadvertency we may seek what we have in our hands. Thus a
   child of God thinks he is cast out of the presence of God when all the
   while he hath a full right and place in his heart. Thus David, Ps.
   xxxi. 22. We think God hath forgotten us, neglects us, casts us off,
   hath no respect for us, when in the meantime the Lord is framing an
   answer of grace for us. One chief cause is misinterpreting God's
   providence, and our manifold afflictions. The Lord sometimes frowns
   upon his children, as Joseph upon his brethren, when his affections
   were very strong; so the Lord covers himself with frowns and anger, the
   visible appearance of it speaks no otherwise.

   2. It may be really when he is angry for sin: Isa. lvii. 17, For the
   iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him; I hid me and
   was wroth.' As the fathers of our flesh show their anger by whipping
   and scourging the bodies of their children, so the Father of our
   spirits by lashing the soul and spirits, by causing them to feel the
   effects of his angry indignation. Or else withdrawing the spirit of
   comfort, suspending all the acts and fruits of his love, so that they
   have not that joyful sense of communion with God as they were wont to
   have. Now the reasons why God's people may want the light of his
   countenance are these:--

   [1.] God out of sovereignty will exercise us with changes here in the
   world, even in the inward man; there we have our ebbs and flows, that
   we may know earth is not heaven. He hath an eternity wherein to reveal
   his love, and to communicate himself to his people; therefore he will
   take a liberty as to temporal dispensations: Isa. liv. 8, In a little
   wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with ever lasting
   kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.' He
   hath an everlasting love and kindness for us, therefore here in the
   world he will exercise us with some uncertainties; as David concealed
   his love towards his son Absalom, when yet his bowels yearned towards
   him. Here he takes liberty to do it, because he will make it up in
   heaven. All your changes shall then be recompensed by an uninterrupted
   comfort.

   [2.] To conform us to Jesus Christ. We should not know the bitter
   agonies our Redeemer sustained for us unless we had some experience of
   it ourselves. He tasted of this cup, Mat. xxvii. 46. And though it be a
   bitter cup, yet it must go round; we must all pledge him in it. Conceit
   will not inform us so much as experience.

   [3.] His justice requires it, when we surfeit of our comforts, and play
   the wantons with them, that he should withdraw them. We ourselves breed
   the mist and clouds which hide from us the shining of God's favour. We
   raise up those mountains of transgression that are as a wall of
   separation between us and God; whence that expression, Isa. lix. 2,
   Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins
   have hid his face from you.' As the sun dissolves and dispels mists and
   clouds by his bright beams, so God of his free grace dissolveth these
   clouds: Isa. xliv. 22, I have blotted out thy iniquities as a cloud,
   and thy transgressions as a thick cloud.' Now there are two sins
   especially which cause God to hide himself--(1.) Too free a liberty in
   carnal pleasures and delights; (2.) Spiritual laziness.

   (1.) Too free a liberty in carnal pleasures and delights. When we live
   according to the flesh, we smart for it, these mar our taste; and when
   our affections run out to other comforts, we forfeit those which are
   better, Ps. xxx. 6, 7; when we begin to sleep upon a carnal pillow, to
   compose ourselves to rest, and lie down and dream golden dreams of
   earthly felicity. Carnal confidence and carnal complacency make God a
   stranger to us. This carnal complacency hinders a sense of God's love
   two ways--meritorie et effective, Not only meritoriously, as it
   provokes God to withdraw when we set up an idol in our hearts, but also
   effectively; as carnal delights bring on a brawn and deadness upon the
   heart, so that we cannot have a sense of God's love, for that requires
   a pure, delicate spirit. Our taste must be purged, refined, sensible of
   spiritual good and evil. Now this will never be except the soul be
   purged from carnal complacency; for while there is so strong a relish
   of the flesh-pots of Egypt, we are not fit to taste the hidden manna;
   but always the more dead the heart is to worldly things, the more
   lively to spiritual sense ever: Jude 19, Sensual, not having the
   spirit,' i.e., spiritual joys, feelings, operations. When Solomon
   withheld not his heart from any joy, God left him. When he was trying
   the pleasures of the creature, and went a-whoring from God, God left
   him.

   (2.) Spiritual laziness is another cause why God hides his face from
   his people, Cant. v. 6, compared with ver. 2, 3. The spouse neglected
   to open to Christ upon light and frivolous pretences, and then her
   beloved had withdrawn himself. If we lie down on the bed of security,
   and grow lazy and negligent, then Christ withdraws.

   [4.] It is necessary and useful for us sometimes that God should hide
   his face. Cloudy and rainy days conduce to the fruitfulness of the
   earth, as well as those that are fair and shining; and the winter hath
   its use as well as the summer. We are apt to have cheap thoughts of
   spiritual comforts, Job xv. 11, apt to run riot, and to grow neglectful
   of God and be proud, 2 Cor. xii. 7. Paul had his buffetings to keep
   down his pride. We have changes even in our inward man to keep us in
   the better frame, the more watchful, diligent, and waiting upon God.

   Use. Well, if it be so, all the use I shall make is to put this
   question--Is this your case, yea or no? There is nothing that conduceth
   to the safety and comfort of the spiritual life so much as observing
   God's comings and goings, that we may suit our carriage accordingly.
   Our Lord saith, Mat. ix. 15, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn
   as long as the bridegroom is with them?' Is God present, or is he gone?
   When God is gone, riot to lay it to heart argues great stupidness. You
   are worse than that idolater, Judges xviii. 24. He thought he had
   reason enough for his laments and moans when they had taken away his
   images, his gods. So if God be gone, shall we digest and put up with
   such a loss, and never mind to lay it to heart? Job complains of this,
   chap. xxix. 3, that the candle of the Lord did not shine upon his head
   as it did of old. Surely they that have any respect to God, any
   tenderness left in their hearts, will be sensible of God's going. On
   the other side, if we get anything of God, his grace and favour to our
   hearts, it should be matter of joy and consolation to us: Rom. v. 11,
   We joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now
   received the atonement.' Jesus Christ hath made the atonement, but we
   have received the atonement when we get anything of the blood of Christ
   upon our own consciences, when we have any sense of reconciliation. A
   little sunshine enliveneth the poor creatures, the birds fall a singing
   that were melancholy and sad before in cloudy weather, they are cheered
   and comforted when the sun shines. How should we observe the least
   glimpse of God's favour if he but show himself through the lattice!
   Cant. ii. There is nothing keeps grace lively, and freeth us from a
   dead and stupid formality, so much as this. But when men are careless,
   and do not observe God's accesses and recesses, hardness of heart
   increaseth upon us presently, and loseth that worship and reverence and
   invocation and praise that is due from us to him. Therefore our eye
   should still wait upon the Lord, and as the eyes of servants are on
   their mistresses, Ps. cxxiii. 3, so should our eye be still on God's
   hands, and observe what he gives out in every duty, or what of God we
   observe in this or that ordinance.

   Secondly, The children of God, that are sensible of this, cannot be
   satisfied with this estate; but will be praying and always seeking the
   evidences of his favour and reconciliation: Ps. lxxx. 3, 7, 19, three
   times it is repeated, Turn us again, O Lord of hosts; cause thy face to
   shine, and we shall be saved.' Their great happiness is to be in favour
   with God. They can dispense with other comforts, and can, want them
   with a quiet mind; let God do his pleasure there, but they cannot
   dispense with this, with the want Of his favour and manifested
   good-will to them. This is the life of their lives, the fountain of
   their comforts; this is the heaven they have upon earth, without which
   they cannot joy in themselves: Thou didst hide thy face, and I was
   troubled.' What are the reasons of this?

   1. Because of the value of this privilege; the favour of God is the
   greatest blessing. It may appear in sundry respects. Take but that
   consideration: Ps. lxiii. 3, Thy loving-kindness is better than life.'
   The favour of God is the life of our souls, and his displeasure is our
   death. A child of God values his happiness by God's friendship, not by
   his worldly prosperity; and is miserable by God's absence, and by the
   causes thereof, his sin and offence done to God. Nay, his
   lovingkindness is not only life, but better than life. A man may be
   weary of life itself, but never of the love of God. Many have
   complained of life as a burden, and wished for the day of death, but
   none have complained of the love of God as a burden. All the world
   without this cannot make a man happy. What will it profit us if the
   whole world smile upon us, and God frown and be angry with us? All the
   candles in the world cannot make it day; nay, all the stars shining
   together cannot dispel the darkness of the night nor make it day,
   unless the sun shines; so whatever comforts we have of a higher or
   lower nature, they cannot make it day with a gracious heart, unless
   God's face shine upon us; for he can blast all in an instant. A
   prisoner is never the more secure, though his fellows and companions
   applaud him, and tell him his cause is good, and that he shall escape,
   when he that is judge condemns him. Though we have the good word of all
   the world, yet if the Lord speak not peace to our souls, and shine not
   upon our consciences, what will the good word of the world do? 2 Cor.
   x. 18, He is approved whom the Lord commendeth.' A sense of God's love
   in Christ is the sweetest thing that ever we felt, and is able to
   sweeten the bitterest cup that ever believer drank of: Rom. v. 3, We
   glory in tribulation.' It will be a blessed thing when we cannot only
   bear tribulations, but rejoice in them; but how come we to rejoice in
   them? Why, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
   Holy Ghost, which is given unto us;' so he goes on. If we would know
   the value of things, the best way is to know what is our greatest
   comfort and our greatest trouble in distress; for when we are drunk
   with worldly prosperity and happiness, we are incompetent judges of the
   worth of things; but when God rebukes a man for sin, what is our
   greatest trouble then? that we may take heed of providing sorrow to
   ourselves another time; then we find sin and transgression the greatest
   burden when any notable affliction is upon us, Job xxxvi. 9; and what
   will be your greatest comfort then? for then your comforts are put to
   the proof. One evidence of an interest in Christ, a little sense of the
   love of God, how precious is it! Ps. xciv. 19, In the multitude of my
   thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul.' His thoughts were
   entangled and interwoven one with another, as branches of a crooked
   tree; for so the word signifies there. When his thoughts were thus
   intricate and perplexed, then thy comforts delight my soul.' Oh! then,
   what should we labour for, but to be most clear in this, that God loves
   us. This will be our greatest comfort and rejoicing in all conditions.
   It is good for us in prosperity, then our comforts are sweet; and in
   adversity and deep affliction, to see God is not angry with us. Though
   we feel some smart of his afflicting hand, yet his heart is with us.

   2. They deal with God as worldly men do with sensible things; for as
   others live by sense, so they by faith. Now worldly men are cheered
   with the good-will of men, and troubled with the displeasure of men
   upon whom they depend. The down-look of Ahasuerus confounded Haman, and
   put him to great trouble: He was afraid,' Esther vii. 8. Absalom
   professes it were better for him to be banished than to live in
   Jerusalem and not see the king's face, 2 Sam. xiv. 32. Surely it is
   death to God's children to want his face and favour upon whom they
   depend. Their business lies mainly with God, and their dependence and
   hope and comfort is in God; they live by faith. Poor worldlings walk by
   sense, therefore their souls run out upon other comforts, in the
   smiling face of some great potentate, or some friend of the world: this
   is their life, peace, and joy. But they that live by faith see him that
   is invisible, and value their happiness by his favour, and misery by
   his displeasure.

   3. The children of God have tasted the sweetness of it, therefore they
   know it by experience. The best demonstration of anything is from
   sense. Description cannot give me such a demonstration as when I taste
   and feel it myself: 1 Peter ii. 3, If so be ye have tasted that the
   Lord is gracious.' They have an experimental feeling of that which
   others know only by guess and hearsay. Carnal men know no other good
   but that of the creature. The spouse did so languish after her beloved,
   being sick of love; when her desires were disappointed, it made her
   faint, Cant. v. 6. They that have not seen and known him, know not what
   to make of those spiritual and lively affections that carry us out
   after the favour of God with such earnestness and importunity; but they
   that have tasted and know what their beloved is, their hearts are more
   excited and stirred up towards him: John iv. 10, If thou knewest the
   gift of God,' &c. You would more admire the favour of God if you knew
   it, especially by experience; you would find it is a better good than
   ever you have yet tasted.

   Use. Is this our temper and frame of our hearts? Can we live
   contentedly and satisfiedly without the light of his countenance? A
   child of God may be without the light of his countenance, but cannot
   live contentedly without it. Are we troubled about it, ever seeking
   after it? Surely this is the disposition of the children of God, they
   are ever seeking after the favour of God. I shall press to this by this
   argument.

   1. God bespeaks it from you: Ps. xxvii. 8, Thou saidst, Seek ye my
   face.' There is a dialogue between God and a gracious heart. The Lord
   saith, Seek;' he saith it in his word, and speaks by the injection of
   holy thoughts, by the inspiration of his grace; and the renewed heart,
   like a quick echo, takes hold of this, Lord, thy face will I seek,' Ps.
   cvi. 4. You should ever be seeking after God in his ordinances, seek
   his favour and face.

   2. The new nature inclines and carries the soul to God; it came from
   God, and carries the soul to God again. The spirit of the world doth
   wholly incline us to the world: they that are after the flesh do mind
   the things of the flesh; and the Spirit of God doth incline us to God,
   and therefore the people of God will value his favour above all things
   else. David speaks in his own name, and in the name of all that were
   like-minded with himself; he speaks of all the children of God in
   opposition to the many, the brutish ones, that were for sensual
   satisfaction: Ps. iv. 6, Many say, Who will show us any good? Lord,
   lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.' He doth not say,
   upon me, but upon us, as the common language of all the saints. The
   favour of God is so dear and precious to the saints, that they can
   compare with the affections of carnal men, take them at the greatest
   advantage. He doth not consider their worldly things in their decrease,
   but he considers them when they are increased; and he considers them in
   the very time when they are increased, in the vintage and harvest time.
   The shouting of vintage and joy of harvest are proverbial; and the
   comforts of this life, when new and fresh, most invite delight. They
   that place their happiness in these things cannot have so much joy as
   they that have a sense of their interest in God. Now, shall we be
   wholly strangers to this temper and disposition of soul.

   3. If we be backward to seek after the favour of God, the Lord whips
   his people to it by his providence; for sometimes their spiritual
   disposition may be marred: Hosea v. 15, I will go and return to my
   place, till they acknowledge their offence and seek my face. In their
   affliction they will seek me early.' The Lord withdraws his gracious
   presence for this reason, not that we may seek ease or freedom from
   trouble, but that we may seek his face, and the applying of his grace
   to our consciences.

   4. God is not wholly gone, neither is the desertion total, when there
   is such a disposition in the heart. He hath left something behind him
   which draws you after him. The estimation of God's favour keeps his
   place warm till he come again; it keeps room in the soul: Ps. lxxxviii.
   13, 14, Unto thee have I cried; in the morning shall my prayer prevent
   thee: Lord, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from
   me?' But when they can digest such a loss with patience, it is an
   indifferent thing whether they have any sense of God's love, yea or no.

   5. We find it to be a sad thing to lose any worldly comfort, and shall
   we lose the favour of God too, and never lay it to heart, and live
   contentedly without it? It is a sign we despise that which the saints
   value, and which is the principal blessing; you will not have cheap
   thoughts of the consolation of God, Job xv. 11.

   6. Unless we seek God's favour, all our labour is lost in other duties:
   2 Chron. vii. 14, If my people, that are called by my name, shall
   humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
   wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven,' &c. This is put in among
   other conditions, and without this the promise is not made good to us.
   Many seek to the Lord in their distresses, but it is only for redress
   of temporal evils, or obtaining necessary temporal supplies; but do not
   seek his face: then their prayers are but like howlings, but like the
   moans of beasts, Hosea vii. 14. They do not seek reconciliation and
   communion with God, but only ease and riddance of present trouble.
   Those are not holy prayers.

   7. It is the distinguishing point that will separate the precious from
   the vile, to have a tender sense of God's favour: Ps. xxiv. 6, This is
   the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob.'
   There are many thoughts of interpreters about that place, I find;
   though they differ in it, yet they all agree in this sense, that they
   are the true Israelites, the true Jacob's posterity, that cannot brook
   God's absence, that seek his face, that will not let him go, but strive
   with him till they get the blessing. These are not Israel in the
   letter, but Israel in the spirit. Jacob said, I will not let, thee go
   unless thou bless me,' Gen. xxxii. 26. Such diligent seekers of God
   should we be, never to give over till we find him. Or, as Moses said,
   Lord, if thy presence go not with us, carry us not up hence;' we will
   not stir a foot without thy favour and presence.

   Thirdly, They that are sensible of the want or loss of the favour of
   God have liberty to sue for it with hope and encouragement to find it.
   For so doth David, Make thy face to shine.' Whence comes this liberty?

   1. Because of God's promise, because of the mercy of God pawned to us
   in his promises. He hath told us, none shall seek his face in vain,
   Isa. xlviii. 19; Prov. viii. 17; Ps. xxii. 11, 20. One that seriously
   and diligently is seeking after God, before he hath done his search, he
   shall have some opportunity to bless and praise the Lord; some
   experience of grace shall be given to him, if he conscionably,
   diligently, and seriously seek it.

   2. Because of the mediation of Jesus Christ, you may come in his name
   and seek the favour of God: Ps. xxxvi. 7, How excellent is thy
   loving-kindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust
   under the shadow of thy wings.' Interpreters upon that place conceive
   the shadow of God's wings does not allude to an ordinary similitude of
   a hen that, when vultures and kites are abroad, covers her little ones,
   gathers her chickens under her wings: no; but they think the allusion
   to be to the outstretched wings of the cherubims; and this is the
   ground of our trust and dependence upon God. Let the sons of men put
   their trust under the shadow of his wings, there to find God reconciled
   in Christ; for the throne of grace was a figure of that propitiation.
   He is called the propitiation, God propitiated and reconciled in Christ
   is the throne of grace interpreted. However that be, it is clear, Ps.
   lxxx. 1, Thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.' When
   they would have God hear, they give him the title of one that sits upon
   the mercy-seat, reconciled by Christ. Though the cloud of sin doth hide
   God's favour from thee, he can make it shine again; and here is our
   ground, the merciful invitation of God's promise, and then God
   propitiated in Christ.

   Use. Oh! then, let us turn unto the Lord in prayer, and in the use of
   all other means, humbling ourselves and seeking his favour.

   1. Waiting for it with all needfulness: Ps. cxxx. 6, My soul doth wait
   for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning;' and he
   repeats it again, I say, more than they that watch for the morning.'
   Look, as the weary sentinel that is wet and stiff with cold and the
   dews of the night, or as the porters that watched in the temple, the
   Levites, were waiting for the daylight, so more than they that watch
   for the morning was he waiting for some glimpse of God's favour. Though
   he do not presently ease us of our smart or gratify our desires, yet we
   are to wait upon God. In time we shall have a good answer. God's delays
   are not denials. Day will come at length, though the weary sentinel or
   watchman counts it first long; so God will come at length; he will not
   be at our beck. We have deserved nothing, but must wait for him in the
   diligent use of the means; as Benhadad's servants watched for the word
   brother,' or anything of kindness to drop from the king of Israel.

   2. Work for it: for I press you not to a devout sloth. All good things
   are hard to come by; it is worth all the labour we lay out upon it.
   There is no having peace with God, any sense of his love, without
   diligent attendance in the use of all appointed means: 2 Peter iii. 14,
   Be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and
   blameless;' and 2 Peter i. 10, Give all diligence to make your calling
   and election sure.' That comfort is to be suspected that costs nothing,
   but, like Jonah's gourd, grows up in a night, that comes upon us we
   know not how.

   Fourthly, God's children, when they beg comfort, also beg grace to
   serve him acceptably; for teaching God's statutes is not meant barely a
   giving us a speculative knowledge of God's will: for so David here,
   Make thy face to shine,' and, Teach me thy statutes.' And why do they
   so?

   1. Out of gratitude. They are ingenuous, and would return all duty and
   thankfulness to God, as well as receive mercy from him: therefore they
   are always mingling resolutions of duty with expectations of mercy; and
   when they carry away comforts from him are thinking of suitable
   returns. And while they take Christ for righteousness, they devote and
   give up themselves to his use and service. The nature of man is so
   disposed, that when we ask anything, we promise, especially if a
   superior: Hosea xiv. 2, Take away all iniquity, and receive us
   graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips.' The children of
   God resolve upon duty and service when they ask favour. So Ps. ix. 13,
   14, Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider my trouble; that I may show
   forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion.' We are
   thinking of honouring and praising God at that time when we seek his
   favour.

   2. The children of God do know that this is the cause of God's aversion
   from them, that his statutes are not observed; and therefore, when they
   beg a greater experience of God's special favour, they also beg
   direction to keep his statutes. They cannot maintain and keep up a
   sense of the love of God unless they be punctual in their duty. He
   knows nothing of religion that knows not that the comfort of a
   Christian depends upon sanctification as well as justification; and the
   greater sense of obedience the fuller sense of the love of God; and the
   degrees of manifesting his favour are according to the degrees of our
   profiting in obedience, for these go along still. Jesus Christ is king
   of righteousness and king of peace. He is Melchisedec, king of Salem;
   he pours out the oil of grace that he may pour out the oil of gladness,
   Heb. vii. 2. But especially see one place, John xiv. 21, He that hath
   my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that
   loveth me shall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and will
   manifest myself to him.' Christ was then most sweetly comforting his
   people, but it was not his mind that they should be emboldened thereby
   to cast off duty. No; he says, the only way to assure them that they
   were not delusions, and to clear their right to these comforts, was
   this, He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that
   loveth me; and he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I
   will love him, and will manifest myself to him.' That is the way to get
   confirmation and evidence of the love of God.

   3. This is a notable effect and evidence of God's favour, to guide you
   in his ways; therefore it is a branch of the former, for whom the Lord
   loveth he teacheth and guides: Rom. viii. 14, As many as are the
   children of God, they are led by the Spirit.' Others are left to their
   own heart's counsels. And Ps. xxv. 14, The secret of the Lord is with
   them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.' The
   communication of secrets is a note of friendship. Now the secret of the
   Lord, the knowledge of his covenant, and what belongs thereto, it is to
   those that fear God. There is the qualification.

   4. He showeth that he does not desire a greater proof of God's love. He
   would chiefly experience the good-will of God to him in being taught
   the mind of God. The most slight that which David prizeth. But if our
   hearts were as they should be, we would prefer this before all other
   good things, sanctification, to be taught of God. For--

   [1.] It is a better evidence of God's favour than worldly comforts.
   Pardon freeth us from punishment, sanctification from sin and
   pollution; sin is worse than misery, and holiness is to be preferred
   before impunity. Christ in the work of redemption considered the
   Father's interest and honour as well as your salvation. The taking away
   of worldly comforts doth not infringe our blessedness; yea, when it is
   accompanied with this benefit, it maketh way for the increase of it:
   Ps. xciv. 12, Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and
   teachest him out of thy law.' All the comforts of the world are not
   worth one dram of grace. The loss of them may be supplied with grace,
   and man be happy, comfortable, and blessed for all that; but the loss
   of grace cannot be supplied with temporal things. We cannot say,
   Blessed is the man that hath lost grace for the world's sake. Again,
   all the riches and honours heaped upon a man cannot make him better,
   they may easily make him worse; but grace can never make us worse, but
   always better, more amiable in the eyes of God, and fitter for
   communion with him. These may be given to those whom God hateth, Ps.
   xvii. 14; but this is the favour of his people. Grace is never given
   but to those whom he entirely loveth. These may be given in wrath, but
   sanctifying grace never in wrath. The more we have of these things, the
   more wanton and vain, Deut. xxxii. 15. They are often used as an
   occasion to the flesh, Gal. v. 13. prove fuel to our lusts, increase
   our snares, temptations, difficulties in heaven's way, Luke xviii. 25.
   Our table becometh a snare, Ps. lxix. 22. But the saving graces of the
   Spirit make all easy, and help us towards our own happiness.

   [2.] Profiting in obedience or sanctification is a greater effect of
   God's favour. Sanctification is a greater privilege than justification,
   Perfect and complete holiness and conformity to God is the great thing
   which God designed, as the glory of God is holiness, Exod. xv, 11.
   Moral perfections exceed natural; and of all moral perfections holiness
   is the greatest. It is better to be wise than strong, to be holy than
   wise. Beasts have strength, man hath reason, but holy angels, a holy
   God. Sanctification is a real perfection, but justification is but a
   relative. It rendereth us amiable in the eyes of God. God hateth sin
   more than misery. Sin is against God's very nature. God can inflict
   punishment, but he cannot infuse sin. God's interest and honour is to
   be preferred before our comfort and personal benefit. In
   sanctification, besides our personal benefit, which is the perfection
   of our natures, God's honour and interest is concerned in our
   subjection to him. Justification is a pledge, but sanctification is not
   only a pledge but a beginning; it is removens prohibens. We love him
   for pardoning, but he delighteth in holiness: he delighteth in us
   rather as sanctified than pardoned. We love much because much is for
   given, Luke vii. 47. But God delighteth in the pure and upright: Prov.
   xi. 20, Such as are upright in their way are his delight.'

   Use 1. For reproof of three sorts:--

   1. Of those that would have ease and comfort, but care not for duty;
   would have the love of God to pacify their consciences, but never mind
   this, to have their hearts directed in God's ways: Hosea x. 11, Ephraim
   is as an heifer that is taught, that would tread out the corn but not
   break the clods.' It yielded food, Deut. xxv. 4. They would be feasted
   with privileges, yet abhor service, when they prize comfort. To these
   we may argue not only ab incongruo--how disingenuous it is to separate
   duty and comfort; to be so ready to expect all from God, and so
   unwilling to do anything for him. It is contrary to the disposition of
   God's children, Titus ii. 11, 12, and Rom. xii. 1;--but ab impossibili.
   Will God ever delight in you till you be conformed to his image? Christ
   came not to make a change in God, but in us; not to make God less holy,
   but us more holy. It is not agreeable to the reasonable nature to
   conceive that God should be indifferent to good and bad, or a friend to
   those that break his laws. Would you think well of that magistrate that
   should let men rob and steal and beat their fellow-subjects, and not
   only connive at them but receive them into his bosom? You that have but
   a drop of the divine nature cannot delight in the company of sinners, 2
   Peter ii. 8.

   2. Those that would have the favour of God, but expect it should be
   showed to them in temporal things. Alas! these things are promiscuously
   dispensed to all; can be no evidence of his special love. God is
   behindhand with none of his creatures, Eccles. ix. 1, 2; sometimes evil
   things to good men, and good things to evil men. Josiah died in wars as
   well as Ahab. Is Abraham rich? so is Nabal. Is Joseph honoured by
   Pharaoh? so is Doeg by Saul. Hath Demetrius a good report of all men? 3
   John 12, so have false teachers, Luke vi. 26. Hath Caleb health and
   strength? Josh. xiv. 11, so have wicked ones: No bands in their death;'
   Ps. lxxiii. 4, Their strength is firm. Was Moses beautiful? Acts vii.
   20, so was Absalom, 2 Sam. xiv. 25. Did God give learning and wisdom to
   Moses and Daniel? &c., Dan. i. 17, so to the Egyptians, Acts vii. 22.
   Long life to Ishmael, Gen. xxv. 17, as well as to Isaac, Gen. xxxv. 20.

   3. The children of God that murmur and repine at their sufferings when
   others, ignorant of the mind of God and the strictness of his ways,
   fare better, Ps. xvii. 14. It is often seen that he that increaseth
   knowledge increaseth sorrow,' Eccles. i. 18. Drones and sots have their
   ampler revenues, but we should not be thereby discouraged. It is their
   portion: Prov. iii. 31, 32, Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose
   none of his ways; for the froward are an abomination unto the Lord, and
   his secret is with the righteous.' They are hateful to God while they
   flourish. It is a greater evidence of God's favour and friendship to
   understand his counsel in the word, and to be acquainted with the
   mysteries of godliness, than to enjoy all the power and greatness in
   the world; the knowledge of a despised, hated truth, than to flourish
   in opposition against the ways of God, through ignorance, obstinacy,
   and prejudice.

   Use 2. Is direction to us:--

   1. For strict walking. If we would have a comfortable sense of God's
   love, we must resolve upon a strict course of holy walking: Gal. vi.
   16, And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
   mercy upon the Israel of God;' and Ps. lxxxv. 8, and Eph. iv. 30.

   2. If we would walk strictly, we must go to God for continual
   direction: Ps. lxxxvi. 11, Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy
   truth: unite my heart to fear thy name;' Ps. cxliii. 10, Teach me to do
   thy will, for thou art my God; thy spirit is good, lead me into the
   land of uprightness.' Especially when blinded with interest, or apt to
   be carried away with temptations.

   3. God's teaching is not only directive, but persuasive; it prevents
   sin, Ps. cxix. 133; quickens to duty, Ps. cxix. 33-35. Teach and keep,
   and make me to go; for that is the difference between literal
   instruction, which we have from man, and spiritual instruction, which
   we have from God. God's teaching is drawing, John vi. 44, 45.

SERMON CLI.

   Rivers of water run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
   law.--Ver. 136.

   MOST of the sentences of this psalm are independent, and do not easily
   fall under the rules of method; so that we need not take pains in
   clearing up the context; the verse needs it not, the time permits it
   not: only you may observe this, that often in this psalm David had
   expressed his great joy, and now he maketh mention of his exceeding
   grief. There is a time to rejoice and a time to mourn; as times vary,
   so do duties; we have affections for every condition. Indeed, in this
   valley of tears mourning is seldom out of season, either with respect
   to sin or misery, for ourselves or others. David, that did sometimes
   mourn for his own sins, and watered his couch with tears, Ps. vi. 6, he
   took also his time to mourn and bewail other men's sins: Rivers of
   tears run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.'

   In the words observe David's grief is set out by--

   1. Constancy and greatness of it, rivers of tears run down mine, eyes.

   2. The goodness of the cause or reason of it, because they keep not thy
   law.

   Rivers of tears.' He compares his tears to a stream and river always
   running. The same expression is used Lam. ii. 18, Let tears run down
   like a river day and night; let not the apples of thine eyes cease.'
   When affections are vehemently exercised, the scripture is wont to use
   such kind of expressions. The will of a godly man is above his
   performance; it is wont to do much more than the body can furnish him
   with abilities to express. He had such a large affection that he could
   weep rivers. Because they.' Some refer it to eyes, the immediate
   antecedent; they are usually the inlets of sin; we are first taken by
   the eye, and then by the heart: She saw the fruit that it was good, and
   then did eat of it.' But I rather suppose it is to be referred to men.
   The Hebrews many times do not express a general antecedent. More
   particularly his enemies, Saul and his courtiers; for so he saith, ver.
   139, My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy
   word;' and again, ver. 158, David saith, I beheld the transgressors,
   and was grieved because they keep not thy word.' I have brought these
   places, because parallel with the text; and principally that you may
   not think David was troubled because of any injuries done to himself,
   but because of offences done to God. Keep not thy law.' Keeping of the
   law is to observe it diligently; not only to maintain it, but to retain
   it in our eye and practice. It might be matter of grief to David that
   they of whom he specially speaketh, being persons of power and place,
   did not maintain the law, and keep it from encroachment and violation,
   but suffered abuses to pass unpunished; but he speaketh here of
   retaining the law in their hearts and practice. For it is an expression
   equivalent with that which is used in ver. 139, Because they have
   forgotten thy word.' The point which I shall observe is this--

   Doct. That it is the duty and property of a godly man to mourn
   bitterly, even for other men's sins.

   Here we have David's instance; and it may be suited with the practice
   of all the saints. Jeremiah: see Jer. xiii. 17, But if ye will not
   hear, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride, and mine eyes
   shall weep sore, and run down with tears.' There you have described the
   right temper of a good prophet, first to entreat earnestly for them,
   and in case of refusal to weep bitterly for their obstinacy. Mark, it
   was not an ordinary sorrow he speaks of there, but a bitter weeping,
   Mine eyes shall weep sore and run down with tears.' Not a slight,
   vanishing sigh, not a counterfeited sorrow; soul and eyes were both
   engaged; and this in secret places, where the privacy contributeth much
   to the measure and sincerity of it. Now this is a fit instance of a
   minister of the gospel.' We cannot always prevail when we plead with
   you, and shall not be responsible for it. God never required it at the
   hands of any minister to work grace and to save souls, but to do their
   endeavours. But, alas! we do not learn of Jeremiah to go and mourn over
   their ignorance, carelessness, and obstinacy of those committed to our
   charge. The next example that I shall produce is that of Lot in Sodom,
   2 Peter ii. 7, 8, Who vexed himself, and was vexed from day to day, in
   seeing and hearing their unlawful deeds.' Not with Sodom's injuries,
   but with Sodom's sins. It was mat ter of constant grief to his soul;
   the commonness did not take away the odiousness. My next instance shall
   be our Lord himself; we read very much of his compassion: I shall
   produce but two instances of it. One is in Mark iii. 5, Christ looked
   upon them with anger, and was grieved for the hardness of their
   hearts.' They gave him cause of offence, but it doth not only exercise
   his anger but grief. In our Saviour's anger there was more of
   compassion than passion. He was grieved to see men harden themselves to
   their own destruction. So when he came near to Jerusalem, a city not
   very friendly to him, yet it is said, Luke xix. 41, When he came near
   and beheld the city, he wept over it, and said, If thou hadst known,
   even thou at least in this thy day, the things that belong to thy
   peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes.' Our Lord Jesus was made
   up of compassion; he weepeth not only for his friends but his enemies.
   As a righteous God he inflicted the judgment, but as man he wept for
   the offences. First he shed his tears, and then his blood. O foolish,
   careless city, that will not regard terms and offers of peace in this
   her day! He bewailed them that knew not why they should be bewailed;
   they rejoiced, and he mourned: Christ's eyes are the wetter because
   theirs were so dry. And now he is in heaven, how doth his free grace go
   a mourning after sinners in the entreaties of the gospel! But that I
   may vindicate this point more fully, I shall give--

   1. Some observations concerning mourning for the sins of others.

   2. Give you the reasons of it.

   The observations are these five:--

   1. That it is an absolute duty to preach this doctrine, not only some
   high and raised effect of grace. When we produce these instances and
   examples of the word, David, Lot, Jeremiah, and Christ, many think
   these are rare and extraordinary instances, elevated beyond the
   ordinary line and pitch of Christian practice and perfection. No; it is
   a matter of duty lying upon all Christians. When God goes to mark out
   his people for preservation, who are those that are marked? The
   mourners: Ezek. ix. 4, Go through the midst of the city, and set a mark
   upon the foreheads of them that sigh and cry for all the abominations
   that are done in the midst thereof.' None are marked out for mercy but
   the mourners. The great difference between men and men in the world is
   the mourners in Zion and the sinners in Zion; so that it lieth upon
   all, if we would have God's mark upon us. And the apostle reproveth the
   Corinthians for the want of this mourning: 1 Cor. v. 7, Ye are puffed
   up, when ye should rather have mourned.' Possibly many of the converted
   Corinthians disliked the foulness of the fact, but they did not mourn
   and solemnly lay it to heart; therefore the apostle layeth a charge
   upon them. In all the examples that have been produced, that of Jesus
   Christ only is extraordinary; and yet we are bound to have the same
   mind in us that was in Jesus. We must have the same mind, though we
   cannot have the same measure of affection. Christ had the spirit
   without measure, but we must have our proportion. If David can speak of
   floods, certainly we should at least be able to speak of drops.
   Somewhat of David's and Christ's spirit. Nay, the example of Christ in
   this very thing is propounded by the apostle: Rom. xv. 3, For even
   Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of
   them that reproached thee fell on me.' The apostle speaketh there of
   bearing one another's burdens. Christ would bear the burden of all the
   world. He was moved with a zeal for the dishonour done to God, and
   compassion to men; and so undertook the burden upon him, not to please
   himself, or seek the ease and safety of the natural life. Well, then,
   it is not some raised effect of grace, but a necessary duty which
   concerns all; a frame of heart which all the children of God have. If
   you love God, and love your neighbour, if you believe heaven and hell,
   and have any sense of the truth of the promises or threatenings, you
   will be thus affected in some measure to mourn and grieve for the sins
   of others.

   2. This duty doth chiefly concern public persons, though it lies upon
   all Christians, magistrates and ministers and officers of the church,
   because of their public and universal influence. Public persons must
   have public affections as well as public relations. You shall see in
   that type the church of the Jews is represented in their officers,
   Zech. iii. 1. When the people were corrupted, and in a calamitous
   condition, Joshua the high priest is brought in standing before the
   Lord in filthy garments, the priest is accused by Satan. Certainly
   public persons are more responsible to God than others, and more
   concerned than others in the sins committed in the land, or places
   where they have a charge. Among private persons, a householder is more
   responsible than a private member of the family, if one under his
   charge fall into a notorious sin. You are responsible for your children
   and servants, and so are we for your souls. Under the law, Exod. xxii.
   10, God said if a man did deliver unto his neighbour an ox, or an ass,
   or a sheep, or any beast to keep, and it did die, or was hurt, or was
   driven away, no man seeing it, or it did miscarry through his
   negligence, he was to make it good, because it was delivered into his
   hand. So I may say here, in quoting this law, Hath God a care of oxen?
   God hath committed souls to us, he hath put them into the hands of
   magistrates and ministers to keep them. Now because we do not discharge
   our duty, he will require their blood at our hands, Ezek. xxxiii. 7-9.
   Because of our trust and charge, we are bound to have more public
   affections: Joel ii. 17, Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord,
   weep between the porch and the altar.' Ministers should be exemplar for
   spiritual feeling and tenderness and humiliation. Under the law the
   measures of the sanctuary were double to other measures. I apply it to
   this very thing. Our portion must be greater, because of the burden
   that lies upon us. Paul speaketh as one sensible of the weightiness of
   his charge, in 2 Cor. xi. 29, Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is
   offended, and I burn not?' Paul trembled to see a weak Christian in the
   hands of Satan; and when they had taken offence, and begun to stumble,
   this was his trouble and grief. Mourning and burning is put for the
   violence of any affection. So Jeremiah the prophet, My soul shall weep
   in secret places for your pride.'

   3. That tears are not absolutely necessary for the expression of this
   grief and tenderness. David saith, Rivers of tears.' Why? For grief
   doth not always keep the road and highway; and many times when water
   goes out, wind comes in. Many are puffed up with sensitive trouble, and
   put more upon tears than they do upon the frame of the heart which
   should engage us to this. All constitutions are not: alike moist; a
   tender heart may be matched with a dry brain. When men are careful to
   get things reformed, and are affected with the calamity of the church
   more than their own private loss, this is that which God requires.
   However, let me tell you, if we find tears for other things, we should
   find tears for these duties, when we come to remember our own sins, and
   the sins of others. God did not make the affections in vain. A man that
   hath a thorough sanctified soul will have affections exercised in some
   measure proportionable; and therefore, if we can shed tears abundantly
   upon other occasions, we should remember this water should be reserved
   for sanctuary uses. David when he is spoken of, is represented as one
   having a moist eye upon all occasions; yet Lot had a tender heart,
   being offended with public disorders. It is said, 2 Peter ii. 8, His
   righteous soul was vexed.' Great devotionists are usually very tender.
   Good men are much given to tears, and these sensitive stirrings of
   affection are a great help to religion; and therefore should not wholly
   be neglected. But if there be a serious displacency against sin, a deep
   laying to heart God's dishonour, though they cannot command tears, the
   duty is discharged. Humiliation lieth more in heart grief and trouble,
   than the sensitive and passionate expression of it. And yet upon
   religious occasions we should express ourselves as passionately as we
   can, and not content ourselves with a few cold words and dull thoughts;
   but our liveliest affections should be exercised about the weightiest
   things: James iv. 9, Be afflicted and mourn, and weep; let your
   laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy to heaviness.' When we
   are deprecating the wrath of God, humbling ourselves under the offences
   done to his infinite majesty by ourselves or others, there should be
   more tenderness, and we should do it in the most lively affectionate
   manner that possibly we can.

   4. The greatest sinners, when they are once converted to God, have the
   greatest compassion afterwards towards other sinners. Why? They know
   the heart of a sinning man, they have had most experience of the power
   and prejudice of corruption, and also sensibly tasted of the love of
   God, and his goodness in Christ Jesus; and so their hearts are
   entendered thereby to pity others, and they more earnestly desire
   others should partake with them of the same grace. As Israel were
   pressed to pity strangers, because they themselves were once strangers
   in Egypt, they knew what it was to be neglected and despised in a
   strange land; so they that are acquainted with the temptations of
   Satan, with the bitter fruits of sin, with the prejudices that men lie
   under before they come to take to the ways of God, they have greater
   compassion towards the souls of others than others have. This is
   observed to be fulfilled in the apostle Paul, whose zeal lay otherwise
   more in the active than in the contemplative way; for in his writings
   we find him mostly doctrinal and rational, yet when he speaketh of
   sinners, he doth it always with grief and bowels: Phil. iii. 18, I tell
   you weeping.' And still he presseth Christians to a greater tenderness,
   to be more in grief for than censure of their brother's faults:. Gal.
   vi. 1, If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore
   such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou
   also be tempted;' and Titus ii. 3, when he presseth to gentleness to
   all men, For we ourselves,' saith he, were sometimes foolish and
   disobedient, deceived and deceiving, serving divers lusts and
   pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another;
   but after the love and kindness of God appeared,' &c. This melted his
   heart, to consider what he was, and what God had made him by grace.
   Whereas sullen men, of a severe temper, of a constant, rigid innocency,
   are wont to be more harsh and carried out with greater indignation than
   sorrow. Sin and they have not been so much acquainted. Others, that
   know how cunning this strumpet is to insinuate and entice the soul,
   pity those that are deceived with its enticing blandishments. Certainly
   men that profess religion, and do not observe their own hearts, or else
   have lived in a more equitable course of honesty, without any sensible
   change, are not touched with such tenderness. But they that once come
   to remember how obstinate they were in prejudices against the ways of
   God, how securely they walked in a way of sin, without any sense of
   God's displeasure, or serious thoughts of the bitter fruit of it, now
   God hath plucked them as brands out of the burning, they would fain
   save others also that are heirs of the same promise. The high priests
   under the law were taken from among men, Heb. v. 2, that they might
   have more compassion; so the Lord multiplies these instances of grace,
   that they might have more compassion towards others. They that have
   felt the terrors of the Lord, and know the wounds and bruises of a
   troubled conscience, are more affective in persuading, more
   compassionate in mourning for others, 2 Cor. v. 7.

   5. There must be not only a constant disposition to mourn over the sins
   of others, but upon some more than ordinary occasions it must with much
   seriousness be exercised and set a-work. It is said of Lot, 2 Peter ii.
   8, He vexed his righteous soul' in seeing their filthiness with his
   eyes and hearing their blasphemies with his ears, these were continual
   torments to him; he could go nowhere but he heard or saw something that
   was matter of grief to him. That is a sad prognostic of an approaching
   judgment when a country is so bad that it is made, as it were, a prison
   to a godly man. Daily a Christian hath his occasions of sorrow. How can
   we walk the streets with dry eyes when we here shall see a reeling
   drunkard, there hear a profane swearer rending and tearing the sacred
   name of God in pieces, a filthy speaker, theatres and the devil's
   temples crowded with such a multitude of people, that men may learn
   more how to please the flesh and hate godliness, and feast their ears
   with filthy talk? To see people so mad against God, and ready to cast
   off the yoke of Christ everywhere, this occasions matter of grief and
   mourning before the Lord. But besides this, there must be solemn
   exercises, when our eyes must gush out with tears, and we must open the
   flood-gates. We must wish, as Jer. ix. 1, Oh, that my head were waters,
   and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for
   the slain of the daughter of my people!' There are certain times when
   this is necessary, as times of great sin, and of judgment felt or
   feared.

   [1.] Of great sin, for then things begin to draw to a judgment. As for
   instance--

   (1.) When outward gross sins are frequently committed, such as are
   against the light of nature: Hosea iv. 1, 2, The Lord hath a
   controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no
   truth, no mercy, no knowledge of God in the land. By swearing, and
   lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break
   out, and blood toucheth blood,' &c. God's severity is last mentioned
   wherein men bewray their high presumption in profaning the name of God
   and violating his commands without any the least appearance of profit
   and advantage--lying and falsehood, a sin inconsistent with human
   society. God, who is the God of truth and the patron of it, cannot
   endure it. So the lives, goods, chastity of men to be abused, this God
   cannot bear with: Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.' God doth
   not contend usually for lesser faults or ordinary infirmities, but
   gross sins, by way of omission or commission.

   (2.) These sins are the more odious, and do provoke God when universal:
   Isa. i. 5, 6, The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint;
   from the sole of the foot, even to the head, there is no soundness in
   it,' &c. Though there be a few secret mourners, yet when the contagion
   becometh general, and riseth to a head, the Lord will take no notice of
   them as to the keeping off a common judgment: Ezek. ix. 4, 5, And the
   Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst
   of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the fore heads of the men that sigh,
   and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst
   thereof. And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye after them
   through the city, and smite; let not your eyes spare, neither have ye
   pity;' and Ezek. xiv. 14, Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job
   were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their
   righteousness, saith the Lord God;' and Jer. xv. 1, Then said the Lord
   unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not
   be towards this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go
   forth.' Yet the sentence against Sodom was revocable if but ten
   righteous persons could be found in it, Gen. xviii. 32. Nay, a larger
   offer concerning Jerusalem, larger than that which God made to Sodom;
   if but a man: Jer. v. 1, Run ye to and fro through the streets of
   Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof,
   if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that
   seeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.' Though Jerusalem were a city
   larger and more populous than Sodom and other cities. When the whole
   body of a people grows monstrous in sin. If a ruling party be sound,
   though the body be corrupt and vicious, that iniquity be not
   established by a law, or countenanced by them; or if the ruling party
   be corrupt and vicious, yet if the body of the people, or a
   considerable number, be serious and holy, and mourn in secret for the
   sins of the times, God may spare a land. But when all flesh have
   corrupted their ways, then the flood comes.

   (3.) When resolute and incorrigible. Resolute; we have, and we will:
   Jer. xliv. 16, 17, As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the
   name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly
   do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense
   unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as
   we have done, we and our fathers.' And incorrigible: Jer. v. 3, They
   have refused to receive correction, they have made their faces harder
   than a rock, they have refused to return.'

   (4.) When bold in sinning: Isa. iii. 9, The show of their countenance
   doth witness against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom, they
   hide it not.' When men commit sin without shame or fear, break over all
   banks of love, moderation, or civility.

   [2.] In respect of judgments felt or feared. When the day of the Lord
   is near, or already begun, when the smoke foreshoweth the fire is
   a-coming, and the decree ready to break forth, these are mourning
   times.

   Secondly, The reasons why this is the duty and property of God's
   children; they do it out of obedience, it is their duty; and they do it
   out of an innate disposition, it is their property.

   1. It is their duty because God hath commanded it. Now all God's
   commands are equal, and full of reason; and there is a great deal of
   reason why God should lay this kind of duty upon the creature.

   [1.] That it may be an allay to zeal. That is an excellent and
   well-tempered zeal when grief is mixed with anger: as it is said of
   Christ, he looked about with anger, and was grieved at the hardness of
   their hearts; when we are angry at the sin, and mourn for the person,
   and mourn over him. Zeal against the sin, that shows our love to God;
   and our commiseration of the person, that shows our love to man. Samuel
   spared not Saul in his sin, yet mourned for him. And all the prophets
   of God you shall find, when they were threatening the people for their
   sins, were grieved lest their threatening should be accomplished. False
   zeal hath malice and mischief; it mourns not for the person, because it
   coveteth his shame and destruction. Now it is the great wisdom of God
   he would have this temper mixed. There must be anger for the offence
   done to God, and a grief that our brother hath offended. The world is
   apt to cry out upon the children of God, as persons peevish and
   rancorous; but this is a rare vindication, when they see you as apt to
   mourn as to chide, that all your expostulations with them come rather
   from conscience than interest; it is an excellent allay and praise to
   public zeal.

   [2.] God would have us mourn for the sins of others, to engage us to
   seek redress and reformation. We should soon neglect the duty that we
   owe to the age and place where and when we live, were it not for this,
   that the want of it would be burdensome to us, and the abounding of
   iniquity will cost us bitter tears upon God's command, and upon zealous
   endeavours to get a public reformation. Ezra first mourns bitterly,
   then reforms zealously: Ezra ix. 6, 7, I plucked off the hair of my
   head, and rent my garment, and said, O my God, I am ashamed, and blush
   to lift up my face to thee, O God; for our iniquities are increased
   over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens,' &c.
   Zealous actions, which few practise in their own case; yet sins of
   others, you see, work an afflictive grief and shame in those that fear
   God. These were the actions of Ezra when he was bewailing the sins of
   others, and this made him so resolute and active in the reformation
   that is described in the next chapter. Their love begets sorrow, and
   their sorrow care. Who would not seek to redress the evil which is
   burdensome to him? Many times the world is angry, because we are so
   clamorous for reformation and repentance. You have liberty enough, say
   they, and may serve God in your own way, and go to heaven quietly; why
   should you trouble yourself about others? But can a man that grieveth
   for the abominations of the times be silent till they be redressed? A
   Christian is troubled about the salvation of others, to see so many
   thousands of souls carried to hell by droves, and hurried to their own
   destruction. Can pity and remorse behold this, without care and
   endeavours with God and man to get it remedied? Certainly, the children
   of God are not impertinently active and pragmatical. Public reformation
   is not only a relief to their souls, but to their bowels. They are
   troubled, therefore thirst and long to see it redressed: 2 Cor. vii.
   11, Godly sorrow,' saith Paul, what carefulness it wrought in you!' He
   speaketh of their public church sorrow. Till they mourned, they
   neglected the discipline of the church, and let incest go without
   censure. O my brethren! until we mourn for public disorders, we shall
   not mourn over one another. We think it is enough to keep ourselves
   free, and to make a little conscience of our own ways. Always private
   sorrow will beget public care. If thou hast wept sore in secret places,
   thou wilt be earnest with God and man to remove the occasion of thy
   grief.

   [3.] The Lord requireth this to keep our hearts the more tender and
   upright; it is an act God useth to make us more careful of our own
   souls, to be troubled at the sins of others, at sin in a third person.
   It keepeth us at a great distance from a temptation. This is like
   quenching of fire in a neighbour's house; before it comes near us, thou
   runnest with thy bucket. There is no way to keep us free from the
   infection, so much as mourning. The soul will never agree to do that
   which grieved itself to see another do. And as it keepeth us upright,
   so also humble, fearful of divine judgment, tender lest we ourselves
   offend, and draw down the wrath of God. He that shruggeth when he seeth
   a snake creeping upon another, will much more be afraid when he cometh
   near to himself. In our own sins we have advantage of conscience
   scourging the soul with remorse and shame. In bewailing the sins of
   others, we have only the reasons of duty and obedience. They that fight
   abroad out of love to valour and exploits, will certainly fight out of
   love to their own safety at home. So God would have us more abroad,
   more against the sins of others, that our hearts may be more set
   against those sins with which we ourselves are apt to be foiled.

   2. This is their disposition as well as their duty; it must be so, and
   it cannot be otherwise with the children of God, for several reasons.

   [1.] From the tenderness of God's glory, which is more dear to them
   than all their own interests. A Christian hath a great affection to the
   glory of God, is very tender of that; he cannot endure it should be
   violated, for his heart will even break within him. Can a man see an
   injury done to a person whom he loves, and not be troubled? Jesus wept
   for Lazarus, because he loved him, and they say, Behold how he loved
   him,' John xi. 36. They that love God can they hear his great name rent
   with so many blasphemies? so many affronts put upon his grace, the laws
   of God trampled under foot, and not lay it to heart? God's glory is
   more dear to them than their own lives. They had neither had any
   standing in nature nor grace had it not been for the glory of God. God
   made all things for himself; therefore when the name of God is
   violated, his authority despised, his laws broken and set at nought,
   and no more regarded or esteemed than a ballad or a song, they cannot
   but express their tenderness and great affection to God by mourning for
   this. Carnal men are hot in their own cause, cold in God's. God's
   children are quite otherwise, cold in their own cause, and hot in
   God's. Therefore they are deeply sensible when God's honour is
   weakened. Moses was the meekest man upon earth, yet he brake the
   tables. How doth this agree? The injuries that were done to himself he
   could look upon with a meek, quiet spirit, easily put them up; but when
   he saw the people bring dishonour to the name of God, then he hath a
   high and deep affection. They cry out, Josh. vii. 9, Lord, what wilt
   thou do for thy great name?' So Ps. cxv. 1, Not unto us, O Lord, not
   unto us; but unto thy name give glory.' They go to God, not to advance
   our faction and interest: We are brought very low; yet the wrath of man
   shall praise thee.' Thy name is dear and precious; they are sorry to
   see any profane it. God hath abundantly provided for their respect, he
   hath bid all men love them, when he bid us love one another. So that in
   effect all the respects of the world are devolved upon one person. And
   they would have all men love God and honour God.

   [2.] It comes from their compassion and pity and love to men. Oh! it
   grieves them to see so many that do not grieve for themselves; and
   their eyes are wet because yours are always dry. I tell you weeping,'
   saith Paul, Phil. iii. 18. Compassion over the miserable estate of such
   teachers, and those that are led by them; they and whole droves run
   after fancies that endanger their souls. False teachers and their
   proselytes should not only fall under our indignation, but our pity.
   They are monsters in nature that want bowels, much more in grace.
   Religion doth not harden the heart, but mollifies it. Jesus Christ was
   made up of compassion, and all Christians partake of Christ's spirit:
   Phil. i. 8, God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
   bowels of Jesus Christ.' Pray mark, Paul had got some of Christ's
   bowels, and let me tell you they were tender ones. Com passion towards
   others, and weeping over their sins, is somewhat like the love of Jesus
   Christ. He would take our burden upon himself when he was not
   interested. So the spirit of Christ worketh in all his members, he hath
   distributed his bowels among them; and therefore they cannot but long
   for the salvation of others; yea, their heart is broken and mollified
   with Christ's compassion to them, and therefore long for fellows in the
   same grace. Though they have received personal and private injuries,
   yet they pity their case, and mourn for them. It is matter of
   humiliation and lamentation: 2 Cor. xii. 21, When I come again I fear
   my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which
   have sinned already, and have not repented of the fornication,
   uncleanness, lasciviousness, which they have committed.' It is matter
   of grief to see so many thousands perish, or in a perishing condition.

   [3.] This disposition cometh from the antipathy and zealous displeasure
   that is in their hearts against sin. They know what sin is, the
   greatest enemy that God and Christ and their own souls have in the
   world. It was sin that made angels become devils; it was sin that blew
   up the sparks of hell-fire; it was sin that opposed God, that crucified
   Christ; it is sin that grieves the Spirit of God; and therefore they
   mourn when sin gets proselytes. A man cannot endure to see a toad or
   viper near him; your hearts rise when you see them creep upon another;
   so do the hearts of the children of God rise, that their enemy and
   God's should find such respect and entertainment in the world. It is
   said of the church of Ephesus: Rev. ii. 2, That she could not bear
   those which were wicked.' And David saith, Ps. ci. 3, I hate the works
   of them that turn aside.' They know this will grieve the Spirit of God,
   that this will press him as a cart is pressed with sheaves; and shall
   God be pressed and burdened, and they not troubled? It cannot be. They
   that love the Lord will hate evil, Ps. xcvii. 10, both in themselves
   and others.

   [4.] This disposition comes out of a sagacity of faith, and serious
   foresight of the effects of sin. They know what sin will come to, and
   what is the danger of it; therefore, when they see sin in creasing,
   Rivers of water run down their eyes.' Wicked men tremble only at the
   judgment of God, but good men tremble at his word; and therefore they
   mourn when others fall into danger of the threatening. When Ezra
   plucked his beard, and was in such a zealous indignation against the
   sins of the people, bewailing them before the Lord, Ezra ix. 4, Then
   were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God
   of Israel.' At fasts others are slight and obdurate; they look on
   threatening as a little mock thunder; they are not sensible of the
   danger. I may set forth this by that allusion, 2 Kings viii. 11, the
   prophet Elisha wept when he saw Hazael, that he looked wishly on his
   face till he blushed: The man of God wept, and Hazael said, Why weepeth
   my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil thou wilt do unto the
   children of Israel; their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their
   young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children,
   and rip up their women with child: and Hazael said, But what! is thy
   servant a dog?' &c. So when the children of God look upon sin, they
   know by the complexion of it what will be the dreadful effects. This
   will be bitterness in the issue, in time this will produce pestilences,
   famine, fire, sword, and all other mischiefs and judgments, and
   expressions of the angry indignation of the Lord. They foresee a storm
   when the clouds are but a-gathering, therefore they tremble when they
   see them. This is the sagacity of faith. Now carnal men, on the other
   side, look upon the threatenings of scripture but as words of course,
   used as in way of policy, that God only would awe and scare them, but
   doth not purpose to condemn them. But faith is sagacious. Look, as to
   the promises, Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
   of things not seen.' So as to the threatenings, the same evidence of
   things not seen. The apostle doth not only instance when he had given
   the general description of the objects of hope for the recompense of
   reward, but he instances in the threatenings, Noah, being moved with
   fear, prepared an ark,' &c. They know, however men slight the word of
   God, one day it will be found true; and therefore, when they see men
   add sin to sin, they are troubled. The word is as sure as execution,
   and works upon them accordingly. They have all things in a near view;
   the nearer the objects of our faith are in our view, the more they stir
   up our affections. Dangers and death, when in hand and in present
   expectation, work far otherwise than they do when they are considered
   at a distance. So when the effects of sin are looked upon as near at
   hand, when faith makes them present, then they stir up these affections
   in the soul.

   [5.] A fifth clause is from their public spirit and tender respect to
   the common good. When they wisely foresee approaching dangers, they are
   moved with the love and care of their country, and this melteth them.
   They know sin is of a destroying nature, that one sinner destroyeth
   much good,' Eccles. ix. 18. One sinner may do his country a great deal
   of mischief, an open bold-faced sinner--Achan troubled the whole camp,
   Josh. vii. 11, 12--much more when a multitude of sinners are increased;
   therefore they sigh and mourn. Godly men are the truest friends to
   their native soil; they are the chariots and horse men of Israel. Those
   that plead with God stand in the gap, keep off judgments, and have the
   most public spirit; therefore the least they can do is to sigh for it
   and to plead with wicked men; as Tertullian, Si non vis tibi parcere,
   parce Carthagini--if thou wilt go on with thy soul-destroying course,
   and wilt not spare thyself, yet spare Carthage. This will be bitterness
   in the issue. The children of God are always of a public spirit. David
   fasted for his enemies, Ps. xxxv. Abraham prayed to God for Sodom, a
   neighbour country. The godly Israelites were good friends to Babylon in
   their captivity: Jer. xxix. 11, Seek the peace of the city, whither I
   have caused you to be carried captive, and pray unto the Lord for it;
   for in the peace thereof ye shall have peace: if nothing but their
   interest and share in the common rest and quietness. Passengers are
   concerned in the welfare of the vessel wherein they are embarked.
   Babylon fared the better for the Jews' prayers. Now more especially are
   their hearts carried out with a respect to their native soil and
   dearest comforts; therefore this melteth them to see the land defiled
   with sins and ready for judgments.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLII.

   Rivers of water run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
   law.--Ver. 136.

   USE 1. For reproof of two sorts of persons:--

   1. Those that do not lay to heart their own sins. Usually men make
   their affections to prescribe to their judgment, and cavil at the
   fervorous exercises of religion, because unpleasant to flesh and blood;
   to humble ourselves before the Lord with a pressing sorrow, seriously
   and indeed to rend our hearts and not our garments. In this wanton and
   delicate age, men are apt to think I speak of a theme obsolete and out
   of date, as calculated for former times, when men were more tender
   hearted. If we could awaken some of the old godly professors out of
   their graves, as the prophet calleth up Rachel to weep in Raman for her
   children, Jer. xxxi. 15, then we might hope to prevail. Alas! to plead
   now for mourning over the sins of others, when men think it a crime to
   mourn for their own, this is like to be lost labour. Were this the
   humour only of ungodly wretches, it might be borne with silence and
   patience; but those that would be taken for Christians of the highest
   form are altogether prejudiced against such doctrines as this. Men
   would be honeyed and oiled with grace, and distaste the whole some
   discipline of repentance as too severe. They cry out, We are legal. How
   may the poor ministers of the gospel go to God, and say, as Moses did,
   Exod. vi. 12, The children of Israel have not hearkened unto me, how
   then shall Pharaoh hear me?' The professors of religion will not brook
   such doctrine, and how shall we hope to prevail with the poor, blind,
   carnal world? To scoff at doctrines of repentance and humiliation was
   once a badge of profaneness; many now adopt it into their religion. But
   be not deceived; the gospel doth not take away the conscience of sin.
   It may take away the fear of hell and damnation upon right terms. The
   heart of flesh is a promise, and the spirit of grace is a promise, or
   mourning apart is a promise. You that say that justified persons must
   no more mourn for sin, you may as well say they shall no longer have a
   heart of flesh or a spirit of grace and supplications, that they shall
   no longer have a tender conscience. Be not deceived; there must be some
   time to weep for your own sins, as Peter went out and wept bitterly.
   Sorrow must have its turn in the Christian life. I would press it upon
   you by this argument: You cannot be sorrowful for others' sins unless
   you be first sorrowful for your own sins. Grief must begin at home,
   there where you have the advantage of conscience and inward remorse. It
   is hypocrisy to pitch upon other men's sins and neglect your own; as
   some will zealously declaim against public disorders, yet neglect their
   own hearts; as the crafty lapwing will go up and down fluttering and
   crying to draw the fowler from her own nest. We have a nest of sin of
   our own, and we are loath it should be rifled and exposed to public
   view.

   2. It reproveth them that in times of public defection never take care
   to mourn over God's dishonour. We complain and murmur under our
   judgments, but do not weep over our sins, every person and family
   apart. Whether it be out of negligence and carnal security, or out of
   distaste and displeasure against the conduct of present affairs, we
   seem to have lost our public affections, and can only wonder at the
   children of God in former times, since they were so broken and tender.
   To many that would now go for professors, this doctrine seemeth a
   riddle, a mere strain of wit and fancy, like a precept wire-drawn, or
   elevated beyond its pitch and tenor. But in the fear of God consider
   what hath been spoken. There are many abuses in our reflections upon
   the sins of others. Wicked men are quite otherwise disposed: they do
   not only do evil themselves, but take pleasure in those that do so,
   Rom. i. 32; would be glad that sin were more common, that it might be
   less odious, and then there would be none to put them to the blush:
   Prov. ii. 14, it is said they rejoice to do evil, and delight in the
   frowardness of the wicked.' So the prophet speaks of some corrupt men
   in the priesthood: They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their
   heart on their iniquity,' Hosea iv. 8. God had appointed those that
   served at the altar should live of the altar, have a proportion of
   those offerings; now they flattered them in their sins, so they might
   have meat, and get a portion of the sacrifices. Many that would be
   accounted ministers care not for the sins of the people, but think the
   less serious men are in religion the better they can work them to their
   private advantages, and have more respect among them. Then there are
   some that scoff at the mourners in Zion; they count it melancholy and
   mopishness to be so often and seriously humbling themselves before the
   Lord. The world deals perversely with the people of God; they provoke
   their sorrow, and then upbraid them with it. You should bear them
   company, mourn with them, pine in consort with those doves of the
   valleys. Better be a mourner than a mocker and scoffer. Others there
   are that yet can make a shift to hold out some profession of religion,
   yet can delight in the company of profane, carnal persons. Would a man
   willingly put himself upon occasions of grief? Are you like Lot, whose
   soul was vexed day by day? Do but consider how much your temper differs
   from theirs. David saith, Ps. cxix. 115, Depart from me, ye
   evil-doers.' Others there are that by censures and bitter invectives
   seek to make the sinner, rather than the sin, more odious. This is to
   exercise malice and pride, not Christian affection. We should not
   censure, but mourn. Tears flow from charity, censures from pride; and
   by this means you lose a duty for a sin, which is a sad exchange.
   Others again are apt to laugh at them, and to make sport with the sins
   of others, but do not mourn. This is a vile abuse, and yet we are many
   times guilty of it. Men laugh at drunkenness, and make the slips of
   others matter of boasting and vain talk. This should rather set our
   hearts a-bleeding and mourning. He were a monster, rather than a man,
   that could see a man take a fall, even to the breaking of his back or
   neck, and turn it into a jest; or a man wound himself, and he make a
   sport of it. And shall we be more kind to the bodies than to the souls
   of men? Oh! consider the danger of these practices. As much as in him
   lieth he hath put himself into hell, and wilt thou laugh at it?

   Use 2. Trial. Are we so tenderly affected? I know every one is not of a
   like tender constitution, and cannot weep rivers of tears; but tell
   me--or rather, tell God--I cite thy conscience to make answer to God
   when thou didst ever go aside into thy closet, or some secret place, to
   lay to heart the dishonour done to God, or the affronts put upon his
   grace? Do not tell me thou hast declaimed against the sin of the times,
   that thou hast not cried tip a confederacy with them that cry up a
   confederacy against God. There may be somewhat of faction and interest
   and obstinacy in those things; but when hast thou mourned, and wept
   sore in secret places? Do not tell me that thou hast joined in public
   fasts: hasty and transient sighs do not wound the heart. Hast thou ever
   done it in secret? or hast thou often done it? It may be thou hast
   resented injuries, and spread them before God; and so there is a spirit
   of self-love and revenge that breathes into thy prayers. Men will be
   hot in their own cause; but what hast thou done in this duty? It is a
   plain question, and therefore I hope it will have the more force upon
   the conscience. True zeal for injuries done to God would ease itself by
   tears rather than anger. True penitents will not satisfy themselves
   only with public humiliation, to which law, custom, and example may
   draw them; but will make conscience of this duty in their families,
   yea, in secret, where no eye seeth them but God's; mourn apart, Zech.
   xii. 12-14, and bring home public provocations to their own doors, Jer.
   xi. 17.

   Use 3. To exhort you to get this practice, and to get this disposition
   of the saints.

   There is a great deal of need to practise it now, whether we look upon
   the sins or dangers of the nation; the sins, such horrid blasphemies
   and reproaches cast upon God's servants, his ways, truths, doctrines
   according to godliness. I think, in the wisest judgment that a man can
   make, never was there such a dangerous kri'sis and temper of any nation
   as of ours at this time. Never were sins boiled up to such a height and
   consistency as now, such snarling at reformation, that was hopefully
   begun. Now sin walketh in the streets with a bold face, drunkenness,
   swearing, and profaneness seem to triumph; and with the more pretence,
   because the stricter sort have so much dishonoured God and religion.
   Church affairs are much out of order. And for our dangers, we hear
   again of wars and rumours of wars, and God knoweth what may be the
   issue and effect of them: Acts xiii. 41, Behold, ye despisers, and
   wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which ye
   shall in no wise believe, though a man should tell you of it.' The
   danger of a nation doth not lie in out ward probabilities so much as in
   the threatenings of the word. He alludeth to the horrible devastation
   of Judea by the Chaldeans, and applieth it to the despising of the
   gospel. Would any believe that the temple and city should be destroyed,
   and the people of God carried captive, that not one should remain? yet
   this came. In the time of Noah, when they abounded in all things, who
   would have thought of a flood? Many would say, as that nobleman, If the
   windows of heaven were opened, how could this be? Who would have
   believed the horrible dissolution by the Romans? or thirty years agone
   that which is now fallen out in Germany? Never think that our armies
   and forces are so strong as to withstand the threatenings of the
   gospel; for our horrible contempt, God may blow upon all these props in
   an instant. Therefore weep and mourn for the pride and rebellion of the
   daughter of your people. So for our private place. What sins are there
   among us! Some have withstood the ways of God; though they have had
   convictions, yet held out against them. Some are profane, many defects
   in all orders. Paul was mightily troubled because the church of Corinth
   was so much out of order; he bewailed it with many tears: 2 Cor. ii. 4,
   Out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many
   tears.' So may I speak, and you think of these things: It is time to
   mourn. By way of motive, consider--

   1. This is the best way to enter our protestation and dissent against
   the iniquity of the times. When we cannot help a thing, it is good to
   retract it, and commit it by tears to God; for then it shall not be
   laid to our charge. When the Corinthians mourned for incest committed
   among them, and sorrowed with a godly sorrow, 2 Cor. vii. 13, Ye are
   verily clear in this matter,' many of them did not only not approve,
   but abhor that foul act before; but they were not clear till they
   mourned, and purged the church from the imputation. So you are not
   clear till you have done this duty.

   2. God may take occasion to punish you from their sins. We are all fuel
   fit for the burning. God's dispensation is not unrighteous as to you,
   but that may be the occasion: Zech. x. 3, My anger was kindled against
   the shepherds, and I punished the goats.' So Prov. xxviii. 2, For the
   transgression of a people; many are the rulers thereof.' The people's
   sins may make great changes and alterations of government.

   3. You are one body with them. Nations are one political body, churches
   one political body. In God's plea about Sodom with Abraham, ten
   righteous persons have an influence to save or ruin it. The sins of one
   generation may be the cause of another. It is said God turned not from
   the fierceness of his anger that was kindled against Judah, because of
   all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal. Manasseh
   was dead thirty or forty years before. Manasseh had repented, and
   Josiah was a great reformer, none like him. You see God may punish
   their sins many years after; nay, in the process of vengeance the whole
   lump is involved, as being one body. So all Israel were troubled for
   one Achan. Do not tax God's dispensation of severity and rigour, for it
   is the condescension and art of divine mercy by this means to prevent
   public ruin; and you are involved in their portion, that every man in
   his place may study the prevention of sin and ruin. So churches are one
   lesser body; one root of bitterness defileth many, Heb. xii. 15; not
   only by the contagion of the sin, but also by imputation of guilt. So
   at Corinth: 1 Cor. v. 6, A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.' So
   also in households and families, which are one lesser body.

   4. Many of their sins may be thine. It is a good prayer, though it be a
   harsh expression, to desire God to be delivered from other men's sins:
   Ab alieno libera me Domine. They have sinned the more because thou hast
   been wanting as a magistrate, as a minister, as a neighbour, a
   fellow-member, as a private Christian. As a magistrate: a negligent
   prince all the sin is put upon him. Eli was a high priest, and was a
   judge in that case; and therefore, though he were innocent, God saith
   he would cut off his house for the iniquity of his sons: 1 Sam. iii.
   17, Because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.'
   When magistrates suffer all things to run at random in religion,
   instead of God's ministers, they prove the devil's agents; though they
   be holy for their persons, yet there is a great guilt lieth upon them.
   So for ministers: we are to watch as those that must give an account,
   Heb. xiii. 17; I will require him at thy hands,' &c. He may be a good
   man, yet not a good minister, when he is not so diligent in inspection,
   so faithful to his trust, as he should be; so frequent in exhortation,
   prayer, mourning, care of the flock: much hurt cometh by our
   connivance. So for private Christians, they are bound to watch over one
   another. It may be you do not look after them, Heb. iii. 13. You suffer
   hardness to grow upon them, and would not warn them. Ye are witnesses
   from God to the people of Israel. You may be guilty of much evil
   example, and unwary carriage: Heb. xi. 7, By faith Noah, being warned
   of God of things not seen as yet, prepared an ark to the saving of his
   house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
   righteousness that is by faith;' and Ezek. xvi. 51, 52, Thou hast
   justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.
   Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame, for thy
   sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more
   righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame,
   in that thou hast justified thy sisters.' You either justify or condemn
   the world. So that in effect they may be your sins: you are sensual,
   vain. We easily catch a disease from one another, but do not get
   health. Nature is more susceptible of evil than of grace.

   5. By seeing of their sins conscience may awaken, and thou mayest
   remember thy own; as Pharaoh's butler said, I remember my faults this
   day.' Their lives are but a glass of the deformity of our natures.
   There are many Judases, many Cains in thy nature. I was in times past
   as bad as any, as bold with sin, and as notorious a sinner. Every sin
   therefore should be a fresh bleeding wound in our own souls. They are
   but the picture of thy natural face: Titus iii. 3, We in times past
   were foolish, disobedient, deceiving, and being deceived.' Thou seest
   them given up to vain pleasure; remember how it was with thee before
   conversion, and let this humble thee.

   6. If all this do not work, consider the holy angels, that are no way
   interested, but as it conduceth to God's glory; that do not communicate
   with us in nature and blood, how they rejoice at the welfare of man. As
   when the world was made: Job xxxviii. 7, When the morning stars sang
   together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.' So when Christ
   came, and assumed human nature at his birth: Luke ii. 14, Suddenly
   there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising
   God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
   good-will towards men.' And when the creature repenteth: Luke xv. 7, I
   say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that
   repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no
   repentance.' So should we mourn over them to God, who are our flesh,
   our neighbours, united in the bonds of duty and neighbourhood, it may
   be church relation.

   7. I might tell of the fruits of mourning. The greater party of
   mourners, the more hope of preservation. We have complained of drought,
   we have dry bottles: judgments are kept off as long as there is a
   sighing party; you are preserved, Ezek. ix. 4, as Lot out of Sodom. But
   if the righteous God see not this fit, and a godly man may be swept
   away, as two dry sticks burn a green one, yet you shall laugh when
   others mourn. In heaven there will be joy enough; this is the valley of
   tears. Wicked men, though now they are dry wood, yet they are fit fuel
   for hell. Consider of these things. It is a difficult work to soften
   the heart, and you have need of all the help that may be.

   [1.] Consider the compassion of Christ to thee. If he had not mourned
   and sighed in the garden, and sweat drops of blood, where had thy soul
   been? Thou wert in thy blood when free grace went a-sighing after thee
   in the ministry of the word: Ezek. xvi. 6, I said unto thee when thou
   wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy
   blood, Live.' These are intending considerations: 1 Tim. i. 13, Who was
   before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained
   mercy,' elee'then. If I had not been all to [17] be-bowelled, and all
   to [18] be-mercied, I had been a brand fit for the burning.

   [2.] Take heed of sensuality: Hosea iv. 12, My people ask counsel at
   their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of
   whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a-whoring from
   under their God.' It taketh away the heart, the tenderness and
   softness; no one thing doth more brawn the spirit. To be given to
   uncleanness, past feeling: Eph. iv. 18, Having the understanding
   darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance
   that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart.'

   [3.] Beg the assistance of God's Spirit; he can smite the rock and make
   waters gush out. That thou mayest not be discouraged, look upon
   precedents in scripture, the tender hearts of God's people there. The
   Spirit of God wrought them to this frame: Cry, O arm of the Lord; put
   on strength as in the ancient days.' God hath promised it: Zech. xii.
   10, I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of
   Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall
   look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as
   one mourneth for his only son,' &c.; and then it follows, And the land
   shall mourn, every family apart,' &c.

SERMON CLIII.

   Righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments.--Ver. 137.

   THIS psalm is spent in commendation of the word of God. The man of God
   sometimes commends it for its efficacy, sometimes for its sureness and
   certainty, and at other times for its sweetness. In this octonary or
   portion, the word of God is commended for its righteousness. David was
   sore troubled for the wickedness of his enemies, yea, tempted greatly
   to impatience and distrust, by looking upon their prosperous estate;
   for if you consult with the context, you shall find this was spoken in
   a time of defection, when rivers of tears ran down his eyes because men
   kept not the law of God. When carnal men pass their time in joy and the
   godly in tears, it is good then to meditate of God's righteousness. So
   does David. When they were making void God's law, he was in deep sorrow
   and tears. It is good so to do, that we may humble ourselves under his
   mighty hand, and compose our soul to patience and a quiet submission,
   and with hope to wait upon God in the midst of wrongs and injuries.
   Simo Caltu telleth us that the emperor Mauritius used these words when
   he saw all his children slain before his face, and himself ready to be
   slain after them by Phocas. The historian tells us, epi` pa'nton
   epekaleito, di'kaios ei ku'rie kai` eutheis ai kri'seis sou--that he
   did in the presence of all meekly submit to this great and heavy
   calamity, crying out, Righteous art thou, Lord, and upright are thy
   judgments.'

   In the words the man of God reasons ab efficiente ad effectum, a
   legislatore ad leges--from the property of God to the laws that he hath
   given us. God being essentially righteous and perfectly righteous, yea,
   righteousness itself, nothing contrary to justice can proceed from him;
   no iniquity from equity itself, nor injustice from justice itself.
   God's law, all his dispensations that proceed from him, are as himself
   is. Therefore in the text you have two things:--

   1. What God is: Thou art righteous, O Lord.

   2. What his word and works are: Upright are thy judgments.

   The word misphatim, judgments, implies both--both the rule and his
   providential dispensations according to that rule. In God's word there
   is a judicial sentence concerning our thoughts, words, and works;
   therefore his law is called judgments. It is the judgment of the great
   God concerning the actions of men, and then the effect thereof when his
   sentence takes place.

   The points are three:--

   1. That God is a righteous God.

   2. That this righteous and holy God hath given a rule of equity and
   justice to his creature.

   3. That all the dispensations that proceed from him according to that
   rule are all exactly righteous.

   First, That God is a righteous God.

   Here I shall show--

   1. What is the righteousness of God.

   2. Prove that God is righteous.

   First, What it is. Amongst men there is a general and a particular
   justice. The general justice is that whereby we carry ourselves
   conformable to the rule of religion, 1 Peter ii. 24, called there
   living unto righteousness; and the particular justice is that whereby
   we give every man his due: so it is taken, Titus ii. 12, That we should
   live soberly, righteously, and godlily.' Godliness is that grace which
   inclines us to give God his portion, and sobriety is that grace which
   helps us to govern ourselves, and righteousness that grace whereby we
   give our neighbour his due.

   1. Justice is sometimes put for the whole rectitude and perfection of
   the divine nature; when God acts becoming such a pure, holy, and
   infinite being; and so God cannot do anything that is against the
   perfection of his nature; he cannot deny himself, 2 Tim. ii. 13. He
   will not give his glory to another, Isa. xlii. 8. He cannot be
   indifferent to good and evil; he will not damn and punish an innocent
   creature; there is a condescency in all his actions to the perfection
   of his nature.

   2. There is a particular justice with respect to his dealings with the
   creature, especially man. And before I come to open that, I must tell
   you that God must be considered under a twofold relation--(1.) As
   absolute Lord; (2.) As governor and judge of the world.

   [1.] As absolute Lord; and so his justice is nothing but the absolute
   and free motion of his own will concerning the estate of all creatures.
   In this respect God is wholly arbitrary, and hath no other rule but his
   own will; he doth not will things because they are just, but therefore
   they are just because God wills them. For--

   (1.) He hath a right of making and framing anything as he willeth in
   any manner as it pleaseth him, as a potter hath power over his clay to
   form what vessel he pleaseth, either of honour or dishonour, Rom. ix.
   21; and Jer. xviii. 6, As the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye
   in mine hand, O house of Israel.' He hath not only might and power, but
   full right to dispose of the creature according to his own pleasure. As
   he sustaineth the person of a Lord, he doth what is agreeable to his
   free and sovereign will. As the good man of the house pleaded, Mat. xx.
   15, Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?' so God as
   absolute lord and sovereign may do as he pleaseth. Nothing before it
   had a being had a right to dispose of itself. Neither did God make it
   what it was by the necessity of nature, nor by the command, counsel, or
   will of any superior, or the direction of any coadjutor; neither is
   there any to whom he should render an account of his work, but merely
   produceth things by the act of his own will, as absolute and sovereign
   Lord of all his own actions: He works all things according to the
   counsel of his own will,' Eph. i. 11; and Rev. iv. 11, Thou hast
   created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.' As
   his wisdom saw fit, so he hath placed creatures in several ranks of
   being. The fish cannot complain that it was made without feet or hands,
   nor the ass that it was made for burden, that it is not fierce and
   mettlesome as the horse, which was made for battle. And we men,
   whatever was given us by creation, it was not a matter of right, but
   the mere effect of God's good-will and pleasure. He might have made us
   stocks and stones, and not living creatures; and among living creatures
   plants only, with the life of vegetation and growth. Or if he had given
   us a sensitive life, he might have placed us in the lowest rank; he
   might have made us toads and vipers, or horse and mule, without
   understanding, and not men. And among men, all the blessings and
   privileges to which we were born might have been withheld without any
   injustice.

   (2.) He hath a right of using and disposing of them so made according
   to his own pleasure, to appoint them to be high or low, miserable and
   afflicted, or prosperous and happy, as it shall be for his glory: Rom.
   xi. 36, All things are of him, and from him, and to him, to whom be
   glory.' As God made the creatures for himself, so he governs them
   ultimately, terminatively for himself. There is no cause of murmuring
   and repining when he will use us as he pleaseth for his own glory, Isa.
   xlv. 9, 10. We cannot say, Why doest thou thus? It is enough to silence
   all tempests in our souls, God did it: Ps. xxxix. 9, I was dumb, I
   opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.' Now this is true in the
   dispensations of grace as well as in the blessings of this life. To
   some God gives grace, to others not; some are elected to mercy, others
   left to perish in their own sins; one is taken, and another left, Mat.
   xxiv. 40, 41. There were two thieves upon the cross together with
   Christ; God saves the one, passes by the other. He may do with his own
   as he pleaseth. He being sovereign is obliged by no debt of law, or the
   command of any superior power; and therefore hath mercy on whom he will
   have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,' Rom. ix. 18. Election is an
   act of sovereignty and dominion. God might have left all in misery, as
   he left the fallen angels; none of them that sinned are recovered out
   of their misery; and are we of a more noble consideration than the
   angels, than those spirits? One of them could have done God more
   service than many men could do; therefore, as he left all those angels
   in their sinful condition, so it is a mercy that, when he might have
   destroyed all mankind, he would save any. God could have given Judas a
   soft heart as well as Peter, but he does not. He will be master of his
   own gifts. Only this clears his justice: none are denied grace, but
   those that deserve it should be so; none by God are compelled to sin,
   none are punished without sin; but in all his gifts, and in what he
   doth as supreme Lord, his will is his reason.

   [2.] God may be considered as governor and judge, and so he gave a law
   to the creatures; and his governing justice consists in giving all
   their due according to his law. This is to be distinguished from the
   former; for God, that is arbitrary in his gifts, is not arbitrary in
   his judgments. Observe that he is arbitrary in his gifts; he hath mercy
   on whom he will have mercy, but in his judgments he proceedeth with men
   according to their works, according to a law or outward rule. Of this
   governing justice the scripture often speaks: Deut. xxxii. 4, He is a
   righteous God, and all his ways are judgment.' So Ps. vii. 9, He will
   judge the world in righteousness, and will minister judgment to the
   people.' Now this governing justice of God is twofold--either
   legislative or judicial.

   (1.) God's legislative justice. This determines man's duty, and binds
   him to the performance thereof, and also decrees and sets down the
   rewards and punishments that shall be due upon man's obedience or
   disobedience. God made man rational, or a voluntary agent, capable of
   good and evil, with desires of the good and fears of the evil; and
   therefore God, as universal king, that he might rule him according to
   his nature, hath made for him a law that revealeth good and evil, with
   promises to move him by desire and hope of the good, and with
   threatenings to drive him by a necessary fear of the evil. So Deut.
   xxx. 15, See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
   and evil.' It is true of the law of Moses, and it is true of the gospel
   of Christ Jesus; he deals with us this way (that I may not make a
   distinction between the law and the gospel). What is the law of the
   gospel? Mark xvi. 16, He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be
   saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.' Now this law is the
   rule of man's duty and God's dealings with all those that have received
   it.

   (2.) There is his judicial justice, called also distributive; and this
   is that whereby he renders unto men according to their works, whether
   they do good or evil, without any respect to persons: 1 Peter i. 17,
   Without respect of persons, he judgeth according to every man's work.'
   The persons that may be respected in judgment is some external thing,
   that hath no affinity with the cause in hand. Now when God comes to
   judge of the breach of his law, or the keeping of his law, he hath no
   respect of persons, high or low, rich or poor, professing or not
   professing Christianity; he deals with them as they have walked
   according to his law. His judicial or distributive justice is declared
   at large by the apostle, Rom. ii. 5-9. There God's executing judgment
   according to his law is described, and you find it
   twofold--remunerative or vindictive.

   (1st.) His remunerative or rewarding justice. It is just with God to
   reward our obedience, and to give men what his promise hath made due to
   them. It is true we cannot expect reward from God in strict
   righteousness, or by the exact laws of commutative justice and strict
   righteousness in this fallen estate, as if there were an inward
   condignity of our works to that which God gives. Oh no! that is
   disclaimed by the saints: Ps. ciii. 3, Who forgiveth all thine
   iniquities;' Ps. cxliii. 2, Enter not into judgment with thy servant;
   for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.' From any exuberancy
   of merit we cannot expect a reward from God; but we may and ought to
   encourage ourselves from his righteousness, even that it is not an
   unrighteous thing with God to give us heaven and happiness when we have
   served him faithfully, and patiently continued in well-doing. You know
   the apostle distinguished that there is a reward according to debt, and
   a reward according to grace, Rom. iv. 4. Though it be righteous with
   God to give the reward, yet he gives it not out of debt, or for any
   condignity of worth; but he gives it out of grace. And so all the
   comforts we have from obedience are said to come from the righteousness
   of God; even the pardon of sin, which is one of the freest acts of God,
   and wherein he discovers most of his mercy: 1 John i. 9, He is faithful
   and just to forgive us our sins.' It is not, faithful and gracious, but
   just. And so for the eternal reward in 2 Thes. i. 6, 7, di'kaion, It is
   a just or righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them
   that trouble you.' Ay! you think it is just with God to punish evil;
   but is it a righteous thing that he should reward our obedience? Bead
   on: And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
   shall be revealed from heaven,' &c. God in righteousness is bound by
   his own promise to give this reward: Heb. vi. 10, God is not
   unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of love.' How is God's
   righteousness engaged? Partly by Christ, Christ having given
   satisfaction equivalent to the offence and wrong to his majesty, and
   having interposed an everlasting merit, it is just with God to forgive
   the sin, as it is just for the creditor to forgive the debt when he
   hath received satisfaction from the surety. And it is just because God
   is bound by his own promise; he hath promised a crown of life to them
   at the end of their trial, James i. 12; and it is part of his justice
   to make good his word; by promise God hath made himself a debtor. So 2
   Tim. iv. 8, Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
   righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that
   day.' Bernard glosseth sweetly upon that place, Paulus expectat coronam
   justitiae, justitiae Dei, non suae; justum est ut reddat quod debet,
   debet autem quod pollicitus est. It is just with God to pay what he
   oweth, and God oweth what he hath promised; and so it is a crown of
   righteousness which God the righteous Judge will give us at that day.
   Once more, it is just with God not to forget your labour of love,
   because it agrees with his general justice, or the rectitude of his
   nature; it falls in with his law. As God is a holy, perfect being, he
   cannot be indifferent to good and evil; it concerns him to see, ut
   bonis bene sit; et malis, male; that it be well with them that do well,
   and ill with them that do ill. But how upon terms it should go well
   with them, that must be interpreted according to either covenant;
   either according to the exactness of the law, and so no flesh can be
   justified in his sight, or according to the moderation of the gospel,
   where the soul sincerely frames itself to do the will of God: and it is
   not an unrighteous thing with God to give you according to your labour
   of love, and zeal for his glory.

   (2dly.) There is his vindictive justice on all sinners. God punisheth
   none but sinners, and only for sin, and that ever according to the
   measure of the sin; as it is more or less, so they have more or less
   punishment: Rom. ii. 9, Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man
   that doth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.' God will
   render vengeance to the Gentiles, that had the light of nature to teach
   them God, to show them the invisible things of his godhead and power;
   but chiefly upon those that have been bred up in his ordinances, and
   mostly upon them that have rejected the terms of grace offered them in
   the gospel; for so it is said, 2 Thes. i. 8, He will render vengeance
   upon all them that obey not the gospel;' and John iii. 18, 19, He that
   believeth not is condemned already.' The law is passed upon him; but
   this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men
   loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.' Their
   sin is inexcusable that will not lay hold upon the offers of grace.
   They have no cause to murmur, or impute their damnation to God's secret
   purpose; in their own consciences they may read the justness of their
   condemnation. Well, then, this is God's justice; it is that property by
   which God acts agreeable to his nature as sovereign lord; and agreeable
   to his covenant as governor and judge of the world, either his covenant
   of works or grace.

   Secondly, To prove that God is just. I shall prove it by four things:--

   1. From the perfection of the divine nature. The perfection of the
   divine will is such that he necessarily loveth righteousness and hateth
   iniquity. As the perfection of God's understanding includes all
   intellectual virtues, so the perfection of his will all moral virtues.
   There can be no virtuous act of the will, either in men or angels, that
   doth not agree to God in a far more excellent manner and measure; and
   therefore if there be such a quality as justice and righteousness in
   angels and men, if holy angels and just men made perfect, certainly
   there is a just God. This rectitude in men and angels is accidental,
   and separable from their being. Angels may be angels, yet not just, as
   appears in the devils; but in God it is essential; as his essence is
   necessarily, so his integrity must needs be so. In short, God must be
   just and holy, because he necessarily loves himself, and hates every
   thing that is contrary to himself: Ps. xi. 7, The righteous God loveth
   righteousness, and his countenance beholdeth the upright.' If they be
   just, he loves their justice, because he loves himself; if unjust, he
   hates their injustice, because they are contrary to himself.

   2. He could not else govern the world, or judge men according to their
   offences. Next his nature, God's office shows him just, that infers his
   justice as he is governor and judge of the world; so we shall see, Gen.
   xviii. 15, The judge of all the earth, shall not he do right?' It must
   needs be so that the judge of the earth will do right: Rom. v. 6, Is
   God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? God forbid; for then how shall
   God judge the world?' It is impossible to imagine that he can be the
   supreme judge who is not just. Among men appeals are allowed, because
   men are fallible, and apt to pervert equity and judgment; and this is
   their relief that they can appeal higher. But now, Eccles. v. 8, If
   thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of
   judgment and justice, marvel not at the matter; for he that is higher
   than the highest regardeth, and there be higher than they.' God is the
   great arbiter of all affairs in the world, where all appeals rest, can
   go no higher than the will of God; therefore he must needs be just.

   3. This was God's great end in giving Jesus Christ, that he might be
   known to be a just God; therefore he stood so punctually upon
   satisfaction, that the sinner must die or the surety. No surety so fit
   to keep up the honour of his law and honour of his justice in the
   consciences of men as the Son of God, Rom. iii. 24-26. God had a mind
   to be gracious to the creature, but without any disparagement to his
   justice. Now how should this be? All the wise men in the world that had
   any sense of the nature and being of God busied themselves in this
   inquiry, How God could be merciful to the creature, and yet just; but
   all their devices were vain and frivolous, until God himself found out
   a ransom and remedy for us, as it is in Job xxxiii. 24. Here was the
   difficulty; God would preserve the notions which the creature had of
   his being and justice inviolable; he would be known as one that would
   stand to his law which he had made for the government of the world.
   Now, there was no way to keep up the credit of it but these two--strict
   execution or sufficient satisfaction. The execution would have
   destroyed all the inferior world, the reasonable creatures at least;
   and the love and wisdom and mercy of God would not permit that the
   world should be destroyed so soon as it was made, and man left
   remediless in everlasting misery. Well, then, strict execution would
   not do it; therefore satisfaction must be the remedy; and such
   satisfaction as might be sufficient to procure the ends of the law, to
   keep up the honour of God's justice in the consciences of men. Now this
   was done by Jesus Christ, whom God had set forth to declare his
   righteousness, that he might exercise his mercy without prejudice to
   his justice. If this ransom had not been found, we should either have
   slighted God, and not stood in awe of him, or else we had been for ever
   left under the curse, and under doubtfulness and scruple, wherewith we
   should have appeased him; but the Lord found out such a means to our
   hands, that he might declare he was a righteous God.

   4. I prove it from the divine nature infused into us. As many as are
   made partakers of God's grace are more just than others, they hate sin
   and sinners; so we read, Eph. iv. 24, That the new man was created
   after God in righteousness and true holiness.' After God, that is,
   after the image and pattern of God. Now, if the new creature be made
   after such a pattern, then certainly God was righteous. We find by
   experience, the more god-like and virtuous any are the more just they
   are, more apt to give every one his due, to live without wrong to any,
   and the more their hearts' are set against that which is base and
   unworthy. Therefore certainly God is righteous, for he hath put such a
   quality as the copy of his nature into the hearts of men.

   Object. If God be so just, why then does the way of the wicked prosper?
   Why are those that desire to be faithful with God so afflicted and
   calamitous? This is a wind that hath shaken the tallest cedars in
   Lebanon. The choicest saints of God have been exceedingly hurried and
   tossed to and fro in their thoughts by this objection against the
   righteousness of God: Jer. xii. 1, Righteous art thou, O Lord; yet let
   me plead with thee.' He holds fast this principle, but yet, Lord, saith
   he, I am not satisfied; Let me talk to thee of thy judgments,' that I
   may be better informed; why doth the way of the wicked prosper?' So
   David: Ps. lxxiii. 1, Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are
   of a clean heart;' but yet the wicked thrive and prosper, and there is
   no bands in their death. So Hab. i. 13, Thou art of purer eyes than to
   behold evil,' &c. Lord, saith he, I know thou art a holy God; but why
   can thy providence then look upon them in the world that deal
   treacherously and perversely? The clearest-sighted saints may be so
   bemisted many times that they are not able to reconcile God's
   dispensations with his nature and attributes, and so quarrel with and
   reproach and impeach his providence. Yea, the heathens, that knew
   little of sin and righteousness, were troubled at the afflictions of
   the good and the flourishing of the wicked, and questioned the being of
   a God upon this account; and therefore there are two heathens which
   have written two worthy treatises to vindicate the providence of God.
   Seneca hath written one treatise, Cur male bonis, et bene malis, to
   show why the good may be afflicted, though there be a God; and Plutarch
   hath written another treatise, De sera numinis vindicta, why the wicked
   may be spared, and suffered to flourish in the world, though there be a
   God to take notice of human affairs. These heathens had a sense of this
   difficulty, for it is an obvious objection.

   I answer--In general God's dispensations are just, though we see not
   the reason of them. The saints hold their principle: Lord, I confess
   thou art righteous, Jer. xii. 1; Hab. i. 13. The justice of God must be
   acknowledged in all his dealings with us and others, though it appear
   not to our reason, which indeed cannot discern well; and therefore is
   unmeet to judge of such high matters as these are: Ps. xxxvi. 6, Thy
   righteousness is like the great mountains, thy judgments are a great
   deep.' The judgments of God are such a deep as we cannot easily fathom
   the bottom of; and therefore, though we do not see the justice of it,
   we must believe it, and prefer faith above sense. The Lord may deal
   otherwise in many things with us than we can express, and see the
   reason of his doing; and yet he is always just and holy in his
   proceedings, and it is the duty of his people to believe it: Ps. xcvii.
   2, Clouds and darkness are round about him, righteousness and judgment
   are the habitation of his throne.' Augustine's words are a good comment
   upon that passage. The judgments of God, saith he, are sometimes
   secret, but always just, saepe occulta, nunquam injusta. We know not
   what to make of it; clouds and darkness are round about it. Ay! but
   though they are unsearchable and secret, they are managed with great
   judgment and rectitude.

   But more particularly to come to speak to the things mentioned in the
   objection. As to the flourishing of the wicked, four things to that:--

   1. God's word doth sufficiently declare his displeasure against them,
   though his providence doth not. There is sententia lata, sed dilata:
   Eccles. viii. 11, Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
   speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them
   to do evil.' Mark, there is a sentence pronounced against evil men, but
   the Lord doth not put the sentence in execution. The sentence is,
   passed against them, both sententia legis, the sentence of the law; and
   so it is said he is condemned already, John iii. 18. Nay, there is
   sententia judicis, the sentence which the judge passeth upon a sinner;
   for he ratifieth the sentence of the law; what is bound upon earth is
   bound in heaven. Well, the warrant for execution is signed, yet the
   execution is suspended for just and wise reasons. Sin is not less
   odious to God because wicked men do not presently feel the punishment
   of it. There are many righteous ends why execution should be delayed,
   partly with respect to the Mediator, into whose hands the government of
   the world is put: Exod. xxxiii. 2, 3, I will send an angel before thee;
   I will not go up with thee, lest I consume thee by the way,' compared
   with Exod. xxiii. 20-23, Behold I send an angel before thee, to keep
   thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have
   prepared: beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
   will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. But if
   indeed thou obey his voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an
   enemy to thy enemies, and an adversary to thy adversaries; for my angel
   shall go before thee;' that was Christ, whom they tempted in the
   wilderness: 1 Cor. x. 9, Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them
   also tempted him, and were destroyed of serpents.' Partly that the
   elect might not be cut off in their unregenerate condition, that the
   wheat may not be plucked up with the tares, which they might be; if
   sentence should be speedily executed against every evil-doer, there
   would be no room left for conversion. Therefore God is not slack, as
   men count slackness; but only waits, that all those that belong to the
   purpose of his grace might come to repentance, 2 Peter iii. 9. He is
   long suffering to us-ward, to those that were such as the apostle was,
   that belonged to the purposes of God's grace. And it is delayed too,
   that his wrath may be glorified in the confusion of the reprobate: Rom.
   ix. 22, He endureth with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath
   fitted to destruction;' that he may show the glory of his power against
   them, they are hardened and strengthened in their wickedness by their
   prosperity. When all the favours of God have been abused, and the
   riches of his goodness set at naught, they have nothing to say for
   themselves. And sentence is delayed, that the little good they do in
   the world may not be hindered. God knows how to use all his creatures;
   even the wicked have a ministry and service under his providence. The
   Lord would not destroy their enemies all at once, lest the beasts of
   the field should increase upon them, Deut. vii. 22. They serve as a
   hedge of thorns to a garden of roses for his people. A dead rotten post
   may support a living tree. It may be God will bring some that belong to
   his grace out of their loins. Hierome saith, Many times an evil shrub
   may bear sweet fruit. And God hath righteous ends too, that his people
   may be humbled, and that their perverse humours may be broken; for so
   saith the Lord: Isa. x. 12, When the Lord hath performed his whole work
   upon Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout
   heart of the king of Assyria.' When he hath sufficiently humbled and
   purged his people, then he will do it. And whenever this temptation
   comes, when you see sentence delayed, go to the sanctuary, as David
   did: Ps. lxxiii. 17, Then you will understand their end.' There you
   will see sentence is not speedily executed, but it is surely executed.
   As a chimney long foul will be fired at length: Ps. lv. 19, Because
   they have no changes, therefore they fear not God,' when they are high
   and prosperous: but God will hear and afflict them, even he that
   abideth of old;' he whose essence and providence hath been always the
   same, he will in due time execute his righteous judgment; and the
   longer he stays, the more heavy; the longer he is about drawing of his
   bow, the deeper will his arrows pierce; they are but treasuring up
   wrath to themselves against the day of wrath,' Rom. ii. 5. As in
   Jehoiadah's chest, the longer it was ere it was opened, the more
   treasure there was in the chest; so they are treasuring up wrath, &c.
   The fire that hath been long kindling burns the more grievous at last.

   2. There are other punishments besides outward afflictions. In visible
   judgments are most fearful, blindness of mind, hardness of heart,
   terrors of conscience. Tertullian ad Marg.--Cogitemus ipsum magis
   mundum carcerem esse, exisse eos de carcere, quam in carcerem introisse
   intelligemus. Majores tenebras habet mundus, quae hominum corda
   excaecant: graviores catenas induit mundus, quae animas hominum
   obstringunt, 2 Cor. iv. 4. Nihil infelicius felicitate peccantium. No
   such misery as to be condemned to this kind of happiness, no blindness
   like a blind understanding, no chains like an obstinate will, no
   torments like terrors of conscience, under which a man lives for his
   further punishment, that he may be his own tormentor. Cain had rather
   die a thousand deaths than be let loose as a vagabond here upon earth,
   and be delivered over to the hell of his own conscience. Those that are
   under torments of conscience will call upon the mountains and rocks to
   cover them.

   3. The third consideration is this, providence must not be viewed by
   halves, but in its whole frame and connection. Do but wait a little,
   and you shall see God will show himself a righteous God. When we view
   the dealings of God by pieces, we are apt to break out into those
   complaints: Ps. lxxiii. 11, 12, Doth the Lord see? how doth God know?
   is there knowledge in the Most High? Behold, these are the ungodly who
   prosper in the world, they increase in riches,' &c. Ay t but stay a
   while, and you will see, There is a God that judgeth in the earth,' Ps.
   lviii. 11. I remember the poet Claudian, who had a little tincture of
   Christianity, though a heathen, as appears by his words, when he saw
   drones and unworthy men greater than the worthy, and vex the pious,
   laetos diu florere nocentes vexarique pios, doubted num inesset rector,
   &c., whether there were any governor of the world, any judge that took
   notice of things here below, et incerto florent mortalia casu, and
   thought all things were delivered over to blind chance; but, saith he
   at length, abstulit hunc tandem Ruffini poena--absolvit Deos, tolluntur
   in altum, ut lapsu graviore ruant. The gods were absolved, for they are
   lifted up on high, that their fall may be the greater. Men give another
   judgment of the work of God when it is brought to perfection than what
   they do when they see the beginning of it. Alas! at first, when we see
   the beginnings of God, we are apt to say, There is no profit to serve
   the Lord. Ay! but at length, Verily there is a reward for the
   righteous. And therefore let us not be rash and hasty, until God hath
   put his last hand to his work. They are impatient spectators that will
   not tarry till the last scene of the tragedy, till the Lord brings
   forth his last work. Our hastiness and impatience will betray us into
   many foul thoughts of God and his providence.

   4. That the solemn triumph of God's justice will be at the last day. If
   God should punish no sin here, no man would believe a God; if he should
   punish all here, no man would be afraid of a future judgment. Now is
   the day of his patience, and all taste the effects of his common
   goodness: Acts xvii. 31, He hath appointed a day wherein he will judge
   the world;' that is the great day of assizes for all the world, when
   the great judge shall appear in his royalty. Now God only keeps a petty
   sessions; now and then he seizeth upon the hairy scalp of a sinner; but
   the general assizes is then. In the day of trial it is not fit we
   should live by sense, but by faith; but hereafter in the day of
   recompenses all shall be open and clear: Rom. ii. 5, Thou treasurest up
   wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous
   judgment of Christ.' There is a day that will reveal the justice and
   righteousness of God, a black day to the wicked it will be, and to
   God's people a day of redemption. Now his justice is manifested on a
   few here, then on all. Now God's children have their sentence of
   absolution from sin in private, in foro conscientiae, their
   justification and assurance of eternal life; and wicked men have their
   woful doom in the stings and horrors of their own conscience, they are
   self-condemned, Titus iii. 11; but then sentence will pass publicly.
   The equity of God's dealings is not now so fully seen, but then the
   causes will be opened; when the secrets of all hearts shall be
   manifested, then we shall see how justly God accepted one to salvation,
   and rejected another to damnation. God's justice is seen by the present
   government of the world, but not so clearly. Here justice is mixed with
   mercy to the godly in their afflictions, and mercy is mixed with
   justice to the wicked in their temporal blessings; but when the Lord
   shall stir up all his wrath, then we shall see clearly God is a just
   God, and will keep punctually to the law he hath made for the
   government of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLIV.

   Righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments.--Ver. 137.

   FOR the other part of the objection, that those which desire to be most
   faithful with God are calamitous and afflicted, as Lazarus lay in
   poverty and rags while the rich man surfeited in all manner of luxury,
   I answer--

   1. God having an absolute right and dominion over us and our comforts,
   may give and take them away according to his own plea sure: Job i. 21,
   The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken;' abstulit, sed et dedit;
   they are his own he gave at first. If he hath lent us anything for his
   service and our comfort, he may command it again when he pleaseth, and
   none can commence a suit against his providence. Whatever straits and
   poverty we are reduced to, we were poorer than ever we can be made by
   providence. We came into the world naked. If God should strip us of
   many comforts, we are not so poor as when we were born.

   2. God having intended to bestow eternal blessings upon us, will take a
   liberty in disposing of outward things. Jesus Christ, when he purchased
   comforts for us, did not purchase only or chiefly earthly comforts and
   blessings: Eph. i. 3, The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ hath
   blessed us with spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus.' He did not
   purchase worldly blessings as our chief happiness. The world is a
   common inn for sons and bastards, where God will show his bounty to
   all, his creatures; our inheritance is elsewhere, in heavenly places;
   for though all things come alike to all, we cannot murmur and say, God
   is unjust; nay, though a child of God should be in a worse condition
   than the wicked are. A child during his nonage is kept under more
   severe discipline than a slave, which doth more live at large. We
   distinguish between the care of a father and the indulgence of a
   mother. The father loves his child; ay! but he breeds him up in a
   strict way. But mothers are fondly indulgent, and would have them
   pampered and cockered; so evil habits increase upon them. We, that so
   quarrel for worldly things, would have God show the fondness and
   indulgence of a mother, and not the wisdom and care of a father.

   3. It is fit, before we go to heaven, that we should be tried;
   therefore God will so manifest his love to us that there may be room to
   exercise faith and patience, Heb. vi. 12. Never any came to reap the
   comfort of God's promises but there was a time to exercise their faith
   with difficulties, and their patience with delays; and therefore God
   will try our sincerity when we have no visible encouragements. God
   would have us live by faith, and not by sense or present appearance
   only, 2 Cor. v. 8, to see if we can look above the clouds and mists of
   the lower world, and encourage ourselves, and grow bold upon the hopes
   and concernments of the world to come. Nature is purblind, but it is
   the property of faith to see afar off, 2 Peter i. 9. There is the
   excellency of faith, if we have but an eagle's eye to see afar off. If
   we had the fruition of the whole blessing, alas! there were no room for
   faith. And then for patience, we are not only to be conformed to God,
   but to Christ; not only to God in purity and holiness, but to Christ in
   patience and submission and self-denial. There are some of our duties
   which imply perfection, as justice, holiness, purity, and mercy; of
   these we have a pattern in God: and some of our duties imply subjection
   and obedience, and of these we have a pattern in Christ. Now all the
   heirs of promise God hath conformed to the image of his Son, Rom. viii.
   29. If we must have all graces, then we must have those graces that are
   conversant about misery. We should be ignorant of one part of human
   affairs were it not for these suffering graces; therefore it is
   agreeable to God's justice that these suffering graces should have
   their exercise sometimes. Then the Lord will try our sincerity, whether
   we follow Christ for the loaves, John vi. 26, out of external
   encouragements, or out of affection for internal reasons, upon pure
   obedience. God's holiness consists in loving himself, but man's
   holiness consists in loving God; therefore his holiness need to be
   tried whether it be a sincere love to God: Ps. xliv. 17, All this is
   come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt
   falsely in thy covenant.' There is a trial of love! A man of strength
   seeks a fit adversary to deal withal. It is no trial to a man of
   strength and courage that he can bear down a child. If we would try our
   strength, fortitude, sincerity, and courage, we had need be exposed to
   difficulty sometimes; as the skill of a pilot is seen in a storm and
   tempest, and a valiant soldier's in a battle. Verberat nos? lacerat nos
   Jehovah? patimur; non est saevitia, certamen est.--Sen. Doth the Lord
   scourge us? doth he break us, and tear us in all our concernments in
   pieces? Bear it; it is not cruelty, it is a trial. Religion must cost
   us something, else it is worth nothing. It will give you no comfort
   till it be tried, and therefore there is a necessity that we should be
   tried.

   4. Afflictions have their profit and use, and conduce to our good, Heb.
   xii. 11. It yields grace and comfort to us; it is the fruit of
   righteousness, and the peaceable fruit of righteousness; that is, that
   righteousness which brings peace. Outward troubles occasion an increase
   of inward blessings. Outward things are but shadows of better. If God
   deny the shadow and give us the substance, have we cause to murmur? If
   God do deny the picture, but give the thing itself, hath that man cause
   to complain? If we have not abundance, yet if we grow rich in faith,
   rich in grace, James ii. 5, we have no cause to repine against God.
   Though we flow not in ease and plenty, yet if we have a full tide of
   spiritual consolation; if we have no respect in the world, yet if we
   have the favour of God, we have no reason to complain. Levi had no
   portion among his brethren, but God was his portion. So it is here;
   good men have comfort and support, at least in all their troubles; they
   may be accounted miserable, but they are not so; especially if we
   consider that a great part of their goodness lies in their
   mortification and contempt of the world. So that to a man that is as
   God would have him to be, that which is a misery to others is none to
   him, for his affections are weaned. Therefore, if we have an increase
   of grace and spiritual comfort, we have no reason to quarrel against
   God's providence.

   5. Good men are but in part good, and it is fit their carnal part
   should be chastised, that while there are remainders of sin there
   should be some trouble, that God should burn and cut here that he might
   spare hereafter, that we should be judged of God, and not condemned
   with the world, 1 Cor. xi. 32. It is better that we should have our
   troubles than all our consolations here, and nothing but hell and
   misery in the world to come.

   Use 1. Information. If God be righteous, then all that comes from him
   is righteous. His word and his works. Modus operandi sequitur modum
   essendi. Righteous art thou, Lord;' and then, Upright are thy
   judgments.' God acts according to his being. It is true a man may be
   just, and yet all that proceeds from him may not always be just. Why?
   He is not essentially just; but God being essentially just, all that he
   does or says is just also. A man's actions are one thing, and his rule
   another. A carpenter that hath a line without him, may sometimes chop
   beside his line; but a man whose hand is his own line can never chop
   amiss. So a man's rule is without him; his righteousness is one thing,
   his nature another; he may swerve, and be just. [19] But God's act is
   his rule, his righteousness is himself; therefore whatever he does is
   just and righteous. Men may be deceived, but God deceiveth none, and is
   deceived by none.

   1. His word, and every part of his word, is just; it is in all things
   right, commanding those things which natural justice exacteth, and
   forbidding those things which have a natural sinfulness and turpitude
   in them. God is just, and all his judgments are just. The way he hath
   set down for the justifying of sinners and receiving them are just and
   righteous, Rom. iii. 26; and the way he hath set down for the
   sanctifying of men, to guide men in holiness, it is a just law: Rom.
   vii. 12, The commandment is holy, just, and good,' becoming such a pure
   nature to give, and having nothing of exorbitancy or irregularity.

   2. The way God hath prescribed for saving such as follow this way of
   sanctification is just. The righteous judge will give a crown of
   righteousness in that day, 2 Tim. iv. 8. And the way for punishing,
   such eternally as do despise eternal mercies is just: they have.
   received a just recompense of reward, especially those that neglect so
   great salvation, Heb. ii. 3. God's law flows from his righteous nature,
   and it is a copy of his righteousness; therefore it becometh those that
   confess God to be righteous to acknowledge his laws such, and to live
   according to them.

   3. His works. God hath his judgments for those that do not accept the
   way of righteousness prescribed by him: Ps. cxlv. 17, The Lord is just
   in all his ways, and holy in all his works.' We are too busy in
   interpreting wrongs to others, but when it lights upon us we do not
   acknowledge it: Neh. ix. 33, Thou art just in all that is brought upon
   us,' &c. Nay, if thy hand be never so smart upon us, Lord, thou art
   righteous in all. The only way to suppress murmuring and silence
   disputes, and rebuke the waves and winds of discontent that toss the
   soul to and fro, is to remember all God's ways are just and true. God
   taketh it ill when we question any of his works: Are not my ways equal?
   saith the Lord,' Ezek. xviii. 25. When we thus acknowledge the
   dispensations of God to ourselves, we may with profit observe them to
   others, that we may applaud his proceedings: Rev. xv. 3, Great and
   marvellous are thy works, just and true are thy ways, O king of
   saints.' So Rev. xix. 2, For true and righteous are his judgments, for
   he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her
   fornications.' There is no hurt done, but they are confirmed in his
   promises, and the rule set down in the scripture, not afflicted but on
   just ground. It is good to observe this in all his dispensations.

   Use 2. If God be a righteous God, and all his judgments right, this is
   terror to wicked men, that securely wallow in the pleasures of sin,
   without remorse and trouble. Go on in the way of your own hearts, give
   satisfaction to your senses, please your eye, withhold not your heart
   from any comfort you delight in; but remember, for all these things God
   will bring thee to judgment. As cold water stays the working of the
   boiling pot, so these sober thoughts of God's justice and judgment may
   abate the fervours of youthful lusts. When you are pampering the flesh,
   letting loose the reins to all wanton desires, Go on in them; there is
   a righteous God. Men harden themselves by two things--by God's patience
   for the present, and thoughts of his mercy for the future.

   1. By God's patience for the present. When God doth not strike, but
   withholds his hand: Ps. l. 21, 22, These things hast thou done, and I
   kept silence; but I will reprove thee, and set them in order be fore
   thine eyes.' Christians, patience and forbearance is not absolute
   remission and forgiveness. God may give you a long day, and yet reckon
   with you at last: Rom. ix. 22, He endureth with much longsuffering the
   vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.' Mark, there is suffering,
   long-suffering, and much long-suffering; and yet vessels of wrath
   fitted for destruction. God suffered Cain to live as a man reprieved;
   so you may be reprieved. He deals with ungodly men, as David with Joab
   and Shimei; he would not acquit them, yet forbare them, and gave order
   to Solomon to put them to death; your doom may yet be dreadful.
   Christians, bethink yourselves; there is a sentence in force, and there
   is but a slender thread of a frail life between you and execution, but
   a step between you and death; and will you add sin to sin; and heap up
   more wrath and condemnation to yourselves? Alas! you are but in the
   state of condemned male factors, and will you roar and revel as some
   desperate wretches in the gaol between condemnation and execution?
   There is but cold comfort in this, to be rescued and to be afterwards
   executed; and therefore remember God may forbear those whom he will not
   pardon. Ay! and his anger is most sharp after patience is abused, and
   most speedy when you begin to reckon the worst is over: Luke xii. 20,
   Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee.'

   2. Men please themselves that they shall do well enough because God is
   merciful; and so they fancy a God all of honey and sweetness. God is
   just as well as merciful. Ay! but his justice may be a friend. Can you
   claim that justice? 1 John i. 9, If we confess our sins, he is faithful
   and just to forgive us our sins.' When we with remorse and humble
   penitence go and confess them before the Lord, then justice is our
   friend. It is not your friend until you be in Christ: Rom. viii. 1,
   There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.' Why, but am
   not I in Christ? am not I baptized in his name? Then I say again, there
   are none in Christ but those that come in in the new covenant way, for
   him hath God set forth through faith in his blood, Rom. iii. 2, 3. If
   we hope we believe in Christ; if we do, then let me say one thing more:
   There are none come in the new covenant way that do allow themselves in
   any known sin; and therefore the justice of God still remains upon you.
   I prove this latter thus: He that transgresses in one point is guilty
   of all; therefore so speak and so do as they that shall be judged by
   the law of liberty, James ii. 10-12. There are some that have judgment
   without mercy, and others that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
   He that allows himself to break with God in any one thing, shall not be
   judged by the law of liberty, but shall have judgment without mercy.
   Therefore take heed; you will have double condemnation if you love
   darkness rather than light; that is, if you allow yourselves in sinful
   courses, and turn your back upon the grace and mercy God offers in
   Christ.

   3. Here is for the comfort of the godly; God is just; but to you also
   he will be merciful; all his dispensations to you are justice and mercy
   mingled: Ps. cxvi. 5, Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God
   is merciful.' Not all mercy and no justice, nor all justice and no
   mercy; but so just that we may not offend, so merciful that we may yet
   hope in him: Ps. xxv. 8, Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will
   he teach sinners in the way.' He is good, therefore will he direct you;
   he is righteous, therefore we must take his direction. Nay, justice and
   mercy are both for you. You must not apprehend as if mercy were for you
   and justice against you. No, no; the justice of God is made your
   friend; that attribute which is most terrible in God is the pawn and
   pledge of thy salvation.

   The grand inquiry of all the great rabbis and sophists of all the world
   was this, How justice should be made a friend? It cannot be put out of
   our mind but that God is just and an avenger of the sinner; but he is
   faithful and just, 1 John i. 9; just in justifying those that believe
   in Christ. You have a double claim and holdfast on God; you may come to
   either court, before the throne of his grace and tribunal of his
   justice; for there Christ interposed, and satisfied the justice of God.
   Here the great scruple of nature is solved; that is, how the justice of
   God should be made our friend. Nay, when you are fainting and
   discouraged with the scorns and neglect of the world, Heb. vi. 10, the
   just God will reward your work and labour of love which ye have showed
   toward his name.' It may be vain in the world, but not vain in the
   Lord, 1 Cor. xv. 59. Therefore be cheerful in your service. Men are not
   paymasters, but God. It is a noble spirit to look for it hereafter, a
   base spirit to look after it here: They have their reward,' saith
   Christ.

   And then against wrongs and injuries we meet with here, the just God,
   who, as he will do us no wrong himself, so he will not suffer others to
   do us wrong without punishing of them: Ps. ciii. 6. The Lord executeth
   righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.' He pities the
   afflictions of them that suffer unjustly, and will execute judgment for
   them. Mark, first from his pity, then from his justice. From his pity:
   Judges x. 16, His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel;' and 2
   Kings xiv. 26, And the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it was
   very bitter, and he saved them.' But how much more will he pity those
   that are unjustly oppressed by men's hands! Acts vii. 33, 34, I have
   seen, I have seen the affliction of my people, and I have heard their
   groaning;' and Isa. lxiii. 9, In all their affliction he was afflicted,
   and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and pity he
   redeemed them.' Therefore, if we look upon the compassions and pities
   of God, this may comfort us in all wrongs and injuries. Then out of
   hatred to oppression: Ps. xi. 7, The righteous Lord loveth
   righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright.' So again, Ps.
   xciv. 15, Judgment shall return unto righteousness, and all the upright
   in heart shall follow it.' Some times they are asunder. Earthly judges
   may refuse the justice of righteousness, a judge may suspend the act of
   his own judgment; but they shall not long be severed; God will bring
   forth his righteous judgment: Zech. viii. 17, f These things I hate,
   saith the Lord.' And then in regard of his providence, God will not be
   unmindful of his promise: Ps. ix. 7-9, He hath prepared his throne for
   judgment, and he shall judge the world in righteousness; he shall
   minister judgment to his people in uprightness.' Courts of justice
   among men are not always open, they have term-time; but God is always
   ready to hear plaintiffs. They make complaints amongst men, and they
   are delayed so much and so long that they are discouraged. But we have
   a friend that is always ready to hear: Ps. xlviii. 10, Thy right hand
   is full of righteousness;' for defending his people and punishing his
   enemies.

   Use 3. To press us to acknowledge this justice of God, that he
   governeth all things righteously, especially when you are under his
   mighty hand. The Lord takes it ill when you question any of his
   providences: Ezek. xviii. 25, Are not my ways equal?' He will be clear
   when he judgeth, Ps. li. 4. God will be justified in all that he hath
   done or shall do for the punishment of sin; and therefore, when the
   hand of God is upon you, take heed you do not reproach God. When his
   hand is smart and heavy upon you, remember affliction opens the eyes of
   the worst men. Nebuchadnezzar, that knew no God but himself, no
   happiness but in pleasing his own humour, yet when he was whipped and
   scourged, hear him speak: Dan. iv. 37, Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise
   and extol and honour the king of heaven, all whose works are truth, and
   his ways judgment, and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.'
   Pharaoh: Exod ii. 27, The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are
   wicked.' These acknowledgments and confessions come from wicked men, as
   water out of a still, forced by the fire. But if affliction opens the
   eyes of wicked men, surely when we are under God's afflicting hand we
   should give him the glory of his justice, and acknowledge that he is
   clear in all that he brings upon us. He takes it ill when we murmur and
   tax his judgment: Micah vii. 9, I will bear the indignation of the
   Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and
   execute judgment for me;' and Lam. i. 18, The Lord is righteous, for I
   have rebelled against his commandment.' And when we submissively stoop
   and accept of the punishment of our sin after he hath been provoked,
   then God will plead for us, Lev. xxvi. 41. When we stoop humbly under
   God's correcting hand, and bear it patiently, and say, God is just in
   all this, then it will succeed well. Observe the justice of God,
   especially his remarkable judgments upon others. The church is brought
   in acknowledging of it, Rev. xv. 3, Just and true are thy ways, thou
   king of saints;' and Rev. xix. 3, True and righteous are his
   judgments.' Not that we should sit crowners upon other men's souls, and
   judge their spiritual condition, and misinterpret providence: I look
   upon it as a great sin of a faction, and perverse humours. But clearly
   when men's sins are so great that the judgments of God have overtaken
   them, we ought to say, Just and true art thou, O Lord, and just in all
   thy judgments.'

   I might show here is much to keep the children of God in awe; the Lord
   is a righteous God; though they have found mercy and taken sanctuary at
   his grace, the Lord is impartial in his justice. God, that did not
   spare the angels when they sinned, nor his Son when he was a sinner by
   imputation, will not spare you, though you are the dearly beloved of
   his soul, Prov. xi. 31. The sinful courses of God's children occasion
   bitterness enough; they never venture upon sin but with great loss. If
   Paul give way to a little pride, God will humble him. If any give way
   to sin, their pilgrimage will be made uncomfortable: God's hand may be
   smart and dismal. Eli for negligence and indulgence, there is the ark
   of God taken, his two sons slain in battle, his daughter-in-law dies,
   he himself breaks his neck. Oh! the wonderful tragedies that sin works
   in the houses of the children of God. And David, when he intermeddled
   with forbidden fruit, was driven from his palace, his concubines
   defiled, his own son slain, a great many calamities did light upon him.
   Therefore the children of God have cause to fear, for the Lord is a
   just God, and they will find it so; here upon earth he hath reserved
   liberty to visit their iniquity with rods, and their transgression with
   scourges. I might press you to imitate God's righteousness: 1 John ii.
   29, If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth
   righteousness is born of God.' You have a righteous God, and here is
   the thing you should copy out.

SERMON CLV.

   Thy testimonies, which thou hast commanded, are righteous and very
   faithful.--Ver. 138.

   IN the former verse the prophet had spoken of the righteousness of God;
   now God is essentially righteous, and therefore all that proceedeth
   from him is righteous. A carpenter, that hath a rule without him, and a
   line to measure his work by, may sometimes hit and sometimes miss; but
   if you could suppose a carpenter, the motion of whose hand were his
   rule, he could never chop amiss. So must we conceive of God; his act is
   his rule, holiness is his essence, not a superadded quality, his
   righteousness is himself; therefore from this righteous God there
   proceedeth nothing but righteousness, and from this faithful God
   nothing but faith. He discovereth his nature both in the acts of his
   providence and the institutions of his word. We cannot reason so
   concerning men, that because they are righteous nothing cometh from
   them but what is righteous; because righteousness is not their nature,
   but an adventitious quality: therefore good men may make ill laws, for
   though they be meant for good, they may be deceived; and sometimes
   wicked men may make good laws, to ingratiate themselves, and for the
   interest of their affairs; but God being essentially, necessarily good,
   holy, and righteous, his laws are also good, holy, and true: Thy
   testimonies, which thou hast commanded, are righteous and very
   faithful.'

   In the words observe--

   1. That there is a revelation of God's will in his word: Thy
   testimonies.

   2. The authority wherewith his revelation is backed: Which thou hast
   commanded.

   3. The intrinsic worth and excellency of these testimonies; it is
   double--they are (1.) Righteous; (2.) Very faithful.

   In the Hebrew, righteousness and faithfulness; that is, very right, and
   very faithful; the one word is referred to the agenda in religion, the
   other to the credenda; they are worthy to be obeyed, worthy to be
   believed. The sum is, God hath his testimonies extant, their authority
   is inviolable, and their justice and truth immutable.

   Some read, praecepisti justitiam testimoniorum tuorum et fidem
   valde--thou hast highly charged and earnestly commanded the
   righteousness and faithfulness of thy testimonies, as referring to our
   duty. But most translations agree with ours. Our duty indeed may be
   inferred; but I shall not make it the formal interpretation of the
   place. In the texture of the words in the Hebrew these attributes are
   given to the word itself.

   Doct. They that would profit by the word or rule of faith and manners
   which God hath commanded them to observe, should look upon it as
   righteous and very faithful.

   So did David here and elsewhere: Ps. xix. 9, The judgments of the Lord
   are true, and righteous altogether.' I shall make good the point by
   these considerations:--

   Prop. 1. That our faith and obedience must be well grounded, or else
   they will have no firmness and stability. The want of a foundation is
   the cause of many a ruinous building. Men carry on a fair and lofty
   structure of profession, but when the winds of boisterous temptations
   are let loose upon them, all is blown down, because they build upon the
   sand, and not upon the rock. They take up this profession without sound
   evidence and conviction in their consciences; and so they are not
   grounded or settled in the faith,' Col. i. 23; not rooted and grounded
   in love,' Eph. iii. 7. They take up religion slightly, not looking into
   the reasons of it, upon tradition or vulgar esteem, they are not
   undoubtedly persuaded that it is the very truth of God. The good seed
   withered that fell upon the stony ground, because there was no depth of
   earth, Mat. xiii. 5, no considerable strength of soil to feed faith.

   Prop. 2. Faith and obedience cannot be well grounded but on such a
   doctrine as is true and righteous; for who can depend on that which is
   not true, or who can obey that which is not righteous? Truth is the
   only sure foundation for faith to build upon, and righteousness for
   practice. Faith considereth truth: Eph. i. 13, In whom ye trusted,
   after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.'
   And that righteousness is that which bindeth to practice, we may gather
   from Ps. cxix. 128, Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all
   things to be right, and I hate every false way.' The word commandeth
   nothing but what is just and righteous.

   Prop. 3. This true and righteous doctrine must be backed with a strong
   and powerful authority, not only recommended to us, but strictly and
   severely enjoined, for two reasons:--

   1. Because otherwise it will not be observed and regarded, but be
   looked upon not as a binding law, but as an arbitrary direction. There
   is a difference between a law and a rule. A bare rule may only serve to
   inform our understandings, or to give direction; but a law is a binding
   rule, a rule with a strong obligation. The word of God is not his
   counsel and advice to us only, but his law; that men may examine and
   regard it with more care and diligence. God hath interposed his
   authority: Ps. cxix. 4, Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts
   diligently;' and in the text, Thy. testimonies, which thou hast
   commanded.' God hath commanded us to believe all truths revealed, to
   obey all duties required; and if God commandeth, there is good reason
   why he should be obeyed.

   2. Divine authority is one means to evidence the righteousness and
   truth of what is to be believed and obeyed. The righteousness; for if
   God, who is my superior, and hath a full right to govern me according
   to his own pleasure, doth command me anything, it is best, that I
   should obey it without reply and contradiction; yea, though I see not
   the reason of it: Acts xvii. 28, For in him we live, and move, and have
   our being.' All creatures have their being not only from him, but in
   him; and therefore sometimes God giveth no other account of his law but
   this, I am the Lord:' Lev. xxii. 2, 3, Speak unto Aaron and to his
   sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the
   children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those
   things which they hallow unto me: I am the Lord. Say unto them,
   Whosoever he be of all your seed, among your generations, that goeth
   unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the
   Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from
   my presence: I am the Lord.' Therefore it gives rules of practice to be
   embraced with all the heart, as holy, just, and good. God's authority
   is founded upon the total dependence of all creatures upon him, and
   upon his infallible wisdom, truth, and goodness, by which he hath right
   to prescribe all points of faith to be believed and assented to. upon
   his own testimony, without contradiction: 1 John v. 9, If we receive
   the testimony of man, the testimony of God is greater.' A man that
   would not deceive us, we believe him upon his word, though he may be
   deceived himself; but God doth not deceive, nor can he be deceived: by
   the holy God nothing can be given but what is holy and good; and
   thereupon I am to receive it.

   Prop. 4. This divine authority, truth, and righteousness, is only to be
   found in God's testimonies, which he hath commanded, or in God's word.

   1. There is a godlike authority speaking there, and commanding that
   which it becometh none but God to command, who is the universal king
   and sovereign. For it speaketh to the whole world without respect of
   persons, to king and beggar, rich and poor, male and female, without
   reservation of honour or distinction of degrees. The word looketh on
   them as standing before God on the same level: Job xxxiv. 19, He
   accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regarded the rich more than
   the poor; for they all are the work of his hands.' And speaketh to them
   indifferently and equally: Exod. xx. 3, Thou shalt have no other gods
   but me.' Which is not the voice of any limited and bounded power, but
   of that which is supreme, transcendent, and absolute. And by these laws
   he bindeth the conscience and the immortal souls of men: Ps. xix. 7,
   The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.' Men may give laws
   to the words and actions, because they can take cognisance of them; but
   the word giveth laws to the thoughts: Isa. Iv. 7, Let the wicked
   forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;' Mat. v. 28,
   Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery
   with her already in his heart.' And the internal motions and affections
   of the heart, how we should love and fear, and joy and mourn: 1 Cor.
   vii. 30, They that weep as though they wept not, and they that rejoice
   as though they rejoiced not.' Of these things God can only take notice;
   the power of man reacheth not to the mind and spirit; they would be
   ridiculous if they should take upon them to give laws to these.
   Philosophers might give directions about them, but potentates would not
   give laws, for it doth not beseem them to inter pose their authority in
   such cases, where it is impossible they shall know whether they are
   broke or kept. The scriptures upon their disobedience make men liable
   not only to temporal, but spiritual and eternal punishments; and
   accordingly are rewards proportioned in case of obedience. The
   magistrate's wrath lighteth on the body, but God's upon the soul. All
   that man can do concerns life, or limb, or liberty, or estate; the
   inward man is exempted from their power; but God threateneth hardness
   of heart: Exod. vii. 13, He hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened
   not unto them.' A reprobate sense: Rom. i. 28, And even as they did not
   like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a
   reprobate mind, to do those things that are not convenient.' A
   trembling heart: Deut. xxviii. 65, The Lord shall give thee a trembling
   of heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind.' On the contrary,
   obedience hath the promises of a soft heart, and peace that passeth all
   understanding: Phil. iv. 7, The peace of God, that passeth all
   understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds, through Christ Jesus.'
   Of an increase of grace: Prov. iv. 18, The path of the just is as the
   shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.' God,
   that punisheth sin with sin, will reward grace with grace. So for
   eternal rewards, God threateneth, The worm that never dieth, and the
   fire that never shall be quenched,' Mark ix. 44. On the other side, he
   promiseth Rivers of pleasures that are at God's right hand for
   evermore,' Ps. xvi. 11. He that will be believed and obeyed upon terms
   of salvation, is a God, one that hath power of the world to come. Thus
   hath God scattered the strictures of his majesty, and given real
   evidence of interposing hi& authority everywhere throughout the word. I
   shall only add, that the scriptures, as God's law, may be considered as
   the rule of man's duty, and God's judgment. In respect of the commands,
   they bind man to duty, and are the rule of it. In respect of the
   sanction, that is, promises and threatenings, they are the rule of
   God's judgment. In the one God showeth his righteousness, in the other,
   his truth; in the precepts, righteousness; in the promises and
   threatenings, truth.

   2. All that God hath required of us is very righteous and just,
   becoming God to give, and man to receive. There is a condescency in
   these precepts both to God's nature and to ours. They are the copy of
   God's holiness, and so a fit means to bring us not only into a
   subjection to him, which is just, he being our creator, but into a
   conformity to him, which is our happiness. To prove the righteousness
   which is in God's laws, I shall produce several arguments.

   [1.] Surely there is a distinction between good and evil, and all acts
   are not in their own nature indifferent; that was a monstrous conceit
   of Carpender and others, contrary to the common sense of men. If this
   were true, the chasteness of Lucretia should not be more to be prized
   than the lightness of Lais, nor the virtue of Cato than the
   dissoluteness of Sardanapalus; and it would be as indifferent for a man
   to kill his father as his neighbour's dog, to rob in the woods as to
   hunt a deer or hare, to lie with his father's wife as to contract
   honest matrimony, to forswear and lie as to be sincere in all our words
   and proceedings. Now whose heart doth not rise within them at such an
   apprehension? If this be thought to be only custom and received opinion
   that begets this abhorrence, I would ask, Whence cometh it that we all
   desire to be, if not really, yet seemingly honest? The most wicked are
   offended when they are taken for such as they are; and endeavour, as
   much as they can, to clothe their actions with the appearance of
   probity and uprightness. If men were not sensible that vice were
   blameworthy and virtue commendable, why should such a desire so
   universally possess the heart of man, were there not a natural sense of
   good and evil, and an essential difference between the one and the
   other, which we are sensible of, nature itself valuing and esteeming
   the one, and blasting the other with severe marks of her improbation
   and hatred? And I do with the more confidence urge this argument,
   because there is difficulty in the exercise of virtue, because of the
   conflict of the sensual appetite; and on the other side, many delights
   and pleasures accompanying vice, by which it gets an easy entrance into
   our souls, and dominion over our desires. Why should a thing so much
   against the bent and hair be accounted worthy of praise, and the
   contrary, which hath such a compliance with our natural desires, be
   accounted worthy of blame? And were there only custom and tradition for
   it, would men so universally conspire to decree honours for that which
   is contrary to their corrupt nature, and to disapprove what is suitable
   to it? It cannot be. Would they desire the reputation of virtue, when
   their desires choose vice, and impel them to it, and hold them under
   it, if they were not sensible that the one hath a comeliness, and the
   other a turpitude in it? Thus hypocrites do clearly attest the
   excellency of uprightness and honesty. Well, then, the testimonies
   which God hath commanded are very righteous, for they forbid those
   things which have a natural turpitude and indispensable sinfulness in
   them; and command those things which are plainly and evidently lovely
   and praiseworthy: Phil. iv. 8, Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are
   true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,
   whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
   things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any
   praise, think on these things.'

   [2.] It is such a rule and direction as men would choose if they were
   at their own liberty, provided they were wise, and not brutified by
   their inordinate passions, evil customs, and discomposure of soul; for
   all such are incompetent judges. For there is nothing preserveth the
   rectitude of human nature, and maketh men to live as men, according to
   the dictates of reason, as the serious observance of this law. Break it
   a little, and so far a man turneth beast: so that it was well said of
   one, A saint or a brute. For the law is so written upon man's heart,
   and so connatural to his reason, that you must extinguish the nature of
   man before you can raze out all the sentiments of this law: Rom ii. 14,
   15, For when the Gentiles, which have not the law do by nature the
   things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
   themselves; which show the work of the law written in their hearts,
   their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile
   accusing, or else excusing one another.' As long as we have these
   hearts that we have, we cannot wholly except against the justice and
   equity of these laws and rules of commerce between God and his
   creatures. It is true, all truths are not alike evident, but they that
   seriously mind the one will be led on to the other, at least will find
   none contrary to such conclusions, as may be drawn from principles
   naturally known, and will be encouraged to go on till God reveal more
   to them. This is so evident, that the wiser any among the heathen are,
   the nearer they come to this rule, and have framed some thing like it
   for the regulation of men, though with great mixtures of their own
   folly. The perfect discovery of man's duty God reserved to himself and
   his own writings, elsewhere there is but ficta rectitudo and picta
   justitia, poor counterfeits in the laws of civil nations and
   institutions of philosophy; sapientia eorum abscondit vitia, non
   abscindit; there was only a little hiding and disguising of sin that it
   might not appear too odious. In short, the less knowledge any nation or
   society of men have of this law, the more brutish and barbarous they
   have been, and so accounted to be by all that have known what civility
   and human converse mean; and on the contrary, the more polite and
   civil, the nearer they come to it. Whom would you judge to be more
   civil, the Romans or the Scythians? the wise and good man, or the sot
   and fool? Even among us, the more punctually any keepeth to this law,
   the more he differeth from others, as much as an angel from a man, or a
   man from a beast: The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour,'
   Prov. xii. 26. It is clear as the sun; whether men will or nill, they
   must acknowledge it, and do when they are serious; for they approve
   them while they hate them, wish their latter end like theirs, intrust
   them more than others, presume more from them than others. Out of all I
   conclude, that the very frame and constitution of the reasonable and
   immortal soul and body of man doth dictate the equity and justice of
   this law, and it doth result from the image of God, wherein man was
   created.

   [3.] That law is just and righteous, the violation of which men judge
   to be justly punished. I use this argument because under punishment men
   are serious, for it rubbeth up and reviveth the sense of a divine
   power. Now, for the violation of this law God hath judged persons,
   families, nations, and kingdoms, and conscience is sensible of the
   justice of God's judgments exercised upon them. God is clear when he
   judgeth, Ps. li. 4; his eminent judgments carry light and conviction
   with them; and wherefore have his judgments been executed? Rom. i. 18,
   For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
   and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;'
   Heb. ii. 2, Every transgression and disobedience received a just
   recompense of reward.' There is a fear after some notorious breach,
   even in those that are not acquainted with God, a shyness of his
   presence, ever since Adam run to the bushes; so it is. All which doth
   seal the righteousness and truth of this law, and how justly God may
   reckon with us about it.

   [4.] There is an intrinsical righteousness in all the duties commanded
   in God's law. Besides the will of the lawgiver, *there is a justice in
   the things themselves. By what measure will we take justice? We usually
   understand it to be to give every one his due. So doth the law, it
   commandeth us to give God his due and man his due. Love is ple'roma
   no'mou, the fulfilling of the law. The law i& comprised in one word,
   love;' to love God, himself, and his neighbour. Is there not justice in
   all this? The natural relation we have to God calleth for love to him;
   for he made us, and is the strength of our lives, and the length of our
   days: Deut. xxx. 20, That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that
   thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave to him; for he
   is thy life, and the length of thy days.' Self-love and
   self-preservation, if that be not a natural principle, nothing is. Our
   neighbours we are bound to love, because of consanguinity; they are our
   own flesh and blood, and God hath bidden us do to them as we would to
   ourselves: Mat. vii. 12, Therefore all things, whatsoever ye would that
   men should do unto you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and
   the prophets.' There is a universal consanguinity between all mankind,
   which hath its root in the communion of one and the same nature, and in
   the dependence and derivation from one common stock. The eminence of
   the divine nature is the foundation of the honour which we tender to
   it; and the equality of our nature is the foundation of the justice
   which we use to one another. So that here are natural, immutable
   obligations and grounds of right. Go to particulars: How equal is it
   that we should acknowledge but one God! They are drunk that see double,
   strangely depraved that see more. That we should not worship him before
   an idol, which is very apt to taint our minds with a gross opinion of
   God, as if he were some limited, finite being. It is a great lessening
   of reverence to see what we worship. Not to take God's name in vain by
   a false oath, that breedeth atheism and contempt. That there should be
   a day to remember the creator of all things; everyday's work is no
   day's work; but there must be a limited time. For reverence to parents,
   all nations call for it. For murder, adultery, stealing, false
   accusations, man's interest will teach him the necessity of those laws
   that forbid these things. Contentation is a guard to all the rest, it
   is fit the God of the spirits of all flesh should give a law to the
   spirit: Thou shalt not covet.' Yet this is the law of God, to which
   scripture is subservient; and all the admonition*, reproofs,
   exhortations, dehortations, examples, directions, histories of the
   obedience and virtue of some, with their rewards; of the disobedience,
   apostasy, rebellion of others, with their punishments; all is to
   enforce this law. The doctrine of Christ, and redemption and
   reconciliation by him, I bring not under this first head, because that
   is a favour and privilege; and the justice and equity of gospel
   precepts will soon appear, when once we have consented to the law that
   it is good. But of that in the next head.

   3. For the truth and faithfulness of God's testimonies. This may be
   considered either in revealing or performing, making or making good his
   promises.

   [1.] For truth and faithfulness in making such offers and promises of
   pardon and eternal life in case of obedience, and threatening a curse
   and everlasting punishment in case of disobedience. Surely there is no
   doubt in all this, because they are revealed by God, who is the supreme
   and original truth, and who neither is nor can be deceived; for God's
   understanding is the rule and measure of all other truths: nothing is
   true but what is constant to his knowledge. And he cannot deceive us;
   that will not agree with the goodness of his nature and love to
   mankind; therefore he is called God that cannot lie,' Titus i. 2.

   [2.] In making good. God hath given us the most solemn assurance: Heb.
   vi. 17, 18, God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of
   promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that
   by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we
   might have strong consolation.' He hath demitted himself to the terms
   of a covenant, given us a seal: Rom. iv. 11, And he received the sign
   of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith.' Pledge: 2 Cor.
   i. 22, Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of his Spirit in
   our hearts.' He hath stood upon his truth above all things: Ps.
   cxxxviii. 2, I will worship towards thy holy temple, and praise thy
   name, for thy loving-kindness, and for thy truth; for thou hast
   magnified thy word above all thy name.' One part of the word verifieth
   another; in one part you have the promise, in another the
   accomplishment, the great promise of sending Christ: Heb. x. 5-7,
   Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and
   offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: in burnt-
   offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure: then said
   I, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.' He would not go back, being
   willing to keep the promise afoot. It was on our part a handwriting
   against us, in testification of our guilt and need of expiation; but on
   God's part an obligation of debt to pay our ransom. Still he
   accomplisheth promises in the return of prayers; and though the great
   payment be in the other world, yet here God remembereth us still,
   accomplishing the intervening promises, and giving proof of his truth.
   So that they that are acquainted with his name will never distrust him:
   Ps. ix. 10, They that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for
   thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.' They that have
   known his way, and the course of his dealings, will have a confidence
   in him.

   Prop. 5. They that would receive the word as the word of God, must be
   soundly convinced of, and seriously consider, this righteousness and
   faithfulness in the testimonies, which he hath commanded; for till then
   the word worketh not on them: 1 Thes. ii. 13, For this cause also thank
   we God without ceasing, because when ye received the word of God, which
   ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in
   truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
   believe.' And till then they are but customary Christians, and can
   never rightly believe nor obey: John iv. 42, Now we believe: not
   because of thy saying, for we have heard him ourselves, and know that
   this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.' First their faith
   depends on the common tradition, or the testimony of the church;
   afterwards on the sure ground of the word itself, in which they find
   such clearness and efficacy, that they cannot but yield to God. The
   authority of man is nothing to it, when our faith is bottomed on a
   surer ground, the authority of God speaking in his word.

   1. There must be sound conviction, or belief of this. This is called,
   The acknowledgment of the truth,' Titus i. 1, epi'gnosis tes
   alethei'as; and Col. ii. 2, The riches of the assurance of
   understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the
   Father, and of Christ.' An assurance that God will keep touch with me,
   that he will not delude me in the terms propounded in the gospel. This
   full persuasion of the truth of God's testimonies we must all aim at,
   and seek after. The assurance of my interest and my salvation is
   another thing, and yet that I am not to neglect, but with this I am to
   begin.

   2. There must be serious consideration; for that improveth all truths,
   and maketh them active and effectual. God's complaint of his people is
   that they will not consider: Isa. i. 3, The ox knoweth his owner, and
   the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not
   consider.' They do not lay truths in the view of conscience. Food
   without mastication and chewing nourisheth not. A thing not considered
   doth profit as little as if not believed, as a for getting God is a
   kind of denying of him. Seriously then debate it with yourselves. You
   must consider the authority of God. Authority is that right which a
   superior hath to prescribe to such as are under him. Doth God usurp
   upon you* when he giveth you a law? or hath he left you in the dark,
   that you do not know whether this be his law, yea or no? Are there no
   strictures of his majesty in the very economy and frame of it? Can any
   but a God speak at such a rate? And for his justice, hath he commanded
   anything to your hurt? No, it is all for thy good: Deut. vi. 24, And
   the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our
   God, for our good always.' And for his truth, men may deceive and be
   deceived, and though they often speak truth, they do not always so; but
   God seeth by his own light, not by discourse, but vision. Truth is his
   nature, from which he can no more swerve than from himself; and what
   need he court a worm, and flatter us? Thus should we urge our hearts.

   Use 1. Let us own and improve the word, as a righteous and faithful
   word, which God hath commanded for our good.

   1. Own the authority of it. It is not an arbitrary thing; the truths
   revealed imply a command to believe them, the duties required imply a
   command to obey them: Mat. xvii. 5, This is my beloved Son, in whom I
   am well pleased, hear ye him.' God hath commanded us to hear Christ, to
   believe in his name, to love one another: 1 John iii. 23, And this is
   his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus
   Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.' As we value
   his word, and would one day see his face with comfort, we should bind
   his precepts upon our hearts. Say to thy soul, As thou wilt answer it
   to God another day, take care of this.

   2. Own and improve the righteousness of his testimonies. Man having a
   total and absolute dependence upon God, God might govern us in what
   manner it pleased him; for it is just that one may do with his own what
   he will,' Mat. xx. 15. But what hath the Lord required of thee, but to
   love him and serve him? Not to pluck the stars from the sky, or to
   guide the chariot of the sun, not such sublimity of knowledge and
   learning, nor such a quantity and proportion of alms, nor to lance
   thyself, or offer thy first-born, nor rivers of oil, nor thousands of
   rams, for a burnt-offering: Micah vi. 8, He hath showed thee, O man,
   what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly,
   and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?' The Lord's
   commands are not rigid and severe and unreasonable, but sweet and
   desirable, that we should do wrong to none, do good to all, and
   maintain communion with him; and is this burthensome? Go try the
   drunkard's life and the adulterer's life; you will see the temperate,
   the chaste, have much the sweeter life of it. Therefore let there not
   be one disallowing thought of what God hath required. Could we bring
   you to esteem the word, other things would come on more easily.

   3. Own it and improve it as a faithful word, building upon the
   promises, fearing the threats thereof. The word will not deceive them
   that are ruled by it. Consider your condition, and what will be the
   event of things. There is a curiosity in men to know their own des
   tiny. We may easily know what shall become of us by the word of God;
   and if men were not more curious to know their end than careful to
   amend their lives, they need not seek any other oracle: Rom. viii. 13,
   For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the
   Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.' So for the end
   of any action; if the word of God say it will be bitter in the latter
   end, though it bring profit and pleasure for a while, believe it
   against all the wicked men in the world, and say, I do more believe
   this one text and place of scripture than all that men can do and say.
   Mind the great duties of the gospel, and venture your souls in Christ's
   hands upon these terms: 1 Tim. i. 15, This is a faithful saying, and
   worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners, of whom I am chief.' I have nothing but God's word, yet I
   will venture my salvation, my all, upon it, upon his bare word. Comfort
   yourselves in the midst of difficulties with the truth of God's word,
   when all sense and outward seeming is contrary to the promise. Before a
   promise be accomplished there will be unlikelihoods. I will instance in
   Paul's prediction: Acts xxvii. 24-26, Lo, God hath given thee all them
   that sail with thee. Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe
   God, that it shall be even as it was told me. Howbeit we must be cast
   upon a certain island,' &c. Yet how many difficulties came to pass!
   First, no isle appeareth; they are tossed in the Adriatic sea for
   fourteen days together; they knew not where they were, nor whither they
   did go. Thus doth God delay the accomplishment of the promise; they
   know not how nor which way it shall be made good. Another difficulty
   was, that, meeting with some isle, it fell out in the night-time; they
   deemed they drew near to some country, but yet feared they should be
   split upon the rocks, ver. 30; the shipmeu were ready to flee out of
   the ship, leave Paul and his fellows in danger, upon pretence of
   casting out anchors out of the fore-stern, and so they were ready to
   miscarry in the haven. When this difficulty was over, and it was day,
   they were not able to row to land, because of their long fasting,
   having eaten little or nothing for fourteen days. Another difficulty
   was, when they would have thrust the ship ashore it was broken all in
   pieces, what with high banks and two seas meeting. Another difficulty
   was, when they were to swim to land, they think of killing the
   prisoners, and the captain, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
   purpose, and so they escaped all to land. Therefore do not distrust the
   word; but especially bear up with the hope of eternal life, though
   remote and in another world, which we never saw: Heb. xi. 13, These all
   died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them
   afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them;' Rom. ii. 7,
   To them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for life, and
   glory, and immortality, eternal life.' You will meet with bitter
   conflicts, heavy troubles, sad desertions; yet remember God's word is a
   faithful word, and let this cheer and revive you.

   Use 2. Express these virtues of the word. We must be righteous and true
   if the word of God be so, for the impression must answer the seal and
   stamp: Rom. vi. 17, But God be thanked that ye were the servants of
   sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doc trine which was
   delivered you;' 2 Cor. iii. 3, Ye are declared to be the epistle of
   Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of
   the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the
   heart;' Phil. ii. 16, Holding fast the word of life, that I may rejoice
   in the day of Christ, that I1 have not run in vain, neither laboured in
   vain.' A Christian is the Bible exemplified; such a conformity there
   must be there to the law of God; the same light that shineth forth in
   scripture should shine forth in the lives of the godly; BO it was in
   Hezekiah: Isa. xxxviii. 3, Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before
   thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is
   good in thy sight.' And of David it is said, 1 Kings iii. 6, Thy
   servant David walked before thee in truth, and righteousness, and
   uprightness of heart'

   1. For righteousness, A Christian's business is to give to every man
   his due, to do what he is bound to do to God and man; Mat. xxii. 21, to
   render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things
   that are Gods.' Whether by the law of nature: 1 Tim. v. 8, If any
   provide not for his own, and especially for them of his own house, he
   hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.' Or by relation,
   as Boaz did the part of a kinsman to Ruth: Ruth iii. 13, Tarry this
   night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto
   thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if
   he will not do the part of a kinsman, then will I do the part of a
   kinsman to thee, as the Lord liveth.' Or by place or station: Neh. vi.
   11, And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that,
   being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go
   in.' Or by paction or agreement: Col. iv. 1, Masters, give to your
   servants that which is just and equal.' Or according to rules of
   prudence, equity, charity: Phil. iv. 5, Let your moderation,' to`
   epieike`s, be known unto all men;' whether it be fear or honour that he
   due: Rom. xiii. 7, Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom
   tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to
   whom honour.' Or good-will: ver. 8, Owe no man any thing, but to love
   one another.'

   2. For truth. You are to adhere to the truth, not to be carried about
   with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning
   craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but, speaking the
   truth in love, ye may grow up into him in all things, which is the
   head, even Christ,' Eph. iv. 14, 15. To speak nothing but truth in your
   ordinary communication: Eph. iv. 25, Wherefore, putting away lying,
   speak every man truth with his neighbour.' To perform what you promise,
   though to your loss: Ps. xv. 4, He sweareth to his own hurt, and
   changeth not.' Thus should the whole course of our lives express the
   properties of the word.

   Use 3. To show the reason why men are so backward in obedience, so
   prone to what is evil, so uncomfortable in trouble. We do not believe
   that the testimony of God is righteous and true, very true, every
   tittle of it; but we are slow of heart to believe; therefore is the
   faithfulness and truth of the word inculcated. Christ saith, Believest
   thou this?' John xi. 25. Could we believe the word more, what advantage
   should we have in the spiritual life! what fear of God! what joy of
   faith! what readiness of obedience! But we cannot depend upon God's
   word, and therefore are easily shaken in mind. Our hearts are like a
   sea, one wave riseth up after another. We must be fed with sense, and
   God must do all immediately, or else we are apt to sink under our
   discouragements.

SERMON CLVI.

   My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy
   words.--Ver. 139.

   IN these words you may observe--(1.) Two different persons; (2.) A
   different carriage mentioned.

   1. Two different persons are spoken of, David and his enemies. By
   enemies is not to be understood those only that were troublesome to
   himself, but those who were an opposite party to God, who opposed
   themselves against God and godliness; these without any breach of the
   law of love may be counted enemies: Ps. cxxxix. 21, 22, Do not I hate
   them, O Lord,4hat hate thee? And am not I grieved with those that, rise
   up against thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred; I count them mine
   enemies.' It is a comfort and satisfaction to the godly to have no
   enemies to themselves but such as are enemies to God also, such as rise
   up against God.

   There is a different carriage mentioned, and ascribed to these two
   parties; on the one side, oblivion and forgetfulness of God's law; on
   the other side, zeal.

   [1.] On the enemies' part, oblivion and forgetfulness of God's word.
   The word of God is not effectual usually, but where it is hid in recent
   memory. They have forgotten thy word;' a proper phrase to set forth
   them in the bosom of the visible church who do not wholly deny and
   reject the word and rule of scripture, but yet live as though they had
   forgotten it; they do not observe it, as if God had never spoken any
   such thing, or given them any such rule. They that reject and contemn
   such things as thy word enforceth, surely do not remember to do them.

   [2.] On David's part here is mentioned zeal, or a flagrant affection,
   which is set forth--(1.) By the vehemency of it; (2.) By the cause of
   it.

   (1.) By the vehemency of it, My zeal hath consumed me.' It was no small
   zeal that David had, but a consuming zeal. Vehement affections exhaust
   and consume the vital spirits, and waste the body. The like expression
   is used, Ps. lxviii. 9, The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.'
   Strength of holy affection works many times upon the body as well as
   the soul, especially zeal, which is a high degree of love, and vents
   itself by a mixture of grief and anger. What a man loves, he would have
   it respected, and is grieved when it is dishonoured and under
   disrepute. Both have an influence upon this consuming, this wasting of
   the spirits that is spoken of in the text, because they had lessened
   and obscured the glory of God, and violated his law; and there was in
   him a holy care, ardour, and earnest endeavour to rectify this abuse,
   and awaken them out of their security, and reduce them to their duty.

   (2.) Here was the cause of it. Why was David so much wasted, pined,
   consumed, and troubled? Because they have forgotten thy word;' the
   contempt of God, and the offence of God sat nearest his heart; as if he
   had said, I should more patiently bear the injury done to myself, but I
   cannot be coldly affected where thy glory, O Lord, is concerned; since
   I have had a taste of thy grace, and felt the benefit of thy word, I
   cannot endure it should be contemned, and it much moves me to see
   creatures so mad upon their own destruction, and to make so light of
   thy salvation. Thus was David consumed, not at the sight of his own,
   but at other men's sins; and not at others in general, but them, his
   enemies, that they should make void the law of God. Such was his love
   to the word, that he could not endure the contempt and violation of it;
   and such was his compassion to the souls of men, that it grieved him
   exceedingly to see any of the workmanship of God to perish, to be
   captivated to the world, to be made factors for the devil, and fuel for
   hell-fire, and to be so violent for their own destruction.

   Doct. That great and pure zeal becomes those that have any affection
   for the word and for the ways of God.

   Here is a great zeal; for David saith, My zeal hath consumed me;' it
   preyed upon his spirit. And here is a pure zeal, for he mentions not
   personal injuries, but disrespect to God's word. When the same men are
   our enemies and God's enemies, we should be more zealous for God's
   cause than our own. Now both the greatness and purity of his zeal did
   arise from his love to the word, as appears from the precedent and
   subsequent verses. In the precedent verses he had told them, Just and
   upright are thy testimonies, and very faithful,' therefore my zeal hath
   consumed me,' because this word should be slighted and contemned. And
   it appears also from the following verse, Thy word is very pure:
   therefore thy servant loveth it.' He was troubled to see such a holy
   and pure word to be trampled under foot, and especially that those seem
   to disown it (he doth not say they deny it) who had generally professed
   to live under this rule; that they made light and disregarded the
   precepts, in which I found so much comfort and delight.

   In the prosecution of this point I shall--

   1. Show what is true zeal.

   2. Why all that love the word should have this great and pure zeal.
   First, What is true zeal? There is a carnal zeal and there is a
   spiritual zeal.

   1. The carnal zeal (to begin with that) is threefold:--

   [1.] That which comes from an ill cause, and produceth ill effects. An
   ill cause, as hatred of men's persons, or envy at their gifts and
   excellences, or their success and happiness in the world: James iii.
   14, If ye have bitter envying in your hearts.' It is pikro`n zelon, if
   you have bitter zeal in your hearts. There is a kind of bitter zeal,
   and malignity at their excellency, whether gifts, graces, rank, dignity
   in the world. And in ver. 16 he tells us this bitter zeal produceth
   confusion and every evil work. To be consumed and eaten out with envy
   is little commendable. This is not the zeal of the text. With this zeal
   were the chief priests filled when they saw that the gospel came into
   some reputation, and that the people, do what they could, did haunt and
   frequent it. We read, Acts v. 17, eple'sthesan ze'lou. We render it,
   They were filled with indignation; it is in the Greek and in the
   margin, They were filled with zeal; with this bitter zeal, malignity,
   envy, indignation, they would bestir themselves to suppress the growing
   gospel by all the means that possibly they could.

   [2.] There is another sort of carnal zeal which hath an ill object,
   though it may be a good cause from whence it proceeds, such as an
   ignorant zeal, which proceeds from some love to that which men call
   religion, but falsely; and so the apostle saith, Rom. x. 2, I bear them
   witness that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge;'
   and such a zeal had Paul when he was a pharisee. He gives an account of
   it, Gal. i. 12-14, How that beyond measure I persecuted the church of
   God, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.'
   Paul was a man that never acted against his conscience, no, not when he
   was a pharisee; he still acted according to his light; but when he was
   blinded by pharisaical prejudices, he wasted the church of God, and was
   exceedingly zealous for a false religion. Thus is such a zeal as
   possibly might have a tolerable cause, but it had a bad object, a zeal
   about the dictates of a deluded conscience, and this zeal, perniciosior
   est, quo flagrantior, is the more pernicious the more earnest it is. It
   hath often raised confusions in the church, when men are led with a
   blind zeal they think for God; if they be under, then they make
   divisions; if they get a-top, then they are persecuting and oppressing.
   This is the zeal of a deluded conscience. In short, zeal must have a
   right object, otherwise it may be great, but cannot be good, pure, and
   holy.

   [3.] Another false zeal is when it hath no ill object, but it exceeds
   in the measure and degree, and is far beyond the weight of the thing
   that it is laid out upon. This is a superstitious, a trifling zeal,
   which runs out to externals, and is altogether employed about lesser
   things of religion, as the pharisees, Mat. xxiii. 23, that made a great
   business about a small matter, tithing mint, and anise, and cummin, but
   neglected weighty duties, faith, judgment, righteousness, and the great
   things of the kingdom of God. The apostle tells u?, Rom. xiv. 17, The
   kingdom of God is not meat and drink,' in being of this party and that;
   many all their care and strength of their souls runs out in matters of
   less importance, keeping up a party and faction in religion; we should
   first make conscience of principal matters. Superstitious scrupulosity
   is always damageful, like those that come into a shop to buy a
   pennyworth of a commodity, and steal a pound's worth. Oh! they have a
   great zeal for lesser things when it runs out mightily about outward
   things, either for that or against that; and in the meantime they
   cherish the world, pride, envy, carnal evil affections, that are
   destructive to and the bane of godliness.

   2. There is a spiritual holy zeal which we may describe--(1.) By its
   cause; (2.) by its object; (3.) by its effects; (4.) by its use as to
   public reformation; (5.) as to its use as to Christians' private
   exercises, to carry on the spiritual life with fervour, warmth, and
   vigour.

   [1.] I am to speak of the cause of it. The true cause of holy zeal is
   love to God and what belongs to God. Zeal is ferventis amoris gradus, a
   higher degree of love; it is the fervour of divine charity. We should
   mark still what spirit inflames the zeal that we have. Every man is
   eaten up with one kind of zeal or another. The zeal of the world eats
   up many, Ps. cxxvii. 2. They bereave their souls of good, and all for a
   little pelf; they work in the fires, they load themselves with thick
   clay. The zeal of the flesh inflames many; they are mad upon carnal
   delights, can let go all considerations so as they may fulfil their
   lusts; they are consumed with these kind of zeals. Another spirit
   should be working in us, a zeal for God; and that comes from an entire
   love to God. When the soul doth heartily and earnestly love God above
   all, then there is a strong desire of promoting God's glory and
   interest; there should be that spirit which breathes in our zeal, and
   with this zeal should we be eaten up and spent. Now they that love God
   will love all them which belong to God. Friends have all things common,
   so it is between us and God; the injuries done to him will be as
   grievous to us as if they were done to ourselves: Ps. lxix. 9, For the
   zeal of thine house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that
   reproached thee are fallen upon me;' and the glory that comes to them
   is as acceptable as if some great benefit had come to us: Acts xv. 3,
   Declaring the conversion of the Gentiles, and they caused great joy
   unto all the brethren.' Oh! this is great joy to a gracious soul when
   God's interest thrives in the world. Oh! this is that they would
   willingly hear spoken of; their hearts are upon it, when God's interest
   stands or falls, such an earnest desire of the glory of God, which is
   the highest degree and measure of love to God.

   [2.] Let us speak of the object of zeal. In three things God's interest
   lies in the world, viz., his truth, his worship, and his servants. Now
   it is not enough to have zeal that we do not oppose any of these, but
   they must be tenderly regarded and looked after, and we must be
   affected with these things as we would with our own concernments. When
   wrongs are offered to any of these, either to God's truth, his worship,
   or his servants, they must go more nearly to our hearts than any
   personal injuries done to ourselves. What we cannot remedy we must
   mourn for. All these three concur in Elijah's speech: 1 Kings xix. 10,
   I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts;' there is his zeal.
   Why? For the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant;' there is
   his truth perverted: they have thrown down thy altars;' there is his
   worship overturned: they have slain thy prophets with the sword;' there
   his servants are wronged. So that zeal mainly is concerned when God
   suffers loss in any of these things. If his truth be perverted, his
   worship overturned, his servants be despitefully used, vexed, and
   grieved, then zeal presently shows itself in opposing these things, or
   in grieving for them.

   (1.) Zeal seeks to preserve the truth of God inviolable. Truth is a
   precious depositum, trust, and charge which God hath committed to the
   keeping of his people; and without zeal to defend and propagate and
   maintain it, though with the greatest hazard, it will never be kept,
   and you will never be faithful to God. We are a kind of feoffees for
   the present age, and trustees for the future; and the charge of God's
   truth is put into our hands, and we must see it be transmitted to the
   world pure and undefiled. Therefore, Jude 3, epagoni'zesthai, We must
   contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered unto the
   saints.' When others would violate the truth we must contend with them:
   Jer. ix. 3, They are not valiant for the truth.' A Christian needs not
   only the labour of an ox, that he may be diligent, but the valour of a
   lion, that he may appear for God in defence of his truth when it is
   invaded and encroached upon. And especially doth this concern the
   officers of the church; this zeal they should have for the word: Titus
   i. 9, antecho'menon, Holding fast the faithful word.' The word
   signifies to be good at holding and drawing; that is, when others would
   wrest it out of our hands, we should hold it fast; as a staff that
   another would take out of our hands, we hold it faster and wrestle with
   him. So should we wrestle, contend, and hold fast the truth, when
   others would draw it from us. And Phil. i. 27, Striving together for
   the faith of the gospel.' Oh! we should not let one dust of truth
   perish. This is to be zealous for the truth, standing to, and striving
   for the defence thereof, in our way and place. If God had not raised up
   zealous instruments in every age to plead for his truth, what a sad
   case would the church have been in? Truth would have been buried under
   a great heap of prejudices, and Christ's kingdom have been crushed in
   the very egg, and religion strangled in the cradle. But there is a
   cloud of witnesses gone before us. In every age God sets up some of all
   sexes, ages, conditions, that have owned his despised and oppugned
   truths, and have not counted their lives dear, so as they might give
   their testimony to the truth of God, Rev. xii. 11, and have more
   greedily embraced martyrdom than others honours and dignities in the
   church; as Sulpicius Severus observes, they have with greater desire
   affected the glory of martyrdom and suffering for the truth, that they
   might be faithful to God and the souls of men in future ages, and to
   preserve God's truth inviolate; they have greedily sought this honour
   to suffer for God. And Ignatius, he could say, Come, saith he, I desire
   the beasts that are prepared should be let loose for me; it is better
   to die for Christ than to command the ends of the earth. And Basil,
   when the Arian emperor threatened those that did oppose his religion
   should die the death, The wild beasts, let them be let out; would to
   God it were so, that I had the honour to die for the truth of Christ!
   This was notably for the increase of Christ's kingdom, and thus the
   Lord hath inspired his people with a holy love and zeal.

   (2.) For his worship, that that may not be corrupted, but his
   institutions kept pure. Zeal is conversant about that too: Exod. xx. 5,
   Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord
   thy God am a jealous God.' In the first commandment, God forbids a
   false god; in the second, he forbids the false means of worship, as
   before the false object. Now, because the means of worship are apt to
   be perverted, the Lord shows how jealous he was for his worship: I am a
   jealous God;' if the institutions of God be perverted, then I will
   visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and
   fourth generation of them that hate me.' The children are considered in
   that commandment, because usually the interest of families is our great
   snare, when an idol is set up, or a false means of worship. The
   chiefest false worship is an idol; and the greatest sin is put for all
   the rest, before an idol, the imagination or invention of men, when
   that is set up. The Lord speaks of the interest of families, because
   men are apt to think they shall undo them and their families if they
   contend in this matter. Now, be you zealous of my worship, for I will
   visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children. That the interest
   of families might not abate our zeal, the Lord takes the family into
   the curse for the violation, and likewise into the blessing for zeal
   for his institutions. And so Christ saith, John ii. 17, The zeal of thy
   house hath eaten me up.' We should be zealous for God's worship.
   Ministers should preach zealously, and magistrates govern zealously to
   purge God's house, and Christians pray zealously; every one of us, as
   far as the bounds of our calling will permit, should be zealous for
   God's worship. Quis comeditur zelo Domus Dei? saith Austin--who is he
   that is eaten out with the zeal of God's house? He that desires that no
   human invention may be blended and mixed with God's worship, and would
   fain amend what is amiss. This zeal is the only right and acceptable
   principle of reformation, our great indignation against all false
   worship whatever. I remember the story of Valentinian, who was
   afterwards emperor, when according to the duty of his place, being
   captain of the guard to Julian the apostate and emperor, he was engaged
   to attend him into the heathen temple of fortune, and the priests were
   to sprinkle the lustrating and holy water--for that ceremony was common
   to the heathens with the papists--and a drop of it lighted upon
   Valentinian, he struck the priest that did it, and said, Thou hast
   defiled me, thou hast not purged me (he thought his garments to be
   contaminated, and not his body sanctified), and he tore off his belt,
   renounced his honour, rather than he would do any thing that should be
   contrary to his religion; and for this Julian sent him into banishment,
   and within a year and a few months, the story tells us, that he
   received the reward of his holy confession and owning of Christ, the
   Roman empire. For the soldiers, being weary of this pagan emperor, as
   soon as he died chose Jovinianus (that had been banished, and a fellow
   sufferer with him), who recalled him and other Christians from their
   exile, and after having reigned not full eight months, he died, and
   Valentinian was chosen emperor in his stead.

   (3.) The third thing we should be zealous for is God's servants; when
   they are oppressed we should own and cherish them, as good Obadiah did
   the prophets, who hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread
   and water,' 1 Kings xviii. 4; and Jonathan owned David though his
   father was greatly displeased with him, and flung a javelin at him, 1
   Sam. xx. 32; and Esther pleads for the Jews when they were doomed to
   destruction, Esther vii. 3; and Nicodemus pleads for Christ that he
   might not be condemned unheard: John vii. 50, 51, When the council was
   ready to condemn him, Nicodemus saith to them (he that came to Jesus by
   night, being one of them), Doth our law judge any man before it hear
   him? And then they went their way.' That stopped the persecution for
   that time. Certainly they have little zeal for God, that can see good
   men perish before their eyes, and have not a word to speak for them.
   This Nicodemus, that was before infirm and weak, that sneaked unto
   Christ, that came to him by night, gets courage in the time of need to
   speak for Christ.

   [3.] What are the acts of zeal with respect to these objects?

   (1.) It quickens us to our duty, and makes us publicly active for God:
   Gal. iv. 18, It is good to be zealously affected always in a good
   thing.' Oh! how remiss and sluggish would we be otherwise in matters of
   God's kingdom and glory, if we had not a strong degree of love to stir
   us up to appear for God, in the worst times, and in the way and places
   that is proper for us! Paul when he saw the whole city given to
   idolatry, it is said, his spirit was stirred in him,' Acts xvii. 16; he
   could not contain; and again, Acts xviii. 5, Paul was pressed in
   spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.' That heroical
   act of Phinehas when he saw the laws of God broken, and nobody ready to
   vindicate the honour of God; he took a javelin in his hand and thrust
   the offenders through, Num. xxv. 7; and the Lord saith afterwards, ver.
   11, Phineas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, hath turned my wrath
   away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among
   them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.' He
   had an extraordinary call to do that; he was high priest, but he went
   then upon jus zenorum. [20] So Elijah, 1 Kings xviii. 40, He took the
   prophets of Baal and brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew
   them there.' There was an extraordinary call; but we are all to be
   active in spreading and defending the truth, and promoting the purity
   of God's worship, and welfare of his people, as far as our calling and
   places permit.

   (2.) It maketh us spare no cost, yea, it judgeth that best done for God
   which costs us most, as David would not serve God with that which cost
   nothing, 2 Sam. xxiv. 25. That is worth nothing that cost nothing in
   religion. Jezebel she was zealous for Baal, and maintained four hundred
   of his priests at her table. In the primitive times they gold all
   things that they had, and had all things common: and the Israelites
   they offered so plentifully to the tabernacle, that Moses was fain to
   forbid them, to put a stop, because there was enough given for the
   advancement of God's worship, Exod. xxxviii. 8. And therefore certainly
   they are cold, and have little zeal for God, that love as the
   Corinthians did, ada'panon euange'lion, a gospel without charges, would
   be at no cost for Christ. This was Paul's case; there the poor saints
   of Macedonia which had but from hand to mouth, they ministered to him,
   and maintained him when he was at Corinth, a rich and opulent town.
   Paul would depart from his right rather than prejudice the gospel.
   Therefore they that will be at no cost for Christ, maintaining his
   truth, upholding his worship, relieving his people, have no zeal.

   (3.) It vents itself by holy grief and anger when any of these are
   violated. (1.) With holy grief. We should be touched, and that to the
   quick, with other men's sins, when they neglect their duty, pervert all
   that is right and honest, and seem not to be concerned with the glory
   of God, 1 Peter ii. 7, 8. It is said of Lot, his righteous soul was
   vexed' at the wickedness of the Sodomites; and he vexed himself,' not
   with Sodom's injuries, but with Sodom's impurities; he could not
   redress the evils, but he mourns for them. So the prophet Jeremiah for
   the stubbornness of the people: Jer. xiii. 17, But if ye will not hear
   it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride, and mine eye
   shall weep sore,' &c. Though they would not hearken, amend, nor any way
   regard these things, yet it grieved him exceedingly. So you shall see
   the like of Ezra, chap. x. 6, He mourned because of the transgression
   of them that had been carried away.' The transgression of God's people
   was very grievous to him. Thus we read of Eli, 1 Sam. iv. 13, Eli sat
   by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God.'
   The glory of God was dear to him; and when religion is in danger, God
   dishonoured, it leaves a mighty impression upon the hearts of those
   that have a zeal and strong love to God. (2.) It vents itself by
   indignation and holy anger; as Christ whipped the buyers and sellers
   out of the temple, and showed his divine power therein, John ii. 15.
   And remember them, O God, that defile the priesthood,' Neh. xiii. 29;
   and Exod. xxxii. 19. Meek Moses, yet his anger waxed hot, and he cast
   the tables out of his hand; and Ezra ix. 3, When I heard this thing, I
   rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head, and
   of my beard, and sat down astonied.' Thus deeply are God's children
   affected with God's public dishonour, though not occasioned by
   themselves, but occasioned by others, and this is to have a zeal for
   God.

   [4.] The qualifications and concomitants of this holy zeal. I will name
   three:--

   (1.) It must be accompanied with knowledge and discretion; that is to
   say, there must be a distinct knowledge of the cause that we take up,
   else we may be factors for the devil's kingdom when we think we are
   acting for God, and be persecuting the saints when we think we are
   destroying his enemies. It must be out of the knowledge of the cause of
   the evil to be renounced and the good to be established. There is a
   blind zeal: John xvi. 2, Whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth
   God service.' The pseudo-Christians, the literal Christians, have a
   blind zeal against the serious Christians, and if they can
   excommunicate them and throw them out of the church and kill them, they
   think this is acceptable service to God. All this is blind zeal. In
   Rom. x. 2, the apostle saith, They have a zeal of God, but not
   according to knowledge;' therefore there must be light as well as heat
   in this fire, else it is not the fire of the altar, but of a common
   hearth; nay, we must not only know the truth, but also the worth of the
   cause. The truth of the cause, that must be guided still by wisdom, and
   we must observe all the seasonable circumstances in discovering
   ourselves for God, else it will produce strange, evil, and malignant
   effects, which tend much to the dishonour of God, and prejudice of the
   gospel. Look, as a blind horse that is full of mettle, but is always
   stumbling, so they never act commendably and seasonably. The church of
   God hath had bitter experience in all ages of the sad effects of
   misguided zeal; when it hath not been seasoned with knowledge and
   discretion to time things, it hath tended much to the hindrance of
   Christ's kingdom, and the promotion of Satan's interest in the world.
   Christ in one place bids us to be wise as serpents,' Mat. x. 16; and in
   another place, not to give that which is holy to dogs, nor cast pearls
   before swine,' Mat. vii. 6; otherwise we unprofitably sacrifice
   ourselves, and hinder the good which we would promote. It was a
   grievous thing to Paul, and pressed upon his spirit, to see all Ephesus
   given to idolatry, and mightily affected with Diana's worship; yet we
   read, Acts xix. 10, he was two years at Ephesus before he spake against
   Diana; he observed his season before he took the liberty and thought
   himself bound to speak against that false worship. The historian tells
   us of Andes, a Persian bishop, that was under Varrans, that, having an
   unguided zeal, got some Christians together to destroy the temple of
   fire, which the Persians worshipped. Saith Theodoret, Not as he ought
   to do; and what is the issue? Varrans the emperor, that was formerly
   favour able to the Christians, when he saw they affected power, and
   would destroy the worship of the country, what then? He was filled with
   cruel persecution, he skinned the backs of some of the Christians, and
   the faces of others, drew splinters through their flesh, used horrible
   torments, which the historian takes notice of, and it conduced to the
   total suppression of the Christian religion. Therefore this wildfire
   when it runs abroad without discretion, and not being seasoned with
   prudence, it doth a world of harm to the church of God. We must observe
   the time, circumstances, and when it is most behoveful for the glory of
   God, the good of the church, and cause we would promote. See Videlius,
   lib i. cap. 1.

   (2.) This zeal also must be mingled with compassion, that as we mind
   the glory of God, so we may pity deluded souls. When we are zealous
   against the sin we must have commiseration of the sinner, as knowing
   the weaknesses and prejudices of education that are incident to human
   nature. This is, to be sure, most agreeable to Christ's pattern. He
   wept over Jerusalem that stood in a state of enmity to him, Luke xix.
   41; and when he was angry with the unbelief of his countrymen, at the
   same time he was grieved at the hardness of their hearts, Mark iii. 5.
   In Christ's anger there was more of compassion than of passion. And
   Samuel he mourned for Saul when he saw him no more, 1 Sam. xv. 35; and
   the apostle, when he had zealously declaimed against the false
   teachers, he falls a-weeping, Phil. iii. 18. When we show love to God
   there should not be a hatred and ill-will to the persons of men, but we
   should bewail their obstinacy and blindness. Those that are all for
   destruction, and ready to call fire from heaven, they know not what
   spirit they are of; they have a fiery zealotic spirit, but that which
   doth not become the temper of the gospel.

   (3.) Zeal must be constant, Gal. iv. 18; the fire on the altar must
   never go out; we cannot be without it for a moment. There are some that
   have zeal for a fit, but soon grow weary of it; they are zealous in
   prosperity, then they are forward and active for God; but when it comes
   to trouble, they give up all to oppositions. On the contrary, others in
   their affliction and low estate, they have a warm sense of religion,
   but when they are all well at ease, they are lost in the delights of
   the flesh, and drowned in the cares of the world, and their zeal for
   God is checked. And we see that some in their youth have a good savour
   and towardliness, and seem to have a very tender conscience, but after
   their first heats are spent they are very careless, and grow
   inordinate, and all their zeal for God is gone: Gal. v. 7, Ye did run
   well; who did hinder you, that ye should not obey the truth?' David was
   as zealous when the crown was upon his head as when God humbled him and
   kept him low. Many think zeal a cumber as they increase in worldly
   wisdom, and so cast it off. Nay, in gross hypocrites you shall find
   this, they will be zealous in good company, and as vain and loose in
   bad. Let any grave servant of God be there, they seem to kindle a great
   fire, but as soon as they are gone, they put it out again. Ay! but true
   zeal should always continue and be of a lasting and of an increasing
   flame.

   [5.] To speak of the private and personal use of zeal, what need we
   have to keep up a warm frame of heart towards God and heavenly things
   (hitherto we have considered it as it respects God's public interest);
   it is also of private use both in resisting of sin, and perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God.

   (1.) In resisting of sin. A man never doth anything to purpose in
   purging out sin until he hath a zeal for God: Rev. iii. 19, Be zealous
   therefore, and repent.' Repentance is set on and quickened by zeal.
   Doth zeal, think you, serve only to rectify the disorders of other men,
   and not our own? No, certainly; we should begin at home; we should take
   care that God be exalted in our own hearts, as well as his interest be
   not infringed in the world. First our Saviour adviseth us to pluck out
   the beam out of our own eyes, Mat. vii. 5. Unless we be blameless
   ourselves we can have no confidence or hope to do much good to others.
   The first stone should be cast at ourselves; we should repent of our
   own sin, our own lusts, the plague of our own heart; if anything we are
   apt to allow that is contrary to God, this should be a great grief to
   us. Unless we cleanse our own unclean sinks at home, how can we hope
   for reformation abroad? Men cry out against public vices, as the
   lapwing will croak abroad to draw off the person from her own nest; it
   is all but the deceit of the heart; and usually we find it to he so in
   the world. Most men are better acquainted with other men's duties than
   their own; with the magistrate's duties more than their own, and so
   other men's sins more than their own. But it is not so where zeal is
   unfeigned; there it begins at home; they will allow nothing in their
   own hearts that may be contrary to God's interest and to the
   sovereignty of his Spirit.

   (2.) Also in perfecting holiness. The whole business of the spiritual
   life must be carried on in warmth and vigour: Rom. xii. 11, Fervent in
   spirit, serving the Lord.' It is ze'ontes pneu'mati, seething hot in
   spirit. Nothing done for God should be done negligently, but
   affectionately. To be lukewarm and key-cold, that makes no work in
   religion; but when a man hath a great zeal for God, oh! then he profits
   and gets ground, then sin decays, grace is strengthened, love is more
   rooted in his heart every day, and he doth more for God. Paul profited
   in the Jewish religion, Gal. i. 14. Why? Because he was more zealous
   than others.' This is the man that will be the honour of God's
   ordinances, that man that will show forth the virtue and power of
   religion, when his heart grows warm for God and zealous for God.

   Secondly, Why we ought to look after a great and pure zeal, if we have
   any love to God and the law of God and his ways.

   1. Why a great zeal?

   [1.] Because it is not zeal else, if it be not in some good degree; for
   zeal is a great fire and a vehement flame; not only love, but vehement
   love; it must needs be great: Cant. viii. 6, 7, For love is as strong
   as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave.' Zeal is cruel as the grave;
   read it so: Many waters cannot quench love,' &c. Mark, our love to the
   ways of God should be of such a nature, such a warm and zealous working
   of heart towards God, that many floods cannot quench it, that nothing
   can bribe it. Surely the best things deserve the best affections;
   therefore whatever we do in religion and for God, we should do it with
   all our might, Eccles. ix. 10.

   [2.] Otherwise it will not do the work. Such as increaseth with
   opposition; as fire, when you put on more fuel, it grows more vehement;
   so unless it be a zeal that grows earnest with discouragement, alas! it
   will soon be quenched. We shall meet with many discouragements from
   within and without; but when we can resolve with David, the more they
   scoffed and opposed him, he would be yet more vile,' 2 Sam. vi. 22. So
   the more trouble they meet with in the ways of God, the more they will
   cleave to him, and will please God though with the displeasure of men.
   True zeal is inflamed with difficulties. As lime, the more water they
   pour on, the more it burns; as Nehemiah's courage it sparkled the more
   the more it was opposed: Should such a man as I flee?' Should I betray
   the cause of God? This is the true zeal, when it sparkles by
   opposition. As Paul, the more they persuaded him, the more he seemed to
   be bound in spirit to go to Jerusalem, Acts xxi. 13; though they did
   even break his heart, they could not break his purpose. Such a zeal as
   is quenched with every drop of water, and goes out with every flout and
   scorn, will never do it; therefore we had need have a great zeal, that
   we may harden ourselves against all oppositions we meet with in the
   way.

   2. It needs to be pure, too; such a fervent affection had need be
   right, for since it makes men so active and resolute, certainly it
   should go upon clear grounds. I showed before nothing hath done more
   mischief in the world than wild zeal; it is like fire out of its place,
   that sets all the house in a flame; it doth not comfort and refresh
   those that have it, but it destroys and consumes all. But why must we
   have pure zeal?

   [1.] Because there is a false zeal, and a self-seeking zeal, which men
   have while they pretend much love to God and good of souls, but are
   really hunting after their own interest: Gal. iv. 17, They zealously
   affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you that ye might
   affect them;' that is, they sought to rend their affections from Paul,
   and from their faithful pastors, that they might affect them; so he
   tells us, Phil. i. 15, Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and
   strife.' There may be a zeal that comes merely out of envy and strife;.
   Jehu could say, Come, see my zeal for the Lord,' 2 Kings x. 16.

   [2.] This false zeal doth a great deal of mischief. It is a dishonour
   to God to pretend to him, and to put the varnish of our cause upon God.
   God himself is involved in the deceit, Jer. iv. 10. It is a strange
   expression to be used to God, Ah! Lord God, surely thou hast greatly
   deceived this people.' The false prophets did it in his name. And it
   divides the church as well as dishonours God: Gal. iv. 17, They would
   exclude you, that ye might affect them.' The meaning is, they would
   rend you from the body of the Christian church, and alienate the minds
   of God's people, so as to devote them to a faction: Phil. i. 16, They
   preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction
   to my bonds.' And it hardens the persons themselves, as Jehu boasted of
   his zeal, and it was only self-seeking, and the Lord counts it murder,
   Hosea i. 4.

   Use. Have we this pure zeal, such a zeal as David speaks of? There are
   many notes by which it may be discerned; as--

   1. When injuries done to God or religion affect us more than injuries
   done personally to ourselves; when we carry ourselves in an
   indifferency in our own cause, but not in God's. Compare Num. xii. 13,
   with Exod. xxxii. 19. Moses could with a meek spirit bear all the
   injuries done to himself, but could not contain himself when he saw
   injury done to God, but breaks the tables.

   2. When the same enemies are God's enemies and ours. David was sensible
   not of the inhumanity of his enemies, but that which most troubled him
   was because they were God's enemies and forsook his words. David was
   not so much troubled at Absalom's rebellion, as dying in his sins.

   3. When there is a compassion mingled with our zeal Fleshly anger is
   all for destruction; holy anger is for conversion, when they grieve,
   and seek to redress the matter.

   4. True zeal is universal; it is most against their own sins, and the
   sins of those that are nearest, and runs out upon weighty things. But
   those that tithe mint and cummin, and neglect weighty things, they have
   not true zeal. There are many instances of this false disproportionate
   zeal of a conscience, taken up for a turn. When there is a partial
   conscience--in some things men are mighty scrupulous, and strain at a
   gnat and swallow a camel--it discovers the hypocrisy that lights upon
   the professors of religion, full of heinous outcries upon small things,
   yet dashing upon things that are against the fundamentals of the
   covenant.

SERMON CLVII.

   Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.--Ver. 140.

   THERE are three things in this verse:--

   1. The excellency of the word, thy word is very pure.

   2. David's respect to it, thy servant loveth it.

   3. The connection between both, in the illative particle, therefore.

   1. The excellency of the word, Thy word is very pure.' That which we
   render very pure,' signifieth tried in the fire and refined; the
   Septuagint reads it, pepurome'non lo'gio'n sou spho'dra, thy word is
   set on fire; and so you may see it explained, Ps. xii. 6, The words of
   the Lord are pure words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth
   purified seven times.' The expression may import two things--(1.) The
   infallible certainty of the word; (2.) The exact purity.

   [1.] The infallible certainty of the word, as gold endureth in the fire
   when the dross is consumed. Vain conceits comfort us not in a time of
   trouble, but the word of God, the more it is tried, the more you will
   find the excellency of it. The promise is tried, as well as we are
   tried, in deep afflictions; but when it is so, it will be found to be
   most sure. In the old translation it is, Thy word is proved most pure:
   Ps. xviii. 30, The word of the Lord is tried; he is a buckler to all
   them that trust in him.' So Prov. xxx. 5, The word of the Lord is pure;
   he is a shield to all that trust in him.' As pure gold suffers no loss
   by the fire, so the promises suffer no loss when they are tried, but
   stand to us in our greatest troubles.

   [2.] It notes the exact perfection of the word. There is no dross in
   silver and gold that hath been often refined, so there is no defect in
   the word of God.

   2. Here is David's respect to the word; speaking of himself in the
   third person, he saith, Thy servant loveth it.' The children of God
   love the word, and the duty and obedience it prescribeth, so as
   effectually to follow it; that is love, and none but that.

   3. Here is his reason for it, Therefore I love it,' because it is pure.
   Wicked men hate it and slight it for this reason: the word of God is so
   pure that it ransacks their consciences, and therefore they cannot
   endure it: The carnal mind is not subject to the law of God, neither
   indeed can be,' Rom. viii. 7. But the saints do the rather embrace it:
   wicked men could wish it were less strict, that it might be calculated
   to their turns; but the children of God love it for this reason.

   Doct. That God's children see such purity in his word that therefore
   they value it and love it exceedingly.

   The point will be made good by four considerations:--

   1. That the word of God is pure.

   2. That this pure word must be loved and esteemed by us.

   3. That we must not only love God's word, but see why we love it.

   4. Among all the grounds and reasons of our love to the word of God,
   this is the most noble and excellent, to love it for its purity.

   For the first of these, that the word of God is pure, yea, as it is
   superlatively expressed in the text, it is very pure, that will appear
   in two respects--it is pure in itself, and it maketh us pure.

   1. It is pure in itself, because it is a holy rule, fit for God to give
   and us to receive, exactly comprising the whole duty of man. We need
   not seek elsewhere for direction in order to true happiness: Ps. xix.
   8, The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;' as
   metal refined from all dross, so here is not the least mixture of
   error, folly, or falsehood, not the least corruption or flaw to be
   found in it, as in all other books of human composure. All other
   writings come as short of the scripture as a coal doth of the sun. The
   whole art and design of this holy book is to advance the spiritual and
   heavenly life, and not to fashion our outward carriage a little for
   converse with men, but to bring us into fellowship and communion with
   God, and to direct us to do all things from holy principles, in a holy
   manner, to holy ends. There is no dead fly in this box of ointment, no
   blemish of weakness and imperfection; it hath the manifest impress of
   the author left upon it, and is the copy of that exact holiness which
   is in God himself.

   2. The word is very pure, as it maketh us pure if we diligently attend
   unto it: Ps. cxix. 9, By what means may a young man cleanse his way? By
   taking heed thereunto according to thy word.' It is not said, By what
   means may a young man guide his way; as if he were yet to choose, or
   were as white paper, indifferent to any impression. But by what means
   shall a young man cleanse his way? Man's heart naturally is a sink of
   sin, and he delighteth to wallow in this puddle, as swine do in the
   mire; he hath gotten a tang and smatch of the old Adam. Now, is there
   no way to make his heart and his way clean? Yes, if he will take God's
   counsel, and direct his life according to the word. A young man that is
   in the heat and strength of his lusts, he may be cured and cleansed.
   Christ prayeth, John xvii. 17, Sanctify them by thy truth; thy word is
   truth.' The work is God's, but he doth it by the truth or his will
   revealed in the word. He hath reserved the power of his Spirit for this
   dispensation and way of institution of mankind. A moral lecture may
   make a man change his life, but it is the word of God that changeth his
   heart: his Spirit goeth along with his word. So John xv. 3, Now you are
   clean through the word that I have spoken unto you.' The word is the
   instrument of purifying sinners, and to get rid of their sins. But how
   doth the word make us pure? As it is an appointed instrument of the
   Spirit, and as it is an accommodate instrument to such an end and
   purpose.

   [1.] It is an appointed instrument by which the Spirit will work: 1
   Peter i. 22, Ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth, through
   the Spirit.' It is the Spirit of Christ that powerfully worketh it, but
   yet in and by the truth: he worketh by his own means, he will not join
   his assistance with other things. The sum of what I would say is this,
   it was meet that God should give a rule to his creatures, or else how
   should they know his will? and then it was meet he should honour his
   rule by owning it above all other doctrines, by the concomitant
   operation of his Spirit, that this might be a constant authentic proof
   of its divine authority. The efficacy of the word is a pledge of the
   truth of it.

   [2.] It is a commodious instrument for this end and purpose, for there
   is a wisdom in all God's institutions. He that looketh upon an axe will
   say, This is an instrument made to cut; so he that looketh upon the
   scriptures must needs say, This is a means to purify. The word is more
   morally accommodated to work upon the heart of man then any other
   instrument, means, or doctrine in the world. Now the word doth so
   commodiously serve for this purpose because there are--(1.) Such pure
   precepts; (2.) Such pure examples; (3.) Such great helps to purity;
   (4.) Great encouragements to purity; (5.) Such great terrors to
   dissuade men from sin.

   (1.) There are pure precepts, setting forth the nature of that purity
   that is pleasing to God; and so, on the one hand, they serve to humble
   us for our natural filthiness; for verum est index sui et
   obliqui--truth showeth itself, and discovereth error also, James i. 34.
   It is such a pure doctrine that it showeth a man his natural face, and
   discovers soul-spots. And, on the other side, by these precepts and
   doctrines we are urged and enjoined to seek after true purity and
   holiness of the right constitution: 1 Tim. i. 5, The end of the
   commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and
   faith unfeigned.' The word telleth us God will be served, and that he
   will be served with a pure heart. The right end and scope of the whole
   law, as it is a gospel rule, is love to God and man, flowing from a
   sincere and renewed heart, and a good conscience rightly informed of
   God's will, and faith unfeigned, apprehending the grace of God towards
   us in Christ our Redeemer. So that you see there is required of us not
   only good actions, but good principles and ends.

   The apostle telleth us e'rgon no'mou, the work of the law, was written
   upon man's heart, Rom. ii. 14. Natural conscience will take notice of
   some gross acts, urge to some external conformity and show of duty; but
   the word of God taketh notice not only of acts, but the frame of the
   heart; not only of sins, but also of lusts. If ever there were an
   instrument fitted to do a thing, the word is fitted to make men pure
   and holy. Briefly, then, the word requireth purity of heart and life.
   That we should be pure in heart: Mat. v. 8, Blessed are the pure in
   heart, for they shall see God;' and pure in life: Blessed are the
   undefiled in the way,' Ps. cxix. 1. You have both in one place: James
   iv. 8, Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye
   double-minded;' both must be cleansed, both heart and hands. But we
   must first begin with the heart. The heart is that polluted fountain
   from whence floweth all the pollution of life: Mat. xv. 19, Out of the
   heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, blasphemies,' &c. It
   is in vain to cleanse the outside, unless the heart be cleansed; and
   therefore the scripture presseth us to wash our hearts from wickedness,
   Jer. iv. 14. There is the difficulty. It is more easy to heal an
   outward wound than to stanch an inward bleeding; and the cause is
   within. The purity of the outside is loathsome to God unless the heart
   be cleansed; it is more easy to prevent disorders in. our conversations
   than to cleanse our hearts; and therefore the scripture mainly calleth
   upon you to purge sin out of the heart, Mat. xxiii. 26, 27. Therefore
   the great design of the word of God, with which it travaileth, is to
   get the heart clean; as Elisha when he would cure the brackishness of
   the waters, cast salt into the fountain, so doth the word of God seek
   to cleanse the hearts of men, and all its wooings and pleadings and
   entreaties tend to this.

   (2.) There are pure examples and patterns. We miscarry by low examples,
   and grow loose and careless seeing others to be so; therefore the word
   is still to keep us humble under our defects, unsatisfied with our
   present measure, always contending, and striving towards the mark: it
   propoundeth all manner of examples to us. It propoundeth the example of
   God: 1 Peter i. 15, Be ye holy, as he that hath called you is holy, in
   all manner of conversation.' God is holy in all his ways, and righteous
   in all his works; and so should we be. And the scripture presseth us to
   be holy as Christ is holy: 1 John iii. 3, He that hath this hope in
   him, purifieth himself, as Christ is pure.' It is impossible there
   should be an exact equality, yet some answerable conformity there
   should be. God is essentially, immutably, infinitely holy: he loveth
   himself so much as he can be loved. His essence and his being is the
   same with his holiness. Our holiness is a superadded quality. God's
   holiness is like a vessel of pure gold, where the substance is the same
   with the lustre; but our holiness is like a vessel of earth gilded with
   gold; the substance is one thing, the varnish another. But yet this God
   and Christ must ever be before our eyes; we must be holy as he is holy;
   we must always be increasing in holiness. We must come into an abiding
   state of holiness. There must be some kind of conformity between God
   and us, and Christ and us; and head and members must be all of a piece.
   He will shoot farther that aimeth at a star, than he that aimeth at a
   shrub; so he will be more holy that doth as God doth, than he that doth
   as sinful creatures do, like himself. Nay, the scripture propoundeth
   the example of the saints, Heb. vi. 12. We need all kinds of examples.
   As we need high and glorious examples, that we may not rest in any low
   degrees and beginnings of purity, so lower examples, that we may not be
   discouraged, and think it impossible. And therefore the saints of God
   are propounded to us, men and women of like affections with us, the
   same natural interests, and we the same grace with them; the way to
   heaven is a trodden path all along; you may see the footsteps of the
   saints before you.

   (3.) The scripture offereth great helps to purity. Christ died to
   purchase it for us: Eph. v. 27, He gave himself for us, that he might
   sanctify and cleanse us by the washing of water through the word.' And
   God hath promised to give this clean heart to them that seek after it,
   and undertaketh to give what he requireth: Ezek. xxxvi. 25-27, I will
   sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean; from all your
   filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you: a new heart
   also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I
   will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a
   heart of flesh: and I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to
   walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.' God
   hath promised this to somebody, and why not to you? You are as fair for
   this promise as any; and if God hath not excluded you, why will you
   shut yourselves out from the grace offered?

   (4.) There are in the scripture excellent encouragements and motives
   from the reward promised to the pure. Lactantius saith of the heathen,
   Virtutis vim non sentiunt quia ejus praemium ignorant--that they were
   ignorant of the force of virtue, because they were not acquainted with
   the reward of it. There is a great force in scripture arguments in this
   kind. See how the scripture speaks of these promises; they are so
   great, so pure, and so expressly binding in their condition and
   qualification annexed. They are so great, 2 Cor. vii. 1, that having
   such great and precious promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all
   filthiness of flesh and spirit, and perfect holiness in the fear of
   God.' And then so pure: 1 John iii. 3, He that hath this hope in him
   purifieth himself as Christ is pure.' It is not barely said, He hath
   hope in him, hut, He that hath this hope. It is not a Turkish paradise,
   but a sinless estate; not an estate wherein we shall be engulfed in all
   sensualities, but satisfied with the vision of God, and made like him.
   Heaven is not only to be looked upon as a place of happiness, but a
   state of likeness to God. Once more, so many and so expressly binding
   to purity, in their condition and qualification annexed. See what the
   word of God speaks to purity, if we would enjoy the favour of God, and
   have him good to us: Ps. lxxiii. 1, Truly God is good to Israel, even
   to such as are of a clean heart.' Who are they that God will be good
   to? To Israel. All are not Israel that are of Israel; but those whose
   consciences are cleansed by the blood of Christ, and study to be clean
   -and holy in heart and life, those are God's Israel. However things
   fall out here, how blustering and boisterous soever the times are, yet
   God will be good to them that are his Israel. If we would have his
   favour actually exhibited, if we would have God to shine upon us, we
   must look after purity: Ps. xviii. 26, With the pure thou wilt show
   thyself pure, and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward.' God
   will be to man as man is to God. No degree of purity shall go
   unrewarded; the holy use of the creatures is their privilege: Titus i.
   15, To the pure all things are pure.' To the wicked all things are
   defiled, and they have a curse with their blessings; but to the pure
   these blessings are lawfully enjoyed, and are sanctified to them, and
   -they receive every temporal mercy as a blessing of the covenant. Would
   we be accepted in our service? Prov. xv. 26, The thoughts of the wicked
   are an abomination to the Lord, but the words of the pure are pleasant
   words.' The thoughts and words of wicked men are an abomination to the
   Lord, but the thoughts and words of the saints are his delight. God
   hath respect to the person and then to his services; so that we must be
   pure in heart if we would have our ser vices accepted of the Lord. Once
   more, the pure are those that shall be employed with honour for God: 2
   Tim. ii. 21, If a man purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel of
   honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto
   every good work.' Again, the purified and cleansed are meet to receive
   and retain the word: 1 Tim. iii. 9, Hold fast the mysteries of faith in
   a pure conscience.' None receive the word with such profit, and retain
   it with such warmth, as the pure in heart. Precious liquor is not put
   into musty, filthy vessels; if it be, it is corrupted and spoiled
   presently. Let a man be addicted to any worldly lust, and he will soon
   lose all the sense of good he hath received. Once more, none pray
   aright but the pure: Zeph. iii. 9, For then will I turn to the people a
   pure language, that they may call upon the name of the Lord;' and 1
   Tim. ii. 8, Lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;' and
   Heb. x. 22, Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of
   faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.' Then we
   draw near to God with comfort, being sure of audience. Once more, if we
   would be happy for ever more, who are they that shall see God? Mat. v.
   8, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.' You shall
   see the question propounded in Ps. xxiv. 3, 4, Who shall ascend into
   the hill of the Lord? who shall stand in his holy place?' And the
   question is answered in the third verse, He that hath clean hands and a
   pure heart.' It standeth upon us to examine how it is with us, since
   all the visible church are not saved; the pure and holy are they that
   shall see and enjoy God. Filthy dogs and impure and unclean swine are
   not suffered to enter into the new Jerusalem.

   (5.) Here are terrible threatenings; the word is impatient of being
   denied; it would have holiness and purity upon any terms; there is
   something propounded to our fear as well as to our hope. Sometimes the
   word of God threatens with the loss of happiness: Heb. xii. 14, Without
   holiness no man shall see the Lord.' If there were no more but this,
   this were enough to terrify us (to be shut out from the presence of the
   Lord!) if it were rightly considered. But oh! how miserable will the
   poor creature be that the word threatens with the loss of the vision of
   God, supposing the soul subsists! This is enough to over whelm us, that
   we shall never enter into the place where God is: Rev. xxi. 17, There
   shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth or worketh
   abomination.' But we hear of a worm that shall never die, a pit without
   a bottom, a fire that shall never be quenched, and torments that are
   without end and without ease. God shall say, I would have purged you,
   but you would not be purged. Whose heart doth not tremble at the
   mention of these things? Oh! then you see the word is very pure.

   The second consideration, that this pure word must be valued and
   esteemed and loved by us. Here I shall show you what it is to love the
   word, and then why.

   1. What it is to love the word.

   [1.] Negatively.

   (1.) It is not an outward receiving, or a loose owning of the scripture
   as the word of God. Many carnal men may so receive it, or rather not
   contradict it: they receive the word of God, not upon any divine
   testimony and evidence of the Spirit of God, but upon the authority and
   credit of men, the practice and profession of the nation where they
   live, and the injunctions of the civil state, or the tradition of the
   church. This is the just account of most men's faith and love to the
   word, and therefore they never feel the power of it. It cometh with
   power when it is the evidence of the Spirit, 1 Cor. ii. 4; human
   credulity breedeth no true love to the word of God.

   (2.) This love is not a bare approbation of purity and holiness; many
   approve that which they never choose and follow None in the face of the
   church can be such a wretch as not to think that it is a good thing to
   be holy, that strictness is commendable Mark vi. 26, Herod reverenced
   John. There is an excellency in holiness and it winneth esteem, even
   there where it is not embraced Purity is a stricture of God's majesty,
   and so it is feared. Where it is not loved it breedeth an aweful
   respect in wicked men. Natural conscience so far doth homage to the
   image of God, and doth incline men to think well of holiness, and to
   show some respect to it.

   (3.) It is not a pang or passionate delight; as some, when the word
   falls upon them, they may be stirred a little; it is not a love that is
   controllable, or easily overcome by other loves: John v. 45, How can ye
   believe, that seek honour one of another?' As Herod rejoiced in John's
   light for a season, and, Mark vi. 20, he loved John's preaching but he
   loved his Herodias better; and therefore off goes John's head! The love
   that he had, it was controllable by a higher love. Unless we be so
   addicted to the word that it prevaileth over all contrary inclinations,
   we do not love the word. Whether it be sensuality, or pride, or
   covetousness, it will be casting off the dominion of the word: John
   viii. 37, My word hath no place in you;' it doth not sink down into
   their hearts that it may bring forth fruit in their lives.

   [2.] Positively, what is it then?

   (1.) It is such a love as causeth us to wait at wisdom's gates, to
   consult with the word upon all occasions, to read it, hear it, meditate
   on it as the great instrument of sanctification. You will take it for
   your counsel, Ps. cxix. 4. That we love we will be thinking on often,
   and exercising our minds in it: Ps. i. 2, But his delight is in the law
   of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.' Oh, how
   few love the word thus! Few read and delight in the scriptures because
   of the purity and holiness that is in them. They read them for
   dispute's sake, or to know the mystery, or to be able to hold up an
   argument; but as they serve to make us pure and heavenly, who loves
   them so? as they forewarn us of sin, and quicken to grace and love to
   God? Ps. xix. 10, 11, Thy word is sweeter than honey or the honey
   comb,' because by them thy servant is forewarned.' Then we love the
   word when we love it for this reason.

   (2.) We love the word when we are chary of transgressing it, or doing
   anything contrary to the tenor of it. We are bidden to keep the
   commandment as the apple of the eye, Prov. vii. 2. The eye is a tender
   thing, offended with the least dust. Oh, take heed of offending the
   word of God! Fear of offending is a sure note and effect of love. So he
   that loves God, he fears the commandment: Prov. xiii. 13, Whoso
   despiseth the word, shall be destroyed; but whoso feareth the
   commandment, shall be rewarded.' A wicked man maketh no bones of a
   commandment, regardeth not what the word saith, but doth according to
   the bent of his own will. Those that will turn their back upon a
   commandment for the least temptation, they have no true love to the
   word of God. But now a godly man is one that feareth a commandment; he
   is afraid to do anything against the express will of God. If a
   commandment stands in his way, it is as much as if an angel with a
   drawn sword stood in his way, as the angel stood with a drawn sword in
   Balaam's way: they had rather have all the world against them, than the
   word against them, Isa. lxvi. 25. This aweful regard of the word of God
   it is a good evidence of our love to it.

   (3.) Then we are said to love the word when we cheerfully and readily
   delight to do what it requireth in order to the glory of God and our
   own salvation: that is love; for true love is not only notional, but
   practical: 1 John ii. 4, He that saith I know him, and keepeth not his
   commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.' Our love to God
   is known by our obedience to him; so our love to the word is known by
   our obedience to it. And therefore we love the word in good earnest
   when we observe it readily and diligently, whatever it costs us: Rom.
   vi. 17, Ye have obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine that was
   delivered to you.' Look, as there is a cold love to a man's brother,
   when we say, Be clothed, be warmed; so there is a pretended love to the
   word that endeth in talk, and not in action; which is as if a man
   should hope to pay his debts by the noise of money, and instead of
   opening his purse to shut it; as ridiculous it is to think to put off
   our duty with good words.

   (4.) It is a rooted affection. A carnal man may have his affections
   moved, and be a little stirred with this pure doctrine, but he is soon
   put out of humour; he is not changed by it, he hath not a constant
   affection to God and holy things: Gal. iv. 18, It is good to be
   zealously affected always in a good thing;' to hold out to the end, and
   still to keep up a warm respect to the word of God. This is to love it,
   to have the word ingrafted into the stock of corrupt nature, James i.
   21. It is not something tied on, but ingrafted into the soul; it hath
   place in the heart.

   2. Let me show you why.

   [1.] The necessity of this love to the word appears because without
   this love we cannot be accepted of God; unwilling and constrained
   service is of little acceptation with him: 1 Cor. xiii. 1-3, If I
   should give my goods to the poor, and my body to be burnt, and have not
   charity, it profiteth me nothing.' If a man hath never so many
   excellencies, if he spend his goods and life and all for God, without
   this sincere love to God and his ways, all is nothing. God doth not
   value men by the pomp of their services, but by the affection of their
   hearts in them; he needeth not the service, and he seeth the heart. A
   man is pleased so his work be done willingly or unwillingly, for he
   needeth the labour of the slave; but he seeth not into his heart; but
   God hath no need of us, and he seeth whether we give him the heart or
   no. So that if we have not charity, all that we do is nothing.

   [2.] Without this love your work will be very difficult, grievous, and
   irksome to you. It is love maketh all things pleasant and easy, and to
   go on roundly: 1 John v. 3, For this is the love of God, that we keep
   his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous.' A love to the
   commands of God will make us do them with cheerfulness. When a man
   loves God, it will be no grievous thing to serve him. It is said, Neh.
   iv. 6, That the building went on because the people had a mind to the
   work.' The building of the temple was a difficult task, to remove the
   rubbish, and carry on such a vast piece of work; but they had a mind to
   the work, and then it went on Love to anything makes it go on sweetly
   and cheerfully, as we use to say; so in God's service, if we love the
   work, we cannot count it difficult.

   [3.] You will never be constant with God without this love. An
   unwilling servant is ever running from his work, and he that hath not a
   heart fixed and set will find discouragement enough in heaven's way.
   They fell off that received not the truth in the love of it, 2 Thes.
   ii. 10. Fear hath compulsion in it, but it will not hold when the fear
   is worn off; but love is a lasting affection, when your hearts love
   holiness, and you love the work for the work's sake.

   Third consideration. It is not enough to love the word, but we must
   look after the grounds and reasons of this love.

   1. Because a true love to the word is not blind, but rational, and may
   be justified: Mat. xi. 19, Wisdom is justified of her children.' All
   that love God and his truth are able to plead for it. If you are not
   able to show your grounds and reasons for your love to the word, your
   love is but customary: Phil. i. 9, I pray that your love may abound in
   all knowledge and judgment.' Such a love and zeal is commendable as
   hath a proportionable measure of knowledge going along with it. When
   the spouse had spoken so much of her beloved, the question is
   propounded, Cant. v. 9, What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
   that thou dost thus charge us?' Christians should be able to say what
   is their Christ, and what is the religion they do profess; that there
   is more in their religion than in all religions in the world.

   2. Because many love it upon wrong reasons. There may be a natural and
   carnal love to spiritual things. Look, as a religious man in outward
   things rejoiceth spiritually, so a carnal man in spiritual things
   rejoiceth carnally. So Herod rejoiced in John's preaching with a human
   passion, Mark vi. 20, as he was a plausible preacher, and a rare and
   pregnant interpreter of the law. This was but a carnal affection; that
   is, thus: They may be pleased with notions, and elevated strains of
   wisdom. I remember a moralist gives this similitude: A gallant going
   into a garden prizeth flowers altogether for the beauty of them; but a
   physician he looks after their use and virtue in medicine, but they
   both go to look after flowers. So a godly man delights in the word of
   God; it is that he may be brought under the power of it, and made more
   holy and heavenly-minded; but others go to hear an argument rationally
   traversed, or to hear cadences of speech and pleasant language. It is
   not enough to take a liking to things, but we must know why. Nay, let
   me tell you that mere foreign and external reasons may sway us to
   delight in the word; when religion is in request, and groweth in
   fashion, and becometh matter of reputation, it is no great matter to be
   an honourer and admirer of it. Simon Magus will be a disciple and turn
   Christian too, when the whole city of Samaria listened to the apostles,
   and embraced their doc trine, Acts viii.; when there was so great an
   outward affluence.

   3. The more we view the grounds and reasons, the more our love is
   increased. It is clear the will and affections are moved by the
   understanding, and that ignorance is the cause of the contempt of the
   Lord's grace: If thou knewest the gift,' John iv. 10. We love, and
   fear, and hate, and joy, according to the apprehensions that we have of
   things; and therefore the more knowledge we have, the more love: Phil.
   i. 9, I pray that your love may abound in all knowledge.' If thou dost
   not increase in knowledge, thou wilt never increase in affection: 2
   Peter i. 2, Grace and peace be multiplied unto you by the knowledge of
   God and Jesus Christ our Lord.' Now, the more these grounds and reasons
   are drawn forth in the view of conscience, the more our love is
   stirred; as the more we beat the steel upon the flint, the more the
   sparks fly out.

   Fourth consideration. Of all the grounds and reasons of our love to the
   word of God, the most noble and excellent is to love the word for its
   purity.

   1. Because, this showeth indeed that we are made partakers of the
   divine nature,' 2 Peter i. 4. For I pray you mark, when we hate evil as
   evil, and love good as good, we have the same love and hatred that God
   hath. It showeth that the soul is changed into the likeness of God when
   we love a thing for its purity. God hath no interest to be advanced by
   the creature; he loves them more or less as they are nearer or further
   off from his glorious being. When once we come to love things because
   they are pure, it is a sign that we have the same love that God hath.

   2. This argueth a suitableness of heart to what God requireth, for
   things affect us as they suit with us: They that are after the flesh
   savour the things of the flesh,' Rom. viii. 5. The pure will only
   delight in pure things, but swine delight in puddles; they that have
   the spirit of the world, they must have worldly pleasure and honour,
   but the pure will delight in the word of God: 1 Cor. ii. 14, The
   natural man receiveth not the things of God,' and because they are not
   suitable to him. First we love things as suitable to our necessity, and
   then we love them upon interest, and afterwards as suitable to our
   disposition. Now it argueth a good frame of heart, and a deep sense of
   God's interest, when we love the word because it is so pure. A man
   first loves the word customarily, because he is born there where that
   religion is in fashion; and then when he beginneth to have a
   conscience, he loveth it for pardon and peace, as it offers a Saviour:
   his own happiness, self-love, puts him upon seeking after God; then
   afterwards his heart is suited to God's will, and there is something of
   kin in his heart to the will of God revealed without, and he loveth it
   for its suitableness of nature unto the will of God.

   3. To be sure this love is no way questionable, but is an undoubted
   evidence of right and sound love to the word of God. Many pretend to
   have a high estimation and respect to the doctrine of God when they
   cannot digest the directions of it, because it is contrary to their
   desires and carnal affections; they reserve something in their hearts
   that makes their love questionable. They that have not a real love to
   the word of God are but lightly tinctured with religion, not deeply
   dyed. The stony ground received the word with joy. Men may have strong
   affections and strange stirrings in their souls, and yet not be right
   with God. But here is an undoubted evidence, to love the word for its
   purity. A man's love may be questionable, because he may love the word
   upon foreign motives, either because of novelty, or fineness of
   expression, or public countenance and credit, or external advantage,
   John vi. 26. Vix diligitur Jesus propter Jesum. Or they may love it for
   internal reasons, as it is a good word, as they that tasted of the
   power of the world to come; they may look upon it for pleasure and
   profit, but not as good and holy. Many look upon the gospel as good and
   profitable, as offering peace, and pardon, and comfort, and eternal
   life. Nature, that hath naturally a sense of religion, hath also a
   hunger after immortality and blessedness; and therefore the promises of
   the gospel may be greedily catched after, as offering everlasting life
   and blessedness. But now a love to that which is pure and holy leaveth
   a more durable impression upon the soul. And further, many have a
   liking to the purity of the word, and a general approbation of it, as
   it is a fit rule for creatures to live by; yet unless there be a strong
   prevailing affection, all comes to nothing; and therefore nothing but
   this love to the word because of its purity is unquestionable.

   4. Unless we love the word as pure, we shall fail in many other parts
   of religion; we shall not love God as we ought, for God is lovely, not
   only as the fountain of blessedness, but as he is the most pure and
   perfect being. He was diligibilis naturae before any emanation of
   goodness passed from him. We are to love him in desertions, when we
   feel no good from him, and he seemeth to write bitter things against
   us, Isa. xxvi. 8. So that we cannot discharge this duty to love God as
   he is a pure and perfect being if we do not love the word because it is
   pure. And we shall not love the saints as we ought without this, Ps.
   xvi. 3. We are to love them for the image of God in them. If you love
   them that love you, what thanks have you?' Mat. v. 46. We are to love
   the saints as saints, and for that reason. Once more, we are to hate
   sin, as filthy, as it is a gross absurdity, and deordination of the
   human nature: Ps. xcvi. 10, Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.' Now,
   till we have this frame of heart, to love the law as it is pure, we can
   do none of these things; for there is the same reason for the one as
   for the other; and therefore it is not a nicety, but a necessary frame
   of heart.

   Use 1. To inform us that they can never love God and his ways that hate
   purity, till their hearts be changed. There are a sort of men in the
   world whose hearts rise against purity; for if they see any make
   conscience of sin, they brand them with the name of Puritans; so those
   that seek to keep themselves from sin, and the more holy they are, they
   are an eyesore to them. Now, can they say, I love thy law because it is
   pure, and cannot endure to see it copied out in others? Oh, what a vile
   disposition is this in you, to be despisers of that which is good! 2
   Tim. iii. 3. None live up to the purity of their profession but you
   scorn them; and let me tell you, you scorn that which is most glorious
   in God himself. Would a father take it well that a slave should mock
   his child because it is like him? So will God take it well that you
   should scorn those that are good, because they are like their heavenly
   Father? These are of the seed of the serpent, who are full of enmity;
   they have the old antipathy, Gen. iii. 15; Prov. xxix. 27. It is a vile
   scorn of the God of heaven to hate a man for his holiness. And they can
   never love the law, whatever they pretend, that do not love the law for
   its purity. A carnal distempered appetite hath no taste for the word of
   God, as it is a direction to holiness, 2 Cor. ii. 14.

   Use 2. To inform us in what rank to place principles. There are several
   sorts of principles; there are some that are false and rotten, and some
   more tolerable, and some good and sound, and some rare and excellent.

   1. There are some false and rotten principles, as carnal example and
   custom. Men will do as they have done, or as others do; they will own
   the religion that their fathers have done, be it what it will. By the
   same reason you may serve Mahomet as well as Christ. A man that
   standeth upon the vantage-ground is not taller than another; such are
   of no better constitution than the Turks, only they stand upon the
   vantage-ground. Another rotten principle is vainglory, to be seen of
   men, Mat. vi.; they pray and give alms to be seen of men. Come see my
   zeal for the Lord of hosts,' saith Jehu. Vainglory many times filleth
   the sails, and carries us on in the service of God. So secular and
   worldly interests and ends; as the Pharisees made long prayers that
   they might devour widows' houses, Mat. xxiii.; that is, they made long
   prayers and show of devotion, to be trusted with the management of
   widows' estates, to make a prey of them. All that I shall say to this
   principle is this, that it is better for the world that men would serve
   God anyhow, that Christ should be served out of vainglory, than not
   served at all; as the apostle saith some preach Christ out of envy, and
   others out of good- will, but I am glad so Christ be preached, Phil. i.
   18; though they themselves be rotten-hearted hypocrites, yet the world
   fares the better for it.

   2. There are some more tolerable principles, the hope of temporal
   mercies. When we come and pray, and do not seek the favour of God, but
   seek temporal mercies: Hosea vii. 14, They howled upon their beds for
   corn and wine.' Or the fear of temporal judgments, Isa. lviii. 5; Jer.
   ii. 16; when all that they do is to remove some temporal judgment: In
   their afflictions they will seek me right early.' And I think I may add
   one thing more here, the fear of eternal death, when it is alone
   (otherwise it is a grace); they shall be damned else; and so it is a
   sleepy sop to appease an accusing conscience, and so it is but a
   sin-offering. Though it requireth some faith to fear what is to come,
   yet fear of punishment alone showeth you are slaves, and only love
   yourselves: the devils fear and tremble, but do not love. Yon may fear
   a thing though you hate it. So far as the heart is affected with the
   fear of hell, it is good.

   3. There are very good and sound principles, yet do not always argue
   grace, as when duties are done out of the urgings of an enlightened
   conscience; this may be without the bent of a renewed heart, but yet
   the principle is sound; for the first thing that influenceth a man is
   to consider himself a creature, and so to look upon himself as bound to
   obey his creator. I shall illustrate it by the apostle's words in
   another case: I must preach the gospel, and woe unto me if I preach not
   the gospel,' 1 Cor. ix. 16, 17, Whether I do it willingly or
   unwillingly, yet a dispensation is committed to me.' So saith the soul,
   Whether I be fitted to do God service or no, God must be obeyed. But
   because God's precept is invested with a sanction of threatenings and
   rewards, here comes in the fear of hell and the hope of heaven. The
   Lord hath commanded me to fly from hell; this is a good principle: so
   the hope of heaven, Heb. xi. 26; it is a sound principle: a man may be
   gracious, or he may not. Many have a liking to heaven and eternal life,
   as it is a state of happiness, not of likeness to God. Where it is not
   alone, it is a very sound principle, but as it is, it may sometimes be
   the sign of a renewed man, and some times not.

   4. There are rare and excellent principles, when we act out of
   thankfulness to God, when we consider the Lord's goodness, that might
   have required duty out of mere sovereignty; he hath laid the foundation
   of it in the blood of his own Son, 1 John iv. 29; when we love him out
   of the sense of his love to us in Christ, and when the grace of God
   that hath appeared teacheth us to deny ungodliness, Titus ii. 11; when
   the mercies of God melt us, Rom. xii. 1; when there are no entreaties
   so powerful as that of love. Again, another principle that is rare and
   excellent is when the glory of God doth season us in our whole course,
   that it may be to the praise of his glorious grace, 1 Cor. x. 31.
   Another is complacency in the work for the work's sake, when we love
   the law because it is pure, when I see it will ennoble me and make me
   like God, when I love God and his ways, when nothing but so noble
   employment doth engage me to his service; and service to God is the
   sweetest life in the world.

SERMON CLVIII.

   I am small and despised; yet do I not forget thy precepts.--Ver. 141.

   HERE David proveth the truth of his former assertion, that seeing the
   word of God was so pure, he loved it for its own sake, and that he did
   not court religion for the portion that he should have with it, but for
   itself. Some are mere mercenaries; no longer than they are bribed by
   some worldly profit, have they any respect for God and his ways. The
   man of God was of another temper. If God would bestow any thing on him,
   well; if not, he would love his word still; yea, when it brought him
   apparent loss, meanness, and contempt, yet this could not make any
   divorce between his heart and the word: I am small and despised,' &c.

   In the words we have--(1.) David's condition; (2.) David's carriage
   under that condition. His condition might have been a snare to him, yet
   still he keepeth up his affection.

   1. His condition is set forth by two notions, the one of which implieth
   the other. God's providence, I am small.' God had reduced him to
   straits. The other, man's treatment of him, and despised.' The one
   showeth what he was really in himself, the other what he was in the
   opinion of others: mean in himself, and contemptible in the eye of
   others. The Septuagint has, neo'teros ego' eimi kai` exoudenome'nos--I
   am the younger, and set at nought; therefore the Greek interpreters
   suppose it relateth to the story where God bids Samuel to anoint one of
   the sons of Jesse to be king, and the elder children were brought
   forth, who were taller, and more likely too; and they said of them,
   Surely the Lord's anointed is before him; and when Samuel inquired for
   another, they told him, 1 Sam. xvi. 7, That there remaineth the
   youngest, and he keepeth sheep;' then, when he was but a youth, and a
   despised stripling, his heart was with God, and God favoured him. Or
   else they refer it to the time when Eliab his eldest brother despised
   him, 1 Sam. xvii. 28. Others think this was verified when the elders of
   Israel forsook him, and clave to Absalom. Bather I think it general to
   any afflicted condition, when he was little in estate and reputation,
   rather than in years; elsewhere so is this word small' taken: Arnos
   vii. 25, Jacob is small; by whom shall he arise?' when his condition
   was helpless and hopeless, and interest inconsiderable in the world. So
   here: I am small and despised;' I am looked upon as a man of no value
   and interest.

   2. David's carriage under this condition, Yet do I not forget thy
   precepts.' First, here is a mei'osis; less is said, more is intended: I
   do earnestly remember them. Again, a man may be said to remember or
   forget two ways--notionally or affectively. Notionally, a man forgets
   when the notions of things formerly known are quite vanished out of his
   mind; affectively, when, though he retaineth the notions, yet he is not
   answerably affected, he doth not act suitably. So it is taken here, and
   implieth as much as I am steadfast in the profession of this truth: as
   they say in a like case, Ps. xliv. 17, We have not forgotten thee, nor
   dealt falsely in thy covenant;' not parted with any point of truth, or
   neglected and dispensed with any part of duty. Precepts' is put for the
   whole word of God: I do not forget thy word,' the comforts and duties
   of it. None do so far forget God and his precepts as those that make
   defection from him. The sum of all is, My mean and despicable condition
   doth not make a breach upon my constancy, but still I keep the credit
   of being a faithful servant to thee. His temptation was double. His
   faithfulness had made him small (God seemeth to forget us in our low
   estate, yet we should not forget him), and had made him despised.
   Though we lose esteem with men by sticking to the word of God, yet the
   word of God should lose no esteem with us.

   Doct. They that love God may be reduced to a mean, low, and afflicted
   condition. I am small,' saith David. The Lord seeth it meet for divers
   reasons.

   1. That they may know their happiness is not in this world, and so the
   more long for heaven and delight in heavenly things: Ps. xvii. 14, 15,
   From men of the world, which have their portion in this life: as for
   me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when
   I awake with thy likeness.' Christ gave his Spirit to the rest of the
   disciples, and the purse to Judas; he had the keeping of the bag, that
   was the worst. God's dearest children usually have the least in this
   world, that they may look higher; as Levi had no portion among his
   brethren, because God would be his portion. Others have more plentiful
   accommodations for back and belly; they are better clad, their tables
   more plentifully furnished and supplied, larger portions for their
   children. They that look to save anything or get anything by religion
   but the saving of their souls are foully mistaken; if we have more than
   others, religion calleth for more disbursements. Charity and liberal
   distributions exposeth to troubles; religion moderateth our desires,
   and forbids all unjust ways of acquiring wealth, calleth upon us to
   forsake all for a good conscience. Therefore they that follow Christ
   out of a design to be rich in this world, lose their aim. Not but that
   hypocrites sometimes make a market of religion, but then God is angry,
   and they, and the church too, pay for it at last: not but that religion
   bringeth in temporal supplies: Mat. vi. 33, First seek the kingdom of
   God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto
   you,' tauta pa'nta prostethe'setai; food and raiment it bringeth in.
   God may give some a more plentiful allowance; especially if they be
   faithful stewards, then they are intrusted with more; but generally
   they are mean and small, or if they have more of this world's goods,
   they have their afflictions in other kinds.

   2. It is necessary to cut off the provisions of the flesh and the fuel
   of their lusts. A rank soil breedeth weeds, and when we sail with a
   full stream we are apt to be carried away with it. We either glut our
   selves with the pleasures of the flesh, or grow proud, and hanker and
   linger after the pomp and vanities of the world, and neglect God. And
   therefore God is fain to diet us, and to keep us bare and low; as he is
   said to cut Israel short, 2 Kings x. 32, when he straitened their
   coasts and borders. So for our cure we need not only internal grace to
   abate the lust, but external providence to catch away the prey and bait
   by which it is fed. The wise man saith not only, Give me grace, but
   Give me neither poverty nor riches,' Prov. xxx. 8, 9; and Gal. vi. 14,
   By whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.' Both parts
   are necessary. Riches are a great temptation; we would root here, and
   grow sensual, worldly, and proud, if God did not snatch our comforts
   from us, when we are apt to surfeit of them. A plentiful portion of
   temporal things is spiritually dangerous.

   3. That they may be more sensible of his displeasure against their sins
   and scandalous carriage, by which they have dishonoured him and
   provoked the pure eyes of his glory. Never have scandals fallen out but
   some great woe followed: Mat. xviii. 7, Woe to the world, because of
   offences.' Therefore God hath brought his people low that he may
   vindicate his name, which through their means is blasphemed, Rom. ii.
   24, and make his people sensible of their sin. The world shall know
   that he doth allow sin no more in them than in others; and therefore,
   though they were as the signet upon his finger, he will pluck them off,
   and make them feel the smart of their wanderings: Amos iii. 2, You only
   have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish
   you for all your iniquities.' They that have been so near and dear to
   him, the world might think he did approve their sins if he did not
   manifest his displeasure at them. Usually their sins go nearest his
   heart, and meet with the sorest vengeance: Deut. xxxii. 19, When the
   Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provokings of his sons
   and of his daughters.' Their relation to God, their privileges, and the
   consequences of their actions, aggravate their sins; and therefore God
   is most quick and severe in punishing their sins. We complain we were
   brought low, but were not our provocations first very high? The most
   religious cannot wipe their mouths, and excuse themselves as faultless.
   Oh! what a sad part hath been lately acted upon the public stage! What
   a trade have many driven for themselves under a mask of religion! What
   breaches in the body of Christ, uncharitable divisions, making a
   profession of the name of Christ for carnal ends!

   4. That we may learn to live upon the promises, and learn to exercise
   suffering graces; especially dependence upon God, who can support us
   without a temporal visible interest. Compare Rev. xii. 11, And they
   overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
   testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death;' Rev. xiii. 7,
   And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome
   them; and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and
   nations.' You shall see how the enemies overcome, and the saints
   overcome; the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. The beast
   raiseth the world against the saints, and prevaileth over their bodies;
   he overcomes them by spoiling them, of liberty, lives, and temporal
   estate; but they overcome by adhering to truth, and resisting his
   temptations and their own corruptions even in the lowest estate by
   suffering. So for other graces,--patience, meekness, self-denial,
   spiritual comforts. As the stars in their order fought against Sisera,
   so all graces are exercised in their turn: Rev. xiii. 10, Here is the
   faith and patience of the saints;' that is, a time to act these graces.
   A full third of the scriptures would be lost which containeth comfort
   for afflicted ones, if God did not exercise them with temporal
   afflictions.

   5. That God may convince the enemies that there is a people that do
   sincerely serve him, and not for carnal selfish ends, Job i. The carnal
   world suspects private, selfish, worldly aims and designs in all that
   we do, and attributes all our duties to interest; being themselves led
   by interest, they cannot think others are led by conscience. Men are
   apt to suspect and malign what they will not imitate. There is
   sometimes too much advantage given; many are mercenaries, only esteem
   the ways of God when beneficial to them: John vi. 26, Ye seek me not
   because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and
   were filled.' Therefore it is needful to heighten the price of religion
   when it is too cheap a thing to be a Christian. This God doth by
   bringing his people low, that the world may see some will cleave to him
   in all conditions; not only when his ways are befriended, but when
   frowned upon. God will glorify himself and his truth by their
   constancy.

   6. That his glory may be more seen in their deliverance; and therefore
   before God doth appear for his children, he bringeth them very low.
   Thus Paul, 2 Cor. i. 9, We had the sentence of death in our selves,
   that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God, which raised the
   dead;' and Ps. cxxxvi. 23, He remembered us in our low estate, for his
   mercy endureth for ever.' His mercy and power is the more glorious in
   our rescue.

   All that I shall say by way of use on this point is this--

   1. That when we are a small people, and persons of no interest, we have
   a liberty to use it to God; you may make use of your weak and low
   condition as an argument of pity. So doth the prophet Amos, Jacob is
   small;' so doth David here and elsewhere: Ps. cix. 22, But I am poor
   and needy; deliver me for thy name's sake;' and Ps. lxix. 29, But I am
   poor and sorrowful; let thy salvation, O God, set me on high.' It is
   some ease to acquaint a friend with our griefs that can only pity us,
   much more when we have liberty to go to God, who can and will help us,
   and will allow us to complain to him, though not of him.

   2. When God's ends are accomplished there is hope: Isa. x. 12, When the
   Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount Zion;' when he hath
   chastised his people, and brought them to his purpose, then he will
   reckon with his enemies; when heaven is minded more, and earth less. We
   naturally mind earthly things, and please our selves with the dreaming
   of a happy estate in the world; the appetite of temporal dominion, and
   wealth, and honour, and peace is natural to us, and very hardly
   subdued; and therefore we would fain flourish here, and do not comfort
   ourselves in our crosses with the meditation of the glory of the world
   to come, but are always feeding ourselves with desires and hopes of
   earthly happiness, and of turning the tide and current of affairs, that
   things may again smile, upon us; and when frustrated and disappointed
   of this hope, our soul fainteth. Your worldly happiness will be a snare
   to you while you are thus affected, Mat. vi. 33. Prepare for heaven,
   and God will give you so much happiness by the way as will be needful
   and fit for you. Again, when we are mortified, and the cross hath
   purged out sin, Isa. xxvii. 9, the cross hath done its work. So when we
   are humble: Lev. xxvi. 41, If then their uncircumcised hearts be
   humble, and they accept of the punishment of their iniquity.' To be
   meek in spirit and to trust in the Lord is a forerunner of mercy: Zeph.
   iii. 12, I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
   people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord.' When you bring
   honour to God by your sufferings: James i. 4, But let patience have its
   perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.' When
   it is most for God's glory to do it: Deut. xxxii. 36, For the Lord
   shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he
   seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up or left.'

   Doct. God's people, when they are brought low, are usually a very
   despised people, the most despised people under heaven.

   Here I shall show--

   1. That this is the usual lot of an afflicted people.

   2. But especially of the people of God.

   3. The trial is very grievous to them.

   1. An afflicted people are usually a despised people: Ps. cxxiii. 4,
   Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at
   case, and with the contempt of the proud.' They that are proud, and
   have all things flow in upon them according to their own will, contemn
   and slight others, and take no notice of their burdens, unless it be to
   increase them; they pour vinegar on the wound. The heathens had a
   reverence for places stricken with thunder, because the hand of God had
   touched them; but here it is not so: Job xii. 5, He that is ready to
   slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thoughts of him that is
   at ease.' While we are burning lamps, shining in riches and greatness,
   we shall have enough to look after us; but a poor, broken, dying lamp,
   a snuff, that is ready to go out, everybody holdeth their nose at it.
   Whilst the enemies are honourable, great, tumble in wealth and the
   excess of carnal delights, they despise those that are mean and low,
   and fallen under God's hand.

   2. The people of God, much more common sufferers, may meet with some
   pity in their calamity, but the godly are subject to reproaches and
   mockings in their troubles; and this many times proveth the heaviest
   part of the cross, and maketh it most grievous to be borne. It is so
   partly because they are fallen from their great hopes, carried on in a
   way of religion. Where is their God, their fasting, prayer? As if all
   were now delusions and fantastical impressions. And partly because the
   presence of God is sensibly gone from them. The presence of God among
   his people maketh them wise, courageous, prosperous. How should one
   chase a hundred, and a hundred put a thousand to flight? But when God
   leaveth them, they grow despicable and ridiculous above all others:
   Hosea xiv. 1, Return to the Lord thy God, for thou hast fallen by thine
   iniquity.' All that honoured her shall despise her, because her
   nakedness is seen,' Lam. i. 8. A dispirited, judgment-blasted people
   shall be contemned. And partly because the cause for which they suffer
   may be strangely disguised and ill-represented to the world. Satan was
   first a liar and then a murderer, John viii. 44. Elijah was thought the
   troubler of Israel. They may not only persecute, but say all manner of
   evil against us falsely for Christ's sake, Mat. xi. 19. Christ is
   called a glutton, a wine-bibber; and Stephen a blasphemer. And partly
   by Satan's instigation; by this means he maketh the despisers increase
   their sin and hasten their judgment, and so he dissuades and
   discourages many weak Christians from owning the despised ways of
   Christ; yea, it taketh off much of the cheer fulness and courage of the
   strong in the profession of godliness.

   3. It is very grievous. Contempt maketh our other trials more sharp.
   Every man thinketh himself worthy of some respect, and would be
   somebody in the world, and therefore, when we are laid aside as if dead
   and useless, the temptation is the greater. Saul could better bear
   death than contempt: 1 Sam. xxxi. 4, Draw thy sword and thrust me
   through, lest the uncircumcised come and abuse me.' Zedekiah was afraid
   of mocking: Jer. xxxviii. 19, Lest they deliver me into the hands of
   the Chaldeans, and they mock me.' But not only as we are men is it
   grievous to us, but also as Christians; because this contempt
   reflecteth upon our hopes and the worship of God; it hindereth our
   service: while we were esteemed we did more good, and had greater
   advantages. It may revive the sense of guilt. God saith, 1 Sam. ii. 30,
   Them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
   lightly esteemed.' We have made God's name to be reproached, and
   religion to be lightly esteemed; we may own the justice of God in all
   this.

   Use. Oh! then, let us be fore-armed against this temptation, that when
   we lose esteem with wicked men, because we will not comply with their
   lusts, we may bear it patiently. Surely we stand too much upon honour
   and respect, and have too tender a sense and feeling of contempt, when
   it discourageth us in the ways of God. A Christian should seek the
   honour that cometh from God only, and be content with his approbation.
   I know it is a blessing to have respect with men; it is said of our
   Lord Christ that he grew in favour with God and with men, Luke ii. 52;
   the same also is spoken of Samuel: 1 Sam. ii. 26, And the child grew,
   and was in favour with God and with men.' It is a blessing where it may
   be had without any violation of duty. When God blameth us not, and men
   have no just complaint against us, our care must be to provide things
   honest in the sight of God and men, Rom. xii. 17; to take away all
   cause of offence both from Jew and Gentile, and from the church of God,
   1 Cor. x. 32. But if men will not be pleased but with the offence of
   God, we should count it a privilege to be worthy of the world's hatred.
   Gratias ago Deo meo, quod dignus sum, quem mundus oderit, saith
   Hierome; be not discouraged if they slight you that slight God and
   Christ and their own salvation. Our self-love is too great when so
   tender to suffer a little disgrace and contempt for Christ, who hath
   suffered so many and so great indignities for us. Therefore, though we
   be small and despised, let our affection be as great to the word as
   ever; say, 2 Sam. vi. 22, I will yet be more vile than this, and base
   in mine own sight.' Alas! many cannot bear contempt, coguntur esse mali
   ne viles habeantur, as Salvian complains in his days. As we should not
   forsake the despised ways of God, so not be dejected and troubled at
   it; better we be despised than God dishonoured; therefore let us
   purchase the glory of God with our disgrace. To animate you--

   1. Consider it is the usual lot and portion of God's children. When God
   meaneth thoroughly to humble his children, he suffereth them to be
   odious in the eyes of the people where they live: we need so sharp a
   means to do us good, therefore the church complaineth of contempt: Lam.
   iii. 45, Thou hast made us as the off-scouring and refuse in the midst
   of the people.' You will say this was a sinning nation. Nay, the
   apostle saith the same thing of himself and other apostles: 1 Cor. iv.
   13, We are made the filth of the world and the off-scouring of all
   things;' cast out, as the sweeping of the city. Yea, Christ himself
   complaineth, Ps. xxii. 6, I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men,
   and despised of the people;' as if he were but as a worm to be trod
   upon in respect of the world. Thou canst not be more despised than
   Christ was. So Isa. liii. 3, He is despised and rejected of men; a man
   of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; we hid our faces as it were from
   him: he was despised, and we esteemed him not.' Well, if this be a
   common lot and portion of God's people, it is more usual to persecute
   with contempt than with violence; men are kept off by the restraint of
   laws.

   2. Shall we not suffer a little for Christ who suffered so much for us?
   He hath endured greater reproaches for our sakes; and what are we to
   him? If he endured shame, was made a curse for us, what a softness and
   tenderness have we for our interests! Mat. x. 24, The disciple is not
   above his master, nor the servant above his lord,' &c.

   3. We must be dead to esteem, credit, and reputation, as well as other
   things, or else we are incapable of the kingdom of heaven: John v. 44,
   How can ye believe, that seek honour one of another, and seek not the
   honour that cometh of God only?' John xii. 41, 42, These things said
   Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. Nevertheless among the
   chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees
   they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the
   synagogue.' It is not enough to deny brutish pleasures, to escape
   sordid covetousness, but all prizing of our own credit, content to be
   nothing, that Christ maybe all in all, or else there is some affection
   not yet subdued to Christ's interest; any interest of ours that cometh
   into competition with Christ must be denied.

   4. This is the true fortitude. We all affect to be counted men of
   spirit and courage; there is not a greater evidence of it than when we
   can endure contempt for Christ. Military valour depends upon bodily
   spirits; it is a more brutish thing. Peter, that ventured upon a band
   of men, was overcome by the weak blast of a damsel's question. He that
   can in a generous contempt count man's day nothing: 1 Cor. iv. 3, But
   with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of
   man's judgment,' &c.

   5. The more despised in the world for righteousness' sake, the more
   honourable with God. If they could hinder your esteem with him it were
   something, 2 Cor. x. 18. He is approved whom the Lord commendeth. They
   will ever be of great account in heaven that have washed their garments
   in the blood of the Lamb, and kept themselves unspotted from the world,
   and are clothed with the sun and have the moon under their feet, Rev.
   xii. 1. The true and afflicted despised church is in the eyes of God
   fair as the sun, pure as the moon, Cant. vi. 10. You are an elect seed,
   a royal priesthood, 1 Peter ii. 9.

   6. If we cannot endure a little disgrace for God, what shall we do when
   called to resist unto blood? Jer. xii. 5, If thou hast run with the
   footmen, and they have wearied thee, how canst thou contend with
   horses?' Scommata nostra ferre non potes, &c.

   7. God hath his times of bringing you into request again: Ps. xxxvii.
   6, He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
   judgment as the noon-day;' Zeph. iii. 19, Behold, at that time I will
   undo all that afflict thee, and will save her that halteth, and gather
   her that was driven out, and I will get them praise and fame in every
   land where they have been put to shame.' All God's children were
   despised in their time, and yet afterwards were honoured. There is a
   resurrection of names as well as persons. Abraham gave Isaac his son to
   God in sacrifice, and received him again; so we receive our names from
   reproach and contempt. He that draweth light out of darkness is able to
   revive our credit and esteem; if not in this world, yet in the world to
   come we shall be glorious, though our condition be never so
   contemptible here; our reward is not in this life. When he dies, the
   beggar is carried into Abraham's bosom. Would you be in the condition
   of Dives or Lazarus? to wallow in ease and plenty, and go to hell, and
   be cast out with the devil and damned spirits? or to be poor and
   despised here, to be carried by angels into the presence of God
   hereafter? So at the day of judgment: Mat. x. 32, Whosoever therefore
   shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father
   in heaven;' we shall be publicly owned.

   8. Great contempt shall be poured upon those that now contemn you. When
   Hanun offered injury to David's servants, he took severe revenge of it.
   God will require an account of all the wrongs and affronts that are put
   upon his servants. The wicked shall be made the scorn of good men and
   angels: Ps. Hi. 6, 7, The righteous also shall see and fear, and laugh
   at him. Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, but trusted
   in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
   wickedness; but I am like a green olive-tree,' &c.

   Doct. That though our condition be small and despicable, yet we should
   be still faithful in our respects to God and his word.

   1. The temptation will not excuse us. Esse bonum facile est, ubi quod
   vetat esse remotum est. Our trial is expressly mentioned in the
   promise, as necessary for our crowning: James i. 12, When he is tried;'
   when the temptation is over, the trial is past. It is no praise for a
   woman to be chaste that hath no suitors. Adam was tempted by Eve, and
   Eve by Satan, yet both bore their burden. Si taceret Deus et loqueretur
   Satan, &c. Why should we hearken to Satan's suggestions rather than
   God's admonitions?

   2. God observeth what we do in our trouble: Ps. xliv. 20, 21, If we
   have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a
   strange god, shall not God search out this, for he knoweth the secrets
   of our hearts?' If we slacken our service to God, or fall off to any
   degree of apostasy, the judge of hearts knoweth all; God knoweth
   whether we have or would deprave and corrupt doctrine, worship, or
   ordinances, or whether we will faithfully adhere to him, to his word,
   and worship, and ordinances, whatever it cost us.

   3. God and his law are the same, and therefore though our condition be
   altered, our affections should not. If we love the word of God upon
   intrinsic reasons, there is the same reason we should adhere to it with
   love still, as to embrace it out of love: ver. 142, Thy righteousness
   is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.' Among men,
   that may be just to-day which is not so to-morrow, because they and
   their laws alter; but God's law is the eternal rule of righteousness,
   that never alters.

   4. In our poor and despicable condition, we see more cause to love the
   word than we did before; because we experiment supports and comforts
   which we have thereby: Rom. v. 3, Knowing that tribulation worketh
   patience,' &c.; 2 Cor. i. 5, For as the sufferings of Christ abound in
   us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.' God hath special
   consolations for his afflicted and despised people; and makes their
   consolation by Christ to run parallel and to keep pace with their
   sufferings for Christ.

   Use 1. Carry your duty still in remembrance. The first step of
   defection is to forget what God hath commanded. There is an oblivion,
   and a darkness for the present on the mind, so that a man knoweth not
   what he knoweth &gt; as Hagar saw not the well that was before her,
   till God opened her eyes. Therefore revive the grounds of your
   adherence, if you would constantly adhere to God. The temptation cometh
   afresh upon you every day, with all the enticing blandishments; so
   should the reasons of your duty. It helpeth our perseverance to
   consider how strong and cogent they are, and what wrong we should do to
   God and religion to consent. At first a man beholds temptations with
   horror; but being familiarised, our thoughts are more reconciled to
   them; therefore recollect yourselves, and remember the reasons you
   first had to put you upon your duty; and if you duly consider them,
   they will be strong and cogent to repel the temptation, that would take
   you off from it.

   Use 2. It showeth who are lovers of the word and who not. On the one
   hand, some love the precepts of God when they are in honour and esteem,
   have many to join with them, and they see peace and plenty follow the
   profession of it; but rather than they will endure trouble and
   contempt, forsake it. The Samaritans would be Jews when the Jews were
   favoured; but in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, when the Jews were in
   trouble, they would be called Sidonians, ouke'th' omolo'goun to`n en
   Garizi`n nao`n tou megi'stou theou, dedicating their temple not to
   Jehovah but Jupiter (Josephus). These never received the love of the
   truth. On the other side, when a man loveth it alike in all times and
   in all conditions, when rich, when poor, in liberty and in bonds, when
   the ways of God are countenanced or when despised, it is all one to
   him; they love it not for out ward respects, but internal reasons.
