Preface

   It often happens that many things in a book are intelligible only to
   those who are familiar with the mind and character of the author. An.
   expression or phrase, which may ordinarily be passed over as
   unimportant, becomes instinct with meaning and suggestiveness, when
   read by one who has the advantage of an intimate acquaintance with the
   writer by whom it was used. And if this be true in regard to the chief
   leaders of thought in the present day, it is truer still when the
   reader and writer find themselves separated from each other by a long
   distance of time.

   Now the realisation of this has often made me feel that a much fuller
   apprehension of the real teaching of the Book of Common Prayer would be
   attained, if more light could be thrown upon the views and characters
   of the different men who compiled and revised it.

   Many summaries of the history of the Book have been given to the world
   at divers times, but the authors have for the most part been satisfied
   with little more than the bare enumeration of the names of men who were
   charged with a work unequalled in importance for the influence which it
   has exercised on the worship of the Church. In a few instances, e.g.
   Cranmer or Ridley or Cosin, there was no necessity to do anything more,
   but Day and Thirlby and Morley (to select at haphazard), except to the
   real student of Ecclesiastical History, have been names, and names
   only.

   Perhaps it would be impossible to illustrate more forcibly the
   advantages of such a plan as I proposed to myself than by a reference
   to the Council of Nicæa. Its history has often been written, and the
   names of the leading Bishops who took part in it have been familiar
   enough; but what a world of fresh interest aatliered into that
   Council-chamber by the Bithynian Lake, when Stanley seized the dry
   bones, and clothed them with flesh and blood, and stampt its own
   individuality upon every form! However much men may dissent from his
   conclusions, no one can deny that by the portraits of the disputants
   which he has drawn, from Constantine and Athanasius to Spiridion and
   Paphnutius, he has imparted a reality to the scene, as refreshing as it
   is instructive.

   The materials upon which I have drawn for what I have written in the
   following pages are so scattered and various that anything like a full
   acknowledgment is impracticable. Much of course has been found in such
   standard histories as those of Collier, Fuller, Peter Heylin, and
   Strype in earlier times; or in Hook's Lives of the Archbishops, and
   Froude's History of England, and Dr. Stoughton's series of works on
   Ecclesiastical History in later times. Separate Biographies, Diaries,
   Histories of individual Colleges at the two Universities, Athenoe
   Oxonienses and Annales Cantabrigienses, have supplied sufficient matter
   for forming a fair estimate of the opinions of the Bishops and Divines
   who were most concerned with the growth and development of the
   Prayer-book.

   Dr. Stoughton's Histories have had an especial interest, as putting
   forth far more ably and attractively than ever before the views of
   Nonconformists upon those critical times.

   But while according him much praise for the general tone, the vivacity
   and the clearness of his writings, it is impossible not to see that he
   has failed to recognise the real standpoint of the Church. For
   instance, he speaks without any reserve in condemnation of the ejection
   of the ministers in 1662 A.D., and tries to enlist our sympathies with
   the sufferings which they had to undergo, because they were too
   conscientious to conform to the Church of the Restoration, ignoring the
   fact that, twenty years before, their opponents had suffered equally,
   and that too at the hands of men who had usurped the government. If the
   Nonconformists had their "black Bartholomew," the Bishops and the
   Established clergy had theirs also ; indeed, not a few of the ministers
   who made such a grievance of being cast out in 1662 A.D. were actually
   holding benefices from which the orthodox incumbents had been ousted
   during the Commonwealth.

   It only remains for me now to perform the pleasant task of expressing
   my grateful acknowledgments to those who have aided me in the work
   which this publication has entailed. These are due especially to the
   Bishop of the Diocese, for help directly and indirectly given, as well
   for suggestions before its commencement, as for criticism of the
   results when the work was concluded. Doubts and perplexities were
   certain to arise, where the right understanding of a book, second in
   importance only to the Bible, was the object in view.On such occasions
   I have found myself not infrequently appealing to his counsel and
   judgment, and rarely without seeing the prospect cleared, and the
   difficulties made easier to contend with.

   Next I would tender my thanks to the Rev. CANON VENABLES, Precentor of
   Lincoln, for having kindly examined the printed pages, and suggested
   some useful alterations. Also I gratefully acknowledge the help in
   revising and correcting the proof-sheets, which I have received from
   the Rev. W. B. TREVELYAN, my colleague in the Ely Theological College.
   And lastly, I may not forget that a fairly exhaustive Index--that part
   of a work on which much of its usefulness so frequently depends, but
   which nevertheless the author is so ready to neglect--is the acceptable
   contribution of a member of my own family.

   And now in sending forth this humble treatise, I would express an
   earnest prayer that He, with Whose worship well-nigh every page of it
   is concerned, will bless its influence for an ever-increasing love, and
   a more intelligent and reverential use of those Forms of Prayer and
   Ceremonial observances, for which such brave battle was done in more
   troublous times.

Preface of the Second Edition.

   In sending forth the Second Edition I cannot forbear to express my
   thanks to numerous correspondents, especially to not a few of the
   Bishops of the Church and their Examining Chaplains, tor their kindly
   recognition of this effort to infuse fresh life into a too much
   neglected subject. The careful criticisms and suggestions of Canon
   Bright have led me to modify a few passages, as well as to supply some
   additional matter, chiefly in connection with the Scotch Liturgy.

   Many recommendations, though valuable in themselves, I have been
   obliged to disregard, inasmuch as to have carried them out would have
   altered too largely the character of the book, and brouht it into
   undesirable competition with others.

Introductory Chapter.

   It may help the reader to a better understanding of the subject which
   we have endeavoured to illustrate in this book if we notice briefly the
   conditions of Public Worship in the country before we arrive at the
   great epochs with which the Book of Common Prayer is more immediately
   concerned.

   Notices of the Early British Church.

   The materials from which the historian is able to draw for a
   description of the Church and everything connected with it among the
   Britons are so scanty that much uncertainty must necessarily prevail.

   Tertullian, [1] in the second century, says that "even those parts of
   Britain hitherto inaccessible to Roman arms had been subdued by the
   gospel of Christ;" and Origen, [2] half a century later, testifies that
   "the power of God our Saviour is even with those in Britain who are
   divided from our world."

   At the beginning of the fourth century we find the British Christians
   governed by Bishops. In 314 A.D., at the Council of Aries in Gaul,
   among the signatures to the Canons then passed occur the names of
   Eborius, Bishop of York, Restitutus of London, and Adelphus of Lincoln
   (or perhaps, Caerleon).

   Again, British Bishops are associated with the Councils of Sardica in
   Illyria, 343-4 A.D., and Ariminum in Italy, 359 A.D. Though not
   actually present at the former, they assented to its decrees, while, in
   connection with the latter, it is worthy of notice, as bearing upon the
   poverty-stricken condition of the Church in this land, that, when the
   Emperor offered to defray the expenses of the Bishops who attended, the
   offer was declined except by those from Britain, who were too poor to
   refuse.

   The source from which they drew their Liturgy.

   In 429 A.D. an event occurred which in all probability had an important
   influence upon the after-worship of the Church. The Britons, finding
   themselves unable to oppose the spread of Pelagianism, sent to Gaul for
   some learned men to come over to help them. A Gallic Synod was called,
   and Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus of Troyes, were sent as a
   deputation, and after completely refuting the errors of the heretics,
   whom they met in controversy at Verulam, they returned home, but only
   to be reinvited to establish the Britons in the Faith, and build them
   up in the doctrines of the Catholic Church. It is to the second visit
   of Germanus, 447 A.D., accompanied on this occasion by Severus, a
   disciple of his, former companion, that the introduction of the
   Gallican Liturgy and Ritual is most probably to be attributed.

   The mission of St. Augustine.

   And from this date, passing over a dark and obscure page in the
   Ecclesiastical history of the country, we come to the Mission of St.
   Augustine.

   It is on his arrival with his forty companions, April 14, 597 AD, that
   for the first time we have any definite mention of the existence of
   particular Forms of Worship in the British Church. The Gallican Liturgy
   was then in use in St. Martin's Church, Canterbury, where Queen Bertha
   worshipped, and Bishop Luidhard ministered: not perhaps in all points
   in its original shape, for variations were common in the Primitive
   Liturgies, arising from a multiplicity of causes, such as the
   peculiarities of a people, their habits and tastes, or the wishes of
   the Bishop of the Diocese. One thing however is certain, that when St.
   Augustine landed in England, he found a congregation of Christian
   people using for their highest Act of Public Worship a Service which
   they had derived from Gaul.

   We are almost surprised that he should have expressed so much anxiety
   to supersede it by the Roman. Had it been a Liturgy of the Oriental
   type, the variations from that to which he was accustomed would have
   been so numerous that his desire to substitute his own would have been
   quite intelligible: but between the Roman and the Gallican there were
   so many points of resemblance [3] that he might well have been
   satisfied to leave the existing Forms undisturbed. But he was impatient
   of any divergence, and inquired of Pope Gregory "why one custom of
   Masses should be observed in the holy Roman Church, and another in the
   Gallican"? He hoped no doubt that he would receive authority to impose
   the Roman in all cases without hesitation, but he was doomed to
   disappointment.

   The Pope, in his reply, showed him that there was no obligation to
   insist upon the Roman.Gregory's reply to his question. "You know," he
   writes, "the custom of the Roman Church in which you remember you were
   bred up. But it pleases me that if you have found anything either in
   the Roman or the Gallican or any other Church, which may be more
   acceptable to Almighty GOD, you carefully make choice of the same, and
   sedulously teach the Church of the English, which as yet is new in the
   faith, whatsoever you can gather from the several churches. For things
   are not to be loved for the sake of places, but places for the sake of
   good things. Choose, therefore, from every Church those things that are
   pious, religious, and upright, and when you have, as it were, made them
   up into one body, let the minds of the English be accustomed thereto."
   [4]

   How far the advice was followed is a disputed question. Perhaps the
   most probable explanation of the different views is to be found in the
   supposition that the two Forms of Liturgical practice continued side by
   side for a time: those Churches which owed their origin to the
   missionary adopting that of their founder, while such as used the
   Gallican before his arrival continued their worship unchanged.

   Such divergence, however, ceased in the eighth century, when by a
   decree of the Council of Cloves-hoo, [5] 747 A.D., it was decreed that
   the Roman Missal should be adopted throughout England.

   But in addition to the Worship of the Altar with which alone the rare
   notices hitherto have been concerned, we now meet with daily worship
   and more frequent services. During that stage of Church history which
   reaches from the Mission of St. Augustine to the Conquest, all our
   interest gathers round the Monasteries.

   The rise and spread of monasteries in England.

   These had existed before in different parts, to which the numerous
   "Bangors" [6] are said to testify. At Bangor Iscoed, at Bangor Wydrin
   (or Glastonbury), and "the great Bangor over Conway," and in other
   places, Monastic Colleges were built and formed centres of religious
   study and worship; but the system took no real hold of the country till
   the beginning of the seventh century. From this time forward it spread
   with marvellous rapidity.

   It was the monks who converted the heathen. The austerity and stern
   duties which marked their manner of life seemed to be possessed of
   attractions for the rude Anglo-Saxon; and when the thanes and nobles
   with their crowds of retainers were drawn in, and then finally Kings
   and Queens lavished their treasure upon the Monastic Houses, the
   country became literally overspread by them. All the most beautiful
   spots in the land were assigned for their settlement, and in "every
   rich valley, and by the side of every clear stream, arose a Benedictine
   Abbey." England became "a nation of monks."

   The Benedictine Rule of Life.

   A consideration of the Benedictine Rule of Life will enable us to
   realise what an impulse the worship of God received from the extension
   of the Monastic system. The day was divided between "opus Dei, labor et
   lectio:" or the service of GOD and manual and intellectual work. For
   the regulation of the first, the day was divided mto what were called
   "Canonical Hours" The Hours.There is some variety, but the ordinary
   arrangement gave seven in addition to the midnight Service viz.,
   Matins, or Lauds, at day-break; Prime, at six A.M.; Tierce, at nine
   A.M.; Sext, at noon, Nones, at three P.M.; Vespers, before sunset; and
   Compline, at bed-time.

   In the "Excerpta" of Ecgbright, [7] we read, "These seven synaxes or
   assemblings we ought daily to offer to GOD with great concern for
   ourselves and for all Christian people." Divers conjectures have been
   made as to the grounds upon which they have severally been observed.

   The night-services probably originated in times of persecution. Prime
   and Vespers, at sunrise and sunset, would naturally suggest themselves
   in connection with the Sun of Righteousness. The observance of the
   three "Lesser Hours," which received their names from the third, sixth,
   and ninth hours with which three of the four divisions of the day
   terminated, was probably regarded as a continuance of the Jewish
   custom. Compline, from Completorium, was the gathering up of the day's
   devotions, the Service in which the worshipper fully commended himself
   to God's care for the coming night. These services combined Were called
   "Divinum Officium."

   The Reforms of Pope Grepory VII.

   The next epoch opens with the Reforms of Gregory VII. and Bishop Osmund
   of Sarum.

   The former, who occupied the Papal Chair from 1073 to 1086 A.D.,
   re-arranged and abbreviated the Divine Services which had been used at
   "the Hours," and brought them out under the title of, "The Breviary,"
   which was generally imposed to the exclusion of the existing Forms. It
   consisted of four parts, for Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn
   respectively, and each part had four or five subdivisions, viz. :--1.
   Kalendarium; 2. Psalterium; 3. Commune Sanctorum; 4. Proprium de
   Tempore; 5. Proprium Sanctorum. Sometimes the second and third of these
   were combined, as containing those parts which did not vary with days
   or seasons. In England the favourite title for the Book was
   Portiforium, which in its English form had many equivalents,--portfory,
   portuisse, and poituary.

   The Reforms of Bishop Osmund.

   The other reformer of Service-books was Osmund. After the Conquest the
   Anglo-Saxon clergy were in some cases forcibly ousted, in many
   succeeded at their deaths by men of Norman blood.

   Among these was a Count of some distinction as a statesman, who was
   consecrated to the See of Salisbury [8] on the death of Herman, 1087
   A.D.

   He at once set himself to put an end to the great diversities of Rites
   and Ceremonies, which prevailed in different parts of the country, and
   even in different parts of the same Diocese. He revised the
   Service-books, and set forth a reformed Breviary, Missal, and Manual
   for adoption in all the Churches and chapels over which he had
   jurisdiction.

   These, which constituted what was known as "the Sarum Use," became
   generally popular, and were introduced into many parts of England, and
   held their ground down to the Reformation.

   Religion confined in the main to the Monasteries.

   So far we have looked at the worship of GOD mainly as it was offered in
   the Monasteries, but it would have been almost useless to look
   elsewhere, for nearly all the religion of the country was gathered
   within their walls. The people who derived so much benefit from them
   would naturally be drawn into sympathy with their religious life. The
   Benedictine monks were the chief missionaries, for as they spread over
   the land they associated the work of evangelisation with the labours of
   agriculture, and while they were turning uncultivated wastes into
   productive and luxuriant farms, and bringing plenty to the homes of the
   people, they superseded ignorance and blind Paganism by the blessed
   knowledge of the Gospel of Christ.

   Results of the rivalry between the secular and regular Clergy.

   But in lapse of time their popularity waned, and a rivalry grew up
   between the secular clergy and the monks. And inasmuch as the former
   wore in the main idle and incompetent, religion flagged, and in the
   Church, outside the Religious Houses, the worship of GOD was suffered
   to fall into neglect.

   There was a brief resuscitation in the thirteenth century, when the
   country clergy were roused from their apathy by the enthusiasm with
   which the preaching Friars carried on their mission.

   But the good influence was only short-lived: the mercenary spirit of
   the Roman religion, so rife at that era, was infused into the new
   Orders, and the preaching of indulgences supplanted the preaching of
   the Gospel.

   In the Monasteries, as soon as they openly repudiated the authority of
   the English Bishops, the door was opened for the admission of endless
   innovations, and the Service-books became more and more tainted with
   Roman errors.

   The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were so notoriously evil that
   for them as well as for the ninth and tenth the dark ages has been
   regarded as the most fitting designation. This period has been
   described in these striking terms, "the epoch was an eclipse--a very
   Egyptian darkness; worse than chaos or Erebus--black as the thick
   præternatural night, under cover of which our Lord was crucified." [9]

   State of Public Worship in the Cathedrals in the 14th and 15th
   centuries.

   And though all this refers to the general condition of the Church, the
   decay of Public Worship was one of the most marked of its features. If
   we may judge from what we read of the Mother Churches, then we may well
   doubt if it was ever nearer to total extinction. As a single
   illustration, in the great Metropolitan Cathedral, at the close of the
   fourteenth century, where there was every facility from rich endowment
   and benefactions to maintain the beauty of holy worship in her services
   and ritual, we are quite appalled at the revelations of history. Where
   the worship of the Altar and the Daily Services had been for many
   generations offered with becoming dignity and splendour, the sacred
   vessels and ornaments were pilfered or sold, and the building profaned
   "by foul and abominable acts." The House of GOD became a place of
   merchandise; and while the Services were suspended or driven into
   obscure corners, men and women, not on common days merely, but
   especially on the Festivals of the Church, exposed their wares, buying
   and selling with no thought whatever for the sanctity of the place.
   [10]

   Then if we leap over a gap of a hundred years we find scarcely any
   improvement, and we realize to the full the appropriateness of the
   title which those centuries have received. When Dean Colet in 1505 A.D.
   found himself the guardian of St. Paul's, with all his religion he made
   hardly a visible eeffort to purge the Church of the profane uses to
   which it had been abandoned. The degeneracy of the times was such that
   it may well be doubted whether he could have reinstated the worship of
   GOD; but a brighter era was about to dawn, and with it the shadows of
   the past were to flee away.

   In the following pages we have endeavoured to show how the interest of
   the Reformation centred round the re-establishment of a pure worship
   with the Service-books revised and the Ritual regulated with a due
   regard to the edification of the worshippers.

CHAPTER I.

THE ANGLICAN REFORM

   The Pre-Reformation Service-book.

   The chief Service-books [11] in use in the English Church at the time
   of the Reformation were these: The Breviary, containing a series of
   daily services for the Canonical Hours, which were eight in number.

   The Missal, or Order of Celebration of the Holy Communion.

   The Manual, for the Baptismal and other occasional offices, which might
   be performed by a priest.

   The Pontifical, for such as the Bishop alone administered.

   In all of these severally, while the outline and structure were the
   same, there was considerable variety in detail, and different editions,
   if we may so speak of them, had become generally accepted in different
   localities. The different "Uses." York, for example, Lincoln, Hereford,
   and Bangor, had each its own "Use," marked off by some peculiarity,
   while the remaining Dioceses united in the adoption of that entitled
   "the Sarum," which the Bishop of Salisbury [12] had compiled with so
   much care in the eleventh century.

   Three things in particular contributed to call for a revision of these
   Service-books about the middle of the sixteenth century.

   The Dissolution of the Monasteries [13] made a complete reconstruction
   of the Breviary an imperative necessity. Frequent worship an essential
   feature of the Monasitc life. In Religious Houses, where it was of the
   very essence of their constitution that the worship of GOD should enter
   largely into the routine of daily life, it was an easy matter to
   subordinate all other occupations to that which was held to be of
   primary importance, and seven [14] times during the twenty-four hours
   the Bell of the Monastery summoned its inmates to assemble in the
   Chapel for Divine Service.

   When Henry VIII realised that the Monastic Orders remained unshaken in
   their loyalty to the Papacy, and that the title of "Supreme Head of the
   Church," which he had assumed, could be little more than nominal, if
   such formidable opponents were left to foster seditious counsels,
   nothing remained for him but to dissolve their constitutions and
   appropriate their revenues to other purposes.

   With this abolition of the Religious Orders, the offering of frequent
   worship became wholly impracticable. It disappeared at their
   dissolution Up to the time of the Dissolution, the daily service had
   not attracted the bulk of the People. [15] A certain number, no doubt,
   wherever there was a Monastery in the neighbourhood, would be drawn to
   some extent into a participation of its worship, but generally the
   people must have felt themselves precluded by their occupations from
   taking any part therein. Now, however, that the Monasteries had been
   swept away, men realised that if the daily homage of the crearture was
   to continue to be paid, such changes were, called for as should make
   the payment compatible with their secular duties.

   How this was effected we shall see presently.

   A second demand for revision arose out of the revival of learning.

   The New Learning the Universities.

   The close of the fifteenth century witnessed the beginning of what was
   designated "the New Learning." The Universities claimed the honour of
   its birthplace. Erasmus, of whom it has been said that he was the first
   "man of letters" who had appeared in Europe since the fall of the Roman
   Empire, worked a complete revolution in the education of the country.
   The Greek language, long known but most imperfectly, and studied only
   in the books of authors wholly unworthy to represent its genius and its
   true value, seemed suddenly endowed with new attractions, and under the
   ægis of Erasmus regained its place in the two great seats of learning
   and education. He determined to break down the ignorant hostility to
   classical literature which reigned in the colleges and monasteries; but
   how difficult a task it was, and how long it took for scholars to shake
   off the fetters of a barbarous age, a study of Erasmus himself will
   abundantly testify. With all his appreciation of the beauties of
   Cicero, notwithstanding the spontaneity and naturalness of his Latin,
   which give it all the charms of a living and spoken tongue, he is still
   far removed from the purity and grace of the classical models.

   The importance of the study of Scripture recongnised

   But that for which we are most deeply indebted to him is the impulse
   which he gave to the study of the New Testament in the original
   language. [16] The "ever memorable" Dean Colet, [17] foremost among his
   friends, substituted lectures on Scripture at Oxford for the customary
   disquisition, on Scotus and Aquinas; while at the sister university
   George Stafford discarded the glosses of the Schoolmen altogether, and
   taught his classes to study the text; and not a few of the Reformers
   [18] sat at his feet.

   One of the most immediate results of this reaction, which rapidly
   affected the community at large, was to make them dissatisfied with the
   part they had hitherto been contented to take in public worship.
   Longings for a more rational kind of worship. Men awoke to the
   realisation of the privileges which attached to "the priesthood of the
   laity," [19] and they determined to claim a portion in that intelligent
   aud rational service, which the Clerics had monopolised all too long.

   The first step towards the attainment of this was the introduction of
   the vernacular in place of a dead unspoken tongue in the Public
   Forms--the supersession of Latin by the language of the country.

   The third, and by many considered to be the chief call for revision,
   came from the pressing necessity for purifying the Service-books from
   error, and clearing away the accretions of superstitious usage which
   had accumulated upon them in mediæval times.

   Such then being the chief causes which contributed to make a revision
   necessary, it remains for us to examine the authority by which it was
   undertaken and carried out, with a view to estimating how far the work
   is entitled to the confidence of the Church.

   The authority upon which revison was undertaken

   There are few greater mistakes than to accept as correct the loose
   statement so frequently made, that the Committee of Revision were
   appointed by the Crown. Long before it ever entered into tho head of
   Henry VIII. to touch our services, a reformed edition [20] of the Sarum
   Breviary had been issued: and it is worth while observing that it
   followed the very lines which the Commissioners laid down for
   themselves in Edward VI.'s reign. [21] This again was succeeded a few
   years later by a somewhat similar revision of the Sarum Missal. Now
   both of these were undertaken before the King had assumed the title of
   "Supreme Head of the Church," [22] and when as yet he took no such
   interest in ecclesiastical matters as to justify us in believing that
   the work was in any way dictated by his advice or direction. The King's
   reluctance to move Indeed we find him at this time most unwilling to
   meddle with Church Reform of any kind: as unwilling as Convocation was
   the reverse. He rejected a petition presented to him by the Convocation
   of Canterbury for an authorised version of the Bible in English for
   general circulation.

   It is true that a few years later he was induced to reconsider his
   decision, but we point to his hesitation in the matter as an indication
   of his indifference to reform, and as affording a strong presumption
   that whatever was done was sanctioned by Convocation, the idea of
   independent action being quite untenable.

   But when at length the King was persuaded to interest himself in
   Liturgical improvement, his first step was to commission the Archbishop
   to acquaint the Houses of Convocation that it was his pleasure that the
   Service-books should be revised: "that all mass-books, antiphoners,
   portuisses, in the Church of England should be newly examined,
   corrected, and reformed;" and Convocation ordered that the The first
   Committee of revison appointed.work be intrusted to the Bishops of
   Sarum and Ely, [23] with three assessors [24] each from the Lower
   House. Matters had been made somewhat easier by an enactment of the
   previous year that one uniform service should be adopted throughout the
   Province of Canterbury. [25] But there was one fatal obstacle to any
   real reform. Impediments to all real reform. So long as the
   Statute-book [26] imposed death by burning as the penalty for denying
   the doctrine of Transubstantiation, and hanging as a common felon for
   disapproval of Communion in one kind, or of the perpetual obligation of
   vows of chastity, or of the necessity of auricular confession, we can
   easily understand that the Revisionists felt themselves clogged and
   hampered at every step. The memory of the terrible scenes enacted in
   the torture-room where Ann Askew so heroically endured the rack, or of
   the fires of Smithfield, in which, in company with others, she suffered
   martyrdom for her belief, must have hung like a sword of Damocles over
   their Council Chamber. Indeed, Capon's predecessor in the See of Sarum,
   Nicholas Shaxton, had been condemned to the stake on the self-same
   charge, but had purchased his life by recantation; and the recollection
   of this must have haunted him like a spectre till the Statute was
   repealed. The first object aimed at was the acceptance of the principle
   that it was lawful for the laity to communicate in both kinds.
   Convocation accepted this principle on the 30th of November 1547,
   during the progress of a bill to authorise it through the House of
   Lords, and before it was introduced into the Commons. [27] The Act
   ordained simply that the primitive custom of administering in both
   kinds should be observed, but no set form of words was prescribed.
   Parliament was prorogued on December 24th, and did not reassemble till
   the close of the next year. Convocation was also prorogued; but in the
   spring "The Order of Communion" was drawn up, and issued by the King,
   for administering in both kinds, and it was wholly in English. [28] The
   Proclamation [29] speaks of the advice received from the Protector, and
   other of the Privy Council, and orilered that the Blessed Sacrament
   should be ministered unto our people only after such form and manner.
   [30]

   After this the Committee was enlarged and proceeded with the revision
   of the Prayer-book.

   Conventional pictures of this assembly of divines, which most probably
   held some of its sessions in the Council-room at Windsor, [31] have
   placed Archbishop Cranmer in the chair. He is supported on either side
   by three bishops: while the six members chosen from the Lower House of
   Convocation occupy a cross-bench facing the Primate.

   The Members fo the Committee of revision who assembled at Windsor
   Castle.

   The Bishops were Goodrich of Ely, Holbeach of Lincoln, Skip of
   Hereford, Day of Chichester, Thirlby of Westminster, Ridley of
   Rochester. The remaining six members were : Cox, May, Taylor, Haines,
   Robertson, and Redmayn: the same no doubt who had sat as assessors to
   Capon and Goodrich in the Committee of 1542 A.D. [32] Which of the
   bishops was placed on the right, which on the left of the Primate's
   chair; which again of these places was the post of special honour, we
   need not stay to dispute, as Rome has so vehemently disputed in
   reference to another and still more momentous assembly [33] in her
   eagerness to claim the foremost place for her representative. In all
   probability Goodrich, as the most eminent Bishop of the old Committee,
   and the senior Bishop, occupied the two highest seats, while Ridley as
   junior, and Thirlby as Bishop of the latest constituted see, that of
   Westminster, occupied the two lowest.

   Now let me call your attention to the great care which appears to have
   been taken to make it a truly representative Committee. We shall see
   how successfully the selection was made, for no interest with any claim
   to have a voice in the revision was neglected.

   The representative character fo the Committee.

   Convocation claimed the whole number as members of one or other of its
   two Houses.

   The Crown had its advocate in Cranmer, than whom none could be more
   attached to the king personally or more tenacious of his rights and
   prerogative.

   The Universities appeared in the Heads of their chief Colleges, Cox
   being Dean of Christ Church, and Redmayn, Master of Trinity.

   Two of the different "Uses" were represented directly: Lincoln by
   Holbeach and Taylor; Hereford by Skip: two, York and Bangor,
   indirectly, as we shall see, while the Archbishop and the other Bishops
   watched the interests of the Sarum "Use" which was adopted in all their
   dioceses.

   It is proposed now to draw the portraits of the chief of these
   Commissioners in as few lines as is practicable, but in such a manner
   that the reader may be able to conjecture their part in the work,
   possibly also to imagine on which side their votes would be given on
   the debated questions, which they were called upon to decide.

   The Primate's character and opinions.

   Of Cranmer many pictures have been given to the world, but probably in
   the case of no other person have the representations varied so
   materially from each other. This variation is due not so much to the
   bias of the painter, as to the fact that his character did change in
   many of its features at different periods of his history.

   As he is seen seated in the chair at Windsor, he bears distinctly many
   of the qualifications which fit him pre-eminently for the post. He had
   in a marked degree the first requisite for an efficient chairman, viz.,
   a perfect control over his temper. He was by no means a man of great
   genius, or an original thinker, likely to strike out something fresh,
   but he possessed a good judgment, which would enable him to
   discriminate between what was new and what was old; what was purely
   Roman, and what was Catholic. He had a profound reverence for the Holy
   Scriptures upon which he based his doctrinal views, not however
   according to his private judgment, but as the great Fathers of the
   Catholic Church had interpreted them in primitive times. [34] Again and
   again, his loyalty to Catholic antiquity manifested itself.

   His views on the Holy Eucharist were already, it is true, declining
   from the Catholic standard, but still very different from those which
   he maintained eventually. He was orthodox in holding the commemorative
   [35] rather than the propitiatory sacrifice: the representation or
   pleading of that which was once offered upon the Cross, rather than the
   repetition of it, which some few so persistently maintained.

   This was an important point which Cranmer was determined not to yield,
   and it was probably this determination which induced him to decline the
   offer of Calvin, who was opposed to any sacrificial view of the Holy
   Eucharist, to aid in the revision. Unless moreover he had felt very
   strong in his position he would hardly have acted as he did, for Calvin
   was at this time in the very zenith of his reputation, and many would
   have welcomed his assistance as the best guarantee for real reform.

   Next in point of interest to the Primate is unquestionably Goodrich,
   Bishop of Ely.

   Bishop Goodrich.

   Now there are many circumstances in Goodrich's life which we are
   concerned in hearing of. When a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, he
   like his more famous companion on the same Foundation [36] rose into
   Royal favour by his judgment on the crucial question of the Divorce of
   Queen Catherine. He had. been selected by the University from his legal
   knowledge to be on the Committee for drawing up an answer to the King's
   application respecting the legality of the separation. There is no
   difficulty in discovering which view he took, for he was made a royal
   chaplain shortly after, and within a few years nominated to one of the
   most enviable posts, the then-wealthy and dignified Bishopric of Ely.
   [37]

   The Author of the first part of the Catechism

   It is more than probable that the part Church Catechism [38] was his
   composition, and when in the year 1552 A.D. he built the Long Gallery
   attached to the Palace, side by side with the armorial bearings of the
   See and his own initials, he engraved on two tablets that which he
   desired to be associated with his name before anything else, "our Duty
   to GOD," and "our Duty to our neighbour."

   His eagerness for reform led him to inaugurate his episcopate by a
   series of Injunctions, having for their object the overthrow of Papal
   influence, and the erasure from the Service-books of the name of the
   Pope, and the demolition of shrines which were frequented by idolatrous
   worshippers. But that he was in no sense a fanatic or disposed to
   condemn any usage or thing simply because it had been abused, his
   monument in Ely Cathedral, upon which he is represented with the full
   pontifical habit, bears evidence. He is further said to have endeared
   himself to the King by his singular wisdom, and to have won the
   affections of the people by his integrity and moderation.

   Bishop Thirlby: his Roman tendencies.

   Next after Goodrich comes Thirlby, whose appointment on the Commission
   is the best proof of the impartiality with which the selection was
   made. Although admitted to the privy councils of Henry VIII. and Edward
   VI. he never sympathised with their in their desire to shake off their
   allegiance to the Papal See, but continued throughout a staunch Roman;
   and at Queen Mary's accession he was singled out as the fittest
   ambassador she could send to tender to time Pope her assurances of
   loyal obedience. He was chosen too in the same reign, for a task from
   which, under other circumstances, he would have shrunk back, the
   degradation of Cranmer before he was sent to the stake. And if further
   and yet more decisive proof of his opinions is needed, it may be found
   in his refusal to accept the reforms of Queen Elizabeth and his
   consequent consignment to prison in the Tower.

   One honour he enjoyed which has been shared by no one else. He was the
   first and last Bishop of Westminster, having exercised the episcopate
   therein from the creation of the See till its dissolution. [39]

   As Bishop of Ely, he was a great benefactor, especially to the
   Foundation of Jesus College, Cambridge, which owes to him much of its
   ecclesiastical patronage, and also to his cathedral, which received
   from him the endowment of its eight prebendal stalls.

   Bishop Day of Chichester, a firm and resolute adherent of mediæval use.

   Of Day less is known, but enough to make it certain that his hand would
   be held up and his voice raised against all changes involving any real
   departure from mediæval usage. He was more courageous in holding his
   opinions than his brother of Westminster, as we shall see when we come
   to the close of the sittings. [40] When the King issued letters for the
   conversion of altars into tables, he refused to enforce the order in
   his diocese, and when threatened with deprivation, he pleaded
   vigorously for the rights of conscience; but finding his efforts to be
   unsuccessful, he expressed his final decision in terms which command
   our respect: "he accounted it a less evil to suffer the body to perish
   than to destroy the soul," and "he would rather lose all that he ever
   had in the world than condemn his conscience." He was committed to the
   Fleet Prison, [41] and his bishopric sequestrated.

   Bishops Ridley of London, and Holbeach of Lincoln.

   The character of Ridley is too well known to need description, while of
   Holbeach, who assumed that name on becoming a monk of Croyland in place
   of his patronymic Rands, so little is left on record that it would be
   difficult to form an accurate estimate of the influence which he
   exercised upon the proceedings of the Commission.

   Of the members of the Lower House, the most distinguished on the whole
   was Cox. He stands out in many ways as the very counterpart of Thirlby,
   and no one who reads their history can fail to be struck with the
   fairness of a Commission which admitted men of such opposing views.

   Cox : his shameless rapacity.

   When a Fellow at Oxford, Cox becmne enamoured of Lutheran Theology, and
   amid all die, changes of those ever-varying times, he remained a
   consistent Protestant to the end.

   After he came into the notice of Edward VI., honours were thickly
   heaped upon him, and it fills one with wonder at the small sense of
   responsibility which such a man must have had, to bear of his being
   simultaneously Rector of Harrow, Archdeason of Ely, Canon of Ely, Canon
   of Windsor, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and Dean of Westminster, and
   Bishop nominate of Southwell ; not to mention the offices of Tutor and
   Almoner to the king, and the Chancellorship of his University.

   His biographer writes quite incidentally, that it has been thought by
   some that "he had more rebard to his private advantage than to the true
   interests of the Church," and without any notice of these frightful
   pluralities, proceeds to vindicate him from the imputation touching the
   alienation of the episcopal estates. History has certainly recorded one
   instance of his determination to maintain the property of the See of
   Ely, though unsuccessfully.His resistance to the Queen's unreasonable
   demands. Sir Christopher Hatton, one of the Queen's favourites, cast an
   envious eye upon the beautiful Palace and garden in Holborn ; and to
   gratify his desire she commanded the Bishop to transfer a portion of it
   to him without delay. Whatever his feelings may have been on other
   occasions, he had strength enough to resist this iniquitous claim, but
   only to call forth the ever memorable rejoinder from the imperious
   Queen, "Proud Prelate, you know well what you were afore I made you
   what you are. If you do not immediately comply with my request I will
   unfrock you, by GOD." And the property was alienated, as the name
   "Hatton Garden" still indicates.

   Considering their value, we can hardly be surprised that his benefices
   were speedily seized and that he himself was lodged in the Tower when
   the Protestant King was no longer able to befriend him.

   Proofs of his Protestant opinions.

   Two circumstances may be here mentioned as testifying to his doctrinal
   opinions. At Oxford he issued a Commission for the discovery of books
   which encouraged Papal pretensions or Roman doctrine, and in the spirit
   of a true iconoclast ordered whole Libraries to be destroyed, without
   any respect to their historical value or antiquarian interest.

   Again, when his brother Revisionist, Day of Chichester, had stirred up
   the people of Sussex to resist the removal of their altars, he was
   selected by the King's Council as the fittest person they could find,
   counteract his influence by a preaching campaign in support of the
   Protestant Faith.

   Dean May: his eagerness for reform.

   In May, the Dean of St. Paul's, Cox found an entirely kindred spirit,
   as the following episode in his life will sufficiently indicate. On the
   publication of an edict by the Privy Council for the destruction of all
   images in churches, the work of demolition was not only sanctioned, but
   even encouraged by the appointed guardian of that Cathedral. The Rood,
   and the attendant figures of St. Mary and St. John, were roughly thrown
   down, and the wealth of sacred treasure in plate and jewels and
   vestments which had accumulated out of the offerings of the faithful to
   an almost incalculable extent was despoiled without even a show of
   resistance on the part of the Dean ; and there is good reason to
   believe that it was done, at his own instigation.

   If this be true we cannot but admire him for his consistency, for much
   that lie encouraged entailed grievous loss upon, if it did not actually
   impoverish, both himself and the Chapter which he represented.

   He was what we may call an advanced Reformer, and a strong, advocate of
   Liturgical revision.

   Taylor.

   Of Taylor's views we are not altogether ignorant; on one important
   question, which all the Revisionists were called upon to answer in
   writing, viz., "what is the oblation and sacrifice of Christ in the
   mass?" it is recorded that he, in company with Cox, took the lowest
   ground, asserting it to "mean nothing more than prayer, thanksgiving ,
   and the remembrance of our Saviour's Passion."

   This was a strange reaction from the opinions which he had put forward
   in the previous reign, when he preached a sermon upon
   Transubstantiation, which led to the martyrdom of Barnes.

   It is worthy of notice also that he was selected for promotion by King
   Edward VI. just at the time when his Majesty was most especially under
   ultra-Protestant influence. [42]

   Of Haynes there is little to be said, save that like Haynesthe members
   of the Lower House already described he had a strong leaning towards
   radical change.

   The two that remain were men of a very different type. Both Robertson
   and Redmayn were more Catholic-minded.

   Robertson and Redmayn.

   Both too were widely renowned for their great learning, the former
   having earned a reputation as a grammarian unsurpassed in his
   generation, and the latter holding one of the highest positions in the
   University of Cambridge.

   The fact that Robertson obtained preferment [43] from Queen Mary, and
   that Redmayn tried to draw back from the sanction, which he had
   reluctantly given by his signature to the Reformed Service-book, are
   adequate proof of the line which they must have taken in the
   deliberations at Windsor.

   Such, briefly drawn, are some of the characteristic features of the
   individual members of that famous Committee to whom the Catholic Church
   of England owes so much.

   But we must not fail to mention that even these men, so learned, so
   well qualified in many ways, and so thoroughly impartial as a body,
   were not held to be competent by their own unaided counsels to
   accomplish the work of Revision.

   The enlargement of the Committee to increase the public confidence.

   It was considered desirable to enlarge the Committee, so as to make it
   if possible still more representative, and to give all parts of the
   country and every one who had any interest at stake a voice in the
   proceedings. A large body of assessors [44] were added. They were not
   admitted to the Council Chamber, as their numbers would have made them
   unwieldy as a working Committee, but a series of questions bearing upon
   the most crucial matters under dispute were submitted to them, and
   their replies were duly weighed, and doubtless had no little influence
   upon the deliberations. Among these, whose opinions were thus invited,
   were the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Sarum, representing
   directly the "Uses" of their Sees, while the Bishop of St. Asaph was
   appointed for the guardianship of the Bangor worship.

   The first and most important change was in the language.

   In the Preface to the First Prayer-book we read, The changes introduced
   Adoption of the English language. "The service in the Church of England
   (these many years) hath been read in Latin to the people, which they
   understood not; so that they have heard with their ears only: and their
   hearts, spirit, and mind have not been edified thereby."

   So long as Rome was the centre of European society, and Latin was
   generally spoken, there was no inconsistency in maintaining it as the
   vehicle of Western worship, but long after Rome had lost this
   pre-eminence, and her language had ceased to be intelligible to the
   common mind, "the once living outpourings of devotion" were suffered to
   continue only "fossilised into cold and lifeless forms."

   The arguments in defence of the continuance Roman arguments for a dead
   language. which the mediæval Church set up were very plausible. It was
   urged that "the majesty of religion would suffer and grow cheap if the
   most solemn and mysterious parts of the service should be understood by
   the audience;" or that there were obvious advantages for the protection
   of the Faith in embalming her Forms in a language which is beyond the
   reach of change; or once more, that it served as an abiding witness to
   the unity of the Church throughout Catholic Christendom, that every
   branch of it should offer up their prayers and praises in one and the
   same tongue.

   These reasons were plausible enough, but the majority of the
   Revisionists saw that there were reasons for change which far
   outweighed them. The edification of the worshipper ought always to be
   amatter of primary importance. Not scriptural nor primitive.St. Paul
   [45] had clearly so regarded it, when he declared that he would "rather
   speak five words in the Church" in such a manner as to teach others,
   "than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue." And the principle was
   upheld by the Primitive Church, which clothed its Liturgies in Greek,
   or Latin, or Syriac, or Coptic, according to the language of the people
   who used them. It wasenforced, moreover, by the sayings of the Fathers;
   [46] and the Law, both civil and canonical, contained the plainest
   injunctions for its maintenance. The Code of Justinian [47] provided
   "that all priests should celebrate the sacred oblation" in such a
   manner that "thereby the minds of the hearers might be raised up with
   greater devotion to set forth the praises of GOD, according to the
   Apostle's teaching; " and that this was interpreted as enjoining a
   language "understanded of the people" is shown by the attempts of those
   who violated the practice to erase the enactment from the Statute-book.

   Again the Canon Law [48] by the authority of Pope Innocent and the
   Lateran Council, 1215 A.D., enforced "the celebration of Divine Service
   according to the diversity of ceremonies and languages."

   When then the Windsor Assembly were called upon to deal with this
   question, they knew that they should be fully supported if they
   abandoned the Latin tongue.

   What strengthened the public yearning for the vernacular in worship.

   We stated before some of the causes which created a yearning on the
   part of the people for a more intelligent worship; and it was quite
   obvious that the use of the English Litany, [49] put forth a row years
   before, and the reading of portions of the Communion office in their
   own language, had greatly intensified their desire, and the
   Revisionists felt that they could best satisfy the wants of the nation
   by giving then a complete English Prayer-book.

   And while commending them for giving us a Service-book in our own
   language, we are constrained to go further, and express an additional
   obligation to them for having clothed it in English, the beauty of
   which has rarely been equalled, and never surpassed, even in the best
   age of literary excellence. [50] To whatever part of it we turn,
   whether hymns, or prayers, or exhortations, the style is such that it
   cannot be improved. "The essential qualities of devotion and
   eloquence," as Macaulay says, [51] "conciseness, majestic simplicity,
   pathetic earnestness of supplication, sobered by a profound reverence,
   are common between the translations and the originals. But in the
   subordinate graces of diction the originals must be allowed to be far
   inferior to the translations. . . . The diction of our Book of Common
   Prayer has directly or indirectly contributed to form the diction of
   almost every great English writer, and has extorted the admiration of
   the most accomplished infidels, and of the most accomplished
   Nonconformists, of such men as David Hume and Robert Hall."

   As an illustration of this high praise, we have only to mention the
   very noblest of our Liturgical hymns, the Te Deum. In point of accuracy
   and exactness of rendering there [52] is in parts no doubt something to
   be desired, but in rhythm, in vigour of arrangement, and in its solemn
   grandeur, it is incomparably superior to the original Latin.

   From the Collects.

   And if we turn to the Collects, the same expression of unfeigned praise
   is equally due. Take one or two specimens--first, of a simple
   translation; and that we may not appear to be making a careful
   selection to support our opinion, we will quote the most familiar
   perhaps of all.

   "Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with Thy most gracious favour,
   and further us with Thy continual help; that in all our works begun,
   continued, and ended in Thee, we may glorify Thy holy Name: and
   finally, by Thy mercy obtain everlasting life," etc.

   Now this, as it happens, is one of the most beautiful of the ancient
   Latin, Collects:--Actiones nostras, quæsumus, Domine, et aspirando
   praeveni et adjuvando prosequere; ut cuncta nostra operatio et a te
   incipiat et per te coepta finiatur, per Jesum, etc.

   But beautiful as it is, we are sure that no competent critic would
   venture to say that it has lost one particle of its peculiar grace by
   being clothed in an English dress.

   Then take a sample of the original compositions. These were chiefly
   introduced to supersede the corrupt forms in use for the Festivals of
   Saints and Martyrs. [53] Again, avoiding selection, let us quote the
   Collect for All Saints' Day, which is oftenest on our lips.

   "O Almighty GOD, who hast knit together Thine elect in one communion
   and fellowship in the mystical body of Thy Son Christ our LORD: grant
   us grace so to follow Thy blessed saints in all virtuous and godly
   living that we may come to those unspeakable joys, which Thou hast
   prepared for them that unfeignedly love Thee, through," etc.

   But it is invidious to single out any special portion for commendation;
   "the whole book," it has been well said, "is a very casket of
   treasures."

   A larger us of Scripture in public worship.

   The second alteration in order of utility was the increased value set
   upon the public reading of Holy Scripture. During mediæval times the
   consecutive reading of this had been greatly interrupted by "the
   planting in uncertain stories and legends with a multitude of
   Responds." [54] Those last came to be regarded of such consequence that
   they were made long and elaborate, while the passages from Scripture
   were proportionably curtailed: in short, the Lessons and the Responds
   exchanged places.

   The result of this was that the primary conception of the latter, which
   was to be simply illustrative, was entirely obscured, and the Respond
   became an independent anthem, confusing instead of unfolding the
   meaning of what was read.

   Furthermore, the Legendary stories and acts of the Saints, especially
   at their commemorations, which were exceedingly numerous, wore
   generally chosen as the Lessons for the day in preference to the Life
   of our LORD, and the sayings of His immediate followers.

   The merit of initiating a reform in this is claimed by a Cardinal of
   the Roman Church, [55] who reinstated the Word of GOD in its rightful
   place, and showed how much store he set by the change, by inscribing on
   the title of his Revised Breviary the motto, "Search the Scriptures."

   This Breviary was put into, the hands of the Revisionists as likely to
   prove a valuable aid in their work, and there is every reason to
   believe that not only in this but upon other important points it
   carried considerable weight.

   In largely expanding the passages of Scripture, and in drawing both
   from the Old and New Testaments, the Revisionists illustrated their
   determination to recover primitive usage wherever it seemed expedient.
   In the description of the early services found in the Apostolical
   Constitutions [56] it would seem that as many as four Lessons of
   considerable length were read, two from either Testament; and in the
   middle of the second century Justin Martyr [57] says, "that the memoirs
   of the Apostles or the writings of the Prophets are read as long as
   time permits." This latter, however, is only noted of Sunday. To adapt
   the principle to the week-days was a most judicious step, and finds
   ample justification in its propriety.

   The Calendar and its perplexities.

   The third change was in the Calendar or Pie. The directions for the
   variable parts of the services in the old uses were complicated in the
   extreme. Perhaps the best idea of the minuteness of detail may be
   gathered from the fact that there is extant in the library of York
   Minster a volume, the entire contents of which are regulations of the
   Pie! [58]

   Indeed so involved were the rules to be observed that the title by
   which the body of directions was designated has become a very symbol of
   perplexity and confusion. Nothing could have been happier

   than the language in which Cranmer expressed the feelings of the
   Revisionists on the subject. "The number," he says, "and hardness of
   the rules called the Pie, and the manifold changings of the service,
   was the cause, that to turn the book only was so hard and intricate a
   matter that many times there was more business to find out what should
   be read than to read it when it was found out."

   All these difficulties were cleared away and a simp1e Calendar was
   substituted containing the order of Lessons, and preceded by a Table of
   Psalms, arranged for Matins and Evensong for a month.

   The consolidation of services.

   A fourth change rendered necessary by the abolition of the Religious
   Houses was the union of the three Service-books, Breviary, Manual, and
   Missal, in one volume, and the curtailment of the number of separate
   services.

   The claims of the people to the privilege of worship recognised.

   The Revisionists determined to recover, for the mass of the people, a
   participation in public worship, which they had well-nigh lost through
   the establishment of the Monastic or Canonical "Hours." The
   multiplication of services had led them to regard worship as an
   impossibility for men engaged in the ordinary occupations of secular
   life; and instead of selecting opportunities from the greater number,
   they came to look upon it as a luxury for the occupants of Religious
   houses, and left it almost entirely to them. Recognising the fact that
   these were properly the exceptions only, and that what might have been
   appropriate enough for the few was ill-adapted to the majority, the
   Committee resolved at once upon a reduction of the services. They went
   back to the early ages for guidance as to their number, but they must
   have been perplexed by the evidence. Some writers [59] spoke of three,
   others of two only. The Revisionists very wisely decided to adopt the
   latter, and thus restore the principle which had existed all through
   the history of the elder dispensation, and offer the voice of praise
   and thanksgiving like the Incense of the Altar and the daily Sacrifice
   in the morning and at even.

   The Seven "Hours," for all of which there were special offices in the
   Breviary, were condensed into Matins and Evensong--the ancient
   Nocturns, Lauds and Prime becoming amalgamated in the former, Vespers
   and Compline in the latter. The remaining three, Tierce, Sext, and
   None, or the Lesser Hours, were set aside altogether, because they had
   long fallen into disuse except in the monasteries; and as these were
   now dissolved, it would have served no purpose to have retained what
   specially belonged to them. To suit the fresh adaptation, the Psalms,
   which had hitherto been divided into seven portions [60] for a weekly
   course, were so arranged as to be read through once in a month.

   The ancient lines followed in the changed services.

   Now it is worth while observing how, in carrying out this consolidation
   of services, they carefully adhered to the ancient lines, and preserved
   in all their integrity the distinctive features of public worship.

   The ideal Form of service has three component parts, though by no means
   in equal proportions. These are praise, instruction, and prayer. The
   primary conception gave by far the highest place to the first of these;
   indeed the other two are entirely subordinate.

   There is a beautiful legend told of St. Theresa which illustrates this
   view in a very striking manner. As she lay asleep, the vision of a
   strange and awful woman passed before her.The primary object of
   worship. In one hand she carried a pitcher of water, in the other a pan
   of flaming fire. And when the Saint asked in fear and trembling whither
   she was going with her mysterious burden, she replied, "I go to burn up
   heaven and to quench hell, that henceforth men may learn to worship
   GOD, not for any hope of future reward in the one, nor for fear of
   threatened torment in the other, but for what He is--for Himself
   alone."

   Praise, then, the ascription of honour to GOD, simply and solely
   because it is due unto His Name, is the dominant element of public
   worship, and that which blends our offering with the songs of angelic
   hosts.

   But subordinate to this there have always [61] been other
   considerations present to the mind of the worshipper, and in a
   confessedly imperfect state it could hardly have been otherwise.
   Meditation upon GOD'S Word, and the record of His works in Creation and
   Providence, exalts our conception of His greatness, and creates a
   desire to know more of His Will; and thus the consciousness of our own
   weakness is borne in upon us, and we pray to the Author of all power
   and might to help our infirmities and supply our needs.

   Thus it is that psalms or hymns, lections, prayers or intercessions,
   have been linked together by a threefold cord in common worship.

   From a comparison of the following Tables it will be seen at a glance
   that the first Revised Service-book preserved the characteristic
   features of the ancient offices, and while the sequence of each part
   was generally retained, due prominence, as of old, was given to the
   element of praise. [62] The Revisionists seem to have had the triple
   division in their mind when they placed in the forefront of their
   service the LORD'S Prayer and the "Venite." Both alike strike the
   key-note of all that is to follow. The first three clauses of the
   Paternoster [63] correspond to the Psalms and Songs of praise; the
   petition "Give us this day our daily bread" has a special application
   to the reception of knowledge through the reading of Scripture; and the
   rest represent all prayer and intercession. So with the "Venite." [64]
   No fitter prelude to worship could be found, since it embraced a triple
   call, in verses 1-5, to sing GOD'S praises; in 6 and 7, to fall down
   before Him in adoration and prayer; in 8-11, to hear His Word.

   The absence of Confession and Absolution

   One element alone of importance is wanting in the Revised Order, viz.,
   Confession and Absolution. It is probable that they were omitted as
   being of late introduction into public services. There is doubt some
   testimony to the former in St. Basil, [65] who narrates how the
   congregation immediately on entering the house of prayer "confess to
   GOD," but the Council of Laodicea points to this confession as being
   made in silence. And in the Western Church there is an entire absence
   of allusion to the custom for many centuries. It finds no place in the
   "Benedictine Rule." [66] And what applies to Confession is of course
   equally applicable to Absolution. They stand or fall together. We shall
   see hereafter under what circumstances the judgment of Cranmer's
   Committee was revised.

   These were the changes upon which the Revisionists laid most stress, as
   we may gather from the Preface with which they introduced their
   reformed Service-book. In our present Prayer-book it is placed second,
   following that which was prefixed at the final revision.

   Many observances and ceremonies which they retained, wisely or
   unwisely, will be brought under our notice in future lectures.The
   general principles which guided the Revisionists.It may, however, be
   well at this stage to state their own account of the principle which
   guided them in their decisions: such ceremonies as were visibly
   superstitious and tended to darken the Gospel and prove cumbersome to
   religion they rejected, [67] while those were retained which guarded
   the worship of God from nakedness and contempt. But while we pass these
   by we feel that no review of a Prayer-book could be regarded as
   satisfactory, which failed to notice the relationship which it bore to
   the much disputed doctrines of the sacrificial aspect of, and the
   nature of the Presence of Christ in, the Holy Eucharist.

   Now it is quite obvious that the Revisionists provided more largely for
   the actual participation of the laity, and gave fuller recognition to
   the Communion aspect of the celebration, which had been obscured in
   mediæva1 times especially by the frequency of solitary masses in which
   the priest alone communicated. Their jealour preservation of ancient
   features. But while doing this they were extremely careful to avoid
   bringing the sacrificial view into discredit: in proof of which I would
   appeal to the general adoption of the term "altar," and to the great
   prominence assigned to the Prayer of Oblation, in which it was said
   that "we do celebrate and make before Thy Divine Majesty, with these
   Thy holy gifts, the memorial which Thy Son hath willed us to make." But
   they were determined at the same time to re-establish completely the
   principle of general communion, by the long obscuration of which the
   ordinance had been deprived of so much of its power and efficacy.

   Then, touching the doctrine of the Real Presence, there can be no doubt
   that the Revisionists retained "the ancient belief from which no
   Apostolic branch of the Church had ever swerved," viz., that the
   conscerated elements were in some way the Body and Blood of Christ.
   [68]

   The words of administration used by them in either kind were the first
   part only of the formulas now in use, "The Body of our LORD, Jesus
   Christ. which was given for thee,"--and the "Blood of our LORD Jesus
   Christ which was shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto
   everlasting life," and they necessitate this view. It is strengthened
   moreover by the manifested anxiety of the ultra-Protestant divines to
   get rid of them, which clearly indicates how they were interpreted.

   Their wisdom in avoiding definitions of doubtful matters.

   But while they "affirmed in unequivocal language, and as the basis of
   all Eucharistic truth, what the consecrated elements were," with a
   wisdom which cannot be over-estimated, they made no show even of
   explaining the manner of Christ's Presence, but left it, as it ever
   should be left, a mystery impenetrable to finite intelligence.

   Prevalent errors concerning the character of the Revision

   The character of the work effected by the first revision of the Old
   Service-books has not unfrequently been misrepresented. There is an
   idea too widely prevalent, that a complete revolution in Church-worship
   was carried out at this time, whereas nothing could have been further
   from the thoughts and intentions of those who undertook the revision,
   as any one may see who will investigate the principles by which, as we
   have desired to show, they were really actuated. Their aim was
   restoration, and in the process of attaining to it, they exercised the
   most careful discrimination between the old and the new, and, while
   cutting away without hesitation the later overgrowths, preserved with
   scrupulous care the ancient landmarks. And the impartial critic will
   not hesitate to acknowledge that the conservative and reverent spirit
   which animated them is abundantly evidenced in the result of their
   efforts.

   The completion of their work.

   But we pass on to the close. The arduous labours of the Committee came
   to an end, and the report of their deliberations was drawn up and laid
   upon the table to be attested by the sign-manual of the individual
   members: and it is not a little remarkable that notwithstanding their
   diversity of opinions, and the warm discussions which many of the
   questions had provoked, the result which they had attained was held to
   be so satisfactory, that there was but one dissentient: Day of
   Chichester alone [69] protesting that his conscience compelled him to
   withhold his assent to the document.

   The next stop, of course, was to give it legal force.

   Convocation met in November, but though we have no records of what
   actually took place, we have the authority of the King for stating that
   it was agreed to by "the whole clergy . . . of this our realm in their
   synods and provincial convocations." [70] Then after being presented to
   the Crown if was laid before the nobility and commons assembled in
   parliament, and on January 15, 1549 A.D., an Act of Uniformity was
   passed enjoining the use of the Revised Prayer-book after Whitsuntide,
   in every parish of the King's dominions "throughout England, Wales,
   Calais, and the marches of the same." [71] The postponement of the
   operation of the Act appears to have heen unnecessarily long, but this
   particular time was selected by the Revisers for the purpose of
   specially dedicating their work to GOD on the Feast of the Holy Ghost,
   by Whose controlling influence they believed their counsels to have
   been guided throughout, and brought to a successful issue at last. [72]

   And now that all the legal formalities had been gone through, let us
   see how the Book was received.

   Some of the London Churches set the example of compliance with the law,
   and superseded the old. Service-books even before the term of respite
   had expired. [73]

   Throughout the country, not a few of the clergy, who were averse to any
   alteration, accepted it because the changes were less violent than they
   had been led to anticipate; many of the laity also welcomed it gladly,
   not so much for any modification in doctrine, as from the fact that
   being written in English, it made their worship more interesting, and
   converted what in too many cases had been merely a dumb show into a
   living intelligent transaction. But there were many exceptions. Some of
   the priests expressed an obstinate determination to resist the
   operation of the Act, and were contented to suffer for conscience sake.
   Others openly conformed to the obligation, but secretly continued to
   celebrate as of old, and, as this created considerable trouble and
   confusion, the Lords of the Council took violent measures to remedy the
   evil. This, however, was trifling, compared to other difficulties which
   arose among the laity, and plunged certain disaffected parts of the
   country into the miseries of civil war.

   Outbreaks of fanatical opposition.

   In these counties the proclamation of the Act was followed by
   insurrection. The first outbreak was in Devonshire and Cornwall. In the
   latter of these, one thing, which had especially recommended the
   Revised Book elsewhere, had little if any force at all. The change from
   Latin to English was no gain to the Cornishmen, to whom one was as
   unintelligible as the other.

   The primary cause of the rebellion is to be found not in any
   spontaneous outburst of religious feeling, or general aversion to the
   Reformed service on the part of the people themselves, but to the
   fanaticism of a few individuals who urged them on.

   Body, [74] one of the Royal Commissioners appointed to destroy
   idolatrous shrines, was stabbed to the heart by a misguided priest,
   who, to justify murder, called upon the people to imitate his zeal, and
   save their Churches from desecration. Other priests went about the
   country preaching what the Mahometans call "a Jehad," and invested the
   movement with all the character of a religious war; and when open
   hostilities broke out, they carried the Host on to the field of battle.

   Misguided views of the insurgents.

   A secondary cause was an infatuated conviction that in some way the
   Revisionists were associated with the abolition of the Common Lands.
   Many of the nobility to whom Abbey estates had been granted attempted
   to turn them to the best account, and made no scruple of enclosing
   commons, without any respect to the rights of the poor to pasturage.

   At Sampford Courtenay in Devonshire, the priest incharge professed his
   intention of acceding to the change of Liturgy on the appointed day,
   but had secretly instigated the people to stop him by force, and claim
   the Latin Mass. From this village the flames of discontent spread [75]
   rapidly, and within a few weeks no less than ten thousand men, mostly
   mechanics and deluded peasants, took the field in defence of the old
   Forms. They marched to Exeter, and from the outskirts of the city sent
   their demands into the King's camp, couched in insolent language,
   insisting on the restitution of their Service-books, a recognition of
   Transubstantiation, and, strangely enough, the re-enactment of the
   Bloody Statute of the Six Articles. The Exonians determined on
   resistance, and the straits to which they were subjected, through a
   prolonged siege, have rarely been equalled in the annals of history. We
   may form some conception of the miseries they endured, when we read
   that one of the citizens proclaimed in the market-place, that sooner
   than surrender he would fight with one arm and feed upon the other! At
   last, when the Royal troops were sufficiently strong to advance against
   the rebels (and it was not till three merchant princes had come forward
   to reinforce the leader with large supplies of money, and a regiment of
   Italian archers [76] had been enlisted in the service), their fate was
   sealed. They suffered three successive defeats, and the rebellion was
   crushed.

   The revenge was severe. Arundel, Winslade, Berry, and Coffin, the
   ringleaders, were publicly executed at Tyburn: a multitude of others
   were unceremoniously hanged, among them the Mayor of Bodmin, and a
   number of priests; and in Exeter, Welsh, the Vicar of St. Thomas', was
   suspended from his own Church tower, where he hung in chains till "his
   Popish apparel" rotted away, and the carrion crows picked his bones.

   That was the most serious of the Rebellions.

   The rising in the Eastern Counties.

   We notice more briefly the rising in Norfolk, June 20, at Attleborough,
   for this, at least at the outset, was less than the other a protest
   against the Prayer-book. At first the enclosure of the commons was
   their cry of complaint, but as their numbers swelled new grievances
   were sought for, and we hear them expressing themselves in such terms
   as these: "The miseries of this world might be borne; but when the loss
   of our souls is the question, the ruin from that quarter must be
   prevented at the utmost hazard . . . the holy ceremonies of antiquity
   are abolished, and a new face and form of religion forced upon us."

   Again the Royal troops were unequal to the task of restoring order.
   Kett, [77] the rebel chief, established a mock court under the "Oak of
   Reformation," [78] and spread terror through the surrounding country.
   And here occurred an incident which nearly cost the great Reformer of
   Queen Elizabeth's reign his life. Parker, in despair at the failure of
   the sword, resolved to try the effect of peaceable measures. He made
   his way into the rebel camp, and, from a branch of the famous oak,
   endeavoured to recall the people to counsels of moderation. But they
   were in no mood to listen, and were about to tear him to pieces for his
   advice, when the Chaplain of the Rebel Forces, realising the imminence
   of the peril, called upon the people suddenly to sing the "Te Deum,"
   and in the excitement and enthusiasm which it kindled the future
   Primate made good his escape. [79]

   At length, vigorous measures were taken by the government, and the
   mutiny was quelled. [80] Kett, on Norwich Castle, his brother on the
   steeple of Wymondham Church, and nine other rebels on as many branches
   of the "consecrated Oak," paid the penalty of their crime.

   The unimpeded spread of the Revised Worship.

   And with their deaths resistance to the Reformed Liturgy ceased; and it
   was introduced throughout the length and breadth of the land to the
   increased edification of the people and the greater glory of Almighty
   GOD.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [11] BREVIARIUM: cf. Introductory Chapter. MISSALE was the title given
   probably in the eighth century, or a little later, to the volumes in
   which the following Office-books were united: LECTIONARIUS, for the
   lections from Scripture. Sometimes this was divided into Epistolarium,
   for the Epistles, and Evangelistarium, for the Gospels: ANTIPHONARIUM,
   or GRADUALE, for all that was sung at Mass: SACRAMENTARIUM, for all the
   fixed parts and the Collects. MANUALE was the title in the Salisbury
   and York "Uses" for the Book called elsewhere RITUALE. It comprised the
   offices for Baptism, Matrimony, Burial, and others of less importance.
   PONTIFICALE; the chief contents of this were the Ordination Services,
   Confirmation, Consecration of a Church and Burial ground, and sundry
   Episcopal benedictions. In addition to the above the PRIMERS deserve
   notice, though they were originally intended rather for private than
   public service. The Primer was not confined to any one definite set of
   prayers, but embraced several different collections according to the
   will of the compiler. Maskell's Primer, e.g. which has been assigned a
   date as early as 1400 A.D., contained Matins, Evensong, Compline,
   Litany, the Hours of the Virgin, the Penitential Psalms and Songs of
   Degrees, the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and Ten Commandments. It was
   usual to print the book in English and Latin, sometimes in one of these
   languages only. A revised edition was brought out by Marshall in 1530
   A.D., and another by Hilsey, Bishop of Rochester, in 1539 A.D., but all
   existing editions were superseded in 1545 A.D. by "The Primer set forth
   by the King's Majesty and his Clergy to be taught, learned, and read:
   and none other to be used throughout all his dominions."

   [12] It is considered highly probable that he was assisted by Lanfranc,
   who had already compiled a "Use" for the Benedictines. For the ifluence
   of Roman ritual upon that which was introduced into England in view of
   reconciling the clergy, which consisted of two rival races, cf. Preface
   to the SARUM MISSAL in English, pp. x.-xi.

   [13] The Lesser Monasteries, 376 in number, with incomes not exceeding
   £200 a year, were dissolved by Act of Parliament, 1536 A.D. The Larger
   Monasteries shared the same fate, but not so summarily. The Act which
   appropriated their revenues passed 1539 A.D.

   [14] In lapse of time the two early services came to be used
   continuously, and were regarded as one.

   [15] 1 Cf. FREEMAN'S Principles of Divine Service, i. 278.

   [16] Erasmus's Greek Testament, though of no critical value, made a
   deep and lasting impression. He had neither the MSS. to enable him to
   form a text, nor training to do it even if he had. To it, however, is
   due the first awakening to the fact that the Vulgate was a document not
   worthy of the confidence which the Church had placed in it.

   [17] Dean of St. Paul's, and founder of the School which bears that
   name. He commenced his Lectures on the Greek Testament in 1498 A.D.

   [18] Latimer, though at first bitterly opposed to him, became a convert
   to his teaching, and drew Ridley over to the same studies.

   [19] Maskell, in opposition to those who have aserted that daily
   service was never intended for the laity, appeals to the authority of
   the Fathers and decides that it is "a certain thing, that the Divine
   Office was not instituted solely for the clergy, but for all men who
   call themselves Christians." Cf. FREEMAN'S Principles of Divine
   Service, i. 277. The Scriptures teach plainly that in some sense all
   Christians are priests. St. Peter addressing his converts at large,
   writes, "Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, an
   holy priesthiood," and again, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal
   priesthiood, a holy nation." 1 Ep. ii. 5, 9. St. JOHN also adopts
   similar language, "And hath made us kings and priests unto God." REV.
   i. 6. This teaching however has oftenbecn misunderstood and supposed to
   destroy the efficacy of ordination. Rightly interpreted, it enhances it
   greatly. It is evident that the Apostles had in their minds the
   language which God addressed to the Israelites, where speaking to all
   He said, "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation."
   EXOD. xix. 6. They knew well that though the universal priesthood of
   the nation was here acknowledged, God had set apart a special
   priesthood with special functions, and so hedged it in that for any one
   of "the kingdom of priests" to claim it, without being called, was an
   unpardonable sin. Unless the two cases had been analogous the Apostles
   would have been careful to avoid the language they used. It is worthy
   of notice how those Nonconforming bodies, which lay stress in this
   matter on the authority of St. Peter and St. John, have robbed the
   laity of their prerogative, and precluded them almost entirely from all
   part in the offering of public worship. A comparison of the ordinary
   service and the parts assigned to the congregation and the ministers as
   appointed in the Church and in any Dissenting Chapel will exhibit the
   contrast in a very marked manner.

   [20] In 1516 and 1531 A.D. Cf. FREEMAN'S Prinicples, etc., Introd. pt.
   II. sect. x.

   [21] This is especially observable in reference to the simplification
   of the directions for services, and to the extended reading of Holy
   Scripture.

   [22] The title of "sole protector and supreme head of the Church,"
   which he proposed to assume, was much discussed in Convocation, and
   accepted with the limitation "quantum per Christi legem licet," first
   by Canterbury and shortly afterwards by York. An Act of Parliament was
   passed in 1534 A.D. declaring the King to be the "Supreme head on earth
   of the Church of England."

   efficacy of solitary masses and the celibacy of the priesthood.

   [28] This "Order of Communion" was really an addition to the old Latin
   Mass of an English Form to be used when any of the laity communicated.
   Cf. Appendix II.

   [29] The Proclamation ran thus : "The most Blessed Sacrament of the
   Body and Blood of Christ our Saviour should from henceforth be commonly
   delivered and ministered to all persons within our realm of England and
   Ireland and other our dominions under both kings, that is to say, of
   bread and wine (except necessity of the wise require) lest every man
   phantasaying and devising a sundry way by himself, in the use of this
   most blessed Sacrament of unity, there might arise any unseemly or
   ungodly diversity."

   [30] In former editions, I spoke of, this Order of Cimmunion having
   received the sanction of Convocation. In this I have made alterations,
   being now satisfied that I was mstaken, and that I had its action in
   regard to the principle of conceding the cup to the laity with the Form
   of Service subsequently framed for administration.

   [31] There has been much dispute as to the actual place of session.
   They were unquestioruably in audience of the King it Windsor, but as
   the Court was residing at Oatlands during their deIiberations, it is
   said they usually met at Chertsey Abbey. Cf. Gasquet, p. 133, n.

   [32] Dixon implies that they were not formally appointed, only
   nominated. The original terms are obscure: "but this the Lower House
   released."--WILKINS, iii. 863.

   [33] The Council of Nicæa, 325 A.D.

   [34] "I protest and openly confess that in all my doctrine and
   preaching both of the Sacrament and of other my doctrine, whatsoever it
   be, not only I mean and judge those things as the Catholic Church and
   most holy Fathers of old with one accord have meant and judged, but
   also I would gladly use the same words that they used." Cf. Hook's Life
   of Cranmer, cap. iii. pp. 147-9.

   [35] For the right understanding of this we suggest a short
   explanation. Firstly, Christ was offered in sacrifice once for all, and
   that sacrifice made a full, perfect, and sufficient antonement for sin.
   Herein it was distinguished from the Jewish sacrifices, which being
   imperfect were necessarily repeated. But though Christ died once only,
   and in His Death all his sufferings ended, there is a sense in which
   His offering is continious. Look at the type. When the typical act of
   Atonement was about to be made on one day for the whole sins of the
   year, the sacrifices were offered in the outer court, and then the High
   Priest, taking the blood of the sacrifice, entered within the Veil, and
   presenting it before the Mercy Seat in the presence of God plealed for
   forgiveness by and through it. The sacrifice was not complete till it
   was presented and pleaded before God. Now see the antitype. Christ
   suffered without the camp, and then by His own blood entered the Holy
   Holies to complete His sacrifice by presenting and pleading it before
   God. This is still going on, as HEBREWS viii. 3 clearly teaches, and
   will be continuous till He comes again, when the pleading or
   representing the memorial of His Death will cease. Now let us see,
   secondly, how the Holy Eucharist is the counterpart on earth of
   Christ's presentation of His own sacrifice in heaven. He commanded time
   Apostles to offer this as His memorial sacrifice. The language he used
   would suggest as much to Jews. Anamnesis not a term familiar to them
   for a "memorial before men;" wherever it was used in the Greek
   Scriptures it was of a "memorial before God;" cl. NUMB. x. 10; LEVIT.
   xxiv. 7; HEBR. x. 3, compared with LEVIT. xvi. 17. poiein, though often
   used in another sense, admitted a sacrificial interpretation; cf.
   BISHOP HAMILTON'S Charge. Liddell and Scott give the meaning
   "sacrifice," poiein moschon, LXX. "Sacerdos vice Christi vere fungitur,
   qui id quod Christus fecit, imitator, et sacrificium verum et plenum
   tune offert."--St. CYPRIAN, Ep. 63. "As it is a commemoration and
   representnsent of Christ's Death, so it is a commemorative sacrifice."

   xvii. ad Hebr.; BRAMHALL, Ep. de la Milletiere, Works, i. 54; BULL,
   Works, ii. 271 (Oxf.) ANDREWES'S Resp. ad Apolog.

   [36] Cranmer was twice Fellow: elected first in 1523 A.D.

   [37] When the Abbey of Ely was converted into a Bishopric in 1109 AD.,
   the king directed that the estates shuould be divided in just
   proportion between the Bishop and the monks. The division, which was
   conducted entirely by Harvey, the first Bishop, and forced upon the
   monastery, was so far from being an equitable one, that a contemporary,
   William of Malmesbury, writes of it in these terms:--"You may judge of
   the value of the ancient possessions of the Church of Ely by this :
   that though many of them have been taken away and many are in the hands
   of intruders, yet he who now presides there receives annually £1040
   into his own purse, besides what he expends on his own family in
   keeping up hospitality, but has scarcely allowed £300 to the
   monks."--Cf. BENTHAM'S Hist. of Ely Cath. p. l35.

   [38] This portion, extending to the paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer,
   has generally been ascribed to Nowell, afterwards Dean of St. Paul's,
   but it the time of this revision an assistant-master at Westminister
   School. There is a strong presumption against the probability of the
   revisers deputing such an important work to one in a position of so
   little dignity. It was far likely to be undertaken by one of their own
   body, such as Goodrich was. It is worthy of record that in 1540 A.D. he
   was appointed one of the translators of the Bible, and had the Gospel
   of St. John allotted to him.

   [39] The Abbey was dissolved and erected into an Episcopal See in
   December 1540 A.D., and Thirdly appointed first Bishop with
   jurisdiction over Middlesex. On March 29, 1550 A.D., he surrendered it
   into the king's hands, who thereupon dissolved it, reconciled Middlesex
   to London, and translated the Bishop to Norwich.

   [40] Cf. p. 48. Day, Thirlby, and Skip all protested at first, but the
   two latter had not the courage of their opinions when the final
   pressure came.--Cf. SOAMES'S Edward VI. p. 354.

   [52] The opening line is an unfortunate rendering and quite
   unjustifiable. It should be "We praise Thee as God." It is not at all
   improbable that this hymn was, in its original form, such an one as
   Pliny says the Christians used in his time, "carmen dicentes secum
   invicem Christo quasi Deo."--Ep. ad Traj. Eusebius also testifies to
   the custom of ascribing Divinity to Christ in hymns.--Eccl. Hist. v.
   28, cf. also LIDDON'S Bamp. Lect. vii. Other inaccurate renderings are
   "goodly fellowship," for "praiseworthy number," "noble army" for
   "white-robed," (as in an old English version, "the white oost
   ;")--"When Thou tookest upon Thee," etc., for "When with a view to
   de1iverance Thou tookest upon Thee humanity."--"Make them to be
   numbered with thy saints in glory," for, "to be rewarded with
   glory:"--"numerari" was probably substituted by a clerical error for
   "munerari," and the "in" prefixed to "gloria" to complete the
   construction;--Possibly "Vouchsafe to keep us this day," for "that
   day," viz., the day of judgment, though isle is used mediæevally for
   hic;--and perhaps "never be confounded," for "not to be confounded for
   ever," so an old version, "Be I not schent for ever," though here again
   "never" is so rendered in the Vulg.; cf. Ps. xv. (xiv.) 5; xxxi. (xxx.)
   1." The rhythm is manifestly improved in verses 7, 8, 9. The original
   runs --

   Te gloriosus Apostolorum chorus,

   Te Prophetarum laudabilis numerus,

   Te Martyrum candidatus laudat exercitus.

   [53] All the Saints' Days Collects were composed in 1549 A.D., except
   those for St. Bartholomew and the Conversion of St. Paul, which were
   only altered, and those for St. Andrew and St. Stephen, the former of
   which was written in 1552 A.D., the latter rewritten in 1661 AD.

   [55] Cardinal Quignonez, a Spanish Bishop, revised the Breviary, and
   published it for the use of the clergy and monasteries, under the
   sanction of Clement VII. in 1536 A.D. The title of his edition was
   "Breviarium Romanæ Curiæ ex sacra et canonica Scriptura necnon
   sanctorum historiis summa vigilautia decerptis accurate digestum." It
   was suppressed in 1576 A.D.

   [56] Lib. ii. c. lvii. The date of their composition is uncertain: the
   first six books probably in the third century, the others a little
   later.

   what Prophet, what Apostle was read to us to-day?" It may be seen also
   from the Canons of the Councils of Ladicæa and Carthage that both the
   Old and New Testaments were read in Church. Cf. BINGHAM'S Antiq. xiv.
   iii. 2.

   [58] 2 The origin of the term Pie is a vexed question. It has been
   derived from the initial letter of IRTAT, a tablet, and from pica, a
   magpie. The allusion in the latter is to the party-coloured letters in
   which the directions were written. Before the 15th century these
   regulations were called Ordinale.

   [59] TERTULLIAN, 190 A.D., speaks of the third, sixth, and ninth hours
   as more solemn than the rest.--De Orat., c. 25. St. JEROME mentions the
   same as the times when, according to Ecclesiastical tradition, the
   knees are to be bent to GOD.--Comm. In Dan., vi. 10. The Apostolical
   Constitutions, on the other hand, testify to two services only. The
   Bishop is directed to exhort the people to attend Church constantly
   morning and evening every day, and the 63d Psalm is appointed for the
   former, the 141st for the latter.--Lib. ii. c. lix. EPIPHANIUS also, in
   giving an account of the customs of the Church, mentions morning hymns
   and evening prayers as constantly used, but makes no allusion to any
   other.--Exposit. Fidei, n. 23 (t. I. p. 1106).

   [60] The bulk of the Psalms were sung at Matins and Vespers, twelve at
   the former, five at the latter. The greater part of the 119th was
   divided between the Lesser Hours. The remainder were distributed
   between Lauds, Prime, and Compline.

   [61] In the passage of the Apotol. Constit. above cited, it is stated
   that the prophets and the account of the Resurrection were read, and
   prayers offered up afterwards.--Lib. ii. c. lix.

   [62] This was more largely provided for in the First Prayer-book than
   in any of the subsequent Revisions. In each and all of these the
   element of prayer has encroached upon that of praise.

   [63] Cf. FREEMAN'S Principles of Divine Service, vol. i. c. iv. s. 3.

   [64] The great antiquity of the use of this Invitation, dating
   certainly to the third century, as we know on the, authority of St.
   Athanasius, as well as its peculiar propriety, are sufficient reasons
   for not omitting it in the Shortened Form of Service sanctioned by the
   Act of Uniformity Amendment Act. It is true that discretion is given to
   the Minister to add, in its proper place, any canticle he may think
   fit, but in our judgment the "Venite" should have found a place in the
   necessary portion of the Service.

   must have become known before this Festival. Cf. LATHBURY, ibid.

CHAPTER II

THE PURITAN INNOVATIONS

   The causes which led to the further change.

   The Revised Prayer-book, after the opposition in Devonshire and Norfolk
   had subsided, received very general recognition. Of course there were
   some who, while grateful for the reforms which had been effected, could
   ill suppress their conviction that the hands of the Reformers had been
   stayed too soon. These, however, in England at least, were not a
   numerous body; and if no influence from without had been brought to
   bear upon them, they would probably have quietly acquiesced without
   taking any action in the matter. But there were many restless spirits
   on time Continent who watched the progress of reform in this country
   with the keenest interest, and whose hopes seemed to hang upon the
   English Church. All, they felt, would be safe if only they could
   indoctrinate England with a truly Protestant spirit, a genuine aversion
   to anything and everything which received the approval of Rome.

   The foreign Reformers.

   Foremost amongst these were Calvin, Melanchthon, John à Lasco, Bucer,
   and Peter Martyr.

   Unfortunately they found in Cranmer, the Primate of the English Church,
   a too ready listener to their Proposals. All of them entered into
   correspondence with him upon ecclesiastical affairs; some of them came
   over in person, and were welcomed as guests in his Palace, and received
   much sympathy and encouragement at his hands.

   Calvin.

   Calvin, piqued by the manner in which the Archbishop had met his
   proposal [81] to take part in the first Revision, hesitated to risk a
   second rebuff by direct negotiations, but endeavoured first to
   ingratiate himself with the Protector, hoping through him ultimately to
   attain his object. He was considerate enough to express his general
   approval of set forms of prayer, but, with time self-sufficiency which
   asserts itself in all his letters, enters upon an elaborate criticism
   and censure of many of those which had so lately received the sanction
   of the English Convocation, the King, and the Parliament. After this he
   wrote to Edward VI. pleading for more extensive revision.

   Cranmer had no personal liking for Calvin, and if he had been the only
   discontented complainant, probably little notice would have been taken
   of his grievance, but a far more dangerous Reformer entered into the
   field of controversy in the person of Melanchthon. The connection
   between him and the Primate begun under most favourable circumstances.
   It would hardly be possible to find any other two men with such strong
   natural affinities to each other. The scheme for a general concordat.
   Now at this time Melanchthon was possessed by an intense desire to draw
   up a Concordat which should commend itself to the Protestant world at
   large, and act as a powerful engine against the Papacy. So long as this
   was attacked by the Churches singly he felt that it would always prove
   formidable, perhaps quite invincible, but if it could once be attacked
   by a combination of forces its downfall was secured.

   The possibility of the scheme had been suggested to him by the cordial
   reception of the Confession [82] which he had compiled throughout the
   Lutheran communities. It is characteristic, however, of Melanchthon's
   modesty, and strangely in contrast with the self-confidence of his
   brother Reformer, that he shrank back from all claim to take part even
   in drawing up the terms of agreement, and more than hinted at the
   imperfections of the document he had framed.

   Melanchthon refuses to come to England.

   The idea commended itself to Cranmer's judgment, and he lost no time in
   inviting its originator to settle in this country, but the invitation
   was not accepted. Again and again the Archbishop renewed his efforts,
   holding out every possible inducement, but Melanchthon persistently
   refused to leave his native land. The urgency of the invitations we may
   gather from the astonishment expressed in one of his letters, [83] in
   which he writes that the English pressed hitting so hard that they took
   away his breath.'

   To any one who had interested himself in the work of Reform the union
   of all the Reformed Churches in such a coalition must in itself have
   appeared a grand conception; but past experience of such combinations
   ought to have suggested difficulty and danger. If the alliance was to
   be more than nominal it would entail many sacrifices before
   satisfactory terms could he mutually agreed upon. Of these it was
   inevitable that by far the larger share would be called for from
   England. Unhappily Cranmer had already begun to drift away from the
   principles which he so boldly advocated at the Windsor Revision [84] ;
   and the utter inconsistency of making the required concessions failed
   to deter him. There was certainly one most desirable object to be
   obtained by the project, and possibly this weighed largely with him. It
   would give back to the Lutheran and Calvinistic Churches the Episcopal
   government which they had lost. [85] But he never calculated how much
   was to be set over-against this one advantage in the surrender of other
   Catholic privileges. The Swiss Protestants, [86] for instance, were
   impatient of everything, either in doctrine or ritual, for which
   express direction was wanting in Holy Scripture. To conciliate them the
   authority of antiquity, the witness of tradition, the decrees of
   general Councils--all must be disregarded--and, in a word, the guiding
   principles of the First Revision completely reversed.

   Influences brough to bear upon Cranmer.

   Cranmer, unless he wilfully closed his eyes, must have seen all this at
   the outset; but he was egged on by the Privy Council and the King
   himself. The fiery Scotch Reformer, John Knox, already enrolled among
   the Royal Chaplains, [87] was actually proposed for a vacant Bishopric,
   the King expressing a hope that if raised to the Episcopal Bench he
   might prove "a whetstone to quicken and sharpen the Bishop of
   Canterbury, whereof he had need." But though the Utopian scheme of
   Melanchthon was soon relinquished as hopeless, the impulse in the
   direction of Protestantism which Cranmer had received lost little of
   its force. Indeed it gathered fresh energy from a new and unexpected
   cause. This produced ultimately such grave and unhappy results that we
   cannot pass on till we have traced its origin with care and attention.

   The second Diet of Spires.

   On March 15, 1529 A.D., a diet of the German Empire was ordered by
   Charles V. to Lake into consideration the state or religion in his
   dominions. A resolution was passed ratifying a previous condemnation of
   Luther, and pledging the members of the Conference to use their
   endeavours to stem the tide of innovation which was threatening to
   inundate the land.

   The Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Prince of Anhalt,
   the Dukes of Lünenburg, together with the Commissioners from fourteen
   Imperial cities, [88] made a manly defence for the rights of
   conscience, and solemnly protested against what they held to be an
   unjust decree, gaining from this circumstance the distinction of being
   the progenitors of all who have since borne the title of Protestant.'

   The league of Smalcald.

   The league of Smalcald, [89] which followed not 1ong after, bound the
   Protestant States together for, mutual defence against all aggression
   upon their religious rights. The Emperor determined to leave no stone
   unturned to defeat their object, but it was not till some time had
   elapsed that he was able to take any decisive step. In 1548 A.D., by
   the aid of several divines, he drew up a system of Theology [90] for
   general adoption, but although it was written with most carefully
   studied dissimulation, and every artifice which language could provide
   was employed to conceal its real effect, it was soon discovered to be
   conformable in all but a few unimportant articles to the old Roman
   Religion. The document purported to be merely intended as a provisional
   arrangement, of force only till a general Council could be summoned,
   and it was designated accordingly The Interim.'

   The tyranny of the Emperor.

   The Emperor was determined to bind the States to his will, and to
   coerce all who refused compliance. One prince after another suffered
   imprisonment, taking courage from the noble example of the Elector of
   Saxony, whom threats and promises alike failed to shake. "I cannot
   flow," he said, "in my old age abandon the principles for which I
   formerly contended; nor, in order to procure freedom during a few
   declining years, will I betray that good cause on account of which I
   have suffered so much, and am still willing to suffer. Better for me to
   enjoy in this solitude the esteem of virtuous men, together with the
   approbation of my own conscience, than to return unto the world, with
   the imputation and guilt of apostasy, and to disgrace and embitter the
   remainder of my days." The severity of his confinement was increased,
   and everything done to compel submission; but throughout Germany and in
   the Netherlands, there was an obstinate determination not to be drawn
   back again into the toils from which they had. extricated themselves,
   when Luther threw the Papal Bull into the flames at Wittenberg.

   The oppressed Foreigners take refuge in England.

   But in the midst of all this persecution it was not surprising that
   they looked abroad for a free country where they might hold and
   proclaim their opinions without molestation; and it was no less
   surprising that they turned instinctively to England to find what they
   desired. These were the circumstances which brought the bulk of the
   Foreign Protestants into this country. We have dwelt upon the history
   at length, at the risk of being tedious, because it was of such
   momentous consequence to the Church that it can hardly be too carefully
   considered.

   The leading Foreigners who took refuge with us were John à Lasco, Peter
   Martyr, and Martin Bucer.

   As they affected for a time the whole character of Liturgical worship
   in England, we shall adopt the plan which we followed with the First
   Revisionists, and endeavour to draw out the leading features of their
   lives and work for the better understanding of the influence which they
   exercised.

   John à Lasco.

   In May 1550 A.D., John à Lasco came to settle in London. Though by
   birth a Pole, of noble blood, he had been living in the capital of
   Friesland [91] for some years, and taking a prominent part in all the
   Ecclesiastical controversies, which agitated the Netherlands, as well
   as the rest of the Continent. The Protestant cause made great progress
   in the province, and the Emperor, perhaps confounding its advocates to
   some extent with the turbulent Anabaptists, took the extreme measure of
   invoking the aid of the Spanish Inquisition to suppress them. [92]

   The fear of this, combined with the publication of "the Interim," [93]
   drove à Lasco to find a refuge in England. His great influence. The
   wide-spread influence which he exercised over the Foreign Churches,
   which had formed or were forming congregations in London, is very
   remarkable, and stamps him as a man of no inconsiderable power. He
   succeeded without difficulty in gaining the ear of the Lords of the
   Council, Cecil and Choke, and through them of the Protector Somerset.
   He held out to him the advantages to trade, especially in the branch of
   weaving, which was their speciality, likely to accrue to our country if
   his followers were permitted to dwell unmolested. The king's
   concessions to him. And he gained even more than he asked. The King was
   so fascinated by his conversation, and touched by his story, that he
   actually granted part of the dissolved monastery of the Augustinian
   Friars as a chapel for his congregation, together with the
   unprecedented privilege of absolute security from interference, civil
   and ecclesiastical, in their forms of worship and discipline. This
   remarkable concession, [94] fraught with so much future trouble to the
   Church, was signed and sealed on July 24, 1550 A.D. It offered all that
   the restless spirits of the time could desire in the free exercise of
   religious worship, after other forms than those established by the law
   of the land. The home of à Lasco became a rendezvous for persecuted
   foreigners of whatever denomination or doctrinal opinion, and he
   reigned like a second Pontiff over a multitude of communities, Dutch,
   German, Italian, Florentine, Belgian and French. His doctrinal views.In
   doctrine, on the crucial question of the day, the nature of the
   Sacraments, he advocated strongly Zuinglian principles, and condemned
   as idolatrous the practice of kneeling to receive the consecrated
   elements. His aversion to Rites and Ceremonies manifested itself in his
   eagerness to shake off the fetters of English usage; while in the
   Vestiarian controversy, which was creating such trouble and bitterness
   at this time, Hooper expressed his satisfaction that though many men of
   influence and position from whom he expected support held entirely
   aloof, John à Lasco stood by his side.'

   His piety was most marked, and his learning so profound, that Erasmus
   pronounced him to be "a man of such parts that he wished for no greater
   happiness than his single friendship," [95] and as an unmistakable mark
   of his esteem, he bequeathed to him in his will the then-priceless
   treasure of his Library.

   Now while à Lasco was exercising his great influence in favour of
   Calvinistic doctrine and unrestrained liberty of private judgment in
   the metropolis, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were being
   brought under the training of foreign minds in many respects of no very
   different type. Peter Martyr.Peter Martyr was teaching at Oxford;
   Martin Bucer at Cambridge. Martyr, a man of high birth, spent his early
   years in a Florentine monastery, but was at last compelled, like so
   many of his contemporaries, to become an exile for conscience sake.
   Like à Lasco he found a sanctuary in England. [96] Shortly after his
   arrival, mainly through the Primate's influence he superseded Dr.
   Richard Smith in the Chair of Divinity at Oxford. He became at once
   unpopular with the University authorities; his first offence was taking
   his wife to live with him in his Canonical lodgings at Christ Church,
   she being the first woman who had ventured to invade by her presence
   "the sanctity of College life." Dying shortly after, she was buried by
   the shrine of St. Frideswide in Christ Church Cathedral, but on the
   accession of Queen Mary the Celibates had their revenge, for her body
   was thrown out in scorn and buried in a dunghill without the precincts
   of the College. [97]

   In the earliest lectures that he delivered, ho took such a low view of
   the Sacraments as to assert that they were mere "figures of absent
   things," and the general tone of his Theology roused a spirit of strong
   opposition, so strong that on one occasion when the Schools were
   thronged by town as well as gown, he owed his preservation from
   personal violence to the timely interposition of the Vice-Chancellor
   and his attendants. [98]

   Again, on the Vestiarian controversy he took up a position directly
   opposed to all the traditional usage of the Catholic Church, and was
   heard to boast that although a Canon of the Cathedral "he had never
   worn a surplice at Oxford, even when present in the Choir," and his
   favourite designation for the Eucharistic vestments was "relics of the
   Amorites." [99]

   And these are things which we must not forget when we come to consider
   the changes which the Second Edwardian Prayer-book effected both in
   doctrine and ceremonial.

   Martin Bucer.

   We pass to the third of the distinguished Foreigners. His original name
   was Kuhhorn, but according to a pedantic fashion of the day [100] he
   changed it to Bucer, bous keras, or in English "Cowhorn." Much of his
   early life he spent at Heidelberg as a Dominican Friar, [101] but was
   at length tempted to abandon the cloister, and entered the married
   state: and in doing so he not only violated his own sacred promise, but
   induced another to do the same, for he selected a nun for his partner;
   and when in the plague which devastated the country in 1541 A.D., she
   and five of her thirteen sons were carried off, the enemies who
   professed the old Faith boasted that judgment had overtaken her at last
   for her broken vows.

   On coming to England at the same time as Martyr, Bucer was placed in
   the corresponding Chair of Divinity in the sister University, where he
   gave a fresh direction to the studies of the place. While his brother
   Professor at Oxford had been trained in the School of Calvin, he had
   sat at the feet of Luther. [102] His doctrinal views.He did not, it is
   true, accept his master's teaching on the subject of subjects; he
   nevertheless held Sacramental views many degrees removed from the
   bareness of Calvin's pupil.

   The vicious principle that the abuse of a thing is in itself a
   sufficient argument for its disuse had to much hold upon him, and it
   led him to oppose with fatal effect the Catholic practice of commending
   in prayer the faithful dead to the mercy of GOD. He did not hesitate to
   profess his cordial acceptance of the Revised Prayer-book, but inasmuch
   as in twenty-eight chapters of criticism of its contents, he finds
   abundant material for censure, it is difficult to acquit him of the
   charge of dissimulation, and certainly his views upon the utility of
   ceremonies, and "the circumstance" of religious worship, are utterly
   inconsistent with an unreserved approval of the principles oh the First
   Revision.His dislike of ceremonies. For instance, he confessed that the
   sign of the Cross in Holy Baptism, the symbolical act of investing with
   the Chrisom, [103] and "the sanctification of water to the mystical
   washing away of sin," were especially distasteful to him. Even the
   innocent practice of bell-ringing, except immediately before service,
   he denounced for reasons quite unintelligible.

   The separation of the Clergy from the Laity during Divine Service, he
   designated an "antichristian practice." The manual acts accompanying
   the words of Consecration in the Holy Eucharist he condemned as
   useless, and not only did he show an aversion to the Eucharistic
   vestments, but went so far as to object to wearing the Academic dress,
   though he shielded what we believe was a genuine detestation under the
   disguise of a quaint witticism, "that he could hardly be expected to
   wear a square cap, seeing that his head was round." [104]

   His personal goodness.

   But while we find so much with which we can feel little sympathy, we
   must not omit to bear testimony to his personal attractiveness and an
   amiability and sweetness of disposition towards those who differed from
   him, which often proved irresistible in winning them to his side.

   His residence at Cambridge was of short duration, but sufficiently long
   to endear him to men of every class, and shade of opinion, and he was
   followed to his grave by the whole body of the University.

   The learned ecclesiastic Redmayn, Master of Trinity, Cambridge, who
   delivered a panegyric upon his merits, confessed that his own high
   sacramental views might not improbably have undergone material
   modification had not the influence of the Professor's teaching been so
   prematurely closed. His labours in the Protestant cause were not
   forgotten when Queen Mary reigned, for his body was exhumed, and burnt
   in the market-place; but the dishonour was wiped out at a later date,
   when a special act of reparation was performed at St. Mary's, and the
   Church presented a spectacle unique in its history, the walls being
   covered with laudatory verses and tributes to his worth.

   It to the spell of these three men that Cranmer yielded himself up.
   Whether he actually utilised their direct aid and counsel, during the
   progress of the Second Revision, or not, is really a matter of
   indifference, or at least of secondary importance.Chranges in the
   opinions of Cranmer. When we contrast him with what he was when he sat
   in the Chair in the Windsor Assembly, no one can deny that a vast
   change had passed over him; and when we go on to consider how the
   change had taken place in the very direction of the teaching of certain
   influential men, with whom he had been living in close intimacy or
   correspondence, there is only one consistent conclusion to be drawn.

   In the alterations which mark the Revision under present consideration
   we see again and again such a significant coincidence between the
   proscription of forms or doctrine, and the peculiar tenets of one or
   other of these Foreign Reformers, that it is simple blindness to refuse
   to acknowledge the potency of this alien influence.

   Now, while Cranmer and the King had been drawn into such close bonds of
   sympathy with the Exiles, and strongly impelled, as we have seen, to
   conciliate them by further revision of our Service-books in view of a
   great Protestant Alliance, matters were brought to a crisis by the
   outbreak of the Vestiarian controversy.

   The Vestiarian dispute.

   The prominent figure throughout was John Hooper.

   On the passing of the "Bloody Statute" [105] he fled to Zurich, and
   there became thoroughly impregnated with Swiss theology, and enamoured
   of the bareness of Zwingli's forms of service.

   John Hooper.

   After his return home upon the accession of Edward VI., he was
   appointed to preach before the King and his Most Honourable Privy
   Council, and availed himself of the opportunity of advocating in
   several sermons a number of sweeping changes and most startling
   innovations. His first efforts were directed to the destruction of
   stone altars [106] and the substitution of wooden tables, which he
   deemed imperative, for the overthrow of the Sacrificial doctrine of the
   Holy Eucharist; and in this crusade Ridley went heartily with him.
   [107] As a necessary sequel it was followed up by an attack upon the
   Eucharistic Vestments, which he said were only "marks of Judaism"
   calculated to bring us back again to the Aaronic Priesthood. From this
   he went on to condemn the Academical habits, and the Convocation Robes
   of the Prelates especially as being of the colour which was held to
   identify the Papacy with the Babylonian harlot. But here the Bishop of
   London wisely quitted his side. Ho even contended so strongly for the
   mediæval dress, that, Sooner than yield, he advised the imprisonment of
   his old colleague for his obstinate refusal to wear them. Hooper was
   committed to the Fleet. [108]

   It was one of those unguarded moves, which so often lead to
   consequences the very opposite to what is desired.

   Persecution endured for conscience sake not unfrequently terminates in
   favour of the persecuted. When the Prison door closed upon Hooper, the
   battle was won for his cause.

   No sanction from Convocation for fresh reforms.

   And, with this agitation, the combination of forces requisite to
   re-open the reform of Church worship was well-nigh complete. It only
   wanted the sanction of Convocation to insure recommencement and
   unimpeded progress afterwards. But, to the honour of the Church, that
   was never given.

   At the urgent solicitation of Calvin, the two Houses seem to have taken
   into consideration the desirableness of proceeding with the work of
   revision, but though the records of their deliberations have perished,
   it would appear from contemporary evidence that they did not encourage,
   certainly not formally authorise, the proposed undertaking. Some of the
   Upper House, it is true, having been like the Primate brought under
   Continental influence, did suggest to the Lower House that they should
   consult upon certain controverted passages in the Book of Common
   Prayer; but when the latter were called upon by their spiritual
   superiors to give in the result of their deliberations, they found an
   excuse in the plea that insufficient time had been allowed, [109] 1 but
   made no signs of proceeding with the business, which, as far as they
   were concerned, was altogether dropped. It is quite clear that they
   were averse to the proposal, and that the Ring was fully aware of it.
   Otherwise it would be impossible to account for his declaration, that
   he was determined to carry it through, despite all opposition, and if
   the changes he desired Were not secured by the ordinary process, he
   would, as head of the Church, exercise his prerogative and enforce
   revision.

   Undertaken on the sole authority of Parliament.

   Eventually an Act of Parliament was passed directing that the former
   Liturgy "should be faithfully and godly perused, explained, and made
   fully perfect." [110]

   This was the authority upon which the Revision was undertaken.

   Before we look at the changes which were made, let us prepare ourselves
   by a rapid glance at the distinctive features of Catholic and Puritan
   worship.

   The broad distinction between Catholic and Puritan.

   The Catholic clings to his Church as an historic Church. In every age
   of its existence its present is linked with its past. Its faith is a
   symbol of unity, because it is part of the great heritage of Catholic
   tradition: not an ever-changing system of religion and worship, but one
   inherited through a long line of ancestry, to be transmitted unimpaired
   to the latest posterity.

   The Church of the Puritan is essentially unhistoric, with no reverence
   for ancient forms because of their antiquity, but ready at any time to
   sacrifice whatever in her judgment has become tainted with error; to
   supersede by modern innovations the most time-honoured usage.

   The changes in the revised Prayer-book.

   And now, in the light of this broad distinction, let us look at the
   changes themselves.

   They were so numerous that without attempting to exhaust the list, we
   shall be satisfied to set forth those which from their significance
   seem most worthy of our attention.

   The Title-page

   The title of the book was changed. In the first Prayer-book of Edward
   VI. It was "The book of common prayer and administration of the
   Sacraments and other rites and ceremonies of the Church, after the use
   of the Church of England."

   In the second Prayer-book "of the Church" was omitted, and an indirect
   blow given to the claim of the Anglican branch to belong to the
   Catholic Church.

   The spirit of the next change is worthy of all praise. Before the
   revision only such as "served the congregation" were expected to recite
   daily Matins and Evensong.The obligation to recite the Daily Office.
   Henceforward an obligation was laid upon all priests and deacons,
   "except they be letted by preaching, studying of divinity, or by some
   other urgent cause;" and also upon all Curates to say the same in their
   Parish Churches, unless they were absent from home or otherwise
   reasonably hindered.

   These obligations, with a slight modification, remain in force at the
   present day. We cannot but think some evil has arisen from the causes
   of exemption not having been duly recognised. In many villages where
   the clergyman hesitates because he is single-handed, the Daily Service
   would be offered, if it were thoroughly understood by priest and people
   that its intermission from time to time from several causes, provided
   for in the rubric, would convey no impression of neglect of duty.

   Changes in the Calendar.

   In the Calendar the names of three Saints were admitted, viz., SS.
   George, Laurence, and Clement; upon what grounds the two former were so
   honoured it is difficult to divine, considering the strong objections
   felt by the Revisionists to the principle of commemorating any other
   than those whose place in Scripture history entitled them to
   distinction.

   At the same time Mary Magdalene was allowed to drop out, probably from
   a doubt in their minds that she was the woman who was "a sinner," to
   whom the portion of Scripture, St. Luke vii. 36-50, read for the Gospel
   referred. There are few traditions more improbable and baseless than
   that which has resulted in the popular belief.

   And though the Revisionists might have acted more wisely by
   substituting an appropriate passage, and thus retaining her place in
   the services of the Church, almost anything is better than the
   perpetuation of an error, which stained the memory of one of the most
   beautiful saints of Gospel story.

   Then we notice the introduction of a rubric directing that the Prayers
   shall be said, "in such place of the Church, chapel, or chancel, and
   the Minister shall so turn him as the people may best hear." This was
   intended as a relaxation of the rule or custom of the First
   Prayer-book, which placed the Reader in the Quire, where be stood or
   knelt facing eastwards, [111] turning, that is, in the same direction
   as the congregation--a position which seemed fit and appropriate to one
   who was acting for the time being as their head and representative. The
   modification was a concession to Bucer and Calvin, whose vehement
   denunciations of the prevailing practice as "Antichristian" and as an
   "insufferable abuse" are still extant.

   Additions.

   Another change was the prefixing of the Sentences, Exhortation,
   Confession, and Absolution to the Matins, [112] which had begun
   hitherto with the LORD's Prayer. This was necessary when the frequency
   of divine service had ceased to solemnise the minds of the
   congregation, and for this purpose a better preparation could hardly
   have been devised. It is when the conscience is relieved from the
   burden of its sins, that man is in the fittest mood to praise and give
   thanks to GOD. The main object however of the Revisionists in this was
   to discourage private confession and absolution by providing through
   the public ministration of daily service the benefits which had been
   sought hitherto from the priest singly and alone.

   At the same time the "Alleluia," which had been sung from Easter to
   Trinity before the "Venite," and which had become most closely
   associated in the minds of the people with that joyful season, was
   omitted.

   Alternative Canticles.

   The use of the "Te Deum" and the "Benedicite" had varied largely in the
   Church services. In the Sarum Breviary the latter was to be substituted
   for the former both in Advent and from Septuagesima Sunday to Easter;
   in the First Prayer-book in Lent only. Henceforward it was made a
   simple alternative for it, and in a similar manner was the "Jubilate"
   for the "Benedictus," the "Cantate" for the "Magnificat," and the "Deus
   misereatur" for the "Nunc dimittis." In the first instance the
   intention was probably to allow of greater freedom in using the
   "Benedicite," which before had been confined to a definite season. On
   the score of ancient usage the claims of the two are equal: for if the
   "Te Deum" be regarded as a development of the hymn which the early
   Christians in Pliny's time sang "to Christ as GOD," we have on the
   other hand the testimony of St. Chrysostom to the fact that the
   "Benedicite" had been sung from the beginning "everywhere throughout
   the world." In point of propriety the one is the hymn of the Church,
   the other the song of the universe; while then the former is more
   adapted for general use, the latter may be fitly substituted on
   numerous occasions, when the blessings of creation are brought
   prominently forward, and for this reason its relegation to Lent was a
   patent inconvenience.

   In the case of the "Jubilate," the obvious intention was that it should
   only be substituted for the "Benedictus" on the occasions when the
   latter occurred elsewhere in the service, though this has been
   completely frustrated, and the special hymn has for the most part
   superseded the general. For obvious reasons this supersession is much
   to be deprecated. What influences led the Revisionists to offer the
   "Deus misereatur" for the "Nunc dimittis" we have no means of
   determining, but in the case of the "Cantate" for the "Magnificat"
   their motive was unmistakable. It was a needless compliance with the
   unreasonable objections of the Puritans, who did not scruple to banish
   from its time-honoured [113] position one of the very noblest
   outpourings of inspired song, to gratify their aversion to everything
   which expressed the slightest reverence for the Mother of our LORD.

   The Incarnation was the special idea embodied in the ancient Vespers,
   and it was very forcibly expressed in the thankful acknowledgment alike
   of the Blessed Virgin and of the aged Simeon. To attempt, therefore, to
   supersede their Canticles tended to break the continuity which the
   First Revisionists had been so careful to preserve.

   The Athanasian Creed.

   In the First Prayer-book the Athanasian Creed was directed to be
   recited on the six great Festivals of Christmas, Epiphany, Easter,
   Ascension, Whitsunday, and Trinity. At the Second Revision seven
   Saints' Days were added, the selection being made, so as to provide for
   its being said, as nearly as possible, once a month.

   Touching the Litany, Creed, etc.

   The limitation of the use of the Litany to the penitential days of the
   week was withdrawn, as also the permission to omit the Litany, "Gloria
   in excelsis," Creed, Homily and Exhortation to Holy Communion, if there
   was to be a sermon, or for other causes which were considered
   important.

   The wish of the Revisionists to enforce the Litany on all Sundays is
   quite intelligible, when read in the light of their austere and gloomy
   views of Sabbath observance; and though we may regret the course they
   adopted in regard to this, they deserve all praise for refusing to
   sanction the omission of the Creed and the "Gloria in excelsis." It is
   true we cannot trace the recitation of a creed in the Liturgy without
   interruption from primitive times, but it is obviously most desirable
   that every safeguard against heresy should be taken in celebrating the
   great Mysteries; neither is it wise to curtail that which helped to
   express our thanksgiving, and make the service a "sacrifice of praise."

   Divers rites and ceremonies in the baptismal office discontiuned.

   In the Baptismal office the following rites and ceremonies were
   abolished: viz., the trine immersion, the anointing with oil, the
   signing the breast with the mark of the Cross, the form of exorcism in
   which the priest commanded the unclean spirit to come out and no more
   exercise tyranny over the infants whom Christ was calling to be of the
   number of his flock, and the investiture of the newly-baptized with the
   Chrisom, [114] as the priest said "Take this white vesture for a token
   of the innocency, which by GOD's grace in this holy sacrament of
   baptism is given unto thee; and for a sign whereby thou art admonished,
   so long as thou livest, to give thyself to innocency of living, that
   after this transitory life, thou mayest be partaker of the life
   everlasting." At the same time the custom of the sponsors laying their
   hands upon the child preparatory to this ceremony was given up, as well
   as the dedication of the Chrisom by the mother when she presented
   herself in Church at her purification.

   Some of these ceremonies may have been fitly removed, some might be now
   recovered with advantage. What, for instance, could be more appropriate
   than the triple affusion accompanying the utterance of the triple Name
   of the Triune GOD?

   And amongst ignorant people, who, as all experience proves, are taught
   most easily by signs and pictures, is it possible to conceive of
   anything more instructive of the whole teaching of Holy Baptism, than
   the immediate investiture of the newly-baptized in a robe of spotless
   purity?

   An important addition was made by the intro- duction of the five
   prayers: "O merciful GOD, grant that the old Adam," etc., of the form
   of reception into "the congregation of Christ's flock," and of the
   declaration of the child's regeneration, "Seeing now," etc., together
   with the thanksgiving for the same, "We yield Thee hearty thanks," etc.

   The Confirmation Service.

   In Confirmation the rubric [115] was withdrawn directing the Bishop to
   "cross them in the forehead," and the beautiful prayer "Defend, O LORD,
   this thy child," etc., substituted for another [116] referring to "the
   sign" as well as the unction of the Holy Ghost.

   The Matrimonial Office.

   In Matrimony the sign of the Cross hitherto made when the priest
   blessed the man and the woman was omitted, and a reference to the
   apocryphal mission of the Angel Raphael to "Thobie and Sara" gave place
   to that of a Scriptural fact, viz., the blessing of GOD upon Abraham
   and Sarah.

   Changes in the Office for the Visitation of the Sick.

   In the Visitation, and the Communion of the Sick, the ancient rite of
   anointing with oil was no longer mentioned. The rubric provithng that
   the form of absolution used in this service should be available for all
   private confessions was erased; and the liberty of reserving the
   Blessed Sacrament from an open Communion celebrated on the same day, or
   from a Celebration in one sick-room for Communion in another, was
   withdrawn.

   No doubt abuses had sprung up in connexion with the practice of
   reservation, but now that there is little probability of their breaking
   out afresh, a return to primitive custom might be allowed, and with
   every prospect of affording relief to the clergy and benefit to the
   sick. Instances of wide-spread sickness and mortality arising from some
   special cause must be within the experience of most parish priests,
   where they have had no alternative but to transgress the existing law,
   or leave men to die without the Food of eternal life.

   In the Burial Service.

   In the Order for the Burial of the dead, the service was robbed of its
   most comforting element when, as touching prayer for the departed, the
   mourners' lips were sealed, and not even a pious aspiration was allowed
   to relieve a stricken and sorrowful heart. Prayers for the Dead
   discountenanced in the Burial Service. Two special forms for commending
   the soul into the hands of the merciful GOD were altogether expunged
   from the Office, and a prayer that the sins which the departed bad
   committed might not be imputed to him, was turned into a thanksgiving
   that he had been delivered out of the miseries of this sinful world;
   and further a petition for our perfect consummation and bliss was
   couched in such ambiguous phrase that it is impossible to say whether
   it comprehends the dead as well as the living, or not.

   The intention of the framers of it, judging from their general course
   of action, most likely was to pray for the latter alone; but their
   language was providentially so ordered that pious men in every
   generation since have been able to use it with larger views and in a
   more Catholic spirit.

   And here I may be pardoned if I dwell awhile, because the action of the
   Foreign Reformers in this matter has not only left a most lamentable
   blot on the Book, but illustrates very clearly the principles by which
   they were guided. Their boast was that they cared little for antiquity,
   and had no reverence for the past the guidance to which they trusted
   was that of private judgment which many of them came at last to believe
   in as infallible.

   For fourteen or fifteen centuries, prayers had been offered for those
   who died in the LORD: there was not a Liturgy [117] from the very
   beginning, either in the East or the West, which did not contain such
   petitions, and yet in the face of this usage, the unbroken usage of the
   Church universal, because the Catholic belief in the intermediate state
   had been confounded with the errors of Purgatory, they paraded their
   pernicious rule, "the abuse is a sufficient reason for the disuse," and
   disallowed in their cold and loveless creed even thanksgiving for the
   good example of a departed saint.

   The Holy Eucharist no longer ordered.

   From the earliest times a celebration of the Holy Eucharist had been
   associated with the burial of the dead, and the Revisionists of 1549
   A.D. made full provision for a continuance of the custom. When their
   successors in 1552 A.D. omitted the Introit, Collect, Epistle and
   Gospel appointed for the Service, thereby discountenancing a
   Celebration, they left a void in our Prayer-book for which nothing but
   its full restoration can ever supply adequate consolation.

   The Psalms altered.

   In this Revision Psalms 116, 136, and 146, which were said in the First
   Prayer-book either before or after the burial of the corpse, were dropt
   out.

   One object observable throughout appears to have been a desire to
   curtail the service as far as possible; a desire which developed in
   their successors to such an extent that in the next century Bishop
   Cosin [118] testifies that "they would have no minister to bury their
   dead, but the corpse to be brought to the grave and there put in by the
   clerk, or some other honest neighbour, and so back again without any
   more ado; "and Hooker [119] laments the miserable days in which an
   orderly burial service was deemed "unmeet, undecent, and unfit for
   Christianity."

   Changes in the Communion Office.

   When we open the Communion Office we are confronted by the same
   reckless indifference to Catholic doctrine and practice, and an
   ever-widening divergence from the lines laid down by the first
   Revisionists.

   The title was changed from "The Supper of the LORD and the Holy
   Communion, commonly called the Mass," into "The order for the
   administration of the LORD's Supper or the Holy Communion." And here we
   cannot but commend them at least in part for the alteration.

   "Mass," [120] as most of us are aware, was derived from the Latin
   missa, in the formula "ite, missa est"--"Depart, it is the dismissal,"
   at the utterance of which words the congregation left the Church. Now
   on the grounds that the designation is not Scriptural nor primitive nor
   significant, the action of the Revisionists in discontinuing it finds
   full and ample justification. We think they would have shown further
   discretion if they had eliminated also the title of "the LORD's
   Supper." It is supposed to rest on the authority of St. Paul, "When ye
   come together into one place, this is not to eat the LORD's Supper,"
   [121] but a careful examination of the passage leads to the conclusion
   that the Apostle there applies it to the Agape or Love-feast in
   combination with the Holy Eucharist, not to the latter considered by
   itself. Indeed, had this not been so, the extreme rarity of the
   designation among the early Fathers [122] would be quite unaccountable.
   Not till the latter half of the fourth century is it adopted by any
   writer; and it is worth mentioning that at two of the early Councils,
   [123] the title is distinctly appropriated for another Feast. The
   language is, "One day in the year in which the LORD's Supper is
   celebrated," where it refers not to the Holy Communion, but to a
   commemorative Feast on Maundy Thursday evening in imitation of our
   Lord's Last Supper with His disciples preceding the institution of the
   Eucharist. Apart then from the uncertainty of its usage in Scripture
   and its extreme rarity in Patristic literature, it might well have
   yielded to titles with better claims and with no tendency to create
   confusion. [124]

   In the Exhortation read at the time of the Celebration the passage in
   which a blasphemer, adulterer, and any one guilty of grievous crime was
   exhorted not to Come to the Holy Table before he had bewailed his sins,
   was transposed and inserted in the exhortation to be read on the Sunday
   or holy day preceding. The propriety of this change is patent, "For,"
   writies Bishop Cosin, [125] "is any person who comes at that time
   purposely to receive the Communion likely to discover himself (if he be
   guilty) in the presence of all the congregation by rising up and
   suddenly departing from it?"

   Omissions.

   There is a long array of omissions, as was naturally to be expected.

   Besides some especially significant, to be considered presently, the
   following are to be noticed :-- The Introits, which were the shorter
   Psalms or portions of the 119th selected one for each Sunday or holy
   day, and sung immediately before the Collect and Epistle. It has been
   conjectured that they were omitted with a view to the substitution of
   the metrical version, [126] which was partly composed by Sternhold at
   this time, but the speedy discontinuance of the Prayer-book at the
   accession of Queen Mary prevented them carrying out their intentions.

   A second Service for Celebration on Christmas Day and Easter was erased
   from the Book.

   The concluding paragraph of the Exhortation, following the direction
   for such as were troubled in conscience to resort to the priest "for
   comfort and absolution," previously ran thus: "requiring such as shall
   be satisfied with a general confession, not to be offended with them
   that do use, to their further satisfying, the auricular and secret
   confession to the priest; nor those also which think needful or
   convenient, for the quietness of their own consciences, particularly to
   open their sins to the priest, to be offended with them that are
   satisfied with their humble confession to GOD and the general
   confession to the church. But in all things to follow and keep the rule
   of charity, and every man to be satisfied with his own conscience, not
   judging other men's minds or consciences; whereas he hath no warrant of
   GOD's word to the same."

   Few persons, who recognise the real teaching of the Church upon
   Confession and Absolution, can fail to regret that such valuable
   counsel should have been removed. In opposition to the Roman view it
   distinctly repudiates the necessity of private confession, by implying
   that in principle there is no advantage in private over public
   absolution: as one of the most eminent of our bishops writes to his
   clergy: [127] "Any one who is sincerely penitent, even in the largest
   congregation, will receive as the absolving words are uttered,
   precisely the same benefit as if he knelt before the priest singly and
   alone." . . . "He may die without having ever made a private
   confession, and yet he may have passed again and again with fulness of
   effect under the keys of the kingdom." But at the same time it
   distinctly admits full liberty of conscience to have recourse to this
   special ordinance of the Church in time of need.

   In the "Prayer for the whole state of Christ's Church," all reference
   to the dead was left out, and thus the immemorial practice of
   remembering in the Eucharist those who had departed in the faith was
   disregarded.

   A few others of more or less importance require notice: such as the
   withdrawal of the rubric directing the minister to put to the wine "a
   little pure and clean water." No reason was assigned for this, nor can
   any be conjectured. The custom of admixture was a natural one, if it be
   true, as most Jewish authorities maintain, that it was the habit of the
   Jews generally to dilute their wine with water; and so we find the
   practice almost universal in the Primitive Church. [128] It continues
   in the Eastern and Roman Churches, and as it is impossible to find in
   it any doctrinal symbolism of dangerous or doubtful import, and as many
   leading Divines [129] since the Reformation have not hesitated to
   consecrate "the mixed Chalice," it is to be regretted on Vincentian
   principles that the rubric should have been erased.

   Two other less important directions were omitted: one that at the
   administration the Bread should be "unleavened and round" in shape: the
   other that it should be placed in the mouth of the Communicant at the
   priest's hands.

   Additions.

   We next consider two additions to the Service, viz.: the Decalogue and
   the Second Exhortation.

   The Revisionists desired to introduce some rule or standard for
   self-examination before communicating, in view of St. Paul's direction,
   "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink
   of that cup." The Decalogue probably suggested itself to them from the
   existing practice of reading and expounding it during this service from
   time to time.

   It was a happy thought which prompted them to take the Kyries, which in
   the First Prayer-book were repeated nine times at this part of the
   service, and with the addition of another, adapt them as ten responsory
   petitions for the ten commandments.

   Whether it would have been more in harmony with the highest Christian
   service to have introduced the standard of self-examination from
   Christ's commentary in the Sermon on the Mount, rather than the stern
   formula of the Jewish code itself, may be an open question. The
   American Liturgy supplements it by St. Matt. xxii. 37-40, and the
   Scotch Liturgy directs the people to "the mystical importance" of the
   commands, as well as "the letter."

   The second addition was an Exhortation for occasional use when the
   Curate found the people "negligent to come to the Holy Communion." From
   1552 A.D. to 1662 A.D. the following passage occurred in it; "And
   whereas ye offend GOD so sore in refusing this holy banquet, I
   admonish, exhort, and beseech you that unto this unkindness ye will not
   add any more; which thing ye shall do if ye stand by as gazers and
   lookers on them that do communicate, and be no partaker of the same
   yourselves. For what thing can this be accounted else than a further
   contempt and unkindness unto God? Truly it is a great unthankfulness to
   say nay, when ye be called; but the fault is much greater when men
   stand by and yet will neither eat nor drink this Holy Communion with
   others. I pray you, what can this be else but even to have the
   mysteries of Christ in derision? It is said unto all, Take ye and eat:
   take and drink ye all of this; Do this in remembrance of Me. With what
   face then, and with what countenance shall ye hear these words? What
   will this be but a neglecting, a despising and mocking of the testament
   of Christ? Wherefore rather than ye should do so, depart you hence and
   give place to them that be godly disposed. But when you depart, I
   beseech you, ponder with yourselves from whom ye depart. Ye depart from
   the LORD'S Table, ye depart from your brethren, and from the banquet of
   most heavenly food."

   This was what Cosin calls a "religious invective" against the principle
   of solitary Masses in which the priest alone communicated. It has in
   disregard of its true purpose been mixed up with the modern
   controversies on the legitimacy of "non-communicating attendance."

   Neither in its introduction in 1552 A.D. was it intended to discourage
   anything as practised in the present day; nor in its subsequent
   withdrawal was it designed to sanction it. An examination of its
   language will show that it is wholly irrelevant to the case. The
   Revisionists had in their mind irreligious men who never communicated,
   and therefore profaned the service by an irreverent presence, for they
   contrast them with "the godly disposed." With such they are certainly
   not to be confounded, who, being frequent communicants, and realising
   fully that the greatest value of the ordinance lies in participation,
   are unwilling to forego a lesser blessing, if they have already
   partaken on the same day, or from some cause are unprepared for it.

   But we pass to matters of greater moment.

   The sacrificial aspect obscured.

   In this revised Service, the Sacrificial aspect was greatly obscured by
   that of Communion. Sacrificial terms were for the most part suppressed:
   sacerdotal vestments forbidden: the position of the altar was changed,
   and the arrangement of important parts of the service disturbed.
   Everything, in short, was done, as the Revisionists fondly hoped, to
   dissociate the mind of the worshipper from all thoughts of oblation or
   sacrifice.

   The direction was cancelled which ordered that at the appointed time
   the Celebrant should "put upon him a plain alb or surplice, with a
   vestment or cope," which, whether invariably so from the beginning or
   not, was unquestionably and universally associated at this time with
   the idea of sacrifice. The term "Altar," which was the correlative of
   sacrifice, was erased from this and every other rubric, and Table or
   Holy Table substituted. The most honourable place occupied by the Altar
   all through the Church's history was left vacant, and the Table brought
   down to the body of the Church, and as a necessary consequence regarded
   simply as a Board from which holy Food was distributed, and nothing
   more.

   The Celebrant who had stood "humbly afore the midst of the Altar" was
   directed to stand "at the north side of the Table."

   And lastly, a displacement [130] of the Prayer of Oblation was
   effected. It had long been inseparably united with the Act of
   Consecration by which the Bread and Wine were declared to be the Body
   that was broken and the Blood which was shed; but by disconnecting
   them, and placing the prayer after the consumption of the consecrated
   elements, the idea of offering these to the Father as a commemorative
   Oblation of Christ's Blessed Body and Blood was cast into the shade.
   Not content with emptying the words of their obvious force by the
   change of position, the Revisionists went further and made its entire
   omission possible by allowing the Thanksgiving Prayer to be used as an
   alternative. This was a direct breach of Catholic usage.

   To pass on, they were no less anxious to discountenance the doctrine of
   the Real Presence.

   Four things especially betray their design.

   The doctrine of the Real Presence discountenanced in divers ways.

   The discontinuance of the Invocation of the Holy Ghost upon the
   Elements, and of the singing of the "Agnus Dei;" the substitution of
   the second clause, "Take and eat this," . . . and "Drink this" . . .
   for the first, "The Body of Our LORD," etc. . . . "The Blood of our
   Lord," etc.; . . . an lastly, the insertion of the "Black Rubric" or
   "Declaration of Kneeling :" upon each of these it will be necessary to
   dwell.

   In almost every Primitive Liturgy [131] there had been a distinct
   prayer that the Spirit of GOD would sanctify the Elements that they
   might become the Blessed Body and Blood of Christ. To eliminate this
   then was break away from Catholic usage as well as to ignore the
   immediate action of the Holy Ghost, which is the great vivifying Agent
   in holy things.

   And here we would observe that this is happily recognised in the
   administration of the other great Sacrament, the operation of the holy
   Spirit being mentioned no less than three times in the opening of the
   Service.

   The Agnus Dei.

   With the discontinuance of the "Agnus Dei," beautiful as it is, we can
   find no fault if we are satisfied not to overstep the paths of
   Primitive Antiquity. It had no place in the early Liturgies or
   Sacramentaries, and was probably not introduced in England till the
   times of Ælfric, in the middle of the tenth century, nor much earlier
   in any foreign Churches.

   The formula of distribution.

   The Form of Words previously used at the distribution of the Elements
   was deliberately abandoned in violation of an almost uniform tradition
   from the beginning. However far we go back we trace an inseparable
   connexion not only in idea, but in expression, between the Bread and
   the Body--the Wine and the Blood. Often when the Priest gave the
   Sacramental Elements he simply said, "The Body of our LORD Jesus
   Christ," "The Blood, etc.," and the Communicant indicated his assent or
   his desire for its realisation by adding "Amen."

   In the Sarum Missal the Formula had expanded into "The Body of our LORD
   Jesus Christ keep thy soul unto eternal life," Amen; and the same had
   been unhesitatingly adopted in the First Prayer-book. But when the
   second Revisionists approached it with the knowledge that it admitted
   of only one interpretation, viz., that the Body of Christ was given in
   the Sacrament, they determined to eliminate it altogether and
   substitute another which would give no countenance to the belief of
   those who maintained that the words of the institution, "This is my
   Body," were more than a mere figure of speech.

   The last of the four was the "Declaration of Kneeling," in which it was
   asserted that that posture did not indicate that any adoration was
   offered unto the Sacramental Elements or to any "Real and Essential
   Presence" of Christ's natural Body. The words "Real and Essential" are
   to be noted, because they are no longer in the Rubric, having yielded
   to "Corporal" at the final Revision. The history of this Rubric [132]
   affords sufficient evidence that its introduction was intended as a
   concession to pacify the foreigners, who never ceased to characterise
   kneeling to communicate as a superstitious and idolatrous act.

   Now the above is a long and heavy bill of indictment against the Second
   Revisionists for departure from Catholic doctrine.

   Suggested explanations of the principles adopted.

   Can anything be urged generally in mitigation of the verdict which the
   Catholic mind is impatient to pronounce? Apologists [133] here and
   there have argued in their defence, that they did riot in reality
   intend to abandon the doctrines and usages which they appeared to
   supersede: that many of the changes were made with the view of bringing
   into prominence principles which had been thrust out of sight to the
   great loss and injury of the Church in mediæval times and at the first
   Revision. "Altar," for instance, was not withdrawn, as intimating a
   denial that what was offered thereon was in some sense sacrificial, but
   "Table" was substituted because the predominance of the Sacrificial
   aspect had completely obscured the other side of Eucharistic teaching,
   viz., the Communion of the Blessed Body and Blood. Again, touching the
   words of administration and "the Black Rubric," the First Book, they
   say, had affirmed what the Elements were--the Second Book aimed at
   explaining what they were not.

   It is a very plausible defence, and finds some support in the official
   statements of the Revisionists themselves.

   In the Act of Uniformity which gave legal force to their Revision they
   stated upon what grounds they had entered upon the work, and what their
   general opinion was of the Book they superseded.

   The Revision had been necessitated, they said, because "divers doubts
   had risen for the fashion and ministration" [134] of the services,
   which proceeded "rather by the curiosity of the minister and mistakers
   than of any worthy cause."

   And the First Prayer-book the Statute declared to be "a very godly
   order, agreeable to the Word of God and the Primitive Church, very
   comfortable to all good people desiring to live in Christian
   conversation, and most profitable to the estate of this realm." [135]

   These statements seem well-nigh inexplicable on any other theory than
   that which the Apologists have set forth, viz., that the Revisionists,
   had not really wished to renounce in any essential matters the teaching
   of the First Prayer-book. But if we could bring ourselves to accept it,
   we should still have to hold them up to rebuke for the weakness of
   their judgment and a strange ignorance of the ways of the world. It
   saves them from Scylla to plunge them into Charybdis.

   The difficulty of accepting the explanation.

   The way to supplement is not to begin by taking away; and to remove one
   word or usage and replace it by another is substitution, not addition.
   If a particular phraseology, ever connected with one set of ideas, was
   ousted by another phraseology which had always been used to clothe
   ideas of a totally different order, no amount, of side-notes, still
   less general assertions, in a Statute, bound up at its first
   publication with the Service-book, but disconnected from it for ever
   afterwards, could insure later generations from the danger of being
   misled.

   It seems difficult to acquit the Revisionists of hypocrisy or
   infatuation. He who best understands the times and circumstances will
   be best fitted to decide whether they had desired in their hearts to
   revolutionise the worship of the Church, and were too cowardly to own
   it, or whether they had only aimed at developing obliterated features,
   but had proved by their bungling their incompetence for the task; and
   it will be a matter of no little surprise if the verdict is not, that
   they were guilty of insincerity rather than mismanagement.

   Their conduct expained by their views.

   The study of their lives and opinions forces upon us the conviction
   that their object was to eradicate the ancient Catholic doctrines; and
   we may be thankful that though they were able to prosecute their end in
   so far as they succeeded in eliminating the most salient features, the
   principles were too firmly embedded in the whole framework of the
   Liturgical Office to be rooted out by their action.

   Their aims defeated.

   The reverent student will trace with satisfaction the over-ruling
   influence of GOD's good Spirit frustrating their designs, and leaving
   them so far hopelessly baffled, that at the final Revision, the Church
   was able solemnly to declare that the true Eucharistic doctrine had
   remained essentially unchanged from the, first Revision to the last.

   The judgment of the Church upon this.

   In the Preface to the Prayer-book of 1662 A.D., which is now in use,
   the Revisionists expressed their conviction of this in unhesitating
   language. "We find, that in the Reigns of several Princes of blessed
   memory since the Reformation, the Church, upon just and weighty
   considerations her thereunto moving, hath yielded to make such
   alterations in some particulars, as in their respective times were
   thought convenient: Yet so, as that the main Body and Essentials of it,
   as well in the chiefest materials, as in the frame and order thereof,
   have still continued the same unto this day and do yet stand firm and
   unshaken." It is impossible to exaggerate the weight of this
   declaration, which we must never forget is "the assertion not of
   individual theologians, but the deliberate pronouncement of the Church
   speaking for herself." [136]

   expressed in one of his letters thus--"If it shall be thought I can he

   [85] The Reformation in Germany was not supported by any Bishop. None
   but priests joined Luther, and he was obliged, by the force of
   circumstances, either to abandon his design, or to admit the novel
   ordination of priests by the laying on of hands of the priests alone.
   He chose the latter course. The Augsburg Confession shows that a true
   sacramental system was retained with true priests to administer it for
   a time, but without the means of transmitting the power. Calvin's
   Reformation began on lower grounds still. The Helvetic Confession
   maintained that Christ is the sole priest, except so far as laymen may
   be regarded as priests. He instituted a new order. Cf. CARTER on the
   Doctr. of the Priesthood, c. iv. p. 24.

   [86] Ranke, the historian, in contrasting Luther and Zwingli, shows
   how, while the former desired to retain everything that was not at
   variance with the express teaching of Scripture, the latter, determined
   to abolish everything which could not be supported by Scripture

   [124] The earliest title was most probably "the Breaking of the Bread,"

   should bid Eucharists to be offered on behalf of such a king as Nero,
   and equally improbable that he should exhort to give thanks for him.
   Ignatius uses it, Ep. ad Philadeiph. c. iv., ad Smyrn. c. vii. viii.
   Many others also use it, Justin Martyr, Ireænus, Clemens Alexandrinus,
   Origen, and it is worthy of notice that it become so common that the
   word was Latinised and Syriacised: cf. TERTULLIAN, de Cor. Mil. c. iii.
   and the Syriac Version of Acts ii. 42 and 46. "The Communion," which
   St. Paul used, was some considerable time before it was popularly
   adopted. Many of the references often given are inapplicable,
   indicating Church-fellowship and privileges rather than the Holy
   Eucharist. Having, however, Scriptural authority, and being at the same
   time especially appropriate in meaning, it may well be accepted as a
   suitable designation for the Sacred Feast.

   [130] At the same time the short Exhortation, the Confession, the
   Absolution, the comfortable words, and the Prayer of Humble access, all
   of which had followed the Consecration, were now placed before it.

   [131] In the Liturgy of St. James (Greek) the prayer is, "Send, O LORD,
   upon us and upon these Thy gifts set forth Thy all-holy Spirit the LORD
   and the Life-giver . . . that He may make this Bread the Holy Body of
   Thy Christ and this Cup the precious Blood of Thy Christ." Cf.

   repeated in that of St. Mark, ib. p. 187, also in that of St. Basil,
   ib. p. 114. The Invocation is found in a shorter form in many of the
   Western Liturgies, e.g. the Gallican and Mozarabic. That which the
   Revisionists of 1552 AD, eliminated ran thus:--"And with Thy Holy
   Spirit and word vouchsafe to bless and sanctify these Thy gifts and
   creatures of Bread and Wine, that they may be unto us the Body and
   Blood of Thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ." It is retained with
   verbal alterations in the Scotch and American Prayer-books. It has been
   held of such importance that the Eastern Church ascribes the
   Consecration to this.

   [132] The Act of Uniformity passed on April 6th, 1552 A.D., and fixed
   All Saints' Day, November 1st, as the date upon which the Revised Book
   was to come into use. On October 27th a Declaration "touching the
   kneeling at the receiving of the Holy Communion" was forwarded by the
   Privy Council to the Lord Chancellor for insertion in the New Book. The
   only authority it had was the King's signature. It is supposed to have
   been compiled by Cranmer, who, as well as the King, was yielding more
   and more every day to the influence of the Foreign Reformers. At the
   Elizabethan Revision it was treated as an illegal interpolation, and
   ignored. Its reintroduction at the Final Revision was due to the
   influence of Gauden and Morley. The Bishops, however, having carefully
   guarded the Catholic doctrine by a change of language, do not appear to
   have resisted the concession to the Presbyterians, who expressed their
   conviction that "the Church of England is for transubstantiation
   because of our kneeling."

  CHAPTER III: The Elizabethan Reaction

   When King Edward breathed his last the Reformed Worship of the English
   Church hung for a moment in the balance.

   The prospects on the accession of Queen Mary.

   "No compulsion of her subjects in the matter of religion" was the
   promise by which Mary gained supporters in Norfolk and Suffolk against
   her rival for the throne; and her words were taken up and repeated in
   every part of the kingdom. And when she entered the Tower and lifted
   the imprisoned Gardiner [137] from his knees, and let him go free, it
   was, she might have urged, one fulfilment of her promise, but it was
   interpreted very differently. Anglican and Protestant began to tremble
   for their faith; and as soon as her Crown was secure she threw off the
   disguise. A dagger launched by some fiery zealot against a preacher
   [138] at St. Paul's Cross, who divining his mistress's mood inveighed
   against the Prayer-book, was the signal for decisive measures to begin.
   Cranmer was confined within the walls of his Palace, Ridley was
   committed to the Tower, Cox was shut up in a cell in the Marshalsea,
   from which Bonner was released, and many others [139] were imprisoned.
   In Canterbury Cathedral the suffragan Bishop, seizing the advantage of
   the Primate's confinement, stopped the legal service, and with all the
   pomp and circumstance of the Roman Ritual restored the Mass : and from
   this beginning the old use regained its position step by step till the
   last vestige of opposition, that of the Legislature itself, entirely
   disappeared. The Houses of Parliament, with scarcely a dissentient
   voice, passed a vote of repentance for their schism, and after
   receiving, in behalf of the nation, absolution from the Papal legate on
   their bended knees, they heard the proclamation read, that England had
   entered again into union with Rome. For four years no language of
   prayer and praise but that which spoke in the Breviary and Missal was
   ever heard in the Churches.The Reaction upon her death. But Mary died,
   and Elizabeth reigned: and a fresh epoch in the religion and worship of
   the Church began. Never in the world's history was a movement initiated
   under more difficult circumstances than the Elizabethan Reaction. It
   was well for England that the Sovereign, who was to guide it, was
   possessed of an unconquerable will and a tenacity of purpose rarely
   equalled, perhaps never surpassed.

   The difficulties by which Queen Elizabeth was confronted.

   Let us look awhile at the difficulties by which she was confronted when
   she resolved, as she did in heart from the beginning, to re-establish
   the Reformed Worship of the Catholic Church, unimpaired if possible
   alike by Papal and Puritan innovations.

   The clergy of the country were pledged to Rome; the posts of dignity
   and influence from Bishopric to Prebend were filled, with rare
   exceptions, by men who were intensely Roman; the Parish priests were
   the same, in a less degree no doubt, but in over- whelming majority,
   for the vigilant eye of Bonner had promoted none that were lukewarm,
   and spared from deprivation few that were disaffected. Here then was
   one obstacle of appalling magnitude.

   And there was a second hardly less formidable. For Edward it would have
   been trivial: for Elizabeth it was overwhelming. The one would have
   seized it and made it a vantage ground: the other would be satisfied
   with nothing short of victory over it, or at least in spite of it.From
   the exiled clergy. This was the Puritan Party which long banishment
   [140] and depression had embittered, and which now the prospect of
   release made buoyant with hope and eager for reascendancy.

   When Mary declared herse1f for the Roman Faith, and the Second
   Prayer-book was suspended, all who held views that were decidedly
   Protestant determined to escape from the intolerance which threatened
   them at home. An exodus to the Continent took place of some hundreds of
   the clergy, and Strasburg and Frankfort, Zurich and Geneva became for
   the English, what London had been a few years before, when it afforded
   a sanctuary from the Inquisition of Charles V. and the Papal Interim.
   And many of the exiles were seized at once with a spirit of
   unrestrained freedom. Calvin, who at Frankfort was looked upon as an
   oracle, denounced the English Prayer-book, and his denunciation
   produced a powerful effect. Knox, the fiery revolutionist in Church
   government, placed himself at the head of those who wished to shako
   themselves free from the forms and ceremonies to which they had been
   tied. Thus a party was created of what we may call ultra-Protestants.
   [141] A few held out vigorously against these democratic innovations,
   under the leadership of Cox, and for a time they succeeded in
   preserving the English ritual in its integrity, but time and
   circumstances told upon them. Living as exiles in want and penury, they
   found that they had little to spend on vestments and ornaments, on the
   luxuries and beauty of an elaborate worship, and indifference to
   externals crept in, and the laxity of rule and discipline of their
   neighbours had its effect upon them and made them impatient of order.
   And so it came about that when they returned to England, even the
   bareness of worship which the close of Edward's reign had encouraged
   was made barer still by Genevan and Frankfort usage.

   Confronted by these, what was the Queen to do? She was determined to
   overthrow the Roman worship, because with all the pomp and ceremonial
   which she loved, it involved doctrines which she (lisbeheved, and she
   shrank from an alliance with the power which would have made the task
   so easy, because her nature rebelled instinctively against the
   unattractive nakedness of Puritanical worship.

   There was yet a third party, albeit apparently a small one, with which
   she decided to identify herself.

   The Anglican Party.

   When the Romanists came in, the Protestants fled; but there were some
   who dreaded the association of the foreign Churches more than contact
   with Rome, and they determined to remain in England, some of them
   conforming to the Roman worship, and retaining their posts, others,
   whose consciences were more tender, resigning their livings and
   retiring into privacy, contented to bide their time and hope for better
   days. With this third party, the less violent portion of the exiles,
   who had clung to the Prayer-book through all their vicissitudes, were
   practically united on their return. It was reinforced too no doubt by
   the adherence of numbers of the laity, for this is the only explanation
   of the conduct of the representatives of the people, in the Houses of
   Parliament, when they were called upon to declare their opinion on the
   Acts of Uniformity.

   The Queen's doctrinal views.

   It will be well to ascertain as clearly as possible what the Queen's
   doctrinal views really were, at the time when she was called upon to
   assume the direction of affairs. There can, I think, be little question
   that they underwent considerable modification in her later years, and
   it has been a common practice to lose sight of this and to speak of her
   as though she had held in the beginning the faith and opinions in which
   she died. Every surrounding had tended to lower the standard. Of the
   Bishops of her reign Parker was the nearest in sympathy, but with none
   of the Queen's enthusiasm and ever ready to make concessions. Of her
   councillors Cecil was most faithful to her wishes, but in the
   maintenance of Catholic faith and worship only a half-hearted minister;
   while Essex was an avowed patron of nonconformity, and Leicester, "the
   wicked Earl," seemed to have been born for the destruction of the
   Church. Such a combination of evil influences could hardly fail to
   affect her.

   At the beginning of her reign she was distinctly Catholic in the true
   and proper sense of the term: and we shall see how she succeeded in
   more ways than one in stamping her Catholicity upon the revised Liturgy
   which was shortly put forth. And this point can hardly be too carefully
   considered or too clearly established, because it must have a most
   important bearing upon the "Vestiarian Controversy," and the right
   interpretation of the disputed Advertisements.

   In proclaiming her title she designated herself "of the true and
   ancient and Catholic faith." When the adoption of a Prayer-book was
   mooted, she expressed a strong predilection in favour of the First of
   Edward VI. She had long been a student of patristic lore and the early
   history of the Church, and it had created in her an intense love for
   antiquity and reverence for old and time-honoured rites and
   observances.

   Her views upon the crucial point of the Presence of Christ in the Holy
   Eucharist she was known to have expressed with a caution and reverence
   which might well be imitated.


   " 'Twas GOD the Word that spake it,

   He took the Bread and brake it,

   And what the Word did make it,

   That I believe and take it." [142]

   And once when the preacher in the Royal Chapel confessed with reverence
   and becoming humility the mystery of the Real Presence in the Blessed
   Sacrament, she expressed her satisfaction by giving thanks to him
   openly for his pains and piety at the conclusion of the service. [143]

   And when de Feria, [144] Philip's ambassador, pressed her to explain
   the doctrines which her people would be expected to believe, she
   assured him that "she held that GOD was really present in the
   Sacrament," though she was not prepared to accept the teaching of the
   Roman Catholics upon the manner of His Presence. All this shows very
   plainly the bent of her mind.

   Accused of Roman tendencies.

   The Puritans made a perpetual grievance of her allowing the Crucifix
   and Lights to remain on the altar in her chapel, [145] and Dean Nowell,
   when preaching before her in Lent, took occasion to speak by the way
   with little reverence of the symbol of the Cross; whereupon Her Majesty
   called to him from her closet window "to retire from that ungodly
   digression and return to his text." [146] The figure of the Crucified
   nailed to the Cross had become an object of intense aversion, but
   sober-minded judges would deem it an extreme measure to condemn her for
   Roman tendencies in using it, especially if her own avowed objections
   are allowed their legitimate weight.

   It is true that in selecting her Privy Council she retained a number of
   statesmen who had served the same office to Queen Mary, [147] but she
   was actuated herein by prudential motives which admit of ample
   justification; and she was careful to provide against an undue
   preponderance of influence by the addition of others [148] of very
   different views and policy. Again, she has been blamed for continuing
   to attend the Celebration of the Mass far longer than was necessary
   after her accession, but she exercised a wise discretion in determining
   to feel her way cautiously and avoid irritating her opponents by
   precipitate change. On one or two occasions, however, she thought fit
   to resist what she believed to be innovations upon Catholic usage. The
   Romans, for instance, elevated the Host that it might be worshipped,
   and against1 this she protested. It is recorded that on Christmas day
   she directed the Bishop, [149] who was about to celebrate in the Royal
   Chapel, not to elevate the Host in her presence, and that, when he
   replied that "his life was the Queen's but his conscience was his own,"
   she marked her disapproval by rising before the Gospel and leaving with
   her attendants.

   We pass now to see what, under these circumstances, was the tendency of
   the ecclesiastical measures with which she began her reign.

   Her first steps towards important changes.

   Her first act was the introduction of certain parts of the Service in
   English in the Royal Chapel, viz., the Litany, the LORD'S Prayer,
   Creed, Epistle, and Gospel. Then with the intention of checking the
   intemperate zeal of the advanced Reformers, who, in the belief that she
   was on their side, began at once a number of innovations, she issued a
   proclamation prohibiting any further departure from the established
   order of worship than such as she had sanctioned in her own chapel,
   till such time as "consultation should be had by her Majesty and her
   three estates of the realm."

   Her next step was to take into her confidence Sir Thomas Smith, a man
   of great learning, and, what was especially helpful to her at such a
   crisis, profound knowledge of the laws of the country. He at once drew
   up suggestions and embodied them in a document entitled "Device for the
   alteration of religion" [150] it is singularly interesting as
   expressive at every turn of the legal mind, which saw things chiefly
   from the opponent's side, and was occupied in forestalling the
   objections which would be raised.

   A committee appointed.

   His advice, which was acted upon, was the immediate appointment of an
   intimate cabinet of trusty Councillors, who should be made privy to the
   Queen's designs and wishes, and aid her in the selection of a Committee
   of Divines to review the service and ceremonies of the Church. The
   inner circle was formed of Cecil, Gray, Northampton, and Bedford, and
   the revision of the Liturgy committed to eight learned and able men,
   Parker, Grindal, Cox, Bill, Pilkington, Whitehead, and May, with Sir
   Thomas Smith to render such legal and lay assistance as they were
   likely to require. The Catholic and Protestant views were equally
   represented, but those who held the latter, though chosen from the
   returned exiles, were of the more orthodox side, all having resisted
   the lax discipline and libertinism of Knox and his colleagues, and
   adhered throughout to the English order. They met for deliberation
   without any appointment under the great seal, but as a private body
   gathered together to advise the government how to proceed in the matter
   of religion. Their place of meeting was the lodging of their legal
   adviser in Cannon Row, Westminster: and the chair was taken by Parker.
   His health broke down shortly after, and Guest [151] was appointed to
   fill his place whenever he was unable to attend. The first question
   which they were called upon to decide was the basis of the proposed
   revision.The basis of the proposed revision. Sir Thomas Smith, as
   representing the Queen's opinion, advised the First Prayer-book of
   Edward VI. It not only expressed those Catholic doctrines which she was
   prepared to uphold, but the authority under which it had been issued
   was unimpeachable. Convocation had drawn it up, the voice of the people
   in Parliament had ratified it, the King had sealed it, and beyond all
   this it had been acknowledged by its Revisionists to have been compiled
   under the guidance and influence of the Holy Ghost. These were weighty
   arguments in its favour, but the returned exiles interposed. They felt
   themselves to be the representatives of the whole Protestant body, and
   realising what a violent shock it would be to them to hear that a Book,
   which many of them disliked only one degree less than the Roman Use
   itself, was about to be presented to Parliament for adoption, they
   pleaded eagerly for that which had been last in use. And their
   arguments prevailed. The office of conciliating the Queen was
   undertaken by Parker. He was known to have great influence with her,
   and he succeeded in overcoming her determination. His own inclinations
   were entirely with hers, but he was a far-seeing and sagacious
   counsellor, and he knew that to alienate the Protestants would be to
   leave the government, if not entirely without support, yet face to face
   with two bitterly hostile parties, which they would be powerless to
   resist.

   It is very probable that he gave the Queen assurances that the Second
   Prayer-book would only be nominally presented to Parliament: he had
   every hope that such alterations would be made as should strip it of
   its most obnoxious features, and so prevent her from doing any violence
   to her conscience in accepting it.

   Legislation proposed.

   After this preliminary was settled, the Committee had repeated
   sittings, and on the 15th of February, a Bill was laid before
   Parliament for Uniformity of worship, but deferred on the ground that
   the subject was not yet ripe for legislation. The Queen thereupon
   directed the Archbishop of York to make arrangements for a public
   disputation between the Roman and Reforming parties in Westminster
   Abbey. Eight disputants were chosen on either side. [152]

   Public debate in Westminister Abbey.

   On the Roman side were Heath, Archbishop of York, four Bishops, White
   of Winchester, Bayne of Lichfield, Scott of Chester, Watson of Lincoln,
   Fecknam, Abbot of Westminster, Cole, Dean -- and Chedsey Prebendary of
   St. Paul's, and two Archdeacons, Langdale of Lewes, and Harpsfield of
   Canterbury.

   On the side of the Reformers were Scory, late Bishop of Chichester,
   Cox, late Dean of Westminster, Horn of Durham, Sandys, Whitehead,
   Grindal, Guest, Elmar, and Jewel.

   Of the Advocates of Rome apart from Archbishop Heath, who however took
   no part in the discussions, there are only two whose names bear any
   distinction in history, -- Cole and Harpsfield, -- the former as having
   been chosen for his learning to preach the Sermon at Oxford in
   justification of Cranmer's sentence, the latter, for the unenviable
   reputation he gained in the Marian persecutions, as "the inquisitor of
   Canterbury," in pitiless cruelty second only to "the bloody Bonner."

   The other list presents a far different aspect, almost the whole number
   having left the mark of their names upon the annals of the age.

   Friday, March 31, was the day appointed for the commencement of the
   combat. It must have been a striking spectacle even in a building
   which, excepting only St. Peter's, has witnessed grander assemblages
   than any other in Europe.

   The gathering of the disputants and the spectators.

   It was the arbitrament to which the Queen had resolved to submit the
   rival claims of her divided subjects, and on the result of the
   disputations the gravest consequences appeared to depend. And the
   spectators were not unworthy of the occasion. The Lord Keeper of the
   Seal, Sir Nicolas Bacon, came representing the Crown, and as Moderator
   of the Assembly, may have occupied for the occasion the Abbot's stall,
   which would only be vacated for the Queen or her delegate. The Privy
   Council, as next in order of dignity, were placed in the stalls of the
   Monks. The Prelates, and the rest of the disputants, some in their
   Convocation robes, others in their Academical dress, were seated in the
   Quire beneath, the one on the North, the other on the South. The Houses
   of Parliament, Nobility and Commons, were provided for where room could
   be found, for their sittings had been suspended that all might attend
   that momentous contest. And such was the excitement and eager
   expectation of the populace, wherever sight could be obtained or
   hearing found, the Abbey was crowded with a dense mass of human beings.

   Three subjects had been agreed upon for discussion: --

   The points of debate.

   Firstly, That it is repugnant to GOD'S Word, and the usage of the
   Primitive Church, that the service should be conducted in an unknown
   tongue.

   Secondly, That every Church has authority to vary or modify its forms
   of worship, with a view to edification.

   Thirdly, That the Mass is not a propitiatory sacrifice for the living
   and the dead.

   The terms of the discussion agreed upon were, that the Roman advocates
   should begin, their adversaries follow. It was pretended that the
   arrangement was made in deference to the superior rank and position of
   the Romans, and they accepted it, without thinking apparently, and were
   placed at a manifest disadvantage. Intellectually the Marian party were
   inferior, and could ill afford to make any such concession. The debate
   was opened with the question of the use of the Latin tongue in public
   service, and it ended as every one expected in the total discomfiture
   of the defenders of the Roman practice, [153] and so completely did
   their adversaries overpower them in argument that they carried the
   audience completely with them, the vast assemblage raising loud
   plaudits at the conclusion, and the Prelates being covered with
   confusion and dismay.

   The following Monday was fixed for the continuation of the dispute, but
   when they reassembled, the Bishops demanded that the order of
   proceedings should be reversed: and argued that alike by the practice
   of the Schools and the Law Courts, as they maintained the negative of
   the question to be discussed, they were entitled to the second place in
   the debate. And certainly they had justice on their side. Until the Law
   had deprived them of their position, they were the recognised guardians
   of the Religion of the country; and it was obviously their duty to
   continue at their post, and when assailed to repel the assault if they
   could, or to succumb if they must.

   But the Moderator ruled that the orders [154] drawn up by the Queen
   admitted of no modification, and must be strictly complied with, or the
   discussion would be closed. Angry recriminations and bitter invectives
   were bandied from side to side, but neither party would yield. The
   Romanists were conscious of being overmatched, and decided that it was
   better to retire with at least a show of unfair treatment, than risk
   being fairly beaten.

   The Queen's Representative rose from his seat and pronounced the
   discussion closed, but forgetting that an arbiter should know no
   favour, he turned with anger to the Bishops, and said, "You have
   refused to let us hear you; ere long, it may be, you will hear of us."
   And the ominous threat was soon put into execution; the Bishops of
   Winchester and Lincoln, who had been foremost in defying the Queen's
   mandate, were committed to the Tower for contempt of court, and the
   rest were bound over in heavy recognisances to come up for judgment
   whenever they should be called upon, and eventually sentenced to
   considerable fines. [155]

   In a short time, the Parliament-sittings were recommenced, and one of
   the earliest measures brought on was the Bill which had been dropped
   three months before for Uniformity of worship.

   Propsals for legislation renewed.

   The debate in Westminster Abbey facilitated its progress. The Commons
   accepted it, as far as we can find, without a division, satisfied that
   it had received full consideration from competent commissioners; but
   the Lords, whom the presence of the spirituality in their councils had
   affected with a deeper concern for matters of religion, were in a far
   different mood, and offered vigorous opposition both at the second and
   third readings of the Bill.

   Oppostion from the Abbot of Westminster and Bishop Scott.

   The first to rise was the Abbot of Westminster, and ashamed no doubt of
   the miserable exhibition which his party had made in the Abbey, and
   eager to retrieve the credit they had lost, he made a vigorous attack
   upon its principles. The arguments of his speech were directed to the
   establishment of three propositions: --

   Firstly, That the Faith which was imperilled was that which had come
   down from ancient times.

   Secondly, That it was the only Faith which had ever been held with
   perfect consistency.

   Thirdly, That it fostered loyal obedience to the Crown and to all in
   authority.

   At the third reading, Scott, the Bishop of Chester, made a final effort
   to throw it out. His appeal was addressed especially to the lay members
   of the House, and he tried to overawe them by dwelling upon the
   weightiness, the darkness, the difficulty of the subject, "one touching
   life and death, upon which damnation depended;" and he drew a terrible
   picture of the danger and peril which hung over their heads if they
   erred in their judgment: and then, traversing the history of the past,
   and the settlement of the great disputes of Arius, Macedonius,
   Nestorius, and Eutyches, in which no voice of the temporal power was
   suffered to be heard, he called upon his brethren of the laity to
   imitate the modesty of Emperors like Theodosius and Valentinian, and
   leave the settlement of Religion to the judgment of the Episcopate.

   Both speeches [156] have happily been preserved, and they are full of
   interest to those who study the turning-points of history.

   How they were answered or by whom, the annals of Parliament have left
   us no record; but when we remember that notwithstanding the fact that
   the occupants of the Episcopal benches were pledged to support them,
   they were defeated, we may fairly conclude that their fallacies were
   exposed, and the fears which they conjured up disarmed of their sting.
   The Act of Uniformity passed.The Bill passed [157] by a majority of
   three, the non-contents including the names of nine lords temporal and
   nine spiritual. It provided that the Second Prayer-book of Edward VI.,
   as revised by a Committee of Divines, should be adopted throughout the
   kingdom on or after the Feast of St. John the Baptist next ensuing.

   Now let us see how the mind of the Queen was reflected in the
   changes.Changes introduced. All but one perhaps involved important
   principles. That was simply the removal of an uncharitable petition in
   the Litany, which fostered a spirit of unchristian hatred, by praying
   for deliverance "from the tyranny of the Bishop of Rome and all his
   detestable enormities."

   The reader's place.

   Of the others the first was a direction that prayers should be said "in
   the accustomed place;" and the words, "as the people may best hear"
   were erased. There can be no question that "the accustomed place" was
   the Quire, where the prayers were wont to be said during the three
   years and a half, when the First Prayer-book of Edward was in use. It
   has been asserted that it may have been simply a return to the usage of
   the Second Book, but as that was only used for eight months in the
   metropolis, and probably much less time in the provinces, no usage it
   enforced or sanctioned could have been of sufficiently long duration to
   be designated by such an epithet as "accustomed." Indeed it is
   extremely probable that, owing to the difficulties of communication,
   many of the more remote parishes never adopted the Book at all. [158]

   The Ornaments Rubric.

   The second was the introduction of an "ornaments rubric," which brought
   back the Eucharistic vestments, and repealed the prohibition of 1552
   A.D. An additional clause was appended referring to an Act of
   Parliament which gave the Queen power by he Royal prerogative "to take
   other order." "Provided always, and be it enacted, that such ornaments
   o the Church and of the ministers thereof shall be retained and be
   used, as were in this Church of England by authority of Parliament, in
   the second year of the reign of King Edward VI, until other order shall
   be therein taken by authority of the Queen's Majesty, with the advice
   of her Commissioners appointed and authorised under the Great Seal of
   England for causes Ecclesiastical, or of the Metropolitan of this
   Realm."

   "And also that if there shall happen any Contempt or Irreverence to be
   used in the Ceremonies or Rites of the Church, by the Misusing of the
   Orders appointed in this Book, the Queen's Majesty may, by the like
   advice of the said Commissioners or Metropolitans, ordain and publish
   such further Ceremonies or Rites, as may be most for the Advancement of
   GOD'S glory, the Edifying of His Church, and the due Reverence of
   Christ's Holy Mysteries and Sacraments."

   When these clauses are read together (and they were printed as one in
   all the Elizabethan Prayer-books) it points to the interpretation of
   the objects of the provision being in both cases rather a development
   than a restraint or modification of Ceremonial.

   The words of administration.

   The third was the happy combination, as we have it now, of the two
   clauses in the Form of administration of the Elements: the first only
   having been used in the First Prayer-book, the second only in the
   Second.

   The Black Rubric.

   The fourth and last of any real import was the striking out of the
   "Black Rubric," which, the Queen insisted, had been illegally foisted
   into the Prayer-book after the revision was completed. [159]

   Such were the changes, exhibiting a marked determination of the
   Revisionists to recover from the retrograde movement of the close of
   Edward's reign. That the whole ground was not regained is not so in
   such a matter of surprise, as that, in the face of such opposing
   forces, they were able to regain so much.

   Even after Parliament had given legal force to the re-establishment of
   the reformed worship, efforts were made to stay the execution. The
   Queen was inexorable, and before the term of respite expired she
   resolved to summon the discontented Prelates into her presence and
   declare her unalterable resolve. Her Privy Council was calledThe Queen
   meets her Privy Council. [160] and the whole Episcopal order and other
   ecclesiastics of distinction; and Archbishop Heath rose in the name of
   GOD and the Church he represented, to entreat her even at the eleventh
   hour to reconsider her determination: and in a speech full of
   foreboding predicted the consequences if the See of St. Peter should
   cease to be obeyed. The Queen replied with a dignity and calmness that
   fills us with wonder in one so young before such an assembly, and the
   words she used have become so familiar on her lips, as almost to have
   lost their original application: "As for me and my house, we will serve
   the LORD," [161] adding, "My aim is to bind myself and my people to
   Christ, the King of kings, and not to the Roman See." And the Assembly
   broke up. Within six weeks from that date, Breviary and Missal were
   superseded, and Forms of worship in which the laity were enabled to
   take an intelligent part restored to the Churches. But the Queen was
   not satisfied to leave the enforcement of the Act to be carried out in
   the ordinary way. Before the year closed she issued a body of
   "Injunctions" to insure conformity in some essential particulars. Let
   me mention two by way of illustration.

   The first was for the promotion of music in Divine Service. Recognising
   its value not only as a vehicle of praise but as a help to devotion,
   she made provision for the due maintenance of singing men and children,
   with a wise precaution that the service should not be made thereby less
   intelligible. And for the special comfort of those who delighted in
   music, she enjoined that at the beginning and end of Common Prayer a
   hymn or song in praise of Almighty GOD should be sung in the best
   melody that could be conveniently devised. Could she have foreseen that
   under the shield of her royal sanction, the barbarous strains of
   Sternhold and Hopkins would thrust out even the "Te Deum" and
   "Magnificat," she would have hesitated to pen such an injunction.

   The second direction was to insure becoming reverence in the outward
   gesture of the worshipper: and she embodied a general principle in the
   following orders [162] which dealt with a familiar case: "That
   whensoever the Name of Jesus should be pronounced in any lesson, sermon
   or otherwise in the Church, due reverence should be made of all persons
   young and old, with lowliness of courtesy, and uncovering of the head
   of the men kind, as thereunto did necessarily belong and heretofore
   hath been accustomed."

   It shocks our ideas of reverence to hear of men having their heads
   covered in a consecrated building, but the practice was general at this
   time. Whether it was confined to the hearing of the sermon only, or
   extended to the whole service, is doubtful. The well-known picture in
   the Palace of Ely, representing the funeral of Bishop Cox, exhibits the
   whole congregation wearing their hats within the choir.

   Anglican worship fully restored.

   And with the Act of Uniformity, passed April 28, 1559 A.D., and the
   Injunctions which followed, the Anglican Reformed worship, with the
   Ritual of Edward's early years, was in the main re-established.

   The priests, according to the service in which they were engaged, were
   free to wear the Edwardian vestments: outward reverence for holy things
   and places and for the Sacred Name was revived: and music, wherever it
   could be had, lent added beauty to the service of GOD'S House. And,
   what was of no little importance, the Queen herself, by whose happy
   efforts these results had been mainly attained, was careful to set
   before her subjects a fitting pattern of the worship which she desired
   to be offered throughout her dominions. The Royal Chapel was a model to
   all Churches, in furniture and ornaments, as well as in the frequency
   and the reverential conduct of its services.

   Accepted by the Roman party.

   But how far was the copy imitated? In proof that in many places it was
   done with no little success, we may appeal to the fact that multitudes
   of Roman Catholics, to whom the absence of Ritual would have been
   intolerable, were, if not satisfied, yet at least able to worship in
   our Churches. The Queen [163] writing some years after testifies to
   this: many of the nobility, who still remained true to Papal
   allegiance, she says, "did ordinarily resort in all open places to
   Divine Services in the Churches without contradiction or show of
   misliking."

   And if the higher classes did deliberately accept the Reformed worship,
   the common people very probably did the same unconsciously.The changes
   not felt at first. It is almost certain that in many parishes the
   transition was practically unobserved by the congregation. The altars
   were vested very much as under the Marian rule, the "ornaments of the
   minister," which the Elizabethan Revision enjoined, were not so
   divergent from the Roman as to strike the eye, while the gestures, the
   manner of the officiant priests, the intonation of the voice, all would
   in the nature of things remain the same, for no direction was given for
   change in any of these points. The real change was effected in the
   substance and doctrine of the Liturgy, but as it had been recited for
   six years in Latin, which was quite unintelligible to the masses, it is
   highly improbable that they would recognise the modifications. The only
   alteration which they would be certain to realise, they must have
   hailed with satisfaction and delight, viz., the substitution of the
   tongue which they spoke themselves, in place of one which, from their
   utter inability to comprehend it, had made their worship a cold and
   lifeless formality.

   But it would have been far too much to expect that such acquiescence
   would be universal.Oppostion at length aroused. In places opposition
   would be stirred up and fostered by the priests, who hated the
   Reformation, and outbreaks of rebellion, for the restoration of the
   Roman Faith and worship, were by no means infrequent. That which
   assumed perhaps the most dangerous proportions was headed by the Earls
   of Northumberland and Westmorland, [164] "the hereditary leaders of the
   North," we may add also "the hereditary chiefs of English Revolution."
   It reached its height in Durham, when they strode defiantly into the
   Cathedral with a crowd of followers armed to the teeth, headed by a
   massive Crucifix, aud the old banner of the Pilgrimage on which the
   five Sacred Wounds were emblazoned. They tore the English Bible and
   Prayer-book to pieces: set up the ancient altar, replaced the holy
   water vessel, and then, as the historian relates, "amidst tears,
   embraces, prayers, and thanksgivings, the organ pealed out, the candles
   and torches were lighted, and the mass was said once more in the long
   desecrated aisles." [165] This rebellion however, like the rest, was
   crushed, and the Roman worship driven out. Then came the Papal Bull
   [166] of Excommunication against the Queen, and no Romanist was
   suffered any longer to worship in the English Church.

   But there was a party in England from whom the Elizabethan Reforms had
   more to fear than from any threatened rebellion of discontented
   Papists.

   Causes contributing to the advance of the Puritans.

   The Puritans had come in like a flood, and Acts and Injunctions and
   Royal proclamations proved powerless to stay their advance. Multitudes
   of important posts in the Church suddenly fell vacant. There had been
   an unprecedented mortality among the Bishops; the Plague had entered
   their Palaces, [167] and no less than nine had died, as Fuller puts it,
   to form "the death-guard" of Queen Mary. The rest, with a single
   exception, [168] refused either the oath of Supremacy or the Act of
   Uniformity, and were deprived. And not only those in the highest
   office, but many Deans, and Archdeacons, and other dignitaries shared a
   similar fate. And what followed? Their places were far from being
   adequately filled. In the dearth of competent men of Catholic views,
   there was no alternative but to draw from the Protestant ranks. Men
   were appointed with strong Puritan tendencies, not only satisfied with
   a meagre ritual, but pledged in principle to encourage it. Bishops like
   Scambler at Lincoln, Pilkington at Durham, Sandys at Worcester, and
   even Grindal in London, made no show even of enforcing the Act, but
   lent all the aid of their countenance to nonconforming clergy, till in
   many parts almost every feature of Catholic worship was obliterated.
   [169]

   The Queen's rapacity.

   And then there was another cause contributing largely to the same
   untoward result, for which the Queen herself must be held responsible,
   we mean the impoverishment of the Church.

   There is a noble protest among Whitgift's Letters, [170] which must be
   remembered to his honour: "Madam," he writes, "religion is the
   foundation and cement of human societies: and when they that serve
   GOD'S Altar shall be exposed to poverty, then religion itself will be
   exposed to scorn and become contemptible; as you may already observe it
   to be in too many poor vicarages in this nation. And therefore as you
   are by a late Act or Acts of Parliament entrusted with a great power to
   preserve or waste the Church's lands, yet dispose of them, for Jesus'
   sake, as you have promised to men and vowed to GOD, that is, as the
   donors intended : let neither falsehood nor flattery beguile you to do
   otherwise; but put a stop to GOD'S and the Levite's portion, I beseech
   you, and to the approaching ruins of the Church, as you expect comfort
   at the last day; for kings must be judged."

   Many a Bishopric was sequestered. Ely, for example, was vacant for
   twenty years after the death of Cox, and his successor Heton found the
   estates of the See frightfully curtailed. And Elizabeth seized the
   revenues with unblushing rapacity, and appropriated them with
   unaccountable inconsistency, to enrich courtiers like Cecil and
   Leicester, as well as herself.

   The richest endowments were the first to suffer. The Cathedrals soon
   presented an appearance of most appalling neglect. The only sign of
   life among the Deans and Canons was the principle of self-interest,
   with which the example of the Queen had infected them. They suffered
   the daily services to cease: the altars to be stripped: flagons and
   chalices stood on their side-boards; and the copes and vestments were
   slit into gowns and bodices for their wives and children.

   In the towns and villages things were but a few degrees better. The
   Parish Priests who conformed and retained their benefices, made a
   struggle to maintain at least the decencies of Ritual, but at last,
   "drawing foul ensample from fair names," they became like the rest.

   The Puritan clergy, to whom even a surplice was an abomination, could
   hardly be expected to check the prevailing desecration.

   The neglected condition of the Churches.

   So early as 1561 A.D. we read in a legal document, [171] in which there
   is no probability of exaggeration, of the deplorable state to which the
   Chancels were reduced. "In sundry Churches and Chapels . . . there is
   such negligence and lack of convenient reverence used towards the
   comely keeping and order of the said Churches, and specially of the
   upper part called the chancels, that it breedeth no small offence and
   slander to see and consider, on the one part, the curiosity and costs
   bestowed by all sorts of men upon their private houses, and, on the
   other part, the unclean or negligent order and spare keeping of the
   house of prayer, by permitting open decay . . . and by appointing
   unmeet and unseemly tables, with foul cloths, for the Communion of the
   Sacraments, and generally leaving the place of prayer desolate of all
   cleanliness and of meet ornaments for such a place whereby it might be
   known a place provided for Divine service."

   Much of this deplorable neglect was inherited from the close of
   Edward's reign. The change of Altars into Tables and also of their
   position in the Churches had almost necessitated the disuse of the rich
   vestments in which they had been clothed. To replenish his exhausted
   coffers the King issued a Commission with power to seize upon the plate
   and hangings and other furniture and ornaments which, it was said,
   being no longer available for their original purpose, would be better
   appropriated than suffered to fall into decay. The demolition of images
   too had led to a great defacement of Churches and Chapels; and the east
   wall in many cases, from having been a favourite position for
   sculpture, presented a ruinous appearance, while no attempt at
   restoration had been made during the Marian rule. This state of
   neglect, which the Romans, with all their love of the externals of
   religion, had done nothing to correct, was aggravated by the
   carelessness of the Elizabethan clergy, and the Preamble of the Queen's
   "Order" to her Commissioners is a terrible revelation.The object of the
   injunctions. Her Injunctions were issued not merely to stay further
   desecration but to recover what was lost. In destroying the Roods, the
   Screens on which they were placed had away: but former, she to efface
   the distinction between the Chancel and the Nave [172] should not be
   acknowledged, and she peremptorily ordered that the partitions should
   be replaced. Further to hide the disfigured wall above the Altar, she
   directed that the Table of the Decalogue should be set up. In
   Cathedrals, "the exemplary Churches," [173] they were to be embellished
   with "costly painting," but in Parish Churches where poverty was sure
   to be pleaded, printed copies pasted upon board were sanctioned. We
   could hardly have a more forcible and telling description than is given
   by the fact that what bore no more traces of beauty than a modern
   "School Board Time Table" should have been accounted as a "comely
   ornament," calculated to recover something of the reverence in which
   the Chancel had once been held. But the Injunctions failed to stay the
   progress of decay, and the Worship of GOD and everything connected with
   it fell into contempt. Even Convocation shared the indifference of the
   times, and a proposal to abolish some of the simplest ceremonies [174]
   was only rejected by fifty-nine to fifty-eight votes. Then came the
   Advertisements, 1566 A.D. They were an honest attempt of the Archbishop
   to enforce the laws which were everywhere persistently broken. Even the
   surplice had been discarded in the administration of the Holy
   Communion, and some received kneeling, some standing, some sitting. The
   superficial reader will be struck with the triviality of the points at
   issue, the use of a dress, the sign of the Cross, the outward reverence
   at the Sacred Name; but the discerner of the times knows that in the
   greatest struggles the immediate battle is often fought over apparent
   trifles, and sees here that the conflict was in reality between
   antiquity and novelty, between the voice of the Church and private
   judgment, between Catholic truth and sectarian error.

   The result of the first attempt to enforce Uniformity proves how
   necessary an appeal to force had become.The London Clergy. When the
   London clergy were summoned before the Primate and the Bishop of
   London, no less than thirty-seven out of ninety-eight, more than
   one-third, refused compliance, and their livings were sequestrated.

   Of the Universities, the natural feeders of the Ministry, Oxford, after
   the suppression of the Roman influence, to which it yielded itself up
   in Queen Mary's reign, became "Calvinistic in the extreme." Sampson.
   Dean of Christ Church, and Humphrys, the President of Magdalene, came
   back from exile, and soon succeeded in creating a reaction. Their party
   was reinforced shortly after by the institution of a new Divinity
   Professorship, to which the Secretary of State appointed Dr. Rainolds,
   "a learned and rigorous Puritan." [175]

   Cambridge too, though traditionally less liable to fluctuations than
   the sister University, passed rapidly from Roman under Puritan
   influence, and fanatical preachers excited the undergraduates to rise
   in rebellion against the operation of the Act for Uniformity of
   worship. Many of the Heads of Houses took an active part in the
   "Vestiarian controversy," and gained the nickname of" cap and surplice
   fanatics." [176] Others vented their Protestant spleen in stripping
   their Chapels of every vestige of beauty and ornament, and many fine
   paintings and stained glass windows fell victims to their iconoclastic
   zeal. Then came the libellous acts of Martin Mar-prelate, [177] which
   fostered the spirit of insubordination to the last degree, and the evil
   genius of the University, Thomas Cartwright, appeared to add to the
   confusion. [178] The evil influnecne of Cartwright. It would be
   impossible to name any one who did more to impregnate that generation
   with an uncatholic system of Theology, and to stereotype in the Schools
   of the clergy principles which aimed at divesting the Worship of the
   Church of all that was attractive and beautiful. His Lecture-room was
   thronged by admiring students, and his sermons were so popular that
   "the very windows were taken out of Great St. Mary's Church that the
   multitudes might come within reach of his voice." But amidst so much
   that was sad and discouraging there was a gleam of sunshine and it must
   have gladdened the heart of the Queen before she died with at least the
   prospect of a brighter future for the Church which she loved.

   The opportuneness of Hooker's writings.

   The Protestant invasion had stifled the "new learning" which was born
   when the century began. It breathed again in the immortal pages of
   Hooker when the century closed.

   The Puritan rested the authority for the doctrines and worship of the
   Church upon the narrow ground of express Scripture direction. Nothing
   whatever, he said, in faith or practice may claim our acceptance, or
   has even any right to receive it, unless it is clearly laid down in
   GOD'S written Word. Hooker [179] showed that this narrow ground must be
   abandoned, and that "a divine order exists, not in written revelation
   only, but in the moral relations, the historical development, and the
   social and political institutions of men," and he claimed for human
   reason the province of determining the laws of this order.

   "The Ecclesiastical Polity" was exactly what was wanted in the crisis,
   and though the impression which it made was not immediately felt, it
   was deep and lasting. It informed the minds of men like Overall, and
   Andrewes, and Laud, and Cosin, and a great host of others who drew from
   its pages the spirit which gave them courage to meet the onslaught of
   the Commonwealth, and enabled them to raise the Church from her
   temporary overthrow, and place her securely in that position from which
   every effort has been powerless to dislodge her.

   [162] CARDW. Docum. Ann. ii. 176. The habit of showing reverence to the
   Name of Jesus, popularly supposed to have originated in the declaration
   of St. Paul "that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow," had a
   more probable origin in the desire of the early Christians to exalt
   that which the Jews attempted to dishonour. The Name Jesus in
   particular was commonly regarded after the Crucifixion as a title of
   reproach, and such contemptuous designations as Jesus, the magician,
   Jesus, the impostor, Jesus, the Galilean impostor, were freely used.
   Again, the usual form of renunciation of Christianity was Anathema
   Jesus. By way of reparation, therefore, the Christians marked the same
   title out for the reception of especial honour. At a Council held at
   Lyons in 1274 A.D. it was ordered that "whenever this glorious Name
   should be mentioned, especially when the sacred Mysteries were being
   celebrated, every one individually fulfilling himself that which is
   written, viz. at the Name,' etc., do bow the knees of his heart and
   testify that he does so by at least bowing the head." In 1604 A.D. the
   custom was indorsed in Canon xviii. Cf. BINGHAM, vol. x. lib. iv. c. 8.

   Elie" were drawn up by the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and disclose
   in the most patent manner the real condition of affairs: "Your Majestie
   shall fill that Sea which hath been 14 yeares voyde, remove the opinion
   of kepinge a Bishopricke so long in your Majestie's hands; by placing
   an olde Bishop there it will not (lykely) be long out of your
   Majestie's hands: the Bishop's howses of accesse now in great ruyne,
   will be repayred. . . . Your Majestie hereby shall not lose any
   profitt." Then follow arguments to show "how the filling of the Sea may
   be nere as valuable to her Majestie as the Sea vacant," and how the
   objections of "the Clergie-men may perchance think your Majestic doth
   decrease the revenewes of the Church" may be answered. The impression
   left on the mind after reading this strange document is simply this,
   that the Keeper of the Seal aimed at relieving the Queen of the
   unpopularity which she had gained by her appropriation of the Episcopal
   revenues, without restoring them to their rightful possessors. Cf.

  CHAPTER IV: The Caroline Settlement

   The Parish Churches of England experienced a second revolution in their
   worship at the beginning of the Long Parliament: but of a very
   different nature from that which ensued upon the accession of Queen
   Mary.

   The bitter hostility to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church which
   had been gathering for many years culminated in 1645 A.D., when a vote
   of the House established the Directory "for the public worship of GOD
   in the three kingdoms," [180] and proscribed by fine and imprisonment
   the use of the Prayer-book, not only in Divine Service in Churches, but
   even in private dwellings.

   Men's feelings during the proscription of the Prayer-book.

   Henceforward the attachment of devout Churchmen to the forbidden
   Liturgy became greatly strengthened, and was regarded "with a degree of
   veneration such as is felt for a saint who has suffered martyrdom." Men
   were courageous enough to brave the consequences for the sake of that
   they loved, and in secret chambers met from time to time to worship GOD
   according to the old ceremonies and the prayers of their fathers.

   We know of hardly anything sadder than the few scattered notices in
   Evelyn's Diary. [181] These are examples.

   Advent Sunday:-- "There being no Office at the Church, but extemporary
   prayers after the Presbyterian way, for now all forms were prohibited
   and most of the preachers were usurpers, I seldom went to Church upon
   solemn feasts, but either went to London, where some of the orthodox
   sequestered Divines did privately use the Common Prayer; . . . or else
   I procured one to officiate in my house . . . on the 10th, Dr. Richard
   Owen, the sequestered minister of Eltham, preached to my family in my
   Library, and gave us the Holy Communion."

   Again he writes, "People had no principles, and grew very ignorant of
   even the common points of Christianity: all devotion being now placed
   in hearing sermons and discourses of speculative and notional things."

   And in one of his entries for Christmas Day, several of which strike
   the same note of sadness, he tells how with some devout worshippers, he
   was surprised in Exeter Chapel in the Strand by a troop of soldiers,
   who held their muskets against them as if they would have shot them at
   the altar, and kept them in confinement. And there is one more notice
   in the same journal which bears melancholy evidence to the condition of
   the Parish Churches: they "were filled with sectaries of all sorts,
   blasphemous and ignorant mechanics usurping the pulpits everywhere."

   And he sums up all in one pregnant line : "The Church now in dens and
   caves of the earth."

   The expected destruction of the Church.

   And in corroboration of all this we might point to the lamentation of
   Chancellor Hyde, where he bemoans the fact that Papists awl Puritans
   were both computing in how few years the enfeebled Church of England
   would expire. [182] But the Providence of God defeated their
   expectations. The death of the Protector and the deposition of his weak
   and irresolute son revived the hopes of the oppressed. The
   re-establishment of the Church was inseparable from the restoration of
   the Monarchy; but it was for some time a matter of anxious doubt
   whether her worship should be brought back in its integrity, or only
   when shorn of most of its ancient glory.

   Loyal deputation to the King in Holland.

   The Lords and Commons and the City of London sent a deputation to the
   King, who had taken up his abode in Holland, during his exile, to
   convey to his Majesty expressions of loyalty. Eight Presbyterian
   Divines [183] seized the opportunity for enlisting his sympathy, and
   succeeded in drawing from him the famous Breda Declaration,His
   manifesto. [184] to which they clung so pertinaciously but so
   hopelessly through all their after troubles. He assured them that in
   consequence of the passion and uncharitableness of the times having
   produced diversity in religious opinions, by which men had become
   engaged in parties and animosities against each other, he would grant
   "liberty to tender consciences." There was some reserve in his promise
   which they did not examine very closely, viz., provided such
   differences did not interfere with the peace of the kingdom, and that
   Parliament were ready to sanction the indulgence.

   There is no doubt however that his manner was conciliatory, perhaps
   more so than he intended, for emboldened by their reception, they
   pushed on at a later interview to extract a promise that neither the
   old Liturgy nor the abhorred surplice should be reintroduced even in
   his own chapel for fear of giving offence to their brethren. The
   replied with no little indignation, "that Since he gave them their
   liberty, he should by no means resign his own; that he had always used
   that form of service, which he considered to be the best in the world,
   and ho would have no other," and touching the minister's habit while
   officiating, he told them that it had been retained by him under more
   difficult circumstances and would certainly not be discountenanced now.

   The return of the King.

   On the 26th of May 1660 A.D., Charles reached the English shores, and
   the following day the joyful sounds of the disused Liturgy echoed once
   more through the aisles of the metropolitan Cathedral at Canterbury.

   Under the date of July 8th, there is a brief entry in Evelyn's Diary,
   almost as full of hope as the last which we quoted from it was of
   sadness: "From henceforth was the Liturgy publicly used in our
   Churches, whence it had been for so many years banished."

   In the autumn of the same year, the King issued a second Declaration
   upon Ecclesiastical affairs.A second manifesto. It Was a repetition in
   the main of the less formal promise given at Breda, and conceived in
   the same conciliatory spirit towards Nonconformity. It contained much
   which would have curtailed very seriously the independent authority of
   the Episcopate; but this we pass by, as our present object is to deal
   with that part only which concerns the Worship of the Church.

   Pending a revision of the Prayer-book full liberty was granted to
   discontinue the use of it, as well as "the ancient ceremony" of bowing
   at the Name of Jesus, and the wearing the surplice, provided only that
   such liberty did not extend to those who ministered in Cathedrals and
   Collegiate Churches.

   Probably the King felt confident of the ultimate result, when the
   projected Council of Divines should have held their debates, and so was
   anxious to make temporary concessions, to avoid being charged with a
   breach of faith, and to save himself from alienating a large portion of
   his subjects at the outset of his reign.

   The unreasonableness of the Presbyterians.

   Each fresh concession, instead of satisfying the Presbyterians, made
   them wax bolder in their demands, till at last they completely
   overreached themselves, and, as we shall see, in the end lost
   everything by their grasping.

   It is often asserted that they received hard measure at the hands of
   their opponents; if it be true, it must be attributed in a great
   measure to their own disregard of the feelings and interests of others.

   The Church too was then rising after a long and severe depression, and
   it was only natural that as she found herself secure of the recovery of
   her ancient prerogatives, some of her ministers should feel but little
   sympathy for the alleged grievances of those, by whom in the hour of
   their triumph they had been so ruthlessly treated. Still further, it
   must be remembered that the differences were religious and doctrinal,
   and it was not a time for orthodoxy to yield even an inch to the
   demands of men whose teaching the Apostolic Church distinctly
   repudiated.

   The proposals for a Conference.

   It was not till the spring of the following year that the King was able
   to carry out his intention of bringing matters to a final issue between
   the contending parties. Steps were then taken for submitting the vexed
   questions of Liturgical worship and ceremonial observance to the
   decision of a formally constituted assembly of Divines selected in
   equal numbers from either side. No pressure of any kind was exercised
   in the selection, but each party was left free to name its own
   Commissioners. Twelve Bishops and twelve Presbyterian ministers with
   nine coadjutors on either side formed the deliberative Council from
   which so much was expected, so little realised.

   Twice before the disputant parties had been arranged on opposite
   benches, once at Hampton Court, [185] once at Westminster. [186] At all
   three meetings the subjects of debate were practically identical, but
   the circumstances under which they were debated, most widely different.

   When King James, in reply to the Millenary Petition, summoned a
   conference in 1604 A.D. to consider the Presbyterian grievances, the
   Episcopalians were in undisturbed power; and they took their seats
   under the Presidency of the King, who, they were secretly convinced,
   was strongly averse to any concession, as Ecclesiastical Commissioners
   appointed to adjudicate rather than to debate on terms of equality. The
   aggrieved party moreover were placed at a manifest disadvantage in
   point of numbers, having no more than four to confront an array of nine
   Bishops, seven Deans, and three others.

   And there was the same inequality at West- minster, 1643 A.D., but then
   the tables were reversed, the Presbyterians appearing in an
   overwhelming majority, out numbering the representatives of the Church
   in the proportion of twelve to one, or even more.

   On the present occasion the champions of the two rival systems met face
   to face, equal in numbers, and not altogether unequal in intellectual
   power and learning; and as far as human judgment could foresee, there
   was every prospect of a fair trial of strength, and a full and
   unprejudiced consideration upon their merits of the questions to be
   debated.

   That these anticipations were not fulfilled was due far more to the
   unwisdom and unyielding

   Spirit of men like Baxter than to any other assignable cause.

   The meeting in the Savoy.

   The place of meeting by the Royal Proclamation was the Palace of the
   Savoy. It was a spot rich in historic memories, and worthy of the
   occasion. In the noble Hall of the Master's lodging, looking out on the
   Thames, the Conference met for the first time on April 15, 1661 A.D.

   The representation of the Episopalians.

   And now let us look at the portraits of the representative Divines of
   that eventful time, for such were those who formed that memorable
   Assembly. [187] Inasmuch as, to all outward seeming, the gravest issues
   for the future of the Church were likely to flow from its
   deliberations, we should have expected to see the Primate of England
   occupying the Presidential Chair, but Juxon was bowed down with the
   weight of years,--years of such anxiety that they would have made a
   young man prematurely old,--and he pleaded the infirmity of age as an
   excuse, deputing Sheldon.Sheldon, the Bishop of London, and by a happy
   coincidence also Master of the Savoy, to fill his place. His character
   has been severely criticised by Nonconformist historians, but he was
   far from deserving the wholesale condemnation which they have dealt out
   to him. We may find it difficult to maintain that the Episcopate
   suffered no loss in its sacred dignity from his public conduct, or that
   his spirituality and piety in private life were such as beseems a
   Father in GOD, but it cannot be denied that he possessed many of the
   qualifications which fitted him for a post, in which he was called upon
   to control the discussions of men of such widely different opinions. He
   had mixed much with the world, and acquired in society a wonderful
   aptitude for discerning character: and with this shrewd discrimination
   and quickness of apprehension, he combined great courtesy in manner and
   gentleness of speech.

   He had the good fortune to be supported by Bishops and Divines, fully
   competent to maintain the honour and rights of the Church, men whose
   names have become familiar as household words in the world of
   Ecclesiastical Literature and debate.

   Cosin.

   Foremost in importance, not perhaps from every point of view, but
   unquestionably in connection with the subjects to be discussed, was
   Cosin, Bishop of Durham. He was almost without a rival in any age for
   acquaintance with Liturgical lore, the decrees of Councils, and
   Patristic teaching. In his early days he had sat at the feet of
   Andrewes and Overall, [188] and afterwards, when Chaplain to the Bishop
   of the See to which he succeeded, he drank in the opinions of Laud and
   other like-minded Divines, for Durham house in London was the centre of
   high Ecclesiastical society.

   It was here that he gathered many of the "Notes," which were destined
   to play such an important part in the final settlement of Anglican
   worship. From the first he was exposed to obloquy, and for his efforts
   to restore the decency of worship in the Cathedral of Durham after his
   appointment to a Canonry, he was publicly delated as "a young Apollo
   who sets out the Quire with strange Babylonish ornaments," arid for his
   zeal in reviving a fitting ceremonial at the Coronation of Charles I.,
   he was contemptuously designated "Popish Master John." Unless it could
   be proved that he changed his views, his conduct during his exile at
   the Court of Queen Henrietta Maria is sufficient to acquit him of any
   tendency Romewards. When brought into contact with the Jesuits, he held
   frequent discussions with them upon doctrinal questions, and at last
   gathered up his arguments into a treatise in denunciation of their
   supreme dogma of transubstantiation. But whether the charges were
   wholly unfounded or not, we can hardly be surprised that he had made
   himself hateful to the Puritans, or that he should have been selected
   as the first Episcopalian to suffer vengeance by a vote of the Commons.
   [189]

   Such being his history, such his character, we can well imagine the
   dismay which the Presbyterians must have felt when they saw him taking
   his place in the ranks of their opponents at the Savoy. From him at
   least they could expect no concession; and though it was by no means in
   a spirit of retaliation, for he was of a most generous temper and the
   strictest sense of rectitude and justice, he did not disappoint them,
   but stood firm and unbending to the principles for which be had
   suffered.

   Morley.

   For the active part that be took in the proceedings, Morley, Bishop of
   Worcester, deserves to be noticed next. He had followed the fortunes of
   the King throughout the war, and had shared his banishment, and for his
   devotion to the Royal cause was selected as the fittest person to
   preach the Coronation sermon in Westminster Abbey.

   He was a most brilliant speaker, quick in reply, and of ever ready wit,
   but unfortunately of such a hasty temper that he often spoke without
   weighing his words considerately. It is said too that he was so
   impulsive that he manifested the greatest impatience of a sustained
   argument, and frequently interrupted a speaker from whom he disagreed.
   These failings materially damaged his influence and weakened the force
   of those qualities which should have made him the most formidable
   member of the Conference. As it turned out, others were more feared by
   the Presbyterians, but no one was more obnoxious to them: indeed they
   disliked him more than all the rest of his party together.

   Sanderson.

   Sanderson, Bishop of Lincoln, had qualifications, which placed him from
   time to time in the President's seat in the absence of Sheldon. He was
   a staunch upholder of the rights and prerogatives of the Church, When
   forbidden by the Commonwealth to read the Book of Common Prayer, he
   committed its pages to heart, and habitually repeated them from memory
   all through the times of the proscription. His reputation as a Casuist
   is such that his works on the Conscience are studied in the present
   generation.

   As a writer of English, he was almost unapproachable for the purity of
   his language, as the most familiar though by no means the best example
   of which, we may read the Preface to the Prayer-book which came from
   his pen.

   He was especially disliked by the Presbyterians for the scathing
   severity with which he criticised the Solemn League and Covenant.

   The portrait gallery of the Churchmen would be grievously deficient, if
   Pearson and Gunning were wanting, though they only acted as Coadjutors.

   Pearson.

   The former, as the Theologian of the Conference, rises above all his
   fellows. The solidity of his learning and the cogency of his
   argumentative skill earned for him a reputation which the lapse of two
   centuries has hardly deteriorated.

   In Catholic doctrine, it is true, he took lower ground than Cosin or
   Gunning, but the extraordinary abilities which he possessed commanded
   the respect of his opponents, though they contributed not a little to
   their discomfiture.

   Gunning.

   The latter, Gunning, deserves a fuller notice. He was a scholar of no
   mean attainments, and being possessed of an unusually retentive memory
   and readiness of speech, was able to enforce his arguments by telling
   illustrations drawn from history and a wide experience. Among the
   uneducated, however, this fertility of allusion made him obscure and
   difficult; and Charles II. is said to have ridiculed the Court ladies
   for their admiration of his preaching, which he explained on the
   principle "omne ignotum pro magnifico."

   His views on Ecclesiastical questions were tho- roughly Catholic; the
   Presbyterians stigmatised them as Roman, but they had been much
   irritated against him by his refusal to administer the Sacrament to
   Prynne, when he obstinately declined to kneel for its reception.

   As a polemic he loved discussion, and was in many ways the counterpart
   of Morley, with the same ready wit and quick reply. He differed,
   however, in that he combined great courtesy and goodness, with the
   utmost gravity and dignified control over his temper.

   It is recorded as an instance of his readiness that once he engaged in
   argument with an enthusiast whom he happened to hear declaiming on the
   immediate nearness of the Advent in the presence of a great crowd who
   were completely carried away with his words. Gunning, after trying in
   vain to turn them from their convictions by Scriptural arguments,
   seized upon an observation casually dropped to the effect that his
   opponent had lately invested in an estate, and offered him two years'
   purchase for the transfer. Taken off his guard, the man demanded twenty
   as its real value, and his converts left him.

   As a writer, he has left his mark upon our Service-book in the
   beautiful prayer for "all conditions of men." [190]

   We think no one can look at his monument in Ely Cathedral without being
   impressed with the majesty of his bearing, and the strength of
   character exhibited in his face, or stand upon the huge stone engraved
   with the pregnant title "Petrus Episcopus Eliensis," without feeling a
   profound sense of gratitude to him, as he recalls his history as of one
   of the saviours of the Church in her most troublous time.

   We turn now to those who represented the opposite party. By far the
   majority of them were men of distinction: a few stand out from the rest
   with names which would command the admiration of any generation in
   history: and at these we look more closely.

   Reynolds.

   The first, however, that attracts our attention is Reynolds, whose
   position as a Bishop is not a little remarkable.

   To sit as a Commissioner on the same bench with men who were ready to
   burn the Prayer-book, and to take his place in Convocation, which was
   almost sworn to defend it, is an anomaly almost without parallel. It
   makes us suspect his integrity, and is indicative of no little
   instability of mind and purpose. Though the Presbyterians were glad to
   avail themselves of his advocacy, he completely lost their confidence,
   when in later days he elected to retain his Bishopric and conform,
   while those in whose ranks he had stood, and who had looked to him for
   guidance, had the courage of their opinions, and were ejected. But
   whatever judgment we may pass upon him for his inconsistency, he has
   left a mark upon the Prayer-book, which the strongest Episcopalian can
   have no wish to efface, as the author of "the General Thanksgiving."
   [191]

   Richard Baxter.

   The moving controlling spirit of their party was Richard Baxter. One
   act of his, to be considered hereafter, will enable us to form a
   correct estimate of his character better than the most lengthy
   description. But we may sum up his faults by saying that be was far too
   self-reliant, seeing only with his own eyes and wholly incapable of
   understanding the position of an opponent: and his good qualities, by
   pronouncing him absolutely without an equal in guilelessness and
   personal piety.

   Though his work in the Conference was in its spirit subversive of all
   that every loyal Churchman holds most dear, he has won our affections
   and healed many a wounded heart by the touch of his "Saints'
   Everlasting Rest."

   Calamy.

   Calamy gained great renown as a preacher, and had a larger following of
   distinguished persons than any minister in the seventeenth century. He
   was profoundly learned and conversant with writings not usually studied
   by men of his views, having read through (as his Biographers assert,
   though it can only be by a figure of speech) all the works of St.
   Augustine no less than five times, and being equally at home in the
   disquisitions of the Schoolman Aquinas.

   Lightfoot.

   Lightfoot, the last to be noticed, was the first of English Divines to
   penetrate deeply into the mysteries of Hebrew Literature, and to lay
   bare for the Christian the secrets of Rabbinic and Talmudic Science.
   Though two hundred years have elapsed since he entered upon the
   then-untrodden field, few, if any, have extended their investigations
   further.

   Such were the men who were called together at this crisis to debate and
   adjust the rival claims of the two systems of Church Government and
   Worship.

   The object of the Conference.

   The President of the Conference opened the proceedings by reciting the
   instrument under which they had been summoned. It enjoined them "to
   review the Book of Common Prayer, comparing the same with the most
   ancient Liturgies which have been used in the Church in the primitive
   and purest times: . . . to advise and consult upon the several
   objections which should be raised against the same, and (if occasion
   be), to make such reasonable and necessary alterations as should be
   agreed upon to be needful and expedient for the giving satisfaction to
   tender consciences . . . but avoiding (as much as may be) all
   unnecessary abbreviations of the forms and liturgy, wherewith the
   people are altogether acquainted and have so long received in the
   Church of England."

   The presiding Bishop ruled that the summons directed them to the
   consideration of exceptions and additions to the Prayer-book, and
   maintained that as the Episcopal party were well-satisfied with the
   Book as it stood, it was obviously the duty of those who were aggrieved
   to set forth their objections and to suggest such additional matter as
   they thought fit. He ordered also that, to insure full consideration,
   they should be laid before the Conference in writing. The
   Presbyterians, after many fruitless protests against a course which
   they foresaw would fetter the freedom of debate, yielded an unwilling
   assent, and agreed among themselves that the main body should undertake
   to draw up the exceptions, and leave to Baxter alone the compilation of
   the additions.

   The former work was speedily accomplished. The grievances had been
   stereotyped for years, [192] and only required to be placed in
   categorical order and expressed in the most trenchant terms.

   The nature of the exceptions.

   Those which related to Church Worship may be comprehended briefly under
   these heads: --

   I. The mode of expressing both prayer and praise.

   II. The ceremonies attendant upon the same.

   III. The restriction of times for public service.

   The first claim put forward was for the omission of responses, and tho
   alternative reading of Psalms, and for time consolidation of time
   divided petitions of the Litany into one continuous prayer.

   This struck at the root of a very important principle, and though the
   objectors hardly realised it, it would have debarred the laity from the
   right which they possess in virtue of their priesthood [193] of taking
   a recognised part in the public service.

   Of a somewhat kindred nature was their exception to separate Collects,
   which, usually embodying only one brief petition, were unnecessarily
   encumbered, each with a preface naming the attributes of GOD, as well
   as a conclusion appealing to the merits of Christ's intercession. It
   would be less interruption, they said, to the general flow of prayer to
   combine the subjects of several in one of greater length.

   Another claim under the first head was that the Liturgy should not be
   so strictly imposed as to exclude the exercise of "the gift of prayer,"
   and that liberty of curtailing the stated forms be granted in view of
   affording opportunity for extempore effusions at the minister's
   discretion.

   Under the second head they desired the abolition of the ornaments of
   the ministers and ceremonial usages, singling out for especial
   animadversion the wearing of the surplice, the sign of the Cross, and
   kneeling at the Holy Communion.

   Under the last, restricting public worship as far as possible to
   Sundays, they took exception to the observance of Saints' Days and
   Vigils, and pleaded for the discontinuance of the title of Holy Days by
   which they had been commonly designated.

   The Bishops feel their strength and resist concession.

   These objections [194] were laid before the Assembly at their next
   sitting. Written replies were drawn up, followed by rejoinders on the
   Presbyterian side, and time passed on without any advance being made
   towards union or reconciliation. The Bishops became daily more and more
   encouraged by a variety of circumstances to make a bold stand for the
   absolute integrity of their worship; and they assumed a more peremptory
   tone towards their antagonists. They were provoked to the last degree
   by the conduct of Baxter. In defiance of the terms under which they had
   been called together, iii total disregard for antiquity, for the
   accumulated treasure of Liturgical forms, in many of which thirty
   generations had expressed their wants and done homage to the Creator,
   he was bold to substitute for the sanction of the Conference a
   Service-book of his own, [195] whose claim for acceptance he based upon
   the fact that it contained nothing in common with the existing Liturgy,
   with a Book, that is, which his opponents next to the Bible held
   dearest in the world.

   Baxter's Liturgy.

   The story of its composition, though it fills us with wonder, cannot
   but touch us by the simplicity of character which it betokens. He tells
   in his own words how, when the idea of a Reformed Liturgy had been
   conceived, he laid everything aside and shut out the world till he had
   carried the work to completion.

   "Hereupon," he says, "I departed from them and came among them no more
   till I had finished my task, which was a fortnight's time." While all
   the pomp and circumstance of Religious worship was breaking out with
   fresh vigour after long suppression, while every Rite and Ceremony
   which could enhance the splendour of the Coronation Service was being
   enacted in Westminster Abbey, a single divine in solitude and
   retirement, with no other help than his Bible and Paraphrase, was
   elaborating page by page a book which, in the infatuation of a
   beclouded judgment, he persuaded himself would be acceptable to the
   nation. And this, the result of fourteen brief days' labour, he did not
   scruple to propose as a substitute for one which had grown with the
   Church's growth, and rooted itself in the heart and affections of the
   people.

   The laying on the table of the Committee-room of that Reformed Liturgy
   did almost more than anything to wreck the Presbyterian cause.

   His work indorsed by his colleagues.

   It may be said that Baxter was only one, but his colleagues fathered
   his proposal, and so made themselves responsible for his act. That the
   adoption of a course so ill-timed, so devoid of all common sense, so
   certain to carry destruction with it, should have been even possible,
   is almost past belief. It is evidence of no little forbearance in the
   party in power that they did not break up the Conference in disgust at
   the revolutionary spirit in which their opponents were prepared to
   sacrifice most hallowed traditions, and at the self-confidence which
   demanded every concession from others, but refused to make any in
   return.

   A final attempt at agreement.

   However, after much written matter had been interchanged between them,
   the Bishops consented to a debate on equal terms. Three were chosen on
   either side, Pearson, Gunning, and Sparrow on one, Baxter, Jacomb, and
   Bates on the other. It is needless to tell with what result. We know
   the respective characters of the chief disputants, Gunning and Baxter,
   and no annalist is required to record the issue of a debate between
   them.

   Cosin makes a definite proposal.

   Before, however, the expiration of the time to which the Session of the
   Conference was limited, Cosin made a final effort to gather up the
   threads of controversy, by calling upon the complainants to divide
   their objections to the Prayer-book, stating what they opposed as
   sinful, what as inexpedient. A subtle argument was carried on for some
   time, in which the Presbyterians attacked the Book as unscriptural, and
   therefore sinful, in eight particulars, [196] but it was as hopeless as
   the discussions which preceded it, and the Conference terminated,
   Morley and Baxter having consented to report to the King that they were
   all agreed as to the ends, viz., the unity, peace, and welfare of the
   Church, but after all their debates were disagreed on the means.

   During the sittings or shorly after, several events occurred which
   tended greatly to the re-establishment of the ancient Forms of worship
   in the Church.

   Divers causes contributing to the restoration of Episcopacy.

   I. The Coronation in Westminster Abbey.

   II. The burning of the Solemn League and Covenant.

   III. The passing by the house of Commons of an Act of Uniformity with
   the restored Prayer-book.

   IV. The introduction of a Bill for the return of the Spiritual Lords to
   their seats in Parliament.

   Let us look at them separately.

   The Ceremonial of the Coronation.

   I. As soon as the Coronation-day (April 22d) was fixed, the records of
   the past were ransacked to furnish precedents for all the details of
   the solemnity, that nothing in the way of Ecclesiastical pomp which had
   characterised similar occasions might be wanting. So strong in the
   minds of the King's counsellors was the reaction from the studied
   absence of Ceremonial which had marked the Commonwealth, that the
   Ritual exceeded in splendour and magnificence anything that even
   Westminster Abbey with all its tale of Ecclesiastical and Regal pageant
   had ever witnessed. The Presbyterians who were present must have heaved
   a deep sigh as they read the unmistakable evidence that Catholic
   worship was on the eve of full restoration, and that Episcopacy, which
   they had dethroned and trampled in the dust, would soon lift up its
   head on every side.

   It was an Episcopal ceremony from beginning to end. The Archbishop
   poured the anointing oil. A Bishop preached the sermon: a second read
   the Gospel, a third the Epistle. Bishops were foremost in the
   procession, and foremost in the reception of: Royal favour, chosen to
   walk at the King's side under a Canopy borne by the Lords temporal, and
   permitted to kiss the King's cheek before any one not of royal blood.

   No matter that Presbyterians had been placed on the list of His
   Majesty's Chaplains, [197] they were rigidly excluded from taking any
   official part in the proceedings.

   This was the first direct blow which their cause received.

   II. It was followed by a second quickly after.

   The Solemn League.

   The Solemn League and Covenant [198] pledged the Covenanters to uphold
   in this country the Reformed worship and discipline, which had been
   established in Scotland, and to extirpate Prelacy, which was said to be
   linked with superstition and heresy, and contrary to sound doctrine and
   the power of godliness.

   It had been accepted by the Assembly of West- minster Divines, when
   with circumstances of an unusual significance they had met, Sept. 25,
   1643 A.D., in St. Margaret's Church under the shadow of the Abbey, and
   in the presence of the House of Commons, who adjourned to witness the
   solemnity, they lifted up their hands and swore to maintain its
   provisions.

   It was not enough that it had been set aside informally at the King's
   restoration; the nation must wash its hands from the stain, and the
   renun- ciation be as publicly marked as the acceptance had been. The
   House of Commons resolved that the ill-starred document should be
   destroyed in such a manner as to leave no doubt of their utter
   abhorrence of it. A decree was accordingly passed that a copy of it
   should be burnt by the public hangman in Palace Yard at Westminster,
   and another in the most crowded parts of the city, that all might see.
   [199]

   And the journal [200] of the period describes the execution of the
   sentence: "The hangman did his part perfectly well, for having kindled
   his fire he tore the document into many pieces and first burned the
   preface and then cast each part solemnly into the flames, lifting up
   his hands and eyes, and not leaving the least shred, but burnt it root
   and branch." And the scene was reproduced in the provinces. At
   Southampton, [201] amidst the, firing of cannon and public rejoicing,
   the hated scroll was plucked from a neighbouring Church, where it had
   been honoured with a stately setting in a conspicuous position, and
   thrown into the fire. At Bury St. Edmunds an effigy of a notorious
   criminal, who had been hanged, was paraded through the streets with a
   copy of the League fastened under his arm and the Directory in his
   hand, and after being subjected to every possible indignity was torn
   piecemeal and destroyed.

   The Act of Uniformity.

   III. The third step towards the re-establishment of the old worship was
   the introduction of a Bill into Parliament to bring back the Book of
   Common Prayer.

   The very day after the King landed on the English shores, to the
   unspeakable joy of many who heard it, the proscribed Liturgy was read
   in Canterbury Cathedral, whither he turned aside on his journey to give
   thanks to GOD. Again, in the Houses of Parliament the old forms had
   been revived after the silence of well-nigh twenty years, and in many
   Churches where the incumbents sympathised with the Restoration the
   Directory was at once discarded, for though the law for its enforcement
   was not yet repealed, they had no misgivings that it might be broken
   with impunity. But the newly elected Parliament, Royalist and
   Episcopalian as they were in overwhelming numbers, were impatient to
   place everything connected with the worship of the Church in an
   unassailable position. So long as the Directory was sanctioned by the
   Statute-book, those who professed the Presbyterian Faith were free to
   use it without molestation. Such liberty must be curtailed without
   delay. On June 29th "A Bill for Uniformity of Public Worship and the
   administration of Sacraments" was introduced in the House of Commons.

   Search was made for the original manuscript of the Second Prayer-book
   of Edward VI. to be affixed to the Bill; but whether it could not be
   discovered, or whether it was discovered but proved distasteful to the
   promoters of the Bill, or from some other unknown cause, its intended
   place was taken by that of King James, as amended at Hampton Court.
   [202] The Bill passed its third reading on July 9th, and was sent to
   the Upper House. They, however, deferred the consideration of it, both
   because they wished to await the result of the Savoy Conference, and
   also from a feeling that such a question could only be discussed at a
   disadvantage till after the readmission into their body of the
   spiritual Lords.

   IV. And this brings us to the last measure, which paved the way so
   securely and effectively for the Caroline Settlement.

   The Bishops restored to their seats in the Legislature.

   In the first year of the Long Parliament a determined effort was made,
   and again and again renewed, to exclude the Bishops from their seats in
   the Legislature. Hatreds of them was stirred up and fostered by a
   variety of charges. On one occasion they were actually threatened with
   personal violence on their way to the House. They appealed for the
   protection of the law, and not satisfied with this, injudiciously went
   on to declare that any measure passed during their enforced absence
   would be null and void. They were at once impeached for high treason,
   condemned and sent to the Tower, and the Bill to deprive them of their
   privilege was hurried forward and passed its third reading within a few
   days, Feb. 5, 1642 A.D.

   This was the history of their exclusion. When Charles II. returned the
   Bishops' Bench had been vacant for eighteen years.

   The House of Commons voted for the restitution of their ancient rights,
   but strangely enough, owing mainly to the hesitation of the King
   founded on some Papist misrepresentations, [203] it was Nov. 20th
   before they were able to take their seats. To commemorate the event the
   King went to the House in person, and the junior Bishop [204] was
   desired to open the sitting with prayer.

   The combination of forces was now complete, and the total discomfiture
   of the Presbyterian cause was only a matter of time.

   The results of the Conference.

   The result of the Savoy Conference was duly notified to the King. After
   waiting till October, he sent letters to the Primate to lay before
   Convocation, ordering them to proceed with the revision of the
   Prayer-book. They met on Nov. 21, and without delay nominated a
   Committee of Bishops to carry out the work. Considering the action
   which the House of Commons had taken, they regarded the business of
   pressing urgency, and directed that they should meet daily except
   Sundays till the revision was completed. It has been asserted [205]
   that the appointed Revisionists did not act separately, but that
   immediately after their appointment Convocation repented of having
   delegated its powers to a small body, and resolving themselves into a
   Committee of the whole House, proceeded at once with the work.

   The uncertainty of the course adopted by Convocation.

   There is unquestionably much uncertainty, but on the whole we are
   disposed to think that the appointment was not rescinded, but that the
   members of Convocation decided to sit simultaneously with the
   Revisionists, so as to consider without delay the recommendations of
   the Committee to be laid before them day by day. An incidental note in
   Sancroft's handwriting, in Cosin's "corrected copy," in reference to
   proposed alterations in the Communion Office, stating that "my lords
   the bishops at Elie House ordered all in the old method," seems
   inexplicable on the theory that the work had been taken out of their
   hands.

   Let us look in now upon the Committee of Revision. The place of meeting
   was the house situated in the Hatton garden of historic memory in
   connection with Queen Elizabeth's threat to unfrock the "proud
   Prelate." [206]

   The Committee appointed for the final revision.

   They were eight in number, Cosin of Durham, Morley of Worcester, Warner
   of Rochester, Sanderson of Lincoln, Henchman of Salisbury, Nicholson of
   Gloucester, Skinner of Oxford, and Wren of Ely. Sancroft was appointed
   to act as Secretary. Of the Bishops the first four had been members of
   the Savoy Conference.Wren. Of the remaining three Wren alone was
   greatly distinguished. Memories of the most touching interest cluster
   round his name. Perhaps no one suffered more persecution at the hands
   of the Puritans, and in the estimation of his persecutors he deserved
   even more than he underwent. Prom his early years he was fiercely
   opposed to dissent, and for this reason was translated from Hereford to
   the turbulent See of Norwich, where schism was rifer than elsewhere. It
   is said that he ruled with such a high hand that its chief town was
   crippled in its manufacture and suffered great loss of wealth from the
   immense emigration of weavers who sought liberty of conscience on
   foreign shores. [207]

   From Norwich he was transferred to the important diocese and Palatinate
   of Ely, owing his promotion to his knowledge of law, both civil and
   ecclesiastical, which was requisite for the office.

   His rigid enforcement of Church discipline, and his attachment to
   Catholic doctrine, raised bitter hostility against him during the
   Commonwealth, and after being subjected to a succession of calumnious
   slanders, be was impeached before the Commons for "high crimes and
   misdemeanours," condemned, and thrown into the Tower. Here he remained
   for eighteen years, so cheerful throughout and resigned to the
   seventies of his confinement that, as the Historian says, "the Church
   beheld his sufferings and saw by him that nothing in Christianity was
   impossible, and the world did almost pardon his enemies for the
   pleasure and benefit of his example."

   It was round his table at Ely House in that memorable winter that the
   Commissioners sat to establish for many generations the Liturgical
   forms and ceremonies in which the worship of the English Church was to
   be offered up.

   They carried out their work with such expedition that they laid
   themselves open to a charge of inconsiderate haste, but in reality the
   revision had long been anticipated and prepared for with the utmost
   care and judgment.

   Revision made easy by Cosin' preceding labours.

   There was a great mass of well-digested material ready to hand, which
   had been accumulating almost from the beginning of the century. Wren
   [208] himself; in conjunction with Laud, had revised the Scotch
   Liturgy, and during his long imprisonment had weighed well the
   questions in dispute, particularly the deficiencies of the Anglican
   Ritual, always buoying himself up with the conviction that the time for
   a reaction was not far distant.

   But the man whose labours contributed most to the final result was
   Cosin, who had been named as President of the Commission.

   So early as 1619 A.D., he had made a collection of "notes" in an
   interleaved Prayer-book, and three or four [209] documents of a similar
   kind succeeded at intervals. The Revisers had little more to do than
   decide which of the proposed alterations should be accepted, and desire
   their Secretary to note down their decision for the approval of
   Convocation. A careful comparison of "the notes" with the Book as
   finally published shows that about ninety in every hundred alterations
   were in accordance with Cosin's suggestions.

   There was a departure from the ordinary rules in respect to the
   Northern Convocation. In consequence of the difficulties and delay in
   transmitting messages between the North and South, the habit of
   discussing the questions separately was broken through, and deputies
   were sent from York, to sit and vote in the Houses of Canterbury.

   The changes very numerous.

   When the Revision was finished it was found that six hundred changes
   [210] great and small had been made.

   The doctrinal changes were by no means numerous, but, such as they
   were, they testified definitely to the Catholic spirit of the Revision.

   Doctrinal changes.

   The "priesthood" was more distinctly marked. At the Savoy Conference,
   the Presbyterians had pleaded for the substitution of "minister"
   throughout the rubrics in place of "priest." The object of their
   request was fully understood, for it went to the very root of the
   dissensions between the Church and Nonconformity. "No Priest, no
   Church" was a maxim which had been handed down from St. Jerome's [211]
   time, and the Bishops might have appealed to it with no little force,
   but they replied with calmness and simplicity that it was "unreasonable
   that the word minister should only be used in the Liturgy, since some
   parts might be performed by a deacon, others by none under the order of
   a priest, viz., absolution and consecration; it was fit therefore that
   some such word as priest should be used for these offices, and not
   minister, which signified at large every one that ministered in that
   holy office of whatsoever order he might be." [212] And now the
   Committee determined to place the meaning of the Bishop's reply beyond
   dispute.

   They displaced "minister" and "pastor" and substituted "priest" [213]
   in two important places. The Absolution was henceforward to be
   pronounced by a "priest," and the suffrage in the Litany for "Bishops,
   pastors, and ministers," was in future to be made for "Bishops,
   priests, and deacons."

   Again, the Presbyterians in their arguments for the identity of the
   office of Bishop and Priest had laid stress on the fact that no
   distinction of functions was recognised in the Ordinal.

   The old form in the Consecration of a Bishop, "Take the Holy Ghost, and
   remember that thou stirre up the grace of GOD which is in thee by
   imposition of hands," was altered to the present form: "Receive the
   Holy Ghost, for the office and work of a bishop in the Church of GOD."
   [214]

   A corresponding addition was made to the words used in the ordering of
   Priests: viz., "for the Office and Work of a Priest."

   In the Prayer for the Church Militant, [215] though they were unable to
   recover all that had been lost by the omission of a prayer for the dead
   with which it closed in the First Prayer-book of Edward VI., they took
   an important step for vindicating a recognition of "the Communion of
   Saints" by inserting the beautiful thanksgiving for the life and
   example of those who had departed in the faith and fear of GOD.

   The Presbyterians had conceived a dislike for the title of "Church,"
   and adopted "congregation" instead. No less than four [216] changes
   were made in connection with this to avoid even the slightest
   suspicion, to which the adoption of the latter term might have given
   rise, in favour of the Presbyterian form of Church Government.

   In the Communion Office, other changes were introduced. Provision was
   made for the "Lesser Oblation," the presentation of the Elements on the
   Altar, by prefixing the rubric to the Prayer for the Church Militant,
   "and when there is a Communion, the Priest shall then place upon the
   Table as much Bread and Wine as he shall think sufficient," and further
   by inserting the word "oblation," to be used in the prayer itself, of
   the Elements after their dedication to GOD.

   Again, greater reverence was shown for that portion of the Consecrated
   Bread and Wine which remained unconsumed, by a direction that the same
   should be covered "with a fair linen cloth;" and also by the
   introduction of the sixth of the final rubrics, ordering that "if any
   remain of that which was consecrated . the Priest and such other of the
   Communicants as he shall then call unto him, shall, immediately after
   the Blessing, reverently eat and drink the same."

   The Black Rubric reintroduced in an altered form.

   It has often however been maintained that the reintroduction of the
   "Black Rubric," or the "Declaration of Kneeling" may well be set over
   against all the alterations which were made in a Catholic direction;
   but such a theory will be found untenable when subjected to
   examination.

   It was no doubt originally introduced into the Second. Prayer-book of
   Edward VI. as a concession to the Puritan party. There is therefore
   some prima facie force in the above argument, but it is entirely
   destroyed by the alteration of the wording which the Revisionists made
   before reinserting it. On its first appearance it ran thus: "We do
   declare that thereby (i.e. by kneeling) no adoration is intended . . .
   unto any real and essential presence there being of Christ's natural
   Flesh and Blood." On its reintroduction by the Caroline Revisionists it
   was worded, "unto any Corporrl Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and
   Blood." The first traversed the Catholic doctrine of a Real Presence:
   the second simply denied Transubstantiation. This Declaration, which
   has been interpreted as a concession to the Presbyterians, who shrank
   from kneeling on doctrinal grounds, was really couched in such
   well-chosen language, that while it appeared conciliatory to them, it
   in no way discredited the highest Sacramental teaching of the Anglican
   Church.

   Such were some of the chief changes resulting from the last revision.
   It has been thought a matter for wonder that with Cosin in the Chair,
   and Wren to sympathise with and support him, the Committee should not
   have carried restoration further on the lines of the First Prayer-book.

   Cosin precluded from very extensive reform.

   Attempts we know were made, but unhappily without success. [217] Cosin
   had remodelled the Prayer of Consecration, introducing the Invocation
   of the Holy Ghost for the sanctification of the Elements, and had
   brought back the Prayer of Oblation to its proper place. The
   Revisionists, however, declined to accept his proposals. Their motive
   in doing so was not prompted by disapprobation, but by a desire to
   adhere as strictly as possible to their letters of instruction. And
   these were so unfortunately worded that they could hardly fail to be
   diversely interpreted. One party laid stress upon that portion which
   directed them "to compare the services with the most ancient
   Liturgies," while the other attached paramount importance to another
   portion in which they were ordered "to avoid all unnecessary
   alterations."

   The Committee finished their work, and the Revised Book was subscribed
   on December 20th.

   The Sealed Books.

   Measures were taken to insure its integrity being preserved. [218]
   Certain printed copies were carefully examined by a Committee appointed
   for the purpose, and each attested by the Great Seal of England. [219]
   Each Cathedral was ordered to procure one of these, and after having
   its name legibly stamped on the cover, to lay it up among its archives
   as an ultimate standard of reference in case of dispute. A copy was
   also sent to the Tower, while four more were deposited in the several
   Courts at Westminster. It was an omen of sinister import for the part
   the Book was unhappily destined to play in legal proceedings, that it
   should be deemed necessary that each Court should be furnished with a
   copy of its own.

   The copy which belonged to the King's Bench has come down to us in good
   preservation, and retains that which was their distinguishing feature,
   viz., the Great Seal perfect, still attached by the original cords; the
   rest of the Legal Copies are preserved, though in a far less perfect
   condition, in the Public Record Office. Of those acquired by Capitular
   bodies, three, which are in possession of St. Paul's, Christ Church,
   and Ely Cathedral respectively, have been collated.

   The Act of Uniformity.

   The Act of Uniformity received the Royal Assent, May 19, 1662 A.D. And
   it was enjoined by Statute that the use of the Revised Book of Common
   Prayer should be obligatory upon all ministers after the ensuing Feast
   of St. Bartholomew (Aug. 24), before which date they were called upon
   to declare their "unfeigned assent and consent to all and everything
   contained and preserved therein." The King, felt scruples in signing
   the document, after the readiness he had so frequently expressed to
   grant "liberty to tender consciences," but he was overruled by the
   wisdom of his Parliament and Convocation, and the principles and
   worship of the Church were preserved whole and entire.

   The consequences.

   The result is known to every one. "Black Bartholomew" witnessed the
   ejection of eighteen hundred [220] Presbyterians who refused to
   conform.

   The terms perhaps unduly stringent.

   It can hardly be denied that there is some justice in the complaints of
   those who suffered, both as to the manner in which the operation of the
   Act was enforced, as well as to the stringency of the terms of
   conformity. The first proposal was that it should not come into force
   till Michaelmas, but the time was afterwards curtailed, and apparently
   not without malice prépense, in order that the nonconforming ministers
   might lose the tithes for the current year, the Feast of St. Michael
   being the day when they fell due.

   Again, the hardship was aggravated by an unwarrantable delay in not
   publishing the Revised Book till the beginning of August, so that the
   Presbyterians were kept in suspense as to whether they would be able to
   conform to it or not; it was actually said that in some cases assent
   was demanded before the Book had even been seen. [221]

   Baxter sets an example of constancy.

   One of the first to refuse was Richard Baxter. After the eagerness
   which he had shown at the Savoy Conference in attempting to supersede
   the Prayer-book entirely, compliance with it at this juncture would
   have exposed him to the reproach of every honest-minded man: and he
   lost no time in making his decision known, hoping that its publicity at
   this early stage would influence the conduct of others who looked to
   him for guidance.

   Reynolds yeilds.

   Reynolds, on the other hand, subscribed and retained his preferment. He
   was not so deeply committed as his friend, but it was a bitter
   disappointment to many, who would have rejoiced in the deposition of a
   Bishop as affording the strongest evidence of the force of Puritan
   convictions.

   The Presbyterian farewells.

   The Sunday preceding the ill-fated Saint's Day was commonly agreed upon
   for the pastors who stood firm to take leave of their flocks.
   Nonconformist writers have excited compassion by the graphic pictures
   they have drawn of the scenes enacted on that mournful day. Happily we
   may compassionate men in affliction without admitting the justice of
   their grievance.

   Calamy had gathered into his chapel, Sunday after Sunday, greater
   crowds than congregated anywhere else. Thomas Lye, Philip Henry, Oliver
   Heywood, Jacomb, Lamb, and many others were deservedly beloved, and
   their parting words drew tears of genuine sorrow from many eyes, but
   neither the faith which they professed, nor the commission which they
   bore as unepiscopally ordained, belonged to the Church whose offices
   and ministry they had unjustly usurped.

   The impossibility of reconciliation without sacrifice of great
   principles.

   It is idle to talk of opportunities of comprehension lost, and bewail
   that men who might have been friends were confirmed in hostility; any
   compromise which would have satisfied them would have ruined the
   Church. It was not merely that they advocated a system of worship alien
   to long-established usage, but they claimed for the Presbytery a right
   which all through the Church's history has been the sole prerogative of
   the Episcopate. However much then we may be touched with the sufferings
   of the ejected ministers, we cannot call them wrongs, nor see how they
   could have been averted without surrendering fundamental doctrines, and
   severing the Church of the Restoration from the Church of the
   Apostles.The last settlement at the bar of history. The Caroline
   Settlement has amply justified itself, and proved the soundness of the
   principles upon which it was made. Criticism is well-nigh disarmed when
   we point to the fact that it has maintained its ground for two
   centuries and a quarter. It survived the shock of the Nonjuring
   Secession, it survived the deadness and coldness of the Georgian
   period, which would have destroyed the vitality of a weaker
   constitution, and has become in this generation the root and source of
   a new outburst of Catholic faith and zeal almost unequalled in the
   Church's history.

   We believe then that every loyal Churchman may look back to it with
   satisfaction.

   The Church passed through a crisis of almost unparalleled gravity. Her
   enemies were never more formidable either in numbers, or influence, or
   intellectual power. Happily it befell at a time when she was able to
   confront them at every point, and it is a matter for most grateful
   acknowledgment that with many temptations to yield for the sake of
   peace, her defenders maintained the contest to the end without making a
   single concession calculated in any way to compromise her position as a
   true and rightful branch of the

     ONE CATHOLIC AND APOSTOLIC CHURCH.

   the passions and uncharitableness of the times have produced several
   Opinions in religion, by which men are engaged in parties and
   animosities against each other; which, when they shall hereafter unite
   in a freedom of conversation will be composed or better understood; we
   do declare a liberty to tender consciences, and that no man shall he
   disquieted or called in question, for differences of opinion in matters
   of religion, which do not disturb the peace of the kingdom; and that we
   shall be ready to consent to such an Act of Parliament as upon mature
   deliberation, shall be offered to us, for the full granting that
   indulgence."

   [185] For a full account, cf. Appendix III. Archbishop Whitgift,
   Bishops Bancroft, Matthew, Bilson, and Deans Andrewes, Overall, and
   Barlow were the chief on the Catholic side. The Puritans were
   represented by Reynolds, Sparks, Knewstub, and Chaderton.

   [186] The Knights of the Shires named two or more representative, from
   each county. They numbered 120, of whom all but a very few were avowed
   enemies of the Church. They met first on July 1st, 1643 A.D., 69
   members answering their names. The Prelates who accepted the invitation
   in the first instances soon discontinued their attendance.

   [187] Churchmen : Frewen, Sheldon, Cosin, King, Warner, Sanderson,
   Morley, Henchman, Laney, Sterne, Walton, and Gauden, with coadjutors,
   Earles, Heylin, Barwick, Gunning, Hacket, Pearson, Pierce, Sparrow, and
   Thorndike. Presbyterians : Reynolds, Baxter, Tuckney, Wallis, Manton,
   Conant, Spurstow, Calamy, Jackson, Case, Newcomen and Clark, with
   coadjutors, Jacomb, Bates, Horton, Rawlinson, Lightfoot, Collins,
   Cooper, Drake, and Woodbridge.

   [188] He owed so much to Overall that he used to designate him his
   "lord, and master." He became his librarian in 1616 A.D.

   [189] He was impeached before the House of Lords 1641 A.D., and fled to
   Paris.

   [190] Gunning is supposed to have yielded to the objections of the
   Presbyterians, and gathered into one the substance of several prayers
   for the king, clergy, and others, originally used at the close of the
   Litany. In favour of this view Wheatley has quoted the tradition that
   in St. John's College Chapel, Cambridge, of which Gunning was master,
   this was never read at Evensong, because its composer had intended it
   to take the place of prayers which had been associated with the Litany,
   and belonged naturally to a morning service. The occurrence of the word
   "finally," when so little has preceded, suggests the idea that other
   petitions may have fallen out. There is no authority for the common
   belief that Bishop Sanderson was the composer of it.

   [191] This also has been assigined to Bishop Sanderson; but from the
   Records of Convocation it appears that Bishop Reynolds prepared a "Form
   of general thanksgiving," and presented it on December 14th, 1661 A.D.
   LATUBURY's Hist. of Convoc., 289. KENNET'S Register, 579.

   [192] A considerable number of them had been embodied in the form of
   petition, which was presented to King James on his accession. The
   petition prayed that these offences following, some may be removed,
   some amended, some qualified: "In the Church Service, that the Cross in
   baptism, interrogatories ministered to infants, confirmations, as
   superfluous, may be taken away, . . . the cap and surplice not urged;
   that examinations may go before the Communion; that it be ministered
   with a sermon; that divers terms of priests and absolution and some
   other used, with the ring in marriage, and other such like in the book,
   may be corrected . . . church-songs and music moderated to better
   edification, . . . no ministers charged to teach their people to bow at
   the Name of Jesus; that the Canonical Scriptures only he read in
   Church." CARDW. Confer. 132.

   [193] Cf. p. 7.

   [194] The exceptions of the ministers, both general and particular, as
   well as the answers of the Bishops, are printed in full in CARDWELL'S
   Conferences, vii,

   [195] There is no doubt that it is a remarkable production, though it
   ill-deserves the high praise given to it by Dr. Johnson, as "one of the
   first compostions of a ritual kind that he had ever seen." It contains
   services for the LORD'S Day, for the Holy Communion and Baptism, for
   marriage, with directions for the visitation of the sick, for the
   burial of the dead; a discourse on preparatory catechising before
   Communion, also on Church discipline, with forms of confession,
   absolution and exclusion, special prayers and thanksgivings, and an
   Appendix containing a long Litany or general prayer, and an ascription
   of praise for man's redemption. Cf. BAXTER's Works, Lond. 1830: vol.
   xv. p. 449.

   [196] 1. That no minister baptize without the transient image of the
   cross. 2. That no minister may read or pray that dare not wear a
   surplice. 3. That none be admitted to Communion that dare not receive
   it kneeling. 4. That ministers be forced to pronounce all baptized
   infants to be regenerate. 5. That ministers be forced to deliver the
   Sacrament to the unfit. 6. Or to absolve the unfit, and that in
   absolute expressions. 7. Or to give thanks for all who they bury. 8. Or
   to subscribe the Prayer Book as containing nothing contrary to the Word
   of God. CARDW. Conf. c. vi. COLL. Vii. 440. The charges were unfounded,
   and the orders of hte Church wilfully misrepresented. When e.g. does
   the Church direct the ministry to do what 5 and 6 assume that she does?

   [197] The Earl of Manchester, who favoured the Presbyterians, obtained
   the King's consent to appoint ten of the number to be Royal Chaplains.
   Only four, however, Baxter, Reynolds, Calamy, and Spurstow, were ever
   invited to officiate at Court. Reynolds afterwards became Bishop of
   Norwich. The See of Hereford was also offered to Baxter, and that of
   Lichfield and Coventry to Calamy, but both were declined.

   [198] The Covenant was subscribed not only by the appointed
   Commissioners and Assembly of Divines, but also by the members of both
   Houses of Parliament. The King however issued a proclamation, dated
   October 9th, forbidding his subjects to accept it. For a copy of it,
   cf. FULLER'S Ch. Hist. iii. 450; STOUGHTON'S Eccles. Hist. ii. 535.

   [202] The Prayer-Book of 1604 A.D. differed from its predecessor in the
   following particulars: in the rubric before the form of absolution was
   added "or remission of sins," in the rubrics in the office for Private
   Baptism it was directed that the Sacrament should be administered only
   by a "lawful minister." The explanation of the Sacraments, by Bishop
   Overall, was added to the Catechism. A prayer for the Royal Family and
   special thanksgivings for rain, fair weather, etc. were added, and
   certain changes were made in the Apocryphal Lessons; cf. Appendix III.

   [203] The Earl of Bristol persuaded the King that the Bishops, if
   admitted to Parliament, would feel conscientiously bound to oppose
   concessions to the Roman Catholics, which his Majesty was desirous to
   make. Afterwards he was induced by the Chancellor to withdraw his
   opposition, and the Bill was got through, and received the Royal assent
   the very day on which Parliament was adjourned, July 30th.

   [213] It is worthy of note, as pointing to the entire disappearance in
   the minds of the leaders of Revision of all aversion to the title of
   "priest," that it was so largely re-introduced that it occurs now about
   the same number of times as it did in the First Prayer-book of Edward
   VI.

   [214] There is a letter extant, written by Dean Prideaux to one of
   Archbishop Sancroft's chaplains, stating his belief that this
   alteration was made without any respect to the Romanists, but "to
   silence a cavil of the Presbyterians, who, from an Ordinal, pretended
   to prove against us that there was no difference between the two
   functions, because the words of ordination said nothing to him (as a
   bishop) in the old Ordinal, which he had not afore as a priest." It
   bears date November 25th, 1687 A.D., and is given in full by CARDWELL's

   [218] Printers errors have nevertheless slipped in. One such is worthy
   of notice, as having led to a distinct breach of Church Rule.
   Originally the rubric after the Nicene Creed provided that the Banns of
   Marriage should be published then. In 1805 A.D. the Delegates of the
   Oxford Press omitted the words from the rubric on their own
   responsibility, to bring it, as they supposed, into agreement with an
   Act of George II., which ordered that the Banns be published "in the
   Morning Service, or Evening Service if there be no Morning Service,
   after the Second Lesson." They misread the object of the Act, which was
   not to interfere with the proper place for publication, viz., after the
   Nicene Creed, when the Creed was said, but to provide an alternative,
   where there was only Evening Service. DR. STEPHENS gave a legal opinion
   to the effect that the present prevailing custom of publishing after
   the Second Lesson in the Morning is "a flagrant breach" of Church
   Order.

   [219] For many interesting details the reader is referred to the Book
   of Common Prayer, edited by A. J. STEPHENS for the Ecclesiastical
   History Society, Introduction, clxxix-cc., and to JAMES PARKER's

APPENDIX I.

In the Gallican Liturgy.

   In the Introductory Chapter we spoke of the earliest Form of Liturgical
   Worship traceable in the records of the British Church.The Gallican
   Liturgy brough into Britain. And while we attributed its adoption to
   the visit of Germanus and Severus, who were sent as a deputation from
   Gaul to help the Britons to combat the Pelagian heresy, we observed
   that it was highly probable that the Liturgy which they brought with
   them was modified in some particulars, yet for the leading features we
   turn to the Gallican Form as it was used in the country from which it
   derived, its appellation. It was superseded, we said, by the Roman in
   England at the Council of Cloveshoo, 747 A.D., but one of the effects
   of the Norman Conquest was the Gallicanising of the country, and many
   variations from the Roman introduced into the Sarum have been
   attributed to the national prejudices of the Liturgical Reformer
   Osmund, the Norman Count.

   Points of resemblance between the Sarum Missal and the Gallican
   Liturgy.

   One peculiarity pointing in this direction has lately been noticed.
   [222] In the Sarum Liturgy the rubrics are cast in the imperative mood
   instead of the present or future indicative, as is usually the case.
   Now we may fairly conjecture that this was adopted from the Gallican;
   we are unable to speak positively, because no rubrics have yet been
   found belonging to this Liturgy. But in the Sister-Liturgy, the
   Mozarabic, used in the neighbouring country of Spain, and bearing such
   a close resemblance in its structure that their common origin has never
   been doubted, this characteristic distinction is found: e.g., In the
   Sarum, Let the Priest say; in the Mozarabic, Let the Priest say; but in
   the Roman, The Priest says.

   The original source of the Gallican Liturgy.

   The Gallican belonged by origin to the Ephesine family of Liturgies,
   and was in the first instance connected with St. John. The Church of
   Ephesus established Christianity in Gaul at an early date, radiating in
   all probability from Lyons over a great part of the country. In the
   second century, 177 A.D., we find the Christians of Lyons and Vienne
   [223] writing to the Churches in Asia and Phrygia, and seeking sympathy
   in their sufferings like children from a common mother.

   The Liturgy of Ephesus, varying in some degree to suit the country,
   became the Liturgy of France, and continued in use there till Pepin
   first introduced the Roman chant and psalmody, and Charlemagne
   completely supplanted it by imposing the Sacramentary of St. Gregory,
   and issued an edict that this should be strictly adhered to. Our
   interest however is but little diminished by the knowledge that before
   the Conquest it had ceased to be used in Gaul, or by the fact that the
   eighth century witnessed the discontinuance of it in its Anglican form
   in this country. The manner in which the highest act of Worship was
   performed during those centuries when this land was being claimed for
   Christ, and the Church set up upon the ruins of Paganism, is well
   worthy of our careful consideration, and on these grounds we have
   subjoined an outline of the Gallican Liturgy according to the plan
   which, with considerable difficulty and perhaps some uncertainty, the
   best Liturgiologists have been able to construct.

   The following is an outline of the structure of the Gallican Liturgy:
   [224] --

   An Anthem or Introit with "Glory be to the Father," etc. The mutual
   salutation of Priest and People, "The LORD be with you," etc.

   The Trisagion (in Greek and Latin), followed by Kyrie eleison.

   The Benedictus.

   A Lesson from (i.) the Prophets, (ii) an Epistle.

   The Benedicite. [225]

   The Gospel read at the Ambon, the clerks at the beginning making
   response, "Glory be to Thee, O LORD," and at the end, "Glory to GOD
   Almighty."

   Homilies, Prayers, and Collect, post precem.

   Departure of the Catechumens.

   The Preface or address on the day, and Collect.

   An Anthem, during which was made tho oblation of the Elements, and
   prayer for their sanctification.

   The recitation of the Diptychs, with prayers for the souls of the
   Saints named.

   Collects post nomina.

   Kiss of peace, [226] and Collect ad pacem.

   The Preface, i.e. the part beginning "It is meet and right," etc.

   The Tersanctus.

   The commencement of the Canon.

   The Consecration.

   The Collect post mysterium, or post secreta.

   The Fraction and the Commixture during the singing of an Anthem.

   A proper Preface.

   The LORD'S Prayer recited by the Priest and People.

   The Blessing, and the Priest's Communion.

   The Communicants approach the Altar.

   Two Collects, one post communionem, the other consummatio Missæ, with
   which the Service closed.

Appendix II.

The Order of the Communion

   On December 20th, 1547 A.D., an Act of Parliament was passed bearing
   the title, "An Act against such as shall unreverently speak against the
   Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, commonly called the
   Sacrament of the Altar, and for the receiving thereof in both kinds."
   This was drawn up in accordance with certain recommendations emanating
   from the Lower House of Convocation. The Committee of Divines, who had
   been appointed to revise the Liturgy, issued in the spring of the
   following year, March 8, 1548 A.D., their first instalment entitled
   "The Order of the Communion." It provided not only for the restoration
   of the Cup to the Laity, but supplied them with a Service-book, which
   was to be used whenever they communicated.

   We have thought fit to print it at length, not only because it has been
   frequently referred to in the preceding pages, but because from the
   nature of circumstances it must be full of interest to all who desire
   to trace the growth of the English Liturgy.

   The following is the Order of the Service: --

        First, the Parson, Vicar, or Curate, the next Sunday or Holyday, or at
        the least one day before he shall minister the Communion, shall give
        warning to his Parishioners, or those which be present, that they
        prepare themselves thereto, saying to them openly and plainly as
        hereafter followeth, or such like.

   The Order of the Communion

   Dear friends, and you especially upon whose souls I have cure and
   charge,        upon day next I do entend, by God's grace, to offer to
   all such as shall be thereto godly disposed, the most comfortable
   Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; to be taken of them in the
   remembrance of his most fruitful and glorious Passion: by the which
   Passion we have obtained remission of our sins, and be made partakers
   of the kingdom of heaven, whereof we be assured and ascertained, if we
   come to the said Sacrament with hearty repentance of our offences,
   stedfast faith in God's mercy, and earnest mind to obey God's will, and
   to offend no more: wherefore our duty is, to come to these holy
   Mysteries with most hearty thanks to be given to Almighty God for his
   infinite mercy and benefits given and bestowed upon us, his unworthy
   servants, for whom he bath not only given his Body to death, and shed
   his Blood, but also doth vouchsafe, in a Sacrament and Mystery, to give
   us his said Body and Blood spiritually to feed and drink upon. The
   which Sacrament being so divine and holy a thing, and so comfortable to
   them which receive it worthily, and so dangerous to them that will
   presume to take the same unworthily; my duty is to exhort you in the
   mean season to consider the greatness of the thing, and to search and
   examine your own consciences, and that not lightly, nor after the
   manner of dissimulers with God; but as they which should come to a most
   godly and heavenly banquet; not to come but in the marriage garment
   required of God in Scripture, that you may, so much as lieth in you, be
   found worthy to come to such a Table. The way and mean thereto is,

   The Order of the Communion

   First, That you be truly repentant of your former evil life, and that
   you confess with an unfeigned heart to Almighty God your sins and
   unkindness towards his Majesty, committed either by will, word, or
   deed, infirmity or ignorance ; and that with inward sorrow and tears
   you bewail your offences, and require of Almighty God mercy and pardon,
   promising to him from the bottom of your hearts, the amendment of your
   former life. And amonges all others, I am commanded of God especially
   to move and exhort you to reconcile yourselves to your neighbours whom
   you have offended, or who hath offended you, putting out of your hearts
   all hatred and malice against them, and to be in love and charity with
   all the world, and to forgive other, as you would that God should
   forgive you. And if there be any of you whose conscience is troubled
   and grieved in any thing, lacking comfort or counsel, let him come to
   me, or to some other discreet and learned Priest taught in the law of
   God, and confess and open his sin and grief secretly that he may
   receive such ghostly counsel, advice, and comfort, that his conscience
   may be relieved, and that of us, as a Minister of God, and of the
   Church, he may receive comfort and Absolution, to the satisfaction of
   his mind, and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness : requiring such
   as shall be satisfied with a general Confession not to be offended with
   them that doth use, to their further satisfying, the auricular and
   secret Confession to the Priest; nor those also, which think needful or
   convenient, for the quietness of their own consciences, particularly to
   open their sins to the Priest, to be offended with them which are
   satisfied with their humble confession to God, and the general
   Confession to the Church; but in all these things to follow and keep
   the rule of charity; and every man to be satisfied with his own
   conscience, not judging other men's minds or acts, where as he bath no
   warrant of God's Word for the same

   The Order of the Communion

        The time of the Communion shall be immediately after that the Priest
        himself hath received the Sacrament, without the varying of any other
        rite or ceremony in the Mass, (until other order shall be provided,) but
        as heretofore usually the Priest hath done with the Sacrament of the
        Body, to prepare, bless, and consecrate so much as will serve the
        people; so it shall yet continue still after the same manner and form,
        save that he shall bless and consecrate the biggest Chalice or some fair
        and convenient Cup or Cups full of Wine, with some Water put unto it.
        And that day not drink It up all himself, but taking only one sup or
        draught, leave the rest upon the Altar covered, and turn to them that
        are disposed to be partakers of the Communion, and shall thus exhort
        them as followeth.

   Dearly beloved in the Lord, ye, coming to this holy Communion, must
   consider what S. Paul writeth to the Corinthians, how he exhorteth all
   persons diligently to try and examine themselves, or ever they presume
   to eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup. For as the benefit is
   great, if with a truly penitent heart and lively faith we receive this
   holy Sacrament; (for then we spiritually eat the Flesh of Christ, and
   drink his Blood; then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us; we be made
   one with Christ, and Christ with us): So is the danger great, if we
   receive the same unworthily; for then we become guilty of the Body and
   Blood of Christ our Saviour; we eat and drink our own damnation,
   because we make no difference of the Lord's Body; we kindle God's wrath
   over us; we provoke him to plague us with divers diseases, and sundry
   kinds of death. Judge therefore yourselves (brethren), that ye be not
   judged of the Lord; let your mind be without desire to sin; repent you
   truly for your sins past; have an earnest and lively faith in Christ
   our Saviour; he in perfect charity with all men; so shall ye be meet
   partakers of these holy Mysteries. But above all things you must give
   most humble and hearty thanks to God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
   Ghost, for the redemption of the world by the Death and Passion of our
   Saviour Christ, both God and Man; who did humble himself, even to the
   death upon the Cross, for us miserable sinners, lying in darkness and
   the shadow of death; that he might make us the children of God, and
   exalt us to everlasting Life. And to the end that we alway should
   remember the exceeding love of our Master and only Saviour Jesus
   Christ, thus doing for us, and the innumerable benefits which by his
   precious blood-shedding he bath obtained to us; he hath left in these
   holy Mysteries, as a pledge of his love, and a continual remembrance of
   the same, his own blessed Body and precious Blood, for us spiritually
   to feed upon, to our endless comfort and consolation. To him therefore,
   with the Father and the Holy Ghost, let us give, as we are most bound,
   continual thanks; submitting ourselves wholly to his holy will and
   pleasure, and studying to serve him in true holiness and righteousness
   all the days of our life. Amen.

        Then the Priest shall say to them that be ready to take the Sacrament,

   If any man here be an open blasphemer, advouterer, in malice, or envy,
   or any other notable crime, and be not truly sorry therefore, and
   earnestly minded to leave the same vices, or that doth not trust
   himself to be reconciled to Almighty God, and in charity with all the
   world, let him yet a while bewail his sins, and not come to this holy
   Table, lest, after the taking of this most blessed Bread, the devil
   enter into him, as he did into Judas, to fulfil in him all iniquity,
   and to bring him to destruction, both of body and soul.

        Here the Priest shall pause a while, to see if any man will withdraw
        himself: and if he perceive any so to do, then let him common with him
        privily at convenient leisure, and see whether he can with good
        exhortation bring him to grace. Aud after a little pause, the Priest
        shall say,

   You that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins and offences
   committed to Almighty God, and be in love and charity with your
   neighbours, and intend to lead a new life, and heartily to follow the
   commandments of God, and to walk from henceforth in his holy ways; draw
   near, and take this holy Sacrament to your comfort, make your humble
   Confession to Almighty God, and to his holy Church, here gathered
   together in his Name, meekly kneeling upon your knees.

        Then shall a general Confession be made, in the name of all those that
        are minded to receive the holy Communion, either by one of them or else
        by one of the Ministers, or by the Priest himself; all kneeling humbly
        upon their knees,

   Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,
   Judge of all men; We knowledge and bewail our manifold sins and
   wickedness, which we, from time to time, most grievously have committed
   by thought, word, and deed, against thy divine Majesty, provoking most
   justly thy wrath and indignation against us. We do earnestly repent,
   and be heartily sorry for these our misdoings; the remembrance of them
   is grievous unto us; the burthen of them is intolerable. Have mercy
   upon us, have mercy upon us, most merciful Father; for thy Son our Lord
   Jesus Christ's sake forgive us all that is past; and grant that we may
   ever hereafter serve and please thee in newness of life, to the honour
   and glory of thy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

        Then shall the Priest stand up, and turning him to the people, say thus:

   Our blessed Lord, who hath left power to his Church to absolve penitent
   sinners from their sins, and to restore to the grace of the heavenly
   Father such as truly believe in Christ; Have mercy upon you; pardon and
   deliver you from all sins; confirm and strength you in all goodness;
   and bring you to everlasting life.

        Then shall the Priest stand up, and turning him to the people, say thus:

   Hear what comfortable words our Saviour Christ saith to all that truly
   turn to him

   Come unto me all that travail and be heavy loaden, and I shall refresh
   you. So God loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, to the
   end that all that believe in him should not perish, but have life
   everlasting.

   Hear also what S. Paul saith.

   This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be embraced and
   received, That Jesus Christ came into this world to save sinners.

   Hear also what S. John saith.

   If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous: he it is that obtained grace for our sins.

        Then shall the Priest kneel down and say, In the name of all them that
        shall receive the Communion, this prayer following:

   We do not presume to come to this thy Table (O merciful Lord) trusting
   in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies. We be
   not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy Table. But thou
   art the same Lord, whose property is always to have mercy: Grant us
   therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the Flesh of thy dear Son Jesus
   Christ, and to drink his Blood, in these holy Mysteries, that we may
   continually dwell in him, and he in us, that our sinful bodies may be
   made clean by his Body, and our souls washed through his most precious
   Blood. Amen.

        Then shall the Priest rise, the people still reverently kneeling, and
        the Priest shall deliver the Communion first to the Ministers, if any be
        there present, that they may be ready to help the Priest, and after to
        the other. And when he doth deliver the Sacrament of the Body of Christ,
        he shall say to every one these words following,

   The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee, preserve
   thy body unto everlasting life.

        And the Priest, delivering the Sacrament of the Blood, and giving every
        one to drink once and no more, shall say,

   The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for thee, preserve
   thy soul unto everlasting life.

        If there be a Deacon, or other Priest, then shall he follow with the
        Chalice; and as the Priest ministereth the bread, so shall he, for more
        expedition, minister the Wine, in form before written.

        Then shall the Priest turning him to the people, let the people depart
        with this blessing:

   The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and
   minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our
   Lord.

        To the which the people shall answer,

      Amen.

        Note, that the Bread that shall be consecrated shall be such as
        heretofore hath been accustomed. And every of the said consecrated
        Breads shall be broken in two pieces, at the least, or more, by the
        discretion of the Minister, and so distributed. And men must not think
        less to be received in part than in the whole, but in each of then the
        whole Body of our Saviour Jesu Christ.

        Note, that if it doth so chance that the Wine hallowed and consecrate
        doth not suffice or be enough for them that do take the Communion, the
        Priest, after the first Cup or Chalice be emptied, may go again to the
        Altar, and reverently and devoutly prepare and consecrate another, and
        so the third, or more likewise, beginning at these words, Simili modo
        postquam coenatume est, and ending at these words Qui pro vobis et pro
        multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum, and without any levation or
        lifting up.

APPENDIX III

In the Hampton Court Conference.

   It may have been thought that, in treating of the crises through which
   the Book of Common Prayer has passed, we might have added a fifth
   epoch, and drawn out the details of its history at the beginning of
   King James I.'s reign. The reason which has prompted, us to relegate
   this to a brief and supplementary page against our inclination (for no
   episode could be found which lends itself so readily for description),
   is the consciousness that, in estimating the importance of its results,
   this period is found to be wholly unworthy of the attention which the
   rest are entitled to.

   The hopes of the Puritans revived on the accession of James I.

   Inasmuch, however, as it did leave its mark upon the contents of the
   Service-books, we have placed before our readers a summary of the
   proceedings of the Council, drawn in the main from original documents.
   [227] Upon the accession of James I. in 1603 A.D., the Puritans were
   full of hope that their grievances against the existing Forms and
   Ceremonies of Worship would receive a favourable consideration.
   Accordingly a Petition purporting to be signed by "a thousand of His
   Majesty's subjects and ministers," hence called "the Millenary
   Petition," in which they embodied their objections, was presented to
   him shortly after his arrival in England.

   It was couched in these terms: --

   "MOST GRACIOUS AND DREAD SOVEREIGN,

   "We, the ministers of the gospel in this land, neither as factious men,
   affecting a popular parity in the Church, nor as schismatics, aiming at
   the dissolution of the state ecclesiastical,The Millenary Petition.
   but, as the faithful servants of Christ and loyal subjects to your
   Majesty, desiring and longing for the redress of divers abuses of the
   Church, could do no less, in our obedience to God, service to your
   Majesty, and love to his Church, than acquaint your princely Majesty
   with our particular griefs.

   "Our humble suit, then, unto your Majesty is that these offences
   following, some may be removed, some amended, some qualified:--In the
   Church service: that the cross in Baptism, interrogatories ministered
   to infants, Confirmations, as superfluous, may be taken away: Baptism
   not to be ministered by women, and so explained: the cap and surplice
   not urged: that examination may go before the Communion: that it be
   ministered with a sermon: that divers terms of priests and absolution
   and some other used, with the ring in marriage, and other such like in
   the book, may be corrected: the longsomeness of service abridged:
   Churchings and music moderated to better edification: that the Lord's
   day be not profaned: the rest upon holidays not so strictly urged: that
   there may be an uniformity of doctrine prescribed: no popish opinion to
   be any more taught or defended: no ministers charged to teach their
   people to bow at the name of Jesus: that the Canonical Scriptures only
   be read in the Church."

   Subsequently the Puritans asked for a Conference of representatives to
   discuss the disputed questions. Such a course was vigorously opposed by
   the Universities as well as by the rest of the Episcopal Clergy, but
   the King, confident in his powers of controlling the debate, and
   thinking it prudent to yield to the wishes of so large a body, granted
   their request.

   The constition of the Conference.

   The Conference was summoned to Hampton Court, where the King resided,
   for its first session on January 14th, 1604 A.D.

   The Divines selected to represent the discontents were Dr. Rainolds or
   Reynolds, and Dr. Sparkes, with Mr. Knewstub and Mr. Chaderton.

   The advocates of the Church invited to take part were Archbishop
   Whitgift, eight Bishops, of whom Bancroft of London, Matthew of Durham,
   and Bilson of Winchester were chief, six or seven Deans, embracing
   Andrewes, Overall, and Barlow, two doctors of Divinity, and one
   Archdeacon.

   The first meeting.

   On the first day the King did not invite the attendance of the Puritan
   representatives, but held a consultation with the Bishops and Deans on
   these subjects, Confirmation, Absolution, and Private Baptism, upon
   which he required information.

   The second meeting.

   Two days afterwards, January 16th, the aggrieved party were admitted to
   a discussion with a portion of their opponents. The King opened the
   proceedings by expressing his readiness to hear any objections which
   they had to bring forward. These were reduced by Dr. Reynolds to four,
   the last of which was aimed at the unfitness of the Book of Common
   Prayer to promote true piety. Judging from the following admonition of
   the King, the Bishops were disposed to take advantage of their position
   and not conduct the debate on fair terms. It was the conduct of Bishop
   Bancroft which called for his Majesty's interposition.

   "My Lord Bishop, something in your passion I may excuse, something I
   must mislike. I may excuse you thus far, that I think you have just
   cause to be moved in respect that they traduce the well-settled
   government, and also proceed in so indirect a course, contrary to their
   own pretence, and the intent of this meeting. I mislike your sudden
   interruption of Dr. Reynolds, whom you should have suffered to have
   taken his liberty; for there is no order, nor can be any effectual
   issue of disputation, if each party be not suffered, without stopping,
   to speak at large. Wherefore, either let the Doctor proceed, or frame
   your answer to his motions already made, though some of them are very
   needless."

   One of the objections which received much attention, as indeed it has
   done in other times besides, was the use of the Sign of the Cross in
   Baptism.

   The Sign of the Cross objected to.

   The King consulted with his Divines, and was satisfied of its antiquity
   from the learned testimony of Dean Andrewes, who appealed to the
   authority of the Primitive Fathers. But such evidence was of no value
   in the eyes of the objectors: even allowing that it had been in use, it
   had been abused, and that of itself was sufficient argument against the
   continuance. Dr. Reynolds called upon the King to follow the example of
   Hezekiah, who had crushed the brazen serpent to powder, because it had
   been perverted to idolatrous purposes. The King's reply is highly
   characteristic: --

   "Though I be sufficiently persuaded of the cross in baptism, and the
   commendable use thereof in the Church so long, yet, if there were
   nothing else to move me, this very argument were an inducement to me
   for the retaining of it, as it is now by order established; for
   inasmuch as it was abused, so you say, to superstition, in time of
   Popery, it doth plainly imply, that it was well-used before Popery. I
   will tell you, I have lived among this sort of men, (speaking to the
   lords and bishops,) ever since I was ten years old, but, I may say of
   myself as Christ did of Himself, Though I lived amongst them, yet since
   I had ability to judge, I was never of them; neither did anything make
   me more to condemn and detest their courses, than that they did so
   peremptorily disallow of all things, which at all had been used in
   Popery. For my part, I know not how to answer the objections of the
   papists when they charge us with novelties, but truly to tell them,
   that their abuses are new, but the things which they abuse we retain in
   their primitive use, and forsake only the novel corruption. By this
   argument, we might renounce the Trinity, and all that is holy, because
   it was abused in Popery: (and speaking to Dr. Reynolds merrily) they
   used to wear hose and shoes in Popery, therefore you shall now go
   barefoot."

   "Secondly," quoth his Majesty, "what resemblance is there between the
   brazen serpent, a material visible thing, and the sign of the cross
   made in the air?"

   Thirdly, he was informed by the Bishops, and found their account true,
   that "the Papists themselves never attributed any spiritual grace to
   the sign of the Cross in Baptism.

   "To say, that in nothing they may be followed which are of the Church
   of Rome, were violent and extreme."

   "Some things they do in that they are men, in that they are wise men,
   and Christian men; some things in that they are misled and blinded with
   error."

   The next scruple was the wearing of the surplice: this, it was
   pretended, was a habit worn by the priests of Isis.

   "This objection," the King said, "was somewhat new, because it was
   usually called a rag of Popery.' But granting the supposition, we do
   not live now amongst heathens, and therefore there is no danger of
   reviving Paganism."

   The third day of meeting.

   On the third day of the Conference, January 18th, the Bishops laid
   before the King the result of their deliberations upon the points on
   which he had consulted them when they first met. Thereupon his Majesty
   decided what alterations should be made in the Prayer-book, the exact
   wording being left to a small committee of the Bishops and Privy
   Council.

   The following may be regarded as concessions to the Puritans, though
   they were quite insignificant compared with the changes which were
   asked for.

   A few unimportant points conceded to the objectors.

   The Apocryphal Lessons were modified, and the title "Confirmation" was
   explained by the additional words, "or laying on of hands upon children
   baptized and able to render an account of their faith."

   Otherwise the Prayer-book strengthened.

   The grievances against vestments, the ring in Matrimony, and the Cross
   in Baptism were left unredressed. An explanation of the Sacraments from
   the pen of Overall, which must have been far from acceptable, if they
   rightly understood it, was added to the Catechism. Further, the title
   of the Absolution was enlarged by the addition of the words, "or
   Remission of sins." With all these decisions the Puritans who were
   present at the Conference expressed their concurrence, though their
   conduct in doing so was a disappointment to the body whom they
   represented.

   Forms of Prayer added.

   An additional Prayer for the Queen, the Prince, and other King's and
   Queen's children, with corresponding insertions in the Litany, was
   introduced, together with numerous Thanksgivings for diverse
   Benefits,--For Fair Weather, For Plenty, For Peace and Victory, and For
   Deliverance from the Plague.

   The new translation of the Scriptures.

   By far the most important however of the results of the Conference was
   the appointment of a Committee of Divines to make a new translation of
   the Holy Scriptures. The suggestion was made by Dr. Reynolds, but some
   years elapsed before the plan was matured. On July 22nd, 1604 A.D., the
   King writes to Bishop Bancroft that fifty-four translators, to meet in
   various companies at Oxford and Cambridge and Westminster, had been
   nominated, and would shortly be prepared to proceed with their work.
   There was still further delay before the companies met, and the
   Translation was not given to the world till 1611 A.D. How far it became
   at once connected with the Services and worship of the Church is a
   disputed question. There is a statement on the title-page that it is
   "appointed to be read in Churches," but there is an entire absence of
   testimony to its having ever received any public sanction from
   Convocation or Parliament or the Privy Council or the King.

Appendix IV

The Scotch Service-book

1637 A.D.

   The history of the Revisions of the Prayer-book during the Reformation
   period can hardly be considered complete without some account of that
   which was made for the Church in Scotland. [228] Its interest lies in
   the two facts, that it was the nearest approach to the First
   Prayer-book of Edward VI. yet made, and that, though failing in its
   immediate object, it had important results in its influence upon the
   Caroline Settlement in this country.

   King James's desire for a Liturgy.

   In 1610 A.D. King James turned his attention to the restoration of
   order and government in the Scotch Church, by the appointment of
   several Bishops and the recovery of Episcopal jurisdiction from the
   encroachments of the laity. His next step was to prepare the way for
   the introduction of an uniform Liturgy, but this was surrounded by so
   many difficulties that he was able to do little more than set an
   example by establishing the English Service-book in his private chapel
   at Holyrood.

   When Charles I. succeeded to the throne he determined to carry out his
   father's object, and intrusted the negotiations to Laud. Maxwell, one
   of the leading Scotch clergy, came over to England, and in opposition
   to Laud, who was anxious for the introduction of the English Liturgy,
   with a view to uniformity of worship throughout the King's dominions,
   pleaded for one compiled by his own countrymen. The arguments he used
   were that it would meet with a better reception, as the people were
   ill-disposed towards the English Church, and also that such a course
   would afford them the opportunity of obtaining a more perfect Liturgy,
   which, if lost then, might never recur.King Charles I. Encourages the
   project. The request was acceded to by the King, who in 1633 A.D.
   intrusted the compilation to a Committee of Scotch Bishops, of whom the
   chief were Spottiswood, Archbishop of Glasgow, Maxwell, Bishop of Ross,
   and Wedderburn, Bishop of Dunblane. It was arranged that the work, as
   it progressed, should be submitted for the approval of Archbishop Laud
   and Bishops Juxon and Wren. Juxon took little or no interest in the
   matter, but the other two threw themselves heartily into the revision,
   and examined the suggestions of the Commissioners with the greatest
   care and attention. The King too was most desirous of promoting the
   efficiency of the work, and not only took part in criticising the draft
   sheets submitted for his sanction, but made many provisions in
   Scotland, which he hoped would insure for the Service-book a ready
   acceptance. But unfortunately all his efforts were defeated.The King
   being ill-advised courts failure. The course he adopted, under the
   misguidance of his advisers, seems, as we look at it, to have been so
   shaped that no other result was possible. It may well be doubted
   whether under any circumstances a nation which was rooted in its
   attachment to such principles of Public Worship as John Knox had
   bequeathed to them, could have risen at once to the level of the First
   Prayer-book; but it is quite certain that they could not do it under
   such arbitrary compulsion as the King exercised. The first false step
   was the publication of the Canons [229] before the Liturgy, for one of
   them enforced, under pains and penalties, the use of Forms of Worship
   which were not even framed at the time. The next error was made when
   the Service-book after receiving the Royal sanction, was thrust upon
   the nation with the most inconsiderate haste, without any opportunity
   given either to the Clergy or the laity to examine or express any
   opinion upon it. The King's Proclamation simply appointed it to be read
   throughout the Churches on the Sunday following its first publication.
   [230]

   The Scotch Presbyters, apart from their innate dislike to the use of
   any precomposed Form of Prayer, regarded the action of the King as an
   inroad upon the rights of the Church and roused themselves to
   resistance. The introduction of the Liturgy into the Cathedral was
   attended by a riot, which the presence of the Chancellor was powerless
   to suppress. The riot became a revolution. The scare of Popery was
   raised throughout the country, and soon the whole nation was in arms
   against the King.

   We need not follow the history of the civil war which ensued. Suffice
   it to say that the Liturgy and Canons were swept away, Episcopacy was
   abolished, and the "Solemn League and Covenant" was signed by every
   member of the Church under pain of excommunication.

   Laud himself thus sums up the history [231] "What way soever was taken,
   or in whomsoever there was a failure, this was certain in the event:
   the Bishops were deceived in their expectation of a peaceable admission
   of that Service-book: the King lost the honour and safety of that
   settlement: and that kingdom such a form of God's Service, as I fear
   they will never come near again."

   The interest attaching to the Service-book.

   But the Scotch Liturgy, as we said above, is full of interest on other
   grounds than its speedy and eventful rejection. Wren, who watched over
   its progress with unfailing interest, and made so many valuable
   suggestions to the Scotch Committee, must have been bitterly
   disappointed when its adoption in Scotland became utterly hopeless. The
   labour, however, which be had bestowed upon the revision was by no
   means wasted, for when, twenty-five years later, he was called to
   preside over the deliberations of the Caroline Revisionists, he fell
   back upon the results of his previous efforts, and had the satisfaction
   of embodying in the Final Settlement not a few of the rejected
   alterations.

   The following [232] may be taken as specimens in the Communion Office:
   --

   "Then shall the Presbyter, turning to the people, rehearse distinctly
   the Ten Commandments." The principle of turning to the people when
   delivering to them a message from God, as distinct from turning from
   them when directing petitions to God in their beha1f, is recognised in
   the Rubric at this place for the first time. It was introduced again in
   1662 A.D.

   The Nicene Creed was to be said or sung as at present. The Alms were to
   be reverently brought in a bason and humbly presented, and set upon the
   Holy Table:--a direction enforced almost word for word in the Rubric of
   the Caroline Prayer-book.

   In the Prayer for the Church Militant the following commemoration of
   the dead occurred, and we have no difficulty in tracing its spirit, and
   to a considerable extent its language also, in that which we now use:
   --

   "And we also bless thy holy Name for all those thy servants, who,
   having finished their course in faith, do now rest from their labours.
   And we yield unto thee most high praise and hearty thanks, for the
   wonderful grace and virtue declared in all thy saints, who have been
   the choice vessels of thy grace, and the lights of the world in their
   several generations: most humbly beseeching thee, that we may have
   grace to follow the example of their stedfastness in thy faith, and
   obedience to thy holy commandments: that at the day of the general
   resurrection we, and all they which are of the mystical body of thy
   Son, may be set on his right hand, and hear that his most joyful voice,
   Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
   from the foundation of the world."

   The title "the Prayer of Consecration" is peculiar to these two
   Revisions. The marginal directions for "the manual acts" during the
   Consecration, which bad been entirely omitted since 1552 A.D., were
   reintroduced in an enlarged form in 1637 A.D., and almost totidem
   verbis, with a further Rubric providing for the fraction, in 1662 A.D.

   The reverence paid to the unconsumed Elements, by placing them upon the
   Holy Table and "covering them with a fair linen cloth," was continued
   by the adoption of a Rubric to the same effect.

   Its Catholic teaching.

   In some particulars the Scotch Liturgy was in advance of the present
   English Form, Wren and Cosin not being able at the Final Revision to
   restore all that they wished. [233] It brought o ut more distinctly the
   sacrificial aspect of the Holy Eucharist as well as the doctrine of the
   Real Presence. In illustration we quote the following instances: --

   One of the early Rubrics provides that the Holy Table should be vested
   in a manner "meet for the holy Mysteries then to be celebrated," and
   should "stand at the uppermost part of the Chancel or Church," the
   force of which language is obvious.

   Another directs that the Presbyter "shall offer up . . . the bread and
   wine prepared for the Sacrament."

   On the sacrificial aspect of the Holy Eucharist.

   In the Prayer for the Church Militant when there was a Communion a
   clause was inserted which ran thus:--"And we commend especially unto
   thy merciful goodness the congregation which is here assembled in thy
   Name to celebrate the commemoration [234] of the most precious death
   and sacrifice of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ." And the title
   "Memorial or Prayer of Oblation" was prefixed to the words, "Wherefore,
   O Lord and heavenly Father, . . . we thy humble servants do celebrate
   and make here before thy divine Majesty, with these thy holy gifts, the
   memorial which thy Son hath willed us to make," etc.

   Furthermore, its position was the same as in the First Prayer-took
   after the Consecration but preceding the act of communion.

   On the doctrine of the Real Presence.

   In support of what we said about its fuller recognition of the doctrine
   of the Real Presence, the following will suffice:--The act of
   Consecration was immediately preceded by the Invocation: "Hear us, O
   merciful Father, we most humbly beseech Thee, and of thy goodness
   vouchsafe so to bless and sanctify, with thy Word and Holy Spirit,
   these thy gifts and creatures of bread and wine, that they may be unto
   us the body and blood of thy most dearly beloved Son."

   Again, the Benediction or Form of Administration consisted of the first
   clause only of that now in use: "The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting
   life:" which was followed by the Rubric, "Here the party receiving
   shall say, Amen."

   The second clause, "Take, eat," etc., which was substituted for the
   above in 1552 A.D. to escape from the obvious conclusion that the Body
   of Christ was given in the Sacrament, was altogether omitted. Lastly,
   when all had communicated, it was provided that "he who celebrates
   shall go to the Lord's Table and cover with a fair linen cloth, or
   corporal, that which remaineth of the consecrated elements."

   Nothing could be more significant than this direction, especially when
   it is remembered that the "fair linen cloth" had acquired the name of
   Corporal because it was supposed to represent that in which Joseph had
   wrapped the body of our Lord.

   It would be interesting to dwell upon other features of this Liturgy,
   but we trust enough has been said to justify our inserting an account
   of it in a treatise which deals with the progressive history of the
   English Service-books.

APPENDIX V

In the Directory.

   The Westminister Assembly of Divines.

   As the Parliament grew in power and influence, they determined to
   submit all questions touching the Religious Worship of the country to
   an Assembly of Divines selected and appointed by their body. In view of
   obtaining for it a general acceptance they resolved to give it an air
   of wide comprehensiveness.

   Its members may be ranged in four parties:-- Firstly, The
   Episcopalians, [235] whose number, however, was naturally as limited as
   possible. Secondly, The advocates of the doctrines and discipline of
   Presbyterianism, [236] who formed the bulk of the Assembly. Thirdly,
   Some foreign Nonconformists, [237] who had settled chiefly in Holland.
   Fourthly, A Committee of Laymen, [238] taken out of the two Houses of
   Parliament. With the Assembly so constituted certain Scotch
   Commissioners [239] were subsequently associated.

   The whole number of members nominated was one hundred and twenty, but
   when their names were called over at their first meeting in the chapel
   of Henry VII. at Westminster, July 1, 1643 A.D., only sixty-nine
   presented themselves, and of these not a few appear to have withdrawn.

   The Church party retire.

   The Episcopalians, on learning the constitution and the objects of the
   Assembly, saw at once that their position as members was quite
   inconsistent with their loyalty to the King and their adherence to the
   Ecclesiastical Discipline of the Church.

   Their withdrawal has been regarded as a mistake, but their numbers were
   far too small to have influenced the decisions of the Council; and we
   cannot regret that their conduct has acquitted the Church of any, even
   the least, participation therein.

   And now let us look at the part which the Assembly took touching Public
   Worship. The Parliament resolved to abolish the Book of Common Prayer,
   and called upon the Westminster Assembly to frame a model for Divine
   Service.The publication of the Directory. The result of their labours
   was a book entitled "A Directory for the Public Worship of GOD,
   throughout the Three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland,"
   ordered by the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament to be printed
   and published March 13, 1644 A.D., and again enforced under pain of
   forfeiture and penalties, January 6, 1645 A.D.

   As it superseded the Prayer-book and continued in use for a long
   period, and as it is not easy to be obtained, we have thought fit in
   this place to subjoin a general statement of its principles, as well as
   sufficient extracts from its directions to enable the reader to
   estimate it aright.

   The disregard of the true characteristic of worship.

   The first characteristic of this "model of Public Worship," is the
   insignificant part assigned to that which the Church has always
   regarded as the chief element, viz., Praise. At the very close, as
   though it were an after-thought merely, it is declared to be "the duty
   of Christians to praise GOD publicly by singing of Psalms together in
   the Congregation, and also privately in the Family," but only once in
   the order of Service (apart from a parenthetical note) is any direction
   given, and then in the most indifferent way, "Let a Psalm be sung, if
   with conveniency it may be done."

   When this slight notice of praise is contrasted with the minute and
   lengthy directions for prayer and preaching. it becomes only too patent
   how selfishness had completely subordinated the higher motives which
   ought to prompt the worshipper to ascribe honour to GOD simply and
   solely because it is due unto His Name. [240]

   The "gift of prayer provided for."

   The exercise of "the gift of prayer," which was one of the most urgent
   demands all through the Presbyterian grievances, was provided for on
   the most liberal scale. The Document, which throughout is a manual of
   directions rather than a Service-book, contains detailed prescriptions
   and numerous suggestions as to the character of the ministers
   petitions, and it is not a little significant that those, which are to
   guide "the Prayer before the Sermon," occupy considerably more space
   [241] than all that bears upon the Celebration of the Holy Communion.

   The reading of Holy Scriptures.

   The directions for the reading of Holy Scripture are much less profuse.
   Of course none but the Canonical Books of the Old and New Testaments
   were admitted, and the long-standing prejudice against the Apocrypha
   was satisfied. The aversion to set Forms was carried to such an extent
   that the compilers seemed unwilling even to have a chapter of the Bible
   read unless it was accompanied by an exposition. For the Preaching of
   the Word, the power of God unto salvation, they laid down a series of
   rules, admirable enough in themselves, but out of place when forced
   into such prominence as to raise the value of the office far above any
   ordinance, saving that to which they allowed nothing to be
   subordinated, viz., extempore prayer.

   The Rite of Baptism.

   In the administration of Baptism, while laying the utmost stress upon
   the Rite as a "seal of the Covenant of grace," they provided against
   the Catholic doctrine of Regeneration, by asserting of those who come
   to receive the Sacrament, "that they are Christians, and federally holy
   before Baptism, and therefore are they baptized."

   The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.

   In the Celebration of Holy Communion, their directions in one instance
   are more Catholic than we should have expected.

   The words which accompanied the distribution of the Elements were so
   framed as to exhibit no trace of a desire to exclude the Catholic
   doctrine of the Real Presence.

   This will be more striking if the formula be compared with that adopted
   by the Puritans in the Second Prayer-book of Edward VI. [242]

   In the Directory, the order runs thus: "Then the Minister, who is
   himself to communicate, is to break the Bread, and give it to the
   Communicants: Take ye, eat ye: This is the Body of Christ, which is
   broken for you; Do this in remembrance of Him."

   The obligation to kneel for reception was abrogated by the rule that
   "the Table should be so conveniently placed, that the Communicants may
   orderly sit about it or at it."

   Again, they read the words of the Institution simply as "a lesson of
   edification" instead of embodying the account in a prayer so as to make
   the Service "a memorial before God," the same manual acts being used
   and the same words spoken as by Our LORD on the night of His betrayal.
   [243]

   The Burial of the Dead.

   One Of the most grievous blots on the Directory is the page which
   touches the Burial of the Dead. It shows how prejudice and fanaticism
   will drive men to violate the instincts of nature. If there be one time
   more than another when the heart of man needs the consolation of
   prayer, it is when he is burying his dead out of his sight. And yet the
   Westminster Assembly peremptorily forbade anything but "meditations and
   conferences suitable to the occasion." If a Minister happened to be
   present, the privilege was conceded of putting the people "in
   remembrance of their duty."

   The Sabbatarianism of the Divines.

   It only remains to point out in what a marked manner their
   Sabbatarianism and dislike to the observance of Holy Days manifested
   itself. The whole of Sunday was to be celebrated as holy to the LORD,
   and an entire abstinence was enjoined, not only "from all sports and
   pastimes but also from all worldly words and thoughts."

   It was further ordered that the intervals between the Public Services
   should "be spent in Reading, Meditation, Repetition of Sermons,
   especially by calling their families to an account of what they have
   heard, and Catechising of them, holy conferences, Prayer for a blessing
   upon the public Ordinances, singing of Psalms, visiting the sick,
   relieving the poor, and such like duties of piety, charity and mercy,
   accounting the Sabbath a delight."

   The Commemoration of Saints, and other Festivals they swept away by the
   declaration that "Festival Days, vulgarly called Holy Days, having no
   warrant in the Word of God, are not to be continued."

    OF PUBLIC PRAYER BEFORE THE SERMON.

   "To acknowledge our great sinfulness; First, by reason of original sin,
   which (beside the guilt that makes us liable to everlasting Damnation)
   is the seed of all other sins, hath depraved and poisoned all the
   faculties and powers of Soul and Body, doth defile our best actions,
   and (were it not restrained, or our hearts renewed by Grace) would
   break forth into innumerable transgressions, and greatest rebellions
   against the Lord, that ever were committed by the vilest of the sons of
   Men."

   "To bewail our blindness of mind, hardness of heart, unbelief,
   impenitence, security, lukewarmness, barrenness, our not endeavouring
   after mortification and newness of life; nor after the exercise of
   godliness in the power thereof;" . . .

   "To acknowledge and confess, that, as we are convinced of our guilt; so
   out of a deep sense thereof, we judge ourselves unworthy of the
   smallest benefits, most worthy of God's fiercest wrath, and of the
   Curses of the Law and heaviest Judgements inflicted upon the most
   rebellious Sinners; and that he might most justly take his Kingdom and
   Gospel from us, plague us with all sorts of spiritual and temporal
   judgements in this life, and after cast us into utter Darkness, in the
   Lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, where is weeping and
   gnashing of teeth for evermore."

   "Notwithstanding all which, To draw near to the Throne of Grace,
   encouraging our selves with hope of a gracious Answer of our Prayers,"

   "And humbly, and earnestly to supplicate for mercy in the free and full
   remission of our sins, and that only for the bitter sufferings and
   precious merits of that our only Saviour Jesus Christ."

   "To pray for the propagation of the Gospel and Kingdom of Christ to all
   Nations, for the conversion of the Jews, the fulness of the Gentiles,
   the fall of Antichrist, and the hastening of the second coming of our
   Lord;" . . .

   "To pray for all in Authority, especially for the King's Majesty, that
   God would make him rich in blessings both in his person and government;
   establish his Throne in Religion and Righteousness, save him from evil
   counsel, and make him a blessed and glorious Instrument."

   "For the comforting of the afflicted Queen of Bohemia, sister to our
   Sovereign, and for the restitution and establishment of the illustrious
   Prince Charles," . . .

   "For a blessing upon the High Court of Parliament," . . .

   "For all Pastors and Teachers, that God would fill them with his
   Spirit," . . .

   "For the Universities, and all Schools and Religious seminaries of
   Church and Commonwealth," . . .

   "For the particular City or Congregation," . . .

   "To pray earnestly for GOD'S grace and effectual assistance to the
   Sanctification of his holy Sabbath, the Lord's day," . . .

   "More particularly that God would in a special manner furnish his
   Servant (now called to dispense the bread of life unto his household)
   with wisdom, fidelity, zeal, and utterance, that he may divide the Word
   of God aright," . . .

    OF PRAYER AFTER THE SERMON.

   "To give thanks for the great Love of God in sending his Son Jesus
   Christ unto us; For the communication of his Holy Spirit; For the light
   and liberty of the glorious Gospel, and the rich and heavenly Blessings
   revealed therein; as namely, Election, Vocation, Adoption,
   Justification, Sanctification, and hope of Glory; For the admirable
   goodness of God in freeing the Land from Antichristian Darkness and
   Tyranny, and for all other National Deliverances; For the Reformation
   of Religion; For the Covenant; and for many Temporal blessings."

   "To turn the chief and most useful heads of the Sermon into some few
   Petitions; and to pray that it may abide in the heart and bring forth
   fruit."

    OF THE ADMINISTRATION OP BAPTISM.

   "That it is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ: that it is a Seal of
   the Covenant of Grace, of our ingrafting into Christ, and of our union
   with him, of Remission of Sins, Regeneration, Adoption, and Life
   eternal:" . . .

   "That children by Baptism are solemnly received into the bosom of the
   visible Church, distinguished from the world and them that are without,
   and united with Believers; and that all who are baptized in the Name of
   Christ, do renounce, and by their baptism are bound to fight against
   the Devil, the World, and the Flesh: That they are Christians, and
   federally holy before Baptism, and therefore are they baptized. That
   the inward Grace and virtue of Baptism is not tied to that very moment
   of time wherein it is administered, and that the fruit and power
   thereof reacheth to the whole course of our life; and that outward
   Baptism is not so necessary, that through the want thereof the Infant
   is in danger of Damnation, or the Parents guilty, if they do not
   contemn or neglect the ordinance of Christ when and where it may be
   had."

    OF THE CELEBRATION OF THE COMMUNION, OR SACRAMENT OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.

   "Let the Prayer, Thanksgiving, or Blessing of the Bread and Wine be to
   this effect;

   "With humble and hearty acknowledgement of the greatness of our misery,
   from which neither man nor angel was able to deliver us, and of our
   great unworthiness of the least of all God's mercies, to give thanks to
   God for all his benefits, and especially for that great benefit of our
   Redemption, the love of God the Father, the sufferings and merits of
   the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, by which we are delivered; and
   for all means of Grace, the Word and Sacraments, and for this Sacrament
   in particular, by which Christ and all his benefits are applied and
   sealed up unto us, which, notwithstanding the denial of them unto
   others, are in great mercy continued unto us after so much and long
   abuse of them all."

   "To profess that there is no other Name under Heaven by which we can be
   saved but the Name of Jesus Christ, by whom alone we receive liberty
   and life, have access to the throne of Grace, are admitted to eat and
   drink at his own Table, and are sealed up by his Spirit to an assurance
   of happiness and everlasting life."

   "Earnestly to pray to God, the Father of all mercies, and God of all
   consolation, to vouchsafe his gracious presence, and the effectual
   working of his Spirit in us, and so to sanctify these Elements both of
   Bread and Wine, and to bless his own Ordinance, that we may receive by
   Faith the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ crucified for us, and so to
   feed upon him that he may be one with us, and we with him, that he may
   live in us and we in him and to him, who hath loved us and given
   himself for us."

   "After all have communicated the Minister is also to give solemn thanks
   to God for his rich mercy and invaluable goodness vouchsafed to them in
   that Sacrament, and to intreat for pardon for the defects of the whole
   service, and for the gracious assistance of his good Spirit, whereby
   they may be enabled to walk in the strength of that Grace, as becometh
   those who have received so great pledges of salvation."

    CONCERNING BURIAL OF THE DEAD.

   "When any person departeth this life, let the dead body upon the day of
   Burial be decently attended from the house to the place appointed for
   public Burial, and there immediately interred without any Ceremony. And
   because the customs of kneeling down, and praying by, or towards the
   dead corpse, and other such usages, in the place where it lies, before
   it be carried to Burial are superstitious, and for that praying,
   reading, and singing, both in going to, and at the Grave, have been
   grossly abused, are in no way beneficial to the dead, and have proved
   many ways hurtful to the living, therefore let all such things be laid
   aside."

   "Howbeit, we judge it very convenient that the Christian friends which
   accompany the dead body to the place appointed for public Burial, do
   apply themselves to meditations, and conferences suitable to the
   occasion: And that the minister, as upon other occasions, so at this
   time, if he be present, may put them in remembrance of their duty."

   "That this shall not extend to deny any civil respects or differences
   at the Burial suitable to the rank and condition of the party deceased
   whilst he was living."

APPENDIX VI

In the Changes introduced at the last Revision.

   In the account of the Revision of the Prayer-book at Ely House after
   the Restoration of Charles II., we entered upon a few changes which
   seemed to have an especial bearing upon the doctrines then under
   dispute. Many others, more or less important, resulted from the labours
   of the Committee, and as the history of this period would be manifestly
   very incomplete without some notice of them, we have subjoined an
   outline thereof deeming this amply sufficient for the ordinary student.

   By far the greatest number of changes was made by the alteration of
   existing rubrics and the addition of new ones. Several which tended to
   promote greater reverence in the Administration of the Holy Eucharist
   have already been mentioned. We notice further the directions or
   side-notes in the Consecration Prayer providing for the manual acts
   which had been ignored in the Second Prayer-book of Edward VI. and not
   restored by Elizabeth. An addition was made to the note in the First
   Prayer-book of Edward VI. of the words, "and here to break the bread,"
   insuring what Bishop Cosin characterised as a "needful circumstance of
   the Sacrament."

   The belief in the: Regeneration of Infants in Holy Baptism was
   strengthened by the transference of a rubric from the Confirmation to
   the Baptismal Office. In its original place it was intended to satisfy
   people that Confirmation was not necessary to salvation, for that if
   children died in their infancy after baptism their salvation was
   assured. In 1662 it was added at the close of the Baptismal Service as
   worthy of greater prominence than it received in an Office which was
   used so rarely as that for Confirmation. The Rubric runs thus:--"It is
   certain by GOD's Word that children which are baptized dying before
   they commit actual sin, are undoubtedly saved." It involved a doctrine
   so repugnant to the Presbyterians, that Baxter declared, "That of the
   forty sinful terms for a communion with the Church party, if
   thirty-nine were taken away and only that rubric concerning the
   salvation of infants dying shortly after their baptism were continued,
   yet they could not conform."

   In the Introductory part of the Prayer-book the following additions
   were made: --

   The Preface, most probably written by Bishop Sanderson.

   The Table of the Vigils, Fasts, Days of Abstinence, together with
   certain solemn days for which particular services are appointed.

   "The five prayers" were transferred from the close of the Litany to the
   services for Matins and Evensong; and the latter received the addition
   of the Sentences, Exhortation, etc., which before had been prefixed to
   Matins only. In the Litany the petition for deliverance from Rebellion
   and Schism was added with much significance. Among the occasional
   prayers and thanksgivings were introduced: --

   A second prayer for fair weather.

   Two prayers for Embertide.

   The prayer for Parliament.

   The prayer for all conditions of men.

   The General Thanksgiving.

   The Thanksgiving for public peace at home.

   New collects were composed for --

   The third Sunday in Advent.

   The sixth Sunday after the Epiphany.

   Easter Even.

   The Collect for St. Stephen's Day was rewritten.

   A distinct Gospel and Epistle were introduced for the 6th Sunday after
   the Epiphany.

   The title of the Feast, "The Purification of St. Mary," was enlarged to
   its present form, "The Presentation of Christ in the Temple, commonly
   called The Purification," etc., and a special Epistle provided instead
   of that for the preceding Sunday.

   A new Office was composed, for "The Baptism of such as be of riper
   years."

   The Catechism was separated from the Confirmation Service, and at the
   same time an addition was made to the latter of very doubtful
   expediency. The Revisionists introduced all that portion which provides
   for a public and solemn ratification of the Baptismal Vows by the
   candidate as a necessary prerequisite for the reception of the Rite. It
   is true that in the First Prayer-book of Edward VI., it was implied
   that children would previously be examined in the Church Catechism,
   which was united with the Confirmation Office in view of this, and also
   that the question, "Dost thou not think that thou art bound to believe
   and do as they (the Godfathers and Godmothers) have promised for thee?"
   together with the answer, "Yes, verily," etc., was in some sense a
   "ratifying and confession of the same." But the first Revisionists
   never contemplated such a result as has unhappily followed upon the
   action of the last, viz., the complete over-shadowing of the Scriptural
   and Catholic doctrine of the Gift of the Holy Ghost, by what is only
   subsidiary, certainly not essential to the Rite. It is a matter of
   profound regret that any human institution, no matter how good and
   useful in itself, should have been allowed to throw into the background
   a Divine Ordinance.

   For fifteen centuries and more the Church held that the Divine Gift was
   imparted wholly irrespective of any such qualification as the renewal
   of Baptismal Vows, in witness whereof we have only to appeal to the
   custom of confirming infants immediately after they had been baptized,
   which prevailed without question down to the eighth or ninth century.
   [244]

   The requirement for newly-married people to communicate on the day of
   their marriage was modified to a recommendation to do so then or at the
   first opportunity.

   In the Visitation of the Sick two rubrical changes were made by the
   insertion of the words in italics: --

   "Here shall the sick person be moved to make a special confession," and
   "After which confession the Priest shall absolve him, if he humbly and
   heartily desire it."
