SERMONS XLVII. XLVIII. XLIX. L.

  ROMANS xii. 18.

   If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
   men. P. 1. 31. 64. 97.

   Christianity the last and most correct edition of the law of nature:
   every precept of it may be resolved into a natural reason; as advancing
   and improving nature in the higher degrees and grander concerns of it.
   Christianity takes care for man, not only in his religious capacity,
   but also in his civil and political, binding the bonds of government
   faster, by the happy provisions of peace, 1.

   I. The shewing what is implied in the duty here enjoined.

   II. What are the measures and proportions by which it is to be
   determined.

   III. What are the means by which it is to be determined.

   IV. What the motives by which it may be enforced.

   I. The duty here enjoined is, live peaceably; which may be taken,

   1. For the actual enjoyment of peace with all men: and so he only lives
   peaceably, whom no man molests. But this cannot be the sense intended
   here, (1.) Because so to live peaceably is impossible, 1. From the
   contentious, unreasonable humour of many men, 2. 2. From the contrary
   and inconsistent interests of many men, 5. (2.) Because, though it were
   not impossible, it can be no man's duty, 6.

   For a peaceable behaviour towards all men; which is the duty here
   enjoined: it seems adequately to consist of two things,

   1. A forbearance of all hostile actions; and that in a double respect.
   (1.) In a way of prevention, 8. (2.) Of retaliation, 10.

   2. A forbearance of injurious, provoking words, 13.

   II. The measures and proportions by which it is to be determined are
   expressed in these words: if it be possible, 15.

   Now possible may be taken two ways: 1. As it is opposed to naturally
   impossible, and that which cannot be done, 15. 2. As opposed to morally
   impossible, and that which cannot be done lawfully, 15.

   But the observance of peace being limited by the measure of lawful, all
   inquiries concerning the breaking of it are reducible to these two:

   1. Whether it be at all lawful.

   2. Supposing it lawful, when and where it ought to be judged so.

   Under the first is discussed that great question, whether war can be
   lawful for Christians, 17.

   War is of two distinct kinds. 1. Defensive, in order to keep off and
   repel an evil designed to the public. 2. Offensive, for revenging a
   public injury done to a community. And it is allowable upon the
   strength of these arguments:

   (1.) As it (the defensive) is properly an act of self-preservation, 17.

   (2.) As it (the offensive) is a proper act of distributive justice, 19.

   (3.) Because St. John the Baptist, Christ himself, and the apostles,
   judged the employment of a soldier lawful, 21.

   The ground of the Socinians' arguments in this case, viz. that God,
   under the Mosaical covenant, promised only temporal possessions to his
   people, therefore war was lawful to them; but now, under the covenant
   of grace through Christ, has made no promise of temporal enjoyments,
   but on the contrary bids us to despise them, and therefore has taken
   from us all right of war and resistance. This argument examined and
   confuted, 23. And

   The scriptures produced by those who abet the utter unlawfulness of war
   examined and explained. As,

   I. Matt. v. 39. Rom. xii. 17, 19. 28.

   II. Isaiah ii. 4. 31.

   III. Matthew xxvi. 52. 33.

   IV. James iv. 1. 34.

   Under the second inquiry, supposing it lawful, when and where it ought
   to be judged so?

   First, some general grounds, that may authorize war, are laid down. As
   when those with whom we are at peace,

   1. Declare that they will annoy us, unless we cut off our limbs, &c.
   and upon our refusal disturb us, 37.

   2. Declare war with us, unless we will renounce our religion, 37.

   3. Injure us to that degree as a nation, as to blast our honour and
   reputation, 38.

   4. Declare war with us, unless we will quit our civil rights, 38.

   Secondly, some particular cases are resolved; as,

   First case. Whether it be lawful for subjects in any case to make war
   upon the magistrate? 39.

   Grotius's seven cases, wherein he asserts it to be lawful, 41.

   David Parseus his arguments, in a set and long dispute upon Rom. xiii.
   examined and answered, 43.

   Second case. Whether it be lawful for one private man to make war upon
   another in those encounters which we commonly call duels? 49. And here
   are set down,

   1. The cases in which a duel is lawful. As (1.) When two malefactors
   condemned to die are appointed by the magistrate to fight, upon promise
   of life to the conqueror, 49. (2.) When two armies are drawn out, and
   the decision of the battle is cast upon a single combat, 50. (3.) When
   one challenges another, and resolves to kill him, unless he accepts the
   combat, 50.

   2. The cases in which duels are utterly unlawful. As

   (1.) When they are undertook for vain ostentation, 52. (2.) To purge
   oneself from some crime objected, 53. (3.) When two agree upon a duel,
   for the decision of right, mutually claimed by both, agreeing that the
   right shall fall to the conqueror, 53. (4.) When undertaken for
   revenge, or some injury done, or affront passed, 54.

   But other arguments there are against duels, besides their
   unlawfulness. As,

   1. The judgment of men generally condemning them, 57.

   2. The wretched consequences of the thing itself; which are twofold:
   (1.) Such as attend the conquered person, viz. ]. A disastrous death,
   58. 2. Death eternal, 59(2.) Such as attend the conqueror. 1. In case
   he is apprehended, 60. 2. Supposing he escapes by flight, 61. 3.
   Supposing by the intercession of great friends he has outbraved
   justice, and triumphed over the law by a full acquitment, 62.

   Third case. Whether it be lawful to repel force by force, so as to kill
   another in one's own defence? 64.

   If a man has no other means to escape, it is lawful upon two reasons.
   1. The great natural right of self-preservation, 65. 2. From that place
   where Christ commands his disciples to provide themselves swords, 65.
   Add to this, the suffrage of the civil law, 66.

   Yet so to assert the privilege as to take off the danger, it is stated
   under its due limitations by three inquiries.

   1st, What those things are which may be thus defended; namely,

   1. Life, 66. 2. Limbs, 67. 3. Chastity invaded by force, 69. 4. Estate
   or goods; which case admitting of some more doubt than the others, the
   opinions for the negative are stated and answered, 69.

   Whatsoever a man may thus do for himself, the same also is lawful for
   him to do in the same danger and extremity of his neighbour, 73.

   2dly, What are the conditions required to render such a defence lawful;
   which are these:

   (1.) That the violence be so apparent, great, and pressing, that there
   can be no other means of escape, 75. (2.) That there be no possibility
   of recourse to a magistrate for a legal protection, 76. (3.) That a man
   design only his own defence, without any hatred or bitter purpose of
   revenge, 78.

   3dly, Who are the persons against whom we may thus defend ourselves,
   78.

   Fourth case. Whether it be allowable for Christians to prosecute, and
   go to law with one another?

   1. The arguments brought against it are examined, 81. Which seem
   principally to bear upon two scriptures, (1.) Matt. v. 40. (2.) 1 Cor.
   vi. 7. The arguments against going to law being drawn from the letter
   of these scriptures, they are examined and explained according to the
   sense of them, 81-87. The third argument is the strict command that
   lies upon Christians to forgive injuries. Here prosecutions are
   distinguished as they concern restitution or punishment, and going to
   law with regard to the first of these shewn to be just and allowable,
   87.

   The arguments for the proof of the assertion are next considered. Which
   are,

   1. That it is to endeavour the execution of justice, in the proper acts
   of it, between man and man, 90.

   2. That if Christian religion prohibits law, observance of this
   religion draws after it the utter dissolution of all government, 91.

   The limitations of law-contentions are three:

   1. That a man takes not this course, but upon a very great and urgent
   cause, 93.

   2. That he be willing to agree upon any tolerable and just terms,
   rather than to proceed to a suit, 94.

   3. Supposing great cause, and no satisfaction, that he manage his suit
   by the rule of charity, and not of revenge, 95.

   III. The means by which the duty of living peaceably is to be effected,
   are,

   1. A suppression of all distasteful, aggravating apprehensions of any
   ill turn or unkind behaviour from men, 97.

   2. The forbearing all pragmatical or malicious informations against
   those with whom we converse, 104.

   3. That men would be willing in some cases to wave the prosecution of
   their rights, and not too rigorously to insist upon them, 112. As (1.)
   When the recovery of it seems impossible, 113. (2.) When it is but
   inconsiderable, but the recovery troublesome and contentious, 115. (3.)
   When a recompence is offered, 116.

   4. To reflect upon the example of Christ, and the strict injunction
   lying upon us to follow it, 118.

   5. Not to adhere too strictly to our own judgments of things doubtful
   in themselves, 120.

   IV. The motives and arguments to enforce this duty are,

   1. The excellency of the thing itself, 122.

   2. The excellency of the principle from which peaceableness of spirit
   proceeds, 124.

   3. The blessing entailed upon it by promise, Matt. v. 124. Two
   instances of this blessing, that certainly attend the peaceable in this
   world: (1.) An easy, undisturbed, and quiet enjoyment of themselves,
   125. (2.) Honour and reputation, which such a temper of mind fixes upon
   their persons, 126. Their report survives them, and their memory is
   blessed. Their name is glorified upon earth, and their souls in heaven,
   128.

SERMON LI.

  ROM. vi. 23.

   The wages of sin is death. P. 129.

   A discourse of sin not superfluous, while the commission of it is
   continual, and yet the preventing necessary.

   The design of the words prosecuted in discussing three things:

   I. Shewing what sin is, 130. As it is usually divided into two sorts:

   1. Original sin, 130.

   2. Actual sin, 132. Which is considered two ways:

   (1.) According to the subject matter of it: as, 1. The sin of our
   words, 133. 2. Of our external actions, 134. 3. Of our desires, 134.

   (2.) According to the degree or measure of it: as 1. When a man is
   engaged in a sinful course by surprise and infirmity, 135. 2. Against
   the reluctancies of an awakened conscience, 136. 3. In defiance to
   conscience, 137.

   II. Shewing, what is comprised in death, which is here allotted for the
   sinner's wages. And

   1. For death temporal, 138.

   2. Death eternal, 140. Which has other properties besides its eternity,
   to increase the horror of it. As (1.) It bereaves a man of all the
   pleasures and comforts which he enjoyed in this world, 141. (2.) Of
   that inexpressible good, the beatific fruition of God, 142. (3.) As it
   fills both body and soul with the highest torment and anguish that can
   be received within a finite capacity, 143.

   III. Shewing in what respect death is property called the wages of sin.

   1. Because the payment of wages still presupposes service and labour,
   144.

   2. Because wages do always imply a merit in the work, requiring such a
   compensation, 147.

   Now sin is a direct stroke, 1st, At God's sovereignty, 149. 2dly, At
   his very being, 150.

   Having thus shewn what sin is, and what death is, the certain
   inevitable wages of sin; he who likes the wages, let him go about the
   work, 151.

SERMON LII.

  MATT. v. 8.

   Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. P. 152.

   It may at first seem wonderful, that there are so few men in the world
   happy, when happiness is so freely offered: but this wonder vanishes
   upon considering the preposterous ways of men's acting, who
   passionately pursue the end, and yet overlook the means: many perishing
   eternally because they cannot eat, drink, sleep, and play themselves
   into salvation. But this great sermon of our Saviour teaches us much
   other things, being fraught with the most sublime and absolute morality
   ever vented in the world, 152. An eminent instance whereof we have in
   the text, which is discussed under four heads:

   I. Shewing, what it is to be pure in heart.

   Purity in general cannot be better explained than by its opposition, 1.
   To mixture, 154. 2. To pollution, 155.

   Purity in heart is shewn, (1.) By way of negation; that it does not
   consist in the external exercise of religion, 156. There being many
   other reasons for the outward piety of a man's behaviour. As, 1. A
   virtuous and strict education, 157. 2. The circumstances and occasions
   of his life, 159. 3. The care and tenderness of his honour, 160.

   (2.) Positively, wherein it does consist, viz. in an inward change and
   renovation of the heart, by the infusion of such a principle as
   naturally suits and complies with whatsoever is pure, holy, and
   commanded by God, 162. Which more especially manifests itself, (1.) In
   the purity and untainted sanctity of the thoughts, 163. (2.) In a
   sanctified regulation of the desires, 164. (3.) In a fearful and
   solicitous avoiding of every thing that may tend to sully or defile it,
   166.

   II. Explaining, what it is to see God.

   Some disputes of the schools concerning this, 168.

   Our enjoyment of God is expressed by seeing him; because the sense of
   seeing, (1.) Represents the object with greater clearness and evidence
   than any of the other senses, 170. (2.) Is most universally exercised
   and employed, 170. (3.) Is the sense of pleasure and delight, 171. (4.)
   Is the most comprehensive and insatiable, 171.

   III. Shewing, how this purity fits and qualifies the soul for the sight
   of God; namely, by causing a suitableness between God and the soul,
   172.

   Now during the soul's impurity, God is utterly unsuitable to it in a
   double respect.

   1. Of the great unlikeness, 173. 2. Of the great contrariety there is
   betwixt them, 173.

   IV. The brief use and application is, to correct our too great easiness
   and credulity in judging of the spiritual estate, either of ourselves
   or others. If we would prevent the judgment of God, we must imitate it,
   judging of ourselves as he will judge of us: for he who has outward
   purity only, without a thorough renovation within him, and a sanctified
   disposition of heart, may indeed hereafter see God, but then he is like
   to see him only as his judge, 174.

SERMON LIII.

  GAL. v. 24.

   And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections
   and lusts. P. 178.

   As all sects and institutions have their distinguishing badge, or
   characteristic name, that of Christianity is comprised in the
   crucifixion of the flesh, and the lusts thereof, 178.

   This explained, by shewing,

   I. What is meant by being Christ's: it consists in accepting of, and
   having an interest in Christ, as he is offered and proposed in the
   gospel, under three offices; his prophetical, his kingly, and his
   sacerdotal, 179.

   II. What is meant by the flesh, and the affections and lusts: by the
   former we are to understand the whole entire body of sin and
   corruption, the inbred proneness in our nature to all evil; by the
   latter, the drawing forth of that propensity or principle into the
   several commissions of sin, through the course of our lives, 180.

   The text further prosecuted in shewing two things:

   I. Why this vitiosity and corrupt habit of nature comes to have this
   denomination of flesh: and that for three reasons:

   1. Because of its situation and place, which is principally in the
   flesh; concupiscence, which is the radix of all sin, following the
   crasis and temperature of the body, 181.

   2. Because of its close, inseparable nearness to the soul; being, as it
   were, ingrafted into it, and thereby made connatural to it, 186.

   3. Because of its dearness to us; there being nothing we prosecute with
   a more affectionate tenderness, than our bodies; and sin being our
   darling, the queen-regent of our affections, 188.

   Hence is inferred,

   1. The deplorable estate of fallen man, 191.

   2. The great difficulty the duty of mortification, 191.

   3. The mean and sordid employment of every sinner, 192.

   II. What is imported by the crucifixion of the flesh: under which is
   shewn;

   1. What is the reason of the use of it in this place: it is used by way
   of allusion to Christ, of whose behaviour and sufferings every
   Christian is to be a living copy and representation, 193.

   2. The full force and significancy of the expression: it imports four
   things: (1.) The death of sin, 196. (2.) Its violent death, 198. (3.)
   Its painful, bitter, and vexatious death, 199. (4.) Its shameful and
   cursed death, 201.

   3. Some means prescribed for the enabling us to the performance of this
   duty: viz.

   (1.) A constant and pertinacious denying our affections and lusts in
   all their cravings for satisfaction, 203.

   (2.) The encountering them by actions of the opposite virtues, 204.

   IV. What may be drawn, by way of consequence and deduction, from what
   has been delivered: and,

   1. We collect the high concernment and absolute necessity of every
   man's crucifying his carnal, worldly affections, because, without it,
   he cannot be a Christian, 205.

   2. We gather a standing and infallible criterion to distinguish those
   that are not Christ's from those that are, 206.

   An objection, that "it is an hard and discouraging assertion, that none
   should be reputed Christ's, unless he has fully crucified and destroyed
   his sin," answered by explaining the doctrine to mean, an active
   resolution against sin, 206.

  PREACHED JANUARY 30th.

  HABAKKUK ii. 12.

   Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood. P. 209

   A short account being given of this whole prophecy, which foretells the
   great event of the Babylonish captivity, 209. the words of the text are
   prosecuted in five particulars.

   I. The ground and cause of this woe or curse; which was the justly
   abhorred sin of blood-guiltiness, 212.

   II. The condition of the person against whom this curse is denounced:
   he was such an one as had actually established a government and built a
   city with blood, 214.

   III. The latitude and extent of "this woe or curse; which includes the
   miseries of both worlds, present and future: and, to go no further than
   the present, is made up of the following ingredients:

   1. A general hatred and detestation, fastened upon such men's persons,
   217.

   2. The torment of continual jealousy and suspicion, 219.

   3. The shortness and certain dissolution of the government, that he
   endeavours so to establish, 220.

   4. The sad and dismal end that usually attends such persons, 222.

   IV. The reasons, why a curse or woe is so peculiarly denounced against
   this sin. Among many, these are produced:

   1. Because the sin of bloodshed makes the most direct breach upon human
   society, of which the providence of God owns the peculiar care and
   protection, 224.

   2. For the malignity of those sins, that almost always go in
   conjunction with it; particularly the sins of fraud, deceitfulness, and
   hypocrisy, 226.

   V. An application of all to this present occasion, 227. by shewing how
   close and home the subject-matter of the text comes to the business of
   this annual solemnity.

   1. In the charge of unjust effusion of blood, considered, 1. As public,
   and acted by and upon a community, as in war, 228. or, 2. Personal, in
   the assassination of any particular man, 229.

   2. In the end or design for which it was shed; namely, the erecting and
   setting up of a government, 230.

   3. In the woe or curse denounced, which is shewn to have befell these
   bloody builders. 1. In the shortness of the government so set up, 231.
   2. In the general hatred that followed their persons,

SERMON LV.

  1 JOHN iii. 8.

   For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy
   the works of the Devil. P. 234.

   This divine apostle endeavours to give the world a right information
   about this so great and concerning affair in this chapter, and
   particularly in these words; wherein we have,

   I. An account of Christ's coming into the world, in this expression;
   the Son of God was manifested. Which term, though it principally
   relates to the actual coming of Christ into the world, yet is of a
   larger comprehension, and leads to an enumeration and consideration of
   passages before and after his nativity, 234.

   II. The end and design of his coming, which was to destroy the works of
   the Devil. In the prosecution of which is shewn,

   1. What were those works of the Devil that the Son of God destroyed,
   238. and these works are reduced to three: 1. Delusion, his first art
   of ruining mankind; which is displayed by a survey of the world lying
   under gentilism, in their principles of speculation and practice, 239.
   2dly, Sin. As the Devil deceived men only to make them sinful, some
   account is given of his success herein, 243. 3dly, Death: the
   inseparable concomitant of the former, 247.

   2dly, The ways and means by which he destroys them. Now as the works of
   the Devil were three, so Christ encounters them by those three distinct
   offices belonging to him as mediator. 1st, As a prophet, he destroys
   and removes that delusion, that had possessed the world, by those
   divine and saving discoveries of truth, exhibited in the doctrine and
   religion promulged by him, 248. 2dly, As a priest, he destroyed sin, by
   that satisfaction that he paid down for it, and by that supply of grace
   that he purchased, for the conquering and rooting it out of the hearts
   of believers, 250. 3dly, As a king he destroys death by his power: for
   it is he that has the keys of life and death., opening where none
   shuts, and shutting where none opens, 251.

SERMON LVI.

  MATTHEW ii. 3.

   And when Herod the king-heard these things, he was troubled, and all
   Jerusalem with him. P. 253.

   It having been the method of divine Providence, to point out
   extraordinary events and passages with some peculiar characters of
   remark; such as may alarm the minds and engage the eyes of the world,
   in a more exact observance of, and attention to, the hand of God in
   such great changes; no event was ever ushered in with such notable
   prodigies and circumstances as the nativity of our blessed Saviour,
   253. Some of them the apostle recounts in this chapter; which may be
   reduced to these two heads:

   I. The solemn address and homage made to him by the wise men of the
   east. Under which passage these particulars are considered:

   1. Who and what these wise men were, 255.

   2. The place from whence they came, 258.

   3. About what time they came to Jerusalem, 260.

   4. What that star was that appeared to them, 262.

   5. How they could collect our Saviour's birth by that star, 263.

   II. Herod's behaviour thereupon, 266. Herod is discoursed of,

   1. In respect of his condition and temper, in reference to his
   government of Judaea; which are marked out by three things recorded of
   him, both in sacred and profane story. 1st, His usurpation, 266. 2d,
   His cruelty, 267. 3d, His magnificence, 268.

   2. In respect of his behaviour and deportment, upon this particular
   occasion, which shews itself, 1. In that trouble and anxiety of mind
   that he conceived upon this news, 270. 2. In that wretched course he
   took to secure himself against his supposed competitor, 271.

   3. In respect of the influence this his behaviour had upon those under
   his government.

   The question, why Christ, being born the right and lawful king of the
   Jews, yet gave way to this bloody usurper, and did not assume the
   government to himself, answered:

   1. Because his assuming it would have crossed the very design of that
   religion that he was then about to establish; which was, to unite both
   Jew and Gentile into one church or body, 273.

   2. Christ voluntarily waved the Jewish crown, that he might hereby
   declare to the world the nature of his proper kingdom; which was, to be
   wholly without the grandeur of human sovereignty, and the splendour of
   earthly courts, 274.

SERMON LVII.

  MATTHEW x. 37.

   He that loves father or mother better than me is not worthy of me. P.
   275.

   Our Saviour here presents himself and the world together, as
   competitors for our best affections, challenging a transcendent
   affection on our parts, because of a transcendent worthiness on his,
   275.

   By father and mother are to be understood whatsoever enjoyments are
   dear unto us, 276. and from the next expression, he is not worthy of
   me, the doctrine of merit must not be asserted: because there is a
   twofold worthiness, 1. According to the real inherent value of the
   thing; and so no man by his choicest endeavours can be said to be
   worthy of Christ, 277. 2. When a thing is worthy, not for any value in
   itself, but because God freely accepts it as such, 277.

   This being premised, the sense of the words is prosecuted in three
   particulars.

   I. In shewing what is included and comprehended in that love to Christ
   here mentioned.

   It may include five things. 1. An esteem and valuation of Christ above
   all worldly enjoyments whatsoever, 278. 2. A choosing him before all
   other enjoyments, 279. 3. Service and obedience to him, 281. 4. Acting
   for him in opposition to all other things, 284. 5. It imports a full
   acquiescence in him alone, even in the absence and want of all other
   felicities, 286.

   II. In shewing the reasons and motives that may induce us to this love.

   1. He is the best able to reward our love, 291.

   2. He has shewn the greatest love to us, 294. and obliged us with two
   of the highest instances of it: 1. He died for us, 296. 2. He died for
   us while we were enemies, and in the phrase of scripture, enmity itself
   against him, 298.

   III. In shewing the signs and characters whereby we may discern this
   love.

   1. A frequent and indeed a continual thinking of him, 300.

   2. A willingness to leave the world, whensoever God shall think fit by
   death to summon us to a nearer converse with Christ, 301.

   3. A zeal for his honour, and an impatience to hear or see any
   indignity offered him, 302.

SERMONS LVIII. LIX. LX.

  EPHESIANS iii. 12.

   In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of
   him. P. 305. 321. 337.

   Prayer is to be exercised with the greatest caution and exactness,
   being the most solemn intercourse earth can have with heaven. The
   distance between God and us, so great by nature, and yet greater by
   sin, makes it fearful to address him: but Christ has smoothed a way;
   and we are commanded to come with a good heart, not only in respect of
   innocence, but also of confidence, 305.

   The words prosecuted in the discussion of four things.

   I. That there is a certain boldness and confidence, very well becoming
   of our humblest addresses to God, 306.

   This is evident; for it is the very language of prayer to treat God
   with the appellation of Father. The nature of this confidence is not so
   easily set forth by positive description, as by the opposition that it
   bears to its extremes; which are of two sorts.

   1. In defect. This confidence is herein opposed, 1. To desperation and
   horror of conscience, 307. 2. To doubtings and groundless
   scrupulosities, 308. Some of these stated and answered, 309.

   2. In excess. Herein confidence is opposed, 1. To rashness and
   precipitation, 312. 2. To impudence or irreverence, which may shew
   itself many ways in prayer, but more especially, 1. By using of saucy,
   familiar expressions to God, 315. or, 2. In venting crude, sudden,
   extemporary conceptions before God, 317.

   II. Is shewn, that the foundation of this confidence is laid in the
   mediation of Christ, 319. which is yet more evidently set forth,

   III. In shewing the reason, why Christ's mediation ought to minister
   such confidence to us: which is, the incomparable fitness of Christ for
   the performance of that work, 321. and this appears by considering him,

   1. In respect of God, with whom he is to mediate, 322. God in this
   business sustains a double capacity, (1.) Of a Father; and there cannot
   be a more promising ground of success in all Christ's pleas for us,
   322. (2.) Of a Judge: now Christ appears for us, not only as an
   advocate, but as a surety, paying down to God on our behalf the very
   utmost that his justice can exact, 323. and besides God himself
   appointed him to this work, 324.

   2. In reference to men, for whom he mediates. He bears a fourfold
   relation to them. 1. Of a friend, 326. 2. Of a brother, 327. 3. Of a
   surety, 328. 4. Of a lord or master, 329.

   3. In respect of himself, who performs the office. 1. He is perfectly
   acquainted with all our wants and necessities, 331. 2. He is heartily
   sensible of and concerned about them, 333. 3. He is best able to
   express and set them before the Father, 334.

   IV. Whether there is any other ground that may rationally embolden us,
   in these our addresses to him, 337.

   If there is, it must be either, 1. Something within; as the merit of
   our good actions, 337. But this cannot be, 1. Because none can merit
   but by doing something absolutely by his own power, for the advantage
   of him from whom he merits, 338. 2. Because to merit is to do something
   over and above what is due, 338. It must then be,

   2. Something without us: and this must be the help and intercession
   either, 1. Of angels, or 2. Of saints, 339.

   Angels cannot mediate for us, and present our prayers; 1. Because it is
   impossible for them to know and perfectly discern the thoughts, 339. 2.
   Because no angel can know at once all the prayers that are even uttered
   in words throughout the world, 339-

   The arguments some bring for the knowledge of angels, partly upon
   scripture, 340. and partly upon reason, 344. examined and answered,
   341. 344.

   The foregoing arguments against angels proceed more forcibly against
   the intercession of saints: to which there may be added over and above,
   1. That God sometimes takes his saints out of the world, that they may
   not know and see what happens in the world, 346. 2. We have an express
   declaration of their ignorance of the state of things below in Isaiah
   lxiii. 16. 347.

   The Romish arguments from scripture, Luke xxi. and from reason, stated
   and answered, 348.

   The invocation of saints supposed to arise, 1. From the solemn
   meetings, used by the primitive Christians, at the saints' sepulchres,
   and there celebrating the memory of their martyrdom, 351. 2. From those
   seeds of the Platonic philosophy, that so much leavened many of the
   primitive Christians, 352. 3. From the people's being bred in idolatry,
   352. But the primitive fathers held no such thing; and the council of
   Trent, that pretended to determine the case, put the world off with an
   ambiguity, 353.

   Conclusion, that Christ is the only true way; the way that has light to
   direct, and life to reward them that walk in it; and consequently there
   is no coming to the Father but by him, 355.

SERMON LXI.

  GENESIS vi. 3.

   And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive with man. P. 357.

   God, in the first chapter, looks over all created beings, and
   pronounces them to be good: in this chapter, he surveys the sons of men
   before the flood, and delivers his judgment, that they were exceeding
   wicked, nay totally corrupt and depraved. But amidst those aboundings
   of wickedness, God left not himself without a witness in their hearts:
   they had many checks and calls from the Holy Spirit, which, by their
   resolution to persist in sin, they did at length totally extinguish.
   God withdraws his Spirit, and the strivings of it: and presently the
   flood breaks in upon them, to their utter perdition, 357.

   The words afford several observations; as first, from the method God
   took in this judgment, first withdrawing his Spirit, and then
   introducing the flood, we may observe,

   1. D. That God's taking away his Spirit from any soul, is the certain
   forerunner of the ruin of that soul, 358.

   2. From that expression of the Spirits striving with man, we may
   observe,

   2. D. That there is in the heart of man a natural enmity and opposition
   to the motions of God's holy Spirit, 359.

   3. From the same expression we may observe,

   3. D. That the Spirit in its dealings with the heart is very earnest
   and vehement, 359-

   4. From the definitive sentence God here passes we may observe,

   4. D. That there is a set time, after which the convincing operations
   of God's Spirit upon the heart of man, in order to his conversion,
   being resisted, will cease, and for ever leave him, 359.

   This last doctrine, seeming to take in the chief scope of the Spirit in
   these words, is here prosecuted in four things.

   I. In endeavouring to prove and demonstrate the truth of this assertion
   from scripture, 360.

   That it is the way of God's dealings still to withdraw his Spirit after
   some notorious resistance, instanced from several scriptures: 1. From
   Psalm xcv. 10, 11. 360. 2. From Heb. iv. 7. 361. 3. From Luke xix. 42.
   361. And from Gen. xv. 16. 362.

   Here note, that by a set time, is not to be understood a general set
   time, which is the same in every man; but a set and stinted time in
   respect of every particular man's life, in which there is some limited
   period wherein the workings of the Spirit will for ever stop, 364.

   II. In shewing how many ways the Spirit may be resisted; that is, in
   every way which the Spirit takes to command and persuade the soul to
   the performance of duty and the avoidance of sin, 364. As,

   1. Externally, by the letter of the word, either written or preached,
   it may be resisted, 365. 1. By a negligent hearing and a careless
   attendance upon it, 367. 2. By acting in a clear and open contrariety
   to it, 368. And this last kind of resisting is great and open
   rebellion; 1. Because action is the very perfection and consummation of
   sin, 370. 2. Because sin in the actions argues an overflowing and a
   redundancy of sin in the heart, 370.

   2. By its immediate internal workings upon the soul. And here the
   Spirit may be resisted,

   1, In its illumination of the understanding; that is, its infusing a
   certain light into the mind, in some measure enabling it to discern and
   judge of the things of God, 371. Now this light is threefold: 1. That
   universal light, usually termed the light of nature, 372. 2. A notional
   light of scripture; or a bare knowledge of and assent to scripture
   truths, 373. 3. A special convincing light, which is an higher degree,
   yet may be resisted and totally extinguished, 374.

   2. In its conviction of the will, 376. Now the convincing works of the
   Spirit upon the will, in all which it may be opposed, are, 1. A
   begetting in it some good desires, wishes, and inclinations, 377. 2. An
   enabling it to perform some imperfect obedience, 378. 3. An enabling it
   to forsake some sins, 380.

   III. In shewing the reasons why upon such resistance the Spirit finally
   withdraws.

   1. The first reason is drawn from God's decree, 382.

   2. Because it is most agreeable to the great intent and design of the
   gospel, l. In converting and saving the elect, 385. 2. In rendering
   reprobates inexcusable, 386.

   3. Because it highly tends to the vindication of God's honour: 1. As it
   is a punishment to the sinner, 390. 2. As a vindication of his
   attributes: 1. Of wisdom, 392. 2. Of mercy, in shewing it is no ways
   inferior, much less contrary to his holiness, 393. and not repugnant to
   his justice, 394.

   4. Because it naturally raises in the hearts of men an esteem and
   valuation of the Spirit's workings: 1. An esteem of fear, 396. 2. An
   esteem of love, 396.

   IV. In an application. We are exhorted not to quench the Spirit, but to
   cherish all his suggestions and instructions, 397. Because our
   resisting the Spirit will,

   1st, Certainly bereave us of his comforts, 398. which are, 1. Giving a
   man to understand his interest in Christ, and consequently in the love
   of God, 399. 2. Discovering to him that grace that is within him, 400.

   2d, It will bring a man under hardness of heart, and a reprobate sense,
   by way, 1. Of natural causation, 402. 2. Of a judicial curse from God,
   402.

   3d, It puts a man in the very next disposition to the great and
   unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost; the foregoing acts being like
   so many degrees and steps leading to this dreadful sin, which is only a
   greater kind of resistance of the Spirit, 402.

SERMON LXII.

  MATTHEW v. 20.

   For I say unto you. That unless your righteousness exceed the
   righteousness of the scribes and pharisees; ye shall in no case enter
   into the kingdom of heaven. P. 405.

   Our blessed Saviour here shews, first, that eternal salvation cannot be
   attained by the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees; secondly,
   that it may be obtained by such a one as does exceed it, 405.

   For understanding the words it is explained,

   I. That these scribes and pharisees amongst the Jews were such as owned
   themselves the strictest livers and best teachers in the world, 406.

   II. That righteousness here has a twofold acception. 1. Righteousness
   of doctrine, 406. 2. Righteousness in point of practice, 407.

   III. That the kingdom of heaven has three several significations in
   scripture: 1. It is taken for the Christian economy, opposed to the
   Jewish and Mosaic, 407. 2. For the kingdom of grace, 408. 3. For the
   kingdom of glory, 408.

   These things premised, the entire sense of the words lies in three
   propositions.

   1. That a righteousness is absolutely necessary to the attainment of
   salvation, 409.

   2. That every degree of righteousness is not sufficient to entitle the
   soul to eternal happiness, 409.

   3. That the righteousness that saves must far surpass the greatest
   righteousness of the most refined hypocrite in the world, 409.

   This proposition, virtually containing both the former, is the subject
   of the discourse, and prosecuted in three things.

   I. Shewing the defects of the hypocrites, (here expressed by the
   scribes and pharisees,) 410.

   As, 1. That it consisted chiefly in the external actions of duty, 410.
   2. That it was but partial and imperfect, not extending itself equally
   to all God's commands, 412. 3. That it is legal; that is, such a one as
   expects to win heaven upon the strength of itself, and its own worth,
   416.

   II. Shewing the perfections and qualities by which the righteousness
   that saves transcends that of the hypocrites.

   Among many, four are insisted upon: 1. That it is entirely the same,
   whether the eye of man see it or not, 420. 2. That it is an active
   watching against and opposing every even the least sin, 423. 3. That it
   is such an one as always aspires and presses forward to still an higher
   and an higher perfection, 426. 4. The fourth and certainly
   distinguishing property of it is humility, 428.

   III. Shewing the necessity of such a righteousness in order to a man's
   salvation. Which arises,

   1. From the holiness of God, 430.

   2. From the work and employment of a glorified person in heaven: and no
   person, whom the grace of God has not thoroughly renewed and
   sanctified, can be fit for such a task; for it is righteousness alone
   that must both bring men to heaven, and make heaven itself a place of
   happiness to those that are brought thither, 432.

SERMON XLVII.

  ROMANS xii. 18.

   If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
   men.

   CHRISTIANITY, if we well weigh and consider it, in the several parts
   and members of it, throughout the whole system, may be justly called
   the last and the most correct edition of the law of nature; there being
   nothing excellent amongst the heathens, as deducible from the external
   light of nature, but is adopted into the body of Christian precepts.
   Neither is there any precept in Christianity so severe and mortifying,
   and at the first face and appearance of things grating upon our natural
   conveniencies, but will be resolved into a natural reason; as advancing
   and improving nature in the higher degrees and grander concerns of it.

   And of so universal a spread is the benign influence of this religion,
   that there is no capacity of man but it takes care for; not only his
   religious, but his civil and political. It found the world under
   government, and has bound those bonds of government faster upon it, by
   new and superadded obligations. And by the best methods of
   preservation, it secures both the magistrate's prerogative and the
   subject's enjoyment, by the happy provisions of peace; the encomiums of
   which great blessing I shall not now pursue, nor forestall here what
   will more aptly be inserted hereafter.

   The text, we see, is a vehement, concerning, passionate exhortation to
   this blessed duty, and great instrument of society, peace. If it be
   possible, live peaceably. It is suspended upon the strictest
   conditions, stretching the compass of its necessity commensurate to the
   utmost latitude of possibility.

   The words are easy, but their matter full; and so require a full and a
   large, that is, a suitable prosecution; which I shall endeavour to give
   them in the discussion of these four particulars.

   I. The shewing what is implied in the duty here enjoined.

   II. What are the measures and proportions by which it is to be
   determined.

   III. What are the means by which it is to be effected.

   IV. What the motives by which it may be enforced.

   I. And for the first of these, the duty here enjoined is, live
   peaceably; which expression is ambiguous, and admits of a double
   signification.

   1. It may be taken for the actual enjoyment of peace with all men. In
   which sense he only lives peaceably, whom no man molests.

   2. It may be taken for a peaceable behaviour towards all men. In which
   sense he lives peaceably, by whom no man is molested.

   The first of these senses cannot be here intended by the apostle, and
   that for these two undeniable reasons.

   (1.) Because so to live peaceably is impossible; and what cannot
   possibly be done, cannot reasonably be commanded.

   The impossibility of it appears upon these two accounts.

   1st, The contentious, unreasonable humour of many men. Upon this score,
   David complains of his enemies, that when he spoke of peace, they were
   for war. Many of the enmities of the world commence not upon the merit
   of the person that is hated, but upon the humour of him that hates: and
   some are enemies to a man for no other cause in the earth, but because
   they will be his enemies. The grounds of very great disgusts are not
   only causeless, but oftentimes very senseless. Some will be a man's
   enemies for his looks, his tone, his mien, and his gesture; and upon
   all occasions prosecute him heartily with much concernment and
   acrimony. And therefore that argument is insignificant, which I have
   often heard used by some men to others; who, when they complain of
   injurious dealings, think they have irrefragably answered them in this;
   Why should such an one be your enemy? what hurt have you done him? or
   what good can he do himself by injuriously treating of you? All which
   supposes that some reason may and must be given for that which, for the
   most part, is absolutely unreasonable. A little experience in the world
   would quickly and truly reply to these demands; that such or such an
   one is an enemy, not upon provocation, but that his genius and his way
   inclines him to insult, and to be contentious. And nature is sometimes
   so favourable to the world, as to set its mark upon such a person, and
   to draw the lines of his ill disposition upon his face; in which only
   you are to look for the causes of his enmities, and not in the actions
   of him whom he prosecutes.

   There are some persons, that, like so many salamanders, cannot live but
   in the fire; cannot enjoy themselves but in the heats and sharpness of
   contention: the very breath they draw does not so much enliven, as
   kindle and inflame them; they have so much bitterness in their nature,
   that they must be now and then discharging it upon somebody; they must
   have vent, and sometimes breathe themselves in an invective or a
   quarrel, or perhaps their health requires it: should they be quiet a
   week, they would need a purge, and be forced to take physic.

   And now, if any one should be molested and have his peace disturbed by
   such a person, would he be solicitous to find out the cause, and
   satisfy himself about the reason of it? When you see a mad dog step
   aside out of his walk only to bite somebody, and then return to it
   again, you had best ask him the reason why he did so. Why, the reason
   is, that he is mad, and his worm will not let him be quiet, without
   doing mischief, when he has opportunity.

   Now such tempers there are in the world, and always were, and always
   will be; and so long as there be such, how can there be a constant,
   undisturbed quietness in societies? We may as well expect, that nobody
   should die when the air is generally infected, or that poison should be
   still in the stomach, and yet work no effect upon the body. God must
   first weed the world of all contentious spirits and ill dispositions,
   before an universal peace can grow in it. And this may be one reason to
   prove, that a living peaceably with all men, as it signifies the actual
   enjoying of such a peace, is utterly impossible.

   2dly, The second reason is from the contrary and inconsistent interests
   of many men. Most look upon it as their interest to be great, rich, and
   powerful: but it is impossible for all that desire it to be so;
   forasmuch as some's being so, is the very cause that others cannot. As
   the rising up of one scale of the balance does of necessity both infer
   and effect the depression of the other.

   This premised, we easily know further, that there is nothing which men
   prosecute with so much vigour, vehemence, and activity, as their
   interest; and the prosecution of contrary interests must needs be
   carried on by contrary ways and motions; which will be sure to thwart
   and interfere one with another: and this is the unavoidable cause of
   enmity and opposition between persons.

   Sometimes we see two men pecking at one another very eagerly, with all
   the arts of undermining, supplanting, and ruining one another. What! is
   it because the one had done the other an injury? or because he is of a
   quarrelsome temper? Perhaps neither; but because he stands in his way;
   he cannot rise but by his disgrace and downfall; he must be removed, or
   the other person's designs cannot go forward. Now as long as both these
   interests bear up together, and one has not totally run down and
   devoured the other, so long the persons will be engaged in a constant
   enmity and contest.

   The ground that the poet assigned as one great cause of the civil wars
   between Caesar and Pompey, multis utile bellum, is that into which most
   men's particular quarrels and enmities are resolved. In peace, every
   man enjoys his own; and therefore he that has nothing of his own, will
   be ready enough to blow the trumpet for war, by which he may possibly
   gain an estate, being secure already that he can lose none.

   What is the reason that it is observed in tradesmen and artificers,
   that they are always almost detracting from one another; but that it is
   the apparent interest of one, by begetting in men a vile esteem of the
   other, to divert his custom to himself; or at least to secure that in
   his own hands, which he has already? If the other person is the only
   workman, why then he shall monopolize all the custom; if he be as good
   as this, then this shall have the less: and this is that which sets
   them upon perpetual bickerings and mutual vilifications.

   The sum of all is, that most men's interests lie cross, their
   advantages clash, or at least are thought to do so: and contrary
   qualities will prey upon one another. Where men's interests fight, they
   themselves are not like to be long at peace. But now God, in his wise
   providence, is pleased to cast the affairs of mankind into such a
   posture, that there will be always such inequalities and contrarieties
   in the conditions and estates of men. And this is the other reason, why
   to enjoy peace with all men is impossible.

   (2.) But in the next place, admitting that it were not impossible, yet
   thus to live peaceably with all men cannot be the sense of the
   apostle's exhortation, forasmuch as it can be no man's duty. That which
   is the matter of duty ought to be a thing not only possible in itself,
   but also in the power of him to whom it is enjoined. But it is not in
   my power to enjoy peace with all men, since this depends upon their
   behaviour towards me, and not immediately upon mine towards them. And
   therefore it can be no more my duty, than it is my duty that another
   man should not be a thief or a murderer. If he will be so, I cannot
   prevent him; he only is the master of his own will and actions: and
   where the power of acting is seated, there only lies the obligation of
   duty; otherwise, if I should be obliged to that which depends not at
   all upon my power, a man might as well tell me that I am obliged to see
   that it does not thunder, or that the Turk does not invade Germany.
   Wherefore it is clear that the words of the text are to be understood
   only in the second sense propounded; and that living peaceably imports
   no more than a peaceable behaviour towards all men: which being the
   duty here enjoined, we are to see what is included in it.

   And for this it seems adequately to consist of these two things.

   1. A forbearance of hostile actions.

   2. A forbearance of injurious, provoking words.

   This seems to take in the whole scope of it, as comprehending all that
   makes up the behaviour of one man towards another, which are his
   actions and his words; what he does and what he says. And if those
   unruly instruments of action, the tongue and the hands, be regulated
   and kept quiet, there must needs ensue an entire peace.

   1. And first, the living peaceably implies a total forbearance of all
   hostile actions, and that in a double respect:

   (1.) In a way of prevention.

   (2.) In a way of retaliation.

   (1.) For the first, I call that prevention, when a man unprovoked makes
   an injurious invasion upon the rights of another, whether as to his
   person or estate. God, for the preservation of society, has set a
   defence upon both these, and made propriety sacred, by the mounds and
   fortifications of a law. For what living were there, did not the divine
   authority secure a man both in his being and in the means of his being;
   but should leave it free for the stronger to devour and crush the
   weaker, without being responsible to the almighty Governor of all
   things for the injury done to his fellow-creature, and the contempt
   passed upon the divine law?

   And certainly one would think it not only a reasonable, but a very easy
   thing for a man wholly unprovoked to keep his hand from his brother's
   throat, to let him live and enjoy his limbs, and to have the benefits
   of nature, and the common rights of creation. It is a sad thing for a
   man not to be safe in his own house, but much more in his own body, the
   dearer earthly tabernacle of the two. How barbarous a thing is it to
   see a Romulus imbruing his hands in the blood of his brother! and he
   that kills his neighbour, kills his brother, as to the common bonds and
   cognation of humanity. Now all murders, poisons, stabs, and unjust
   blows, fall under this just violation of the peace in reference to
   men's persons; which God will avenge and vindicate, as being parts of
   his image: for there is none who requires to be honoured in himself,
   who will endure to be affronted so much as in his picture.

   It is looked upon by some as a piece of gentility and height of spirit,
   to stab and wound, especially if they are assured that the injured
   person will not resist; and so secure them the reputation of
   generosity, without the danger of betraying their cowardice.

   The other instance of violence, is the forcible wringing from men the
   supports of life, their estates, their revenues, or whatsoever is
   reducible to this notion, as contributing either to their subsistence
   or convenience. And this is not to be understood barely of oppression
   managed by open and downright defiance; but by any other sinister way
   whatsoever, as the overbearing another's right by the interest and
   interposal of great persons, by vexatious suits and violence cloaked
   with the formalities of a court and the name of law. And whosoever
   interverts a profit belonging to another by any of these courses, is a
   thief and a robber; perhaps a more safe and creditable one indeed, but
   still a thief; and that as really, as if he did it by plunder and
   sequestration; which is only a more odious name, but not a more unjust
   thing.

   And he is no less a disturber of the peace, and a breaker of this law,
   who oppresses the widow, and grinds the face of the fatherless and the
   poor, than he who forages a country with an army. For that is only
   violence with a greater noise, and more solemnities of terror. But God,
   who weighs an evil action by the malignity of its principle and the
   injustness of its design, and not by those exterior circumstances which
   only clothe its appearance, but not at all constitute its nature, has
   as much vengeance in store for an oppressing justice (if that be not a
   contradiction in the terms) as he has for the pillaging soldier or the
   insolent decimator: it being as truly oppression in the accounts of
   heaven, when proclaimed by the groans and cries of the orphan, as when
   ushered in with the sound of the trumpet and the alarm of war.

   For wherein should consist the difference? Is it because one stands
   upon his ground, and repels the invasion? and the other opens his bosom
   to the blow, and resigns himself to his oppressor with patience and
   silence? Is it peace, because the man is gagged and cannot, or overawed
   and dares not cry out of oppression? Or is he therefore not wronged,
   because his adversary, by his place or greatness, has set himself above
   the reach of justice, and is grown too big for the law?

   It was an acute and a proper saying of one concerning a prevailing
   faction of men, Solitudinem cum fecerint, pacem vocant; when they have
   devoured, wasted, and trampled down all before them, so that there is
   none indeed so much as left to resist, that they call peace. But
   certainly neither are the peacemakers blessed, nor is the peace a
   blessing, that is procured by such dismal methods of total ruin and
   desolation. And thus much for the forbearance of hostility in point of
   prevention or provocation.

   (2.) In the next place, there is required also a forbearance of all
   hostile actions, as to retaliation. I shall not run forth into the
   common place about revenge, it being a subject large and important
   enough to be treated of in a discourse by itself. But this I shall say,
   that according to the weights and measures by which Christianity judges
   of things and actions, he that revenges an injury will be found as
   truly a malefactor in the court of heaven, as he that does one. And he
   that requires an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, is a Jew, and
   not a Christian; a person of a mean spirit, and a gross notion,
   unacquainted with the sublimity and spirituality of so refined and
   excellent a religion.

   A peaceable deportment is one of the great duties enjoined in it: and
   the rule and measure of that is to be charity, of which divine quality
   the apostle tells us in 1 Cor. xiii. 7, that it suffers all things,
   hopes all things, endures all things. The very genius and nature of
   Christianity consists in this, that it is a passive religion: a
   religion that composes the mind to quietness, upon the hardest and the
   most irksome terms and conditions.

   And the truth is, if it drives on a design of peace, we shall find that
   the consequences of revenge make as great a breach upon that, as a
   first defiance and provocation. For were not this answered with
   resistance and retribution, it would perhaps exhale and vanish; and the
   peace would at least be preserved on one side. For be the injurious
   person never so quarrelsome, yet the quarrel must fall, if the injured
   person will not fight. Fire sometimes goes out, as much for want of
   being stirred up, as for want of fuel.

   And therefore he that can remit nothing, nor recede, nor sacrifice the
   prosecution of a small dispensable right to the preservation of peace,
   understands not the full dimensions and latitude of this great duty;
   nor remembers that he himself is ruined for ever, should God deal with
   him upon the same terms.

   The great God must relax his law, and recede from some of his right;
   and every day be willing to put up, and connive at many wrongs, or I am
   sure it is impossible for him to be at peace with us. He shines upon
   his enemies, and drops the dew of heaven upon the base and the
   unthankful. And in this very instance of perfection, Matth. v. 48, he
   recommends himself to our imitation.

   If revenge were no sin, forgiveness of injuries could be no duty. But
   Christ has made it a grand and a peculiar one: indeed so great, as to
   suspend the whole business of our justification upon it, in Matth.
   xviii. 35. And in the foregoing verses of that chapter, treating of the
   unmerciful servant, who exacted a debt from his poor fellow-servant, we
   find that his lord was wroth with him, and delivered him to the
   tormentors. Neither could it have profited him to have said, that he
   exacted but what was lawfully his own; what was due to him upon the
   best and the clearest terms of propriety. No; this excused not the
   rigour of a merciless proceeding from him, who had but newly tasted of
   mercy, and being pardoned a thousand talents, remorselessly and
   unworthily took his fellow by the throat for an hundred pence.

   It is or may be the case of every one of us. We pray every day for
   forgiveness; nay, we are so hardy as to pray that God would forgive us
   just so as we forgive others: and yet oftentimes we can be sharp,
   furious, and revengeful; prosecute every supposed injury heartily and
   bitterly; and think we do well and generously not to yield nor relent:
   and what is the strangest thing in the world, notwithstanding an
   express and loud declaration of God to the contrary, all this time we
   look to be saved by mercy; and, like Saul, to be caught into heaven,
   while we are breathing nothing but persecution, blood, and revenge.

   But as to the great duty of peaceableness which we have been
   discoursing of, we must know, that he who affronts and injures his
   brother breaks the peace; but withal that he who owns and repays the
   ill turn, perpetuates the breach. By the former, a sin is only born
   into the world; but by the latter, it is brought up, nourished, and
   maintained.

   And perhaps the greatest unquietness of human affairs is not so much
   chargeable upon the injurious, as the revengeful. The first undoubtedly
   has the greater guilt; but the other causes the greater disturbance. As
   a storm could not be so hurtful, were it not for the opposition of
   trees and houses; it ruins no where, but where it is withstood and
   repelled. It has indeed the same force when it passes over the rush or
   the yielding osier; but it does not roar nor become dreadful, till it
   grapples with the oak, and rattles upon the tops of the cedars. And
   thus I have shewn the first thing included in a peaceable behaviour,
   viz. a forbearance of hostile actions, and that both as to provocation
   and retaliation. But whether all kind of retaliation be absolutely
   unlawful, shall be inquired into afterwards.

   2. The other thing that goes to constitute a peaceable behaviour, is a
   forbearance of injurious, provoking words. I know none that has or
   deserves a reputation, but tenders the defence of it, as much as of his
   person or estate. And perhaps it has as great an influence upon his
   contents and emoluments as both of them. It is that which makes him
   considerable in society. He is owned by his friends, and cannot be
   trampled upon by his enemies. Even those that will not love him, will
   yet in some manner respect him. For till the enclosures of a man's good
   name are broke down, there cannot be a total waste made upon his
   fortunes.

   Upon this it is, that abusive language, by which properly a man's
   repute is invaded, is by all men deservedly looked upon as an open
   defiance, and proclaiming of war with such a person: and consequently,
   that the reviler is as great a disturber as an armed enemy; who usually
   invades a man in that which is much less dear unto him. Rabshakeh broke
   the peace with Hezekiah, as much by his railing, as by the army that
   besieged him. And he that flings dirt at a man, affronts him as much as
   he that flings a stone at him. A wound upon the skin is sometimes
   sooner got off than a spot upon the clothes.

   I would fain know, what man almost there is, that does not resent an
   ugly, reflexive word with more acrimony and impatience, than he would
   the stab of a poniard. He remembers it more tenaciously, prosecutes it
   more thoroughly, and forgets it much more difficultly. And the reason
   is, because a blow or a wound directs an evil only to a man's person,
   but an ill word designs him a wider calamity; it endeavours the
   propagation and spreading of his unhappiness, and would render him
   miserable as far as he is known.

   Besides, it hurts him so as to put the reparation of that hurt
   absolutely out of his power: for it lodges his infamy in other men's
   thoughts and opinions, which he cannot command or come at, so as to
   rectify and disabuse them. But admit that the defamed person by a
   blameless and a virtuous deportment wipes off and confutes the calumny,
   and clears himself in the esteem of men; yet it is of those only with
   whom the scene of his converse lies: but in the mean time the slander
   spreads and flies abroad; and many hundreds come to hear the ill words
   by which the man is abused, who never come to see his own behaviour by
   which he is righted.

   I conclude therefore, that this great duty of living peaceably is not
   consummate, without a constant and a careful suppression of all
   offensive and provoking speeches. And he who does not acquit himself in
   this instance of a Christian behaviour, will find hereafter, that men
   will meet with as certain a condemnation for what they have said, as
   for what they have done.

   And thus much for the first general thing proposed for the handling of
   the words; namely, to shew what was implied in the duty enjoined in
   them. I pass now to the

   Second, which is to consider, what are the measures and proportions by
   which it is to be determined. And those are expressed in these words;
   If it be possible, live peaceably. Now possible may be taken two ways.

   1. As it is opposed to naturally impossible, and that which cannot be
   done. Which sense cannot be here intended, as being supposed in all
   just and reasonable commands. For none can rationally command or advise
   a man to that, which is not naturally within his power, as has been
   already observed.

   2. It may be taken, as it is opposed to morally impossible, and that
   which cannot be done lawfully: for it is a maxim in the civil law, id
   possumus quod jure possumus; which was the sense of Joseph's answer to
   his mistress, in Genesis xxxix. 9, How can I do this great wickedness,
   and sin against God? and of that of the apostle, 2 Corinth. xiii. 8, We
   can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. In both which
   places, not the possibility, but the lawfulness of the action is
   specified; and that is the sense here intended.

   But now the observance of peace being limited by the measure of lawful,
   it follows, that where the breaking of the peace is not unlawful, there
   the maintaining of it ceases to be a necessary duty. It is of some
   moment therefore to satisfy ourselves when it is lawful, and when
   unlawful to break the peace. And all inquiries concerning this are
   reducible to these two.

   1. Whether it can at all be lawful.

   2. Supposing that it may be lawful, when and where it ought to be
   judged so.

   Under the first of these I shall discuss that great question, whether
   war can be lawful for Christians. Under the second, I shall shew those
   general grounds that may authorize a war, and from thence descend to
   the resolution of particular cases. As,

   1. Whether it can be lawful to break peace with the magistrate.

   2. Whether it may be lawful for one private man to make war upon
   another, in those encounters which we commonly call duels.

   3. Whether it be lawful for a man to repel force with force, so as to
   kill another in his own defence.

   4. And lastly, since the prosecution of another in courts of judicature
   is in its kind a breach of the mutual bond of peace, I shall inquire
   whether it be allowable for Christians to go to law one with another.

   All these things admit of much doubt and dispute; and yet, being
   matters of common and daily occurrence, it concerns us to have a right
   judgment of them.

   I shall begin with the first question, which is concerning the
   lawfulness of war; in order to the resolution of which, I shall premise
   what it is. War may be properly defined, a state of hostility, or
   mutual acts of annoyance, either for the preservation of the public
   from some mischief intended, or in the vindication of it for some
   mischief already done to it.

   The ground of war therefore is some public hurt or mischief; and since
   this may be twofold, either intended or actually done, there are
   accordingly two distinct kinds of war, defensive or offensive.

   1. Defensive is in order to keep off and repel an evil designed to the
   public; and therefore is properly an act of self-preservation.

   2. Offensive is for the revenging a public injury done to a community,
   and so is properly an act of justice.

   It is clear therefore, that the lawfulness and justness of war is
   founded upon the justness of its cause; and this being once found out,
   and rightly stated, I affirm, that it is allowable before God to cease
   from peace, and to enter into a state of war; and that upon the
   strength of these arguments:

   (1.) That which is a genuine, natural, and necessary consequent derived
   from one of the chief principles of the law of nature, that is lawful:
   but so is war, namely, from the principles of self-preservation, the
   noblest and the most acknowledged of all those principles, by which
   nature regulates and governs the actions of the creature. Hoc et ratio
   doctis, necessitas barbaris, feris natura ipsa praescripsit, ut omnem
   semper vim, quacunque ope possint, a corpore, a capite, a vita sua
   propulsarent. Cicero, in his defence of Milo. And that
   self-preservation cannot be maintained without war is too evident to be
   proved. The Jews, when they were set upon by their enemies on the
   sabbath day, and then murdered and massacred, because they thought it
   unlawful to make any resistance, or to defend themselves on that day,
   have transmitted the sad truth of this assertion in bloody letters to
   posterity.

   That men will sometimes invade the rights and the lives of others is
   certain; and it is also as certain, that the naked breast is not the
   surest armour, nor patience the best weapon of defence.

   Do we expect a rescue from heaven? and that God should send down fire
   from the clouds, and work miracles for our preservation? Experience
   sufficiently convinces us that such an expectation is vain. God
   delivers men by means, when means are to be had, and by the interposal
   of their own endeavours: and therefore he that flies to the church when
   he should be in the field, and takes his prayer-book in his hand when
   he should take his sword, tempts God, and loses himself; and, according
   to a due estimate of things, becomes a murderer, by so patiently
   suffering another to be so.

   Victrix patientia is a puff and a metaphor; and may, perhaps, in the
   issue of things, bear a man through a domestic injury or a private
   affront; but I never read that it put an army to flight, or rebated the
   courage or controlled the invasion of a fighting enemy.

   Besides, patience is properly the suffering quietly, when God in his
   providence calls us to suffer: but it is not a suffering, when God
   calls us to act, and to stand upon our own defence. As in some men we
   see it usual to veil their cowardice and pusillanimity with the names
   of prudence and moderation; so that, which some call patience, will be
   once found nothing else but a lazy relinquishment of the rights and
   privileges of their nature; and that a life and a being was much cast
   away upon such as would not exert the utmost power they had to defend
   it. This argument is properly for defensive war.

   (2.) The second is for offensive; and it proceeds thus: That which is a
   proper act of distributive justice is lawful; but such a thing is war,
   it being a retribution of punishment for a public hurt or injury done
   by one nation to another. That he who does a wrong should suffer for
   it, is a thing required by justice, the execution of which is committed
   to the supreme power of every nation: and why justice may not be done
   upon a company of malefactors defending themselves with arms, as well
   as upon any particular thief or murderer, brought shackled and disarmed
   to the block or the gallows, I cannot understand.

   The case in a civil war is clear between a magistrate assisted by his
   subjects, against another rebel part of his subjects: for he being the
   supreme power, the right of punishing offenders, whether single or in
   companies, is undoubtedly in him. But since to punish is properly an
   act of a superior to an inferior, and two kingdoms or nations seem to
   be equal, and neither to have any superiority or jurisdiction over the
   other, it may be doubted, how the one's making war upon the other can
   be properly an act of punitive justice.

   To this I answer, that though these two kingdoms or states be in
   themselves equal, yet the injury received gives the injured people a
   right of claiming a reparation from those that did the injury; and
   consequently, in that respect, gives them a kind of superiority over
   the other. For, in point of right, still the injured person is
   superior: and the reason is, because common justice is concerned in his
   behalf; to whose rules all nations in the world owe a real subjection.

   If it were not for war, therefore, there could be no provision made of
   doing justice upon an offending nation; justice would only prey upon
   particular persons; but national robberies, national murders, must pass
   in triumph with the reputation of virtues, as high and great actions,
   above the control of those common rules that govern the particular
   members of societies.

   In a word, society could not consist, if it were not lawful for one
   nation to exact a compensation for the injuries done to it by another;
   and upon the refusal of such compensation, to endeavour it by force and
   acts of hostility. Wherefore I conclude, that war must needs be just,
   when the instrument of its management is the sword of justice. And this
   argument is for offensive war.

   But before I dismiss it, there is one doubt that may require
   resolution, and it is this; that admitting that an injured nation may
   lawfully make war upon the nation that injured it, yet is it lawful for
   the injurious nation, being thus justly assaulted by war, also to
   defend itself?

   I answer, that it is; and that upon this ground, that be a man's
   delinquency against the laws of society never so great, yet, as long as
   he retains the nature of a man, he also retains the natural right of
   self-defence and preservation; unless where, by his own consent, he has
   quitted it.

   But you will say, a particular malefactor is bound to resign up his
   life to the punishment of the law without resistance: and the case, as
   to this, seems to be the same in a particular malefactor and an
   injurious nation; war being a doing of justice upon one, as the
   execution of the gallows is upon the other: and consequently the
   obligation to a non-resistance seems to be the same in both. I answer,
   that the case is very different; and that upon this reason, that a
   particular member of a commonwealth has consented and submitted to the
   laws of the nation of which he is a member, which laws enjoin
   malefactors to surrender up their lives to justice without resistance;
   whereupon, the right of resisting is lost by his own consent. But now
   there is no law imposed upon one nation by another, or owned and
   submitted to by any nation, that obliges it, for having done an injury
   to another nation, without resistance to endure the effects of war and
   an hostile invasion; whereupon it still keeps the right of defending
   itself against all opposition, how just soever it be on their sides
   that make it.

   (3.) The third argument is for all kind of war indifferently, and it
   runs thus: If St. John the Baptist, Christ himself, and the apostles,
   judged the employment of a soldier lawful, then war is lawful. The
   consequence is apparent; for every employment is lawful or unlawful,
   according to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the actions to which it
   is designed: an employment being indeed nothing else but a constant
   engaging of a man's self in such or such a way of action. And now for
   the assumption, that St. John the Baptist, Christ himself, and the
   apostles, judged the life and employment of a soldier lawful, it shall
   be made appear particularly.

   And first for St. John the Baptist. It was his great office to be the
   preacher of repentance, and to consign it with the great sacrament of
   baptism: upon which it is rational to conclude, that he admitted none
   to baptism, without declaring to them what sins they were to repent of.
   And since the sum of his doctrine was, that men should bring forth
   fruits worthy of repentance; when any men asked him what they were to
   do, to fulfil this great command, it is most consonant to reason to
   judge, that his answer taught them all that was included in that duty,
   and shewed them whatsoever was inconsistent with it.

   But now, when the soldiers amongst others asked John what they should
   do, Luke iii. 14, he speaks nothing at all of laying down their
   employment; but rather confirms that, by prescribing rules to them how
   they should manage it: as, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any
   one falsely, and be content with your wages. In short, it is not
   imaginable that the great forerunner of the Messias, even one of the
   greatest persons that was born of women, should busy himself to
   instruct men how they should lawfully manage such an employment as was
   in itself absolutely unlawful; and to countenance men to receive wages
   for a work that he judged highly impious and unjust.

   In the next place, for the judgment of Christ and his apostles about
   this matter; the first we have in Matth. viii. 10, where Christ,
   speaking of the centurion, said, that he had not found so much faith,
   no, not in Israel. And the like is testified of Cornelius the
   centurion, in Acts x. 1, 2, that he was a devout man, and one that
   feared God with all his house.

   From whence I argue thus: he whose faith Christ commended, and he to
   whom the Spirit of God bore this testimony, that he was a devout man,
   and feared God, could neither of them be engaged in a course of life
   absolutely unlawful; otherwise saving faith, and the fear of God, would
   be consistent with a settled, constant, resolved living in sin. For he
   whose employment is sinful, sins habitually, and with a witness; and we
   might, with as much propriety of speech, and truth in divinity, commend
   the faith of an highwayman, and say, a devout bawd, and a devout cheat,
   as a devout centurion.

   I conclude therefore, that war is a thing in itself lawful and
   allowable, and that the proof of it stands firm, both upon the
   principles of nature and the principles of Christianity.

   And being so, it is a great wonder that Faustus Socinus, and his
   school, in other things too partial defenders of nature, should yet in
   this so undeservedly desert it, as to assert all war to be utterly
   unlawful; not indeed by virtue of the law of nature, or of Moses, but
   of Christ, who, they say, has perfected the two former, and superadded
   higher and more sublime precepts.

   But still I cannot see that this sect of men are able to quit
   themselves from the charge of very great unreasonableness in this
   assertion. For in those truths that concern the theory of the Christian
   religion, as about the Trinity and the like, they vehemently contend
   that all scriptures, howsoever in the clearest appearance of natural
   construction looking that way, yet ought to be interpreted and brought
   down to the analogy and rules of natural reason. But here, in the
   highest concerns of practice, in which men's lives and fortunes, their
   being and wellbeing, are immediately interested, they strip men of all
   the rights of nature, and that under pretence of such an injunction
   from the Christian religion.

   It concerns us therefore to inquire into their arguments; which we
   shall do, first, by examining the general ground upon which they stand;
   and then by traversing those several scriptures which these men allege
   in the behalf of their opinion.

   First of all then, they lay this as the foundation of all their
   arguings in this particular, that God, under the Mosaical covenant,
   made only promises of temporal possessions and blessings to his people;
   and therefore giving them a temporal Canaan, it was necessary that he
   should allow them the means of defending it, which was properly by war,
   and repulsing their temporal enemies: but now under the covenant of
   grace, established by the mediatorship of Christ with the world, God
   has made no express promise of any temporal enjoyments or felicities;
   but rather, on the contrary, bids us despise and take our minds wholly
   off from them. And therefore, according to the tenor of such a
   covenant, he has made no provision to secure his people in any such
   temporalities, but took from them all right of war and resistance.

   To this, which is a proposition current through the main body of the
   Socinian divinity, I answer, that it is both false in itself, and as to
   the present purpose hugely inconclusive.

   For first, it is to be denied that God transacted with his people,
   under the Mosaical covenant, only in temporal promises: he did indeed,
   according to the thick genius of that people, too much intent upon
   worldly happiness, express and shadow forth spiritual blessings under
   temporal; but that they had hopes, and consequently promises of a
   better life after this, is clear from sundry places, as particularly
   that in Psalm lxxiii. 24, where David says to God, Thou shalt guide me
   with thy counsel here, and afterward receive me to glory. And it is
   clear, from all the foregoing verses, that by the guidance of God's
   counsel, he understood God's favour to him throughout the whole compass
   of his life. But more fully in Heb. xi. 13, where the divine author,
   speaking of the ancient heroes before the times of the gospel, says,
   that they all died in the faith, not having received the promises, but
   having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
   them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
   What could be said more fully and expressly to shew the insolence of
   that assertion, that by taking from the Mosaical church all promise of
   future blessedness, would degrade them to the rank of brutes and swine,
   and epicures, who live only by this beastly principle: Let us eat and
   drink to-day, for to-morrow we shall die?

   And further, it is also false, that God has under the covenant of grace
   made no temporal provision for the persons under it. For what mean
   those words of Christ, Matt. vi. 33, Seek ye first the kingdom of God.,
   and all these things shall be added unto you? God indeed did not design
   these temporals as parts of the great promised blessing, as he did
   under the Mosaical covenant, but only as appendages and concomitants of
   it, that so he might shew the spiritual nature of this covenant to be
   much above that of the other: but still it follows not, but God has
   made an allowance of temporal necessaries under the second covenant,
   though not in the same manner and upon the same terms that he did under
   the first.

   It is clear therefore, that the contrary proposition is false; and that
   it is as weak in the nature of an argument, as it is false in the
   nature of a proposition, is no less manifest.

   For if the only reason that made war lawful to the Jews was because it
   was a means to secure them in the possession of their temporal Canaan,
   against the invasion and incursions of the enemy, then when there was
   no such incursion or invasion, it ceased to be lawful: this is a
   natural inference. But the contrary is evident: for we know that they
   commenced a lawful war against the tribe of Benjamin, their brethren,
   in which there could be no pretence either of securing or enlarging the
   borders of the promised land; but only a just revenge acted upon them,
   for a black and villanous trespass upon the laws of common justice and
   humanity.

   And then for the Christian church; suppose they should have no federal
   or spiritual right to their earthly possessions, yet they have a civil
   and a natural right; which right they may accordingly defend: since, by
   virtue of the covenant of grace, to have a title to heaven; and withal
   to have a civil and temporal claim to their earthly estates; and
   further, to maintain that claim against the violence of an enemy; are
   not at all opposite or contrary one to the other, but very fairly
   subordinate.

   But that I may thoroughly pluck up this false foundation, grounded upon
   the difference of the two covenants, I shall observe this: that since
   in the former covenant there were some things of moral and external
   right, some things only of positive institution, peculiarly made for
   and restrained to the church and commonwealth of the Jews; whatsoever
   alterations and abrogations have been made by Christ under the second
   covenant, were only of those positive laws, peculiar and proper to the
   Jews; all other things, which depended upon the eternal and immutable
   laws and rights of nature, remaining inviolately the same under both
   covenants, and as unchanged as nature itself.

   Now such a thing I affirm the right of war to be, as being the result
   and dictate of that grand natural right of self-preservation. It is the
   voice of reason and nature, that we should defend our persons from
   assassination, and our estates from violence: and he that seeks for
   rescue from any thing but a vigorous resistance, will find himself
   wronged to that degree, that it will be too late for him to be righted.

   Having thus removed the false ground of the arguments, proving the
   utter unlawfulness of war, I come now to see what countenance this
   opinion receives from scripture; from which the abettors of it argue
   thus:

   If we are expressly commanded not to resist evil, but being smote on
   the right cheek, to turn the other also, as in Matt. v. 39. and to
   recompense no man evil for evil., nor to avenge ourselves, but rather
   to give place to wrath, as in Rom. xii. 17, 19. if also we are
   commanded to love our enemies, as in the same Matt v. then war, which
   includes in it the clean contrary, is utterly unlawful.

   Before I answer these particular scriptures, I shall premise this:

   What if we should answer Socinus in his own words, who in his book De
   Jesu Christo Servatore, disputing against Covelus for the disproving of
   Christ's satisfaction, has the hardiness to say, that the word
   satisfaction is not to be found in scripture? which is true. But
   supposing that it were; yet it being, in his judgment, contrary to
   right reason, it was not, he says, to be admitted in the sense
   naturally signified by it. So say I; these scriptures indeed, however
   they prohibit self-defence, yet this being contrary to the light of
   nature and right reason, they are not to be admitted in their proper
   signification. Surely this, though it were a bold and a profane speech,
   yet to him it were a very full answer, who makes the very same plea
   upon a parallel occasion.

   But we shall not need such refuges. To those scriptures therefore I
   answer, that they are to be understood only of private revenge acted by
   one particular man upon another, and not of a public, managed by the
   authority of the magistrate: but such a revenge only is war. That the
   words are so to be understood is clear, as the occasion of those in
   Matt. v. shews: for Christ's design was to beat down that corrupt and
   false gloss of the pharisees upon the law, who taught that it was
   lawful for any private man to right and revenge himself with his own
   hands; provided that he observed the just measure of equality between
   the evil which he suffered, and the evil which he returned: whereas
   indeed Moses committed the execution of this law of retaliation only to
   the magistrate.

   Hereupon Christ tells them, that it was the duty of private men not to
   resist evil, nor to revenge themselves, but being smote upon one cheek
   to turn the other; which words are not literally to be understood, for
   neither Christ himself nor the apostle Paul so behaved themselves: but
   being smote upon the face, they expostulated the injury of the blow,
   John xviii. 23, and Acts xxiii. 3. But they are only an hyperbolical
   speech, prescribing a very great degree of patience and composure of
   mind; and that of the two, we should rather choose, having received one
   injurious blow, to offer ourselves to another, than to sin against God
   by revenging it.

   But that this prohibition of revenge, further urged in Rom. xii. 19,
   concerns only private men, and not absolutely damns all kind of
   revenge, acted by a public person, is manifest; for not above six
   verses off, namely, in verse 4, chap. xiii. the apostle is so far from
   denying this to the magistrate, that he tells us it is the very design
   of his office, and that he beareth not the sword in vain; as being the
   minister of God., a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doeth
   evil. We cannot therefore make the apostle to forbid all revenge,
   without a gross and a palpable contradicting of himself.

   But besides, as touching revenge, which is properly a retaliation, or
   repaying one evil for another, that this is not a thing in its nature
   unlawful, is invincibly proved by this: that God, by an express law,
   under the Mosaical economy, committed the exercise of it to the
   magistrate. But were it a thing in the very nature of it unjust, God
   could not so much as permit or allow the practice of it, much less
   countenance it by a law.

   As for the next injunction, of loving our enemies, I answer, 1. That it
   is there directed by Christ to particular persons, not public bodies or
   whole nations. 2. But secondly, admitting that it extends to these
   also, yet I assume that the love here commanded is not properly a love
   of friendship, but a love of charity; which consists in a freedom from
   any malice to, or hatred of our enemies' persons: and this may continue
   and be maintained, even while a man, either in the defence or
   vindication of his country, kills his adversary in the field.

   For I suppose a judge may be in charity with a malefactor while he
   condemns him; and the executioner have no design of hatred to him, whom
   by the duty of his office he makes a sacrifice to common justice.

   The case is the same in war; where, when a man kills another, it is not
   because he has not a love of charity to his person, but because he is
   bound to love his prince and his country with a greater.

SERMON XLVIII.

  ROMANS xii. 18.

   If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
   men.

   II. THE second argument to prove the unlawfulness of all war is taken
   from that prophecy, in Isaiah ii. 4, where it is said of those that
   shall live in the times of the gospel, that they shall beat their
   swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: and nation
   shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
   any more.

   Answ. But to this I answer;

   1. That prophecies only foretell the future event of things, but
   determine nothing concerning either the lawfulness or unlawfulness of
   those things.

   2. If these words are understood literally, that after the coming of
   the Messias war shall every where cease; then they prove nothing, but
   what the Jews pretend to prove by them, which is, that Jesus Christ is
   not the Messias; forasmuch as since his coming, we have seen no such
   thing as a general cessation of war over the world.

   For the explication of this place therefore we must observe; that in
   scripture, things have those effects ascribed to them which they have a
   natural fitness to produce: though by accident, and other impediments,
   they never actually produce them. Thus, because the gospel delivers
   such precepts to the world, which if men would live up to, there would
   certainly ensue such an universal peace and tranquillity; therefore the
   production of such a peace is ascribed to the gospel, though, through
   the vice and corruption of men, the case of things fall out to be much
   otherwise.

   But it may be replied, that then, however, those who obey and live up
   to the precepts of the gospel, ought to abstain from all war: whence it
   follows, that, according to those precepts, war is unlawful.

   I answer, that upon supposition of such an absolute obedience to the
   doctrine of Christ, war indeed would not be lawful, because the very
   ground and occasion of it would be taken away, by the inoffensive
   behaviour of one man towards another. But the dispute is here
   concerning what is lawful to be done, when the generality of the world
   live not according to the tenor of this doctrine, but invade the rights
   of others. In which case I affirm, that the gospel rends not from any
   the privileges of a natural defence, and the prosecution of justice in
   a lawful war.

   As for instance, the gospel, as much as any doctrine can do, makes
   provision that there should be no thieves or murderers in the world, by
   a prohibition of those unhallowed courses: but yet when it falls out
   that men obey not those prohibitions, but engage in such practices,
   surely it does not strip the magistrate of all right to animadvert upon
   such offenders, but leaves the axe as sharp, and the gibbet as strong
   as ever it was under the law. This exception therefore concludes
   nothing.

   But then by the way, for the further clearing of the text from the
   Jews' objection, raised out of it against Jesus Christ's being the
   Messiah; besides what has been said, I add further, as to the very
   literal impletion of the prophecy, that when it is foretold that a
   thing shall come to pass in the time of the gospel, it is not necessary
   to understand that it must happen immediately upon the introduction of
   it, and be always to be found in the world, during the continuance of
   the gospel: but it is sufficient if it come to pass and be fulfilled in
   any period of it. And who knows but before the world ends, God may give
   the gospel such a progress over the earth, and withal such a mighty
   influence upon the hearts of those that profess it, that there may be
   such an universal peace to be seen amongst all nations, and such
   glorious halcyon days, as the very literal purport of these prophecies
   seems to exhibit to us. From whence I infer, that we must first see an
   end of all things, before the Jews' objection can be admitted to prove
   what it does intend.

   III. The third argument for the unlawfulness of war is taken from that
   place in Matt. xxvi. 52, where Christ commanding Peter to put up his
   sword, tells him, that all they that take the sword shall perish by the
   sword. From whence it follows, that since Christ allowed not his
   disciple the use of the sword, and that upon such an occasion as the
   defence of his master, and him also the Lord and Saviour of the world,
   certainly he would not allow of it as lawful upon any other occasion
   whatsoever. To this I answer, that the sense and meaning of every
   speech is to be limited to the subject-matter of it, and also to be
   measured by that which first occasioned the utterance of it. Now Christ
   reprehends Peter, because that by an unwarranted, though perhaps a
   well-meaning zeal, and without any leave, either had or asked from
   Christ himself, he flew upon the high priest's servant in that manner.
   The words therefore, howsoever uttered in general terms, signify only
   thus much; that those who without any call or warrant from the lawful
   superior power, but merely by the instigation of an hot zeal, and an
   hotter head, shall presume to use the sword, such shall perish by the
   sword. But this concludes nothing against the lawfulness of those men's
   waging war, who come to it armed with the authentic call of the supreme
   magistrate, to whom God has committed the defence of the subject, and
   the administration of justice. It is indeed a dagger in the throat of
   their cause, who can dare to raise armies, ruin countries, and subvert
   governments, upon no other commission, than the impulse of a furious
   ambition and a pretended inspiration.

   IV. The fourth and last argument for the unlawfulness of war may be
   framed thus: That which proceeds from a sinful cause, and produces
   sinful, unlawful effects, that itself is unlawful. But so does war. For
   the sinfulness of its cause, we have an account of that in James iv. 1,
   Whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of
   your lusts? And for the unlawfulness of its effects, we need only
   survey our own experience, without recurring to any further histories
   to inform us what dismal cruelties, rapines, and outrages, are the
   constant, inseparable attendants of war. Now for that which issues from
   so evil a beginning, and draws after it such evil consequences, it is
   certainly very strange, if it should not be in an high degree evil
   itself. But to this I answer,

   1. As for that place of St. James, it speaks only of personal quarrels
   and dissensions between particular men, and not of national hostilities
   managed by the public conduct of the magistrate: which only is the
   thing here disputed of.

   2. But secondly, admit that the words may be extended to national
   hostilities and wars between people and people; yet the apostle speaks
   only of what usually are the causes of war; and not, what are so of
   necessity, and according to the nature of the thing itself: which,
   though on one side they are unlawful, namely on that which gives the
   offence; yet on the other, the causes of it are not. always men's
   lusts; but a rational defence of their country, and a due vindication
   of public justice.

   In a word, it is one thing to speak of war, as actually it uses to be
   managed, and another to speak of it, as it ought and may be managed.
   And this affords also an answer to the second part of the argument,
   concerning those sad and sinful effects that follow it, as unjust
   violences, rapines, cruelties, and the like. Of all which it is to be
   said, that they proceed only from the corruption and vice of those who
   manage it, but are utterly extraneous to the nature of war, considered
   precisely in itself. I know no action so good and allowable but may
   derive a contagion by passing through ill hands. But we are not to
   judge of the nature of any thing or action by that which is only
   accidental to it. The nature of war consists properly either in the
   repelling of an intended, or the revenging of a received injury. But
   whether this be done with unjust rapines and hideous cruelties upon the
   innocent, or duly and justly, the nature of war is still the same: the
   quality is indeed altered from just to unjust, but that amounts to no
   more than the ill performing of a thing in itself indifferent.

   And thus I have answered all the arguments that to me seem to be of any
   moment to prove the absolute unlawfulness of all war; upon the strength
   of which answers, I think I may reckon upon it as a proved assertion,
   that war is not a thing in itself unlawful.

   I suppose nobody will conclude the foregoing discourse to have been a
   commendation of war, much less an exhortation to it. It is indeed a
   lawful, but a sad remedy. And I think there is none who looks upon it
   as a sufficient argument to persuade him that the cutting off a leg or
   an arm is a desirable thing, because it is better to do so, than to
   have a gangrene spread itself over the whole body.

   Caustics and corrosives may be endured, but certainly the causes that
   make them necessary are not to be chose. War can be desired only in the
   nature of a remedy, and a remedy always supposes an evil. And I know no
   argument so strong to prove the lawfulness of war, but that war itself
   is a stronger argument to prove the worth and the convenience of peace.

   I have now done with the first general inquiry, concerning the measures
   by which the great duty of peaceableness is to be determined: which
   was, Whether war could be at all lawful? I come now to the second,
   which is to inquire, upon supposition that it may be lawful, When and
   where it ought to be judged so? And here I shall,

   First, lay down some general grounds that may authorize war. And,

   Secondly, descend to the resolution of particular cases.

   For the first of these, I shall lay these four general grounds of the
   lawfulness of it, premising first what is the nature of peace.

   Peace is properly the mutual forbearance of acts of hostility or
   annoyance, in order to the preservation of our nature in all its due
   rights and capacities.

   It is clear therefore, that peace is a means or instrument designed
   only to such an end. Now that ceasing to be able to compass this end,
   to which it is designed, ceases also to be an instrument or means, and
   consequently to engage us to use it: whereupon it is lawful to enter
   into a contrary estate, namely, of hostility or war.

   From whence follow these assertions, as so many general grounds of it.

   1. When those with whom we are at peace declare that they will annoy
   us, unless we cut off our limbs, and injure and mangle our bodies; and
   accordingly upon our refusal disturb us; as Nahash the Ammonite did to
   the men of Jabesh Gilead, offering them peace only upon condition that
   they would let him thrust out their right eyes, 1 Sam. xi. 2; it is in
   such a case lawful to repel and resist that force or disturbance. For
   every one has a right to preserve his limbs and the faculties of his
   nature.

   2. When those with whom we are at peace declare war with us, unless we
   will renounce our religion, and, upon our refusal, do so; (which is the
   case of the pope's exposing the dominions of those whom he calls
   heretics to the invasion of other princes;) it is then lawful to repel
   and resist that force or invasion. The reason is, because every man has
   a natural right to the use of that which he apprehends indispensably to
   conduce to his chiefest good: and that is his religion.

   3. When one nation injures another to that degree, as to blast its
   honour and reputation, it is lawful to revenge that public breach of
   honour by a public war. The reason is, because the honour of a nation
   is as absolutely necessary to the welfare and support of it, as its
   trade or commerce; it being indeed the great instrument of both, and
   perhaps also of its very safety and vital subsistence: it being seldom
   known that a government, dishonoured and despised abroad, did long
   preserve itself in credit and respect at home.

   4. When those with whom we are at peace declare war with us, unless we
   will quit our civil rights, as our estates and families, and the
   protection of the laws, and accordingly upon our refusal do so; it is
   lawful to enter into war with those who make such encroachments upon
   us. The reason is, because when civil societies are constituted and
   submitted to, every man, so submitting to them, has a natural right to
   the conveniences and enjoyments of such societies.

   Now the foundation of the lawfulness of war in all the forementioned
   cases is, because whatsoever a man has a lawful right to possess or
   enjoy, he has by consequence a right to use all those means which are
   absolutely necessary to the possession or enjoyment of that thing.

   You will say now, that, according to this doctrine, when the prince
   encroaches upon his subjects' bodies, estates, or religion, they may
   lawfully resist or oppose him.

   This objection brings in the resolution of the first particular case
   proposed by us to be discussed, which is, Whether it be lawful for
   subjects in any case to make war upon the magistrate? My answer to it
   is in the negative; and the reason is, because the subject has resigned
   up all right of resistance into the hands of his prince and governor.

   And for this we must observe, that as every man has naturally a right
   to resist any one that shall annoy him in his lawful enjoyments, so he
   has a general, natural right, by which he is master of all the
   particular rights of his nature, so as to retain them or recede from
   them, and give them away as he pleases.

   Now when a man consents to be a subject, and to acknowledge any one for
   his governor, he does by that very action invest him with all the
   necessary means of being a governor; the chief of which is, a quitting
   and parting with that natural right of resisting him upon any occasion
   whatsoever.

   And every man consents to have such an one his governor, from whom he
   covenants to receive protection, and to whom he does not actually
   declare a non-subjection.

   This being laid down, it follows, that it is not more natural for a man
   to resist another particular man, who would deprive him of his rights,
   than it is natural for him not to resist his prince upon the same
   occasion. Forasmuch as by a superior and general right of nature, he
   has parted with this particular right of resistance: and consequently,
   having given his prince the propriety of it, he cannot any more use it,
   unless his prince should surrender it back to him again; which here is
   not supposed.

   And this is the ground upon which I judge a resistance of the supreme
   magistrate both unlawful and irrational. But there have not been
   wanting in the world scholars to teach, as well as soldiers to act the
   contrary. Such as have weakened the ties of government, and shook the
   supremacy of princes, by prescribing of cases in which this duty of
   nonresistance binds not the subject; and by which they are so
   discharged of their allegiance, as to be let loose to carve for
   themselves, and to restrain their superiors.

   But before I come to survey any of their opinions, I shall premise this
   rule or maxim: that those whom the people have a right of proceeding
   against, so as to punish them by law; those also they may proceed
   against by war and open force, in case that legal course of proceeding
   be obstructed.

   The reason is, because war is a remedy upon the default of law; and
   therefore, where the coercive power of the law cannot have its effect,
   war is to take place, and supply the want of it: Ubi judicia desinunt,
   incipit bellum, says Grotius in his second book de Jure Belli, cap. i.
   sect. 2.

   Upon which ground it is, that one private man cannot revenge an injury
   upon another by open force, the law being open for him to right himself
   by; but one nation may by force and war revenge an injury done to it by
   another nation, because there is no provision of a coercive power
   stated by a law between them, by which one nation may implead the
   other, and so have a reparation of an injury made it by the sentence of
   a common judge. Now I premise this observation to shew, that whosoever
   teaches that the people may judicially proceed against and punish their
   prince, the same person does by consequence affirm that the people may
   also take up arms against him, when they cannot otherwise bring him to
   such a judicial process.

   This being observed, I cannot but set before you those several cases
   assigned by Grotius in his first book de Jure Belli, and fourth
   chapter, in which he asserts it lawful for the people to proceed
   against their prince. As,

   (1.) When, according to the professed constitution of the government,
   the prince is accountable to the people, as in Lacedaemon, where the
   people owned a coercive power over their king, which power they
   deposited in the hands of their ephori; who, by virtue thereof,
   restrained the king at the people's pleasure.

   (2.) When a prince quits and relinquishes all right of government:
   after which action, he says, the prince may be dealt withal as any
   other private man.

   (3.) When he would transfer and alienate the right of government to
   another: in which endeavour, he says, the subjects may hinder, and by
   force resist him.

   (4.) When he actually attempts the destruction of all his people.

   (5.) When he holds the grant of the sovereignty from the people upon
   conditions, and fails in the fulfilling of those conditions.

   (6.) When the prince holds but part of the supreme power, the senate or
   people holding the other part: in which case, if the prince invades
   that part of the sovereign power not belonging to him, those to whom
   that part does belong may resist him. According to this doctrine, those
   amongst us who taught that the king was one of the three estates, and
   that the parliament was a power coordinate with him, did by consequence
   teach, that in some cases they might make war upon him; and their
   practice was not short of their doctrine.

   (7.) When, in the conferring of the sovereignty to a prince, the people
   declare, that in certain cases it shall be lawful for them to resist
   him: and the reason is, because he who transfers his right to another,
   may transfer it upon what terms or under what reserves he thinks fit.

   This seems of near affinity with the fifth instance, but it is not
   altogether the same: for the former is suspended upon the prince's not
   doing of something which he conditioned to do; but this speaks not of
   the prince's action, but of some events of affairs, under which the
   people put in caution, that their subjection to him should cease.

   These aphorisms I had rather rehearse than animadvert upon; the great
   reputation of the author making all censures upon him, though perhaps
   true, yet unhandsome.

   But the foundation which he had laid a little before, in the seventh
   section of the same chapter, seems large enough to bear all these
   superstructures, and many more.

   For proposing the question, Whether the law of not resisting the
   magistrate binds the subject in a great, imminent, and extreme danger?
   he answers, that most laws, human and divine, though running in
   absolute terms, yet imply a condition of relaxation in cases of
   extremity. And for this law, of not resisting the magistrate, he says
   it sprung first from the consent of the people, who, for the benefits
   of government and society, resigned themselves up to the absolute
   disposal of a sovereign; which people, he says, had they been asked
   whether they would have chose rather to die, than in any case
   whatsoever to resist their sovereign with an armed power, he conceives
   they would never have owned that to have been their will or intention;
   and consequently, that the sense of that law, which is to be measured
   by the sense of those from whose consent it took force, ought still to
   be supposed to imply an exception in cases of extreme danger. And
   accordingly he concludes, in the eighty-seventh page, that for his part
   he could not condemn a people, under such a danger, so defending
   themselves: that is, by a resistance of the magistrate; for that is the
   thing that he is debating of expressly, and exemplifies it by the
   Maccabees defending themselves with an army against Antiochus.

   This assertion, I am apt to think, in the full improvement of it, would
   widen itself to a very strange latitude. But thus much may be said for
   this author, that he breathed a popular air, and lived a member of a
   commonwealth, which needed such maxims as these to justify its being
   so.

   But David Paraeus has, with a much more barefaced impudence, flown in
   the face of sovereignty, in a set and long dispute upon Rom. xiii. a
   strange text, one would think, to preach rebellion upon. His arguments
   therefore I shall briefly examine and remove, and so conclude this
   question.

   The whole discourse stands upon these two propositions.

   Prop. I. The first is, that it is lawful for the inferior magistrates
   to resist and punish the supreme; and some of the cases in which they
   may do so are these.

   1. If he blasphemes God, or causes others to do so. 2. If he does the
   subjects some great injury. His words are, si ipsis fiat atrox injuria;
   a term of a very large comprehension, and it is hard if any pretence
   cannot clothe itself with this name. 3. If the subjects cannot freely
   enjoy their lives, estates, and consciences.

   This, I say, subverts all government; for, if the prince may be
   punished, it follows,

   (1.) That he is not supreme; for all punishment, as such, is an act of
   the superior upon the inferior.

   (2.) If the inferior magistrates may punish him, then they may also
   judge when he is to be punished; and consequently the prince is never
   secure, since it is in their power to judge this when they think fit;
   and they will undoubtedly think it fit, when they find it for their
   advantage.

   His reasons for this doctrine are principally these two.

   1. He lays down this division: kings are absolute or by compact; and
   subjoins, that there is none in Europe, but is by compact, and upon
   conditions. Upon this he reasons thus; that such a prince, violating
   the conditions upon which he holds the sovereignty, may be judged by
   the people or senate that made him prince, upon those conditions.

   To this I answer, first, that those who hold the supremacy upon any
   such conditional grant, upon default of these conditions, may indeed be
   made accountable to their people; but then I deny that either the kings
   of England, France, or Spain, hold their kingdoms by any such compact.
   Yet, because the kings of England take an oath at their coronation to
   govern by such and such laws, which in case they should not, Milton,
   and such others, are so bold as to absolve the subject from his
   allegiance; I shall, to dash that puritan, antimonarchical tenet, lay
   down this distinction; that it is one thing for a king to promise to
   manage his kingly office according to such rules, and another thing to
   take upon him the kingly office upon condition that he so governs: it
   is this latter only that would render him accountable to his people;
   but the former, if not fulfilled, is not breach of an antecedent
   condition, but only breach of a subsequent promise, for the sin of
   which he is answerable only to God.

   2. The other reason for the inferior magistrate's resisting the supreme
   is this; because they are joined with him as associates in the
   government, and God has committed the defence of the people to them in
   their order; by virtue of which commission, they are to defend them
   against the supreme magistrate himself, if a tyrant, as well as against
   any other: forasmuch as being intrusted with the people's defence, it
   matters not who the persons are, against whom they are to be defended.

   But to this the answer is ready, by a positive denial of that false and
   base principle, that the inferior magistrates are associates with the
   supreme; and that God immediately commissions them to govern and defend
   the people. For they are not the prince's associates, but his
   instruments in government, and have no power but what they receive
   immediately from him: and that he who acts by authority from another,
   cannot by that authority act against him, whose will and gift is the
   alone cause of that authority, is too clear to need any proof.

   It would be too long particularly to insist upon his other reasons to
   this purpose; I shall reduce them therefore to general heads, annexing
   to each their respective solutions.

   (1.) He argues from several scripture instances; as Ehud killing Eglon,
   and Jehu killing Joram.

   (2.) From many instances of the heathens; as the Romans deposing
   Tarquinius.

   (3.) From several speeches of princes, acknowledging a kind of
   dependence upon, and an accountableness to their people. To which I
   answer,

   1. For those scripture instances and examples, that most of them are
   set down without any approbation or disapprobation, but only by a bare
   historical narration; and withal, that the honesty of the person does
   not legalize every one of his actions. And perhaps it can no more be
   said, that to depose or kill a prince is just, because Ehud and Jehu
   did it, than, because David left Solomon in charge to revenge an old
   injury upon Shimei, a man may nowadays, having pardoned an injury, yet
   justly cause his son to revenge it. Add to this, that those persons are
   said to have done what they did by an especial commission or warrant
   from God; which men nowadays cannot pretend to.

   2. In the next place, to his allegation of the example of the Romans, I
   answer, that it was unlawful, and that to use it here is to prove the
   lawfulness of one rebellion by another.

   3. And for those several speeches and concessions of princes,
   acknowledging their right at the people's dispose, I answer, that we
   are not to judge of the right of princes by what they may sometimes
   speak in flattery, upon design, or necessity. Besides, that the
   concessions this or that prince makes from his own right cannot
   prejudice or infringe the right of others. And thus much for Paraeus's
   first proposition, by which we see how he has armed inferior
   magistrates, as sheriffs, constables, bailiffs, and the like, against
   their prince; and it is much, that he did not take care also for their
   calling of triennial parliaments. But does he stop here? no, he
   proceeds further in another proposition, which is this:

   If the prince shall offer violence to the subject, as a tyrant,
   murderer, or adulterer, and there is no help to be had from any
   inferior magistrate, then it is lawful for every private man to defend
   himself vi et armis, as from a common thief or murderer.

   This is wholesome divinity indeed; and it was not to be doubted, but
   that the former assertion would in the end produce this.

   His reasons for it are these two.

   (1.) Because what the inferior magistrates may do, that every private
   man may do in his own behalf, in a case of necessity. The consequence,
   I confess, is good, and therefore grant this to be just as lawful as I
   have already proved the former; that is, indeed, absolutely wicked and
   unlawful.

   (2.) Because otherwise God would have put it into the power of the
   magistrate to destroy the commonwealth. To this I answer, 1. That the
   magistrate is but a particular man, and therefore cannot effect such a
   thing by himself, but by the assistance of others, against whom some
   are of opinion that the subjects may defend themselves. As amongst us,
   let any man rob or injure us, and although he be ever so much commanded
   by the king to do so, yet we have our action against him at law. But
   still those who hold that the king's instruments, in any act of
   violence upon the subject, may be resisted, qualify their assertion
   with these two cautions: first, that the violence offered be apparent
   and notorious, such as no man endued with common reason can doubt of or
   deny; secondly, that the person of the king be still sacred and
   untouched: yet, since a king, without an absolute obedience to those
   instruments whom he shall think fit to employ, is but a mere mockery
   and an insignificant shadow; and since to make the subjects judges,
   when they are to obey persons so commissioned by him, and when to
   resist them, clearly opens a door to an insolent shaking off all
   subjection; I cannot think it safe to build any thing upon this
   assertion. 2. In the second place therefore I answer, that I see no
   inconvenience in granting, that that absolute authority which kings are
   invested withal, puts it within their power, by the abuse of it, to
   ruin the commonwealth. For if God puts it in the prince's power to be
   able to preserve, undoubtedly the same power, misemployed, will be as
   able to destroy society: he indeed is to be responsible to God for his
   tyrannical abuse of his trust; but subjects, whether their subjection
   makes them happy or miserable, yet still are to be subjects.

   And thus I think I have answered Paraeus's discourse, in which he sets
   himself as a bold arbitrator between the prince and the subject, so
   stating the privileges of one, as utterly to subvert the prerogative of
   the other. The usual patrons of this doctrine against princes are the
   Jesuits, who are properly the pope's janizaries; and those of the
   presbytery, whether at home or beyond the seas. But this opinion, that
   the supreme magistrate may be resisted by his subjects, I think none
   can confute so fully as the supreme magistrate himself.

   II. The next case that comes to be resolved, according to the order
   proposed by us, is,

   Whether it can be lawful for one particular man to make war upon
   another in those encounters which we commonly call duels?

   A duel, called by the Greeks monomachi'a, and by the Latins duellum,
   receiving its denomination from the persons engaged in it, is properly
   a fight or combat between two persons, mutually undertook, appointed,
   and consented to, by each of them.

   That the action is not a thing in itself absolutely unlawful is
   apparent, because otherwise it could not be lawful for two men, meeting
   in a battle, to fight one with another; nor for one man to fight for
   the defence of his life, with the murderer that assaults him. Since
   therefore this falls within the number of those actions, which, being
   indifferent in their nature, come to be stamped lawful or unlawful by
   their principles and circumstances, and other determining ingredients
   of action, we are to inquire when it is to be allowed, when not. In
   which inquiry we shall set down,

   1. The cases in which a duel is lawful.

   2. The cases in which it is impious, unlawful, and utterly to be
   disallowed.

   (1.) First of all then, when two malefactors stand convict, and
   condemned to die, and the magistrate appoints them to fight singly; in
   which fight he that overcomes shall have his life: in this case it is
   lawful for persons so condemned to accept of such a fight. The reason
   is, because on either side it is only a mutual desire of doing
   execution upon a malefactor convict: and it is lawful for one
   malefactor, upon the warrant or allowance of the magistrate, to do
   execution upon the other.

   (2.) When two armies are drawn out to fight, and the decision of the
   battle is cast upon a single combat, it is lawful for any two persons,
   upon the appointment of the generals, to undertake such a combat; the
   reason is, because it is allowable for soldiers under command to obey
   their generals in all things not apparently unjust: and a general has
   full power to draw out as much or as little of his army to fight, as he
   shall judge most conducible for the success; there being no ground to
   conclude, why he may not as well command one single soldier, as one
   regiment or body of men, to fight, how and when he shall judge fit.
   Besides the convenience of this course, that it is a compendium of war,
   and a redemption of the lives of thousands by the death of one,
   bringing all the advantages of a conquest, without the dismal miseries
   of a battle.

   (3.) When one challenges another, and resolves immediately to kill the
   challenged person, unless he accepts the combat, it is then lawful for
   him to accept it; forasmuch as this is nothing else but a repelling of
   force by force, and so is resolved into pure self-preservation: which
   shall be considered of by itself afterwards.

   But a case may be here propounded: Suppose one should accuse another
   for his life falsely, offering to verify his accusation by single
   fight, and the judge should declare that he would proceed to the
   sentence immediately, unless the person so accused would undertake thus
   to fight with his accuser in single combat.

   In answer to this, some affirm that the accused person may lawfully
   accept the challenge, it seeming to be equally a repelling of force,
   and the result much the same, whether the accuser endeavours to kill
   the accused by his own hand, or by the unjust sentence of the judge.

   But, with submission to better judgments, I conceive that it is not
   lawful for him in this case to accept the combat, the instances
   propounded being not indeed the same; for in one the danger is from the
   sentence of the judge, which, however unjust, a man is bound to submit
   to; in the other, the danger is from the force of a private person,
   which no man is obliged to submit to, but has a natural right to repel.

   And if it be replied, that such an one is necessitated to fight with
   his challenger in his own defence, for that otherwise he must die; I
   answer, that this very thing implies, that the necessity or compulsion
   is not absolute, but only conditional, unless he will submit to death;
   which of the two he is rather to choose, than to commit a sin.

   For the man is under a judicial process, and so has no right to defend
   himself by force: neither matters it to say, that the judge, by his
   permission or command, gives him a right; for the judge, by commanding
   or permitting him so to defend himself, unjustly balks his own duty,
   which would oblige him to decide the case of the innocent another way;
   and the judge's going against his duty, by an unjust command, cannot
   give any man a right to do according to that command. If the man is
   condemned, and dies, he suffers; but if he fights with his accuser,
   when the law ought to deliver him, he acts, and that unjustly. And this
   is to be observed, that though a man, by the unjust sentence of a
   judge, is obliged to suffer an unjust punishment; yet he cannot, by any
   allowance or command of the judge, have any right or obligation to do
   an unjust action.

   The sum of this case is, that a man, under the forementioned condition,
   is bound rather to die by an unjust sentence, than to take an undue
   course for his vindication.

   2. I come now to shew those cases in which duels are to be judged
   utterly unlawful.

   (1.) As first, when they are undertook for vain ostentation, and that
   either of affection to the dead; as it was the custom of the Romans
   heretofore, upon the death of some commander or great man, for some
   soldiers voluntarily to undertake a single fight at the funeral
   solemnities, and to kill one another, as it were, by way of sacrifice,
   in honour of the dead; by that, declaring their loss so great, that
   they had no will to survive them. It was a custom also, for ostentation
   of strength and valour at their public sights and shows, for persons to
   entertain the spectators with duels, and to die like fools, to please
   they knew not whom; till at length this wretched custom so prevailed,
   that some would hire themselves at the Praetorian shows, to fight thus
   in single combat, as men are nowadays hired to act upon the stage; and
   these were called gladiators, a term that grew to as great ignominy
   amongst the Romans, as thief or cutter is amongst us. I suppose I need
   not take any pains to prove the unlawfulness, nay, the sottishness of
   such duellings, where men sold their lives for a crown or an angel; and
   by a preposterous way of labouring, earned wages, not to get their
   living, but to procure their death. It argued also, by the way, a
   strange savageness in the Roman temper, that men, women, and children
   should come with such eagerness to, and enjoy themselves with such
   delight at those barbarous spectacles, in which their chiefest
   diversion and recreation was to behold these duellers kill one another
   upon the stage. From which custom, as vile as it was, both on their
   parts that beheld, and on theirs that fought, most learned men are of
   opinion, that the use of duels, now so frequent, had its infamous
   original.

   (2.) Another case in which men used to undertake single combats, was
   for the cleansing of themselves from some crime objected to them; which
   must needs be unlawful and highly irrational, as being a means no ways
   suited in its nature to such a purpose; and withal a bold presumption
   upon Providence, that any one, without any warrant from the revealed
   will of God, should presume that he must determine the success on the
   right side. For the ridiculous unreasonableness of it, besides the
   demonstrations of experience, that the guilty has frequently killed the
   innocent, it is further evident, from the very nature of the thing: for
   is there any natural inference, from a man's strength or success, to
   his innocence? or is it any argument, that the man did not steal
   another's goods, or defile his bed, because he had better skill at his
   weapon than his accuser, and so slew him? I should both abuse my own
   labour and your patience, should I endeavour to beat down this
   senseless custom by any further confutation.

   (3.) A third case is, when two agree upon a single combat, for the
   decision of the right of possessing any goods or estate, mutually
   claimed by both, in which it is agreed that the right shall fall to the
   conqueror. This also is utterly unlawful, as being a course wholly
   extrinsical to, and unfitted for the decision of matters of right.

   For in every doubtful case, there is yet a right on one side; and where
   there is a right, there a right may be proved: the proving of which
   belongs to the law, and the courts of justice; and he that seeks for
   law from his rapier, which he should seek from the judge, deserves to
   have his person instead of his case brought to the bar. No man has a
   right or power to choose the way of having his right tried, by any
   course not prescribed or permitted by the law.

   He indeed whose right the thing is, may possess and defend it against
   him who is pleased to doubt of the other's right; and in the defence of
   it may lawfully kill him in his unjust and violent invasion: but yet he
   may not voluntarily and by choice cast the deciding of his questioned
   right upon the issues of a single combat, a thing otherwise disallowed.
   The reason is, because though every man is master of his own right, yet
   he is not master of the way by which that right is to be tried; that
   being by all laws took out of private hands, and vested in the person
   of a public judge.

   And to what purpose are courts open, and tribunals erected, if causes
   must be tried in the field, and inheritances conveyed by the decrees of
   a lawless combat and a contingent conquest?

   (4.) The fourth and grand case is, when a duel is undertaken either for
   revenge of some injury done, or for vindication of a man's honour, upon
   the account of some affront passed upon him. As for the first of these,
   all plea of lawfulness is taken from it, by what has been already said
   in condemnation of private revenge. And for the second, which is the
   defence of the great idol and Diana of the duellists, called honour; it
   is confessed that the case of the challenger, and of him that is
   challenged, is very different. And for the former, there are few that
   patronize or absolve him, under what pretence soever he may absolve
   himself. But for the latter, many fair allegations may be made: as,
   that he loses his reputation upon refusal of the combat; and that, as
   to the real concernments of life, and the advantage of his fortunes, he
   is thought unfit for any public command or preferment which requires a
   person of courage; he is despised, scorned, and trampled upon, by which
   the contents and comforts of life, dearer than life itself, are torn
   from him: but with a non obstante to all this, I affirm any acceptance
   of a duel in such a case to be unlawful. And, in answer to what has
   been alleged, I reply, first, that it proves only to be a difficult
   duty; such as the exercise of most virtues are, especially according to
   those straight lines of duty drawn by Christianity. For if every
   inconvenience attending the performance of a duty should change it from
   being a duty, where is the difficulty of being religious? How can any
   man be obliged to suffer for conscience sake, if fear of suffering
   unties the obligation?

   The upshot of the dispute is, God by his providence, for the trial of a
   man's sincerity, and his obedience to the divine law, calls him to an
   act of duty, beset with high dissuasives, grim circumstances, and great
   discouragements. So that the point lies here: Will you lose your soul,
   or your reputation, the favour of God, or the opinion of men? quit your
   hopes of eternity, or the momentary breath of a popular applause? I
   suppose here the weight and reason of the thing is sufficient to
   determine his choice, and to support his spirit in all the calamities
   that shall attend it.

   Besides, that which is here supposed, which is loss of honour, is
   indeed no such thing: the measure of honour, is the judgment of the
   knowing, and the pious, and the virtuous, who will value and applaud
   the passive magnanimity of such an one, that durst look a duty in the
   face, in spite of scorn, and conquer the scoffs of the world, of which
   the most reputed for valour are afraid. All that he loses is the
   opinion of those who rate honour by a false rule, and measure glory by
   the standard of their own ignorance, vanity, and rashness: and the same
   persons who condemn him for this, would slight him as much for not
   talking obscenely, not scoffing at religion, and whatsoever is sacred,
   and for not drinking himself to the condition of a barrel or a spunge;
   or not rapping out such hideous oaths, as might even provoke divine
   justice to revenge the impiety of them upon a place or a nation. Those
   indeed who look upon the not doing of these things as pedantry, would,
   no question, account all refusal of a duel poorness and pusillanimity.

   It was a wise, a prudent, and indeed a valiant answer of a certain
   commander, who being challenged by one of his enemies to a duel, told
   him, that he would meet him in the head of the enemy; which to a
   soldier was the true opportunity of fortitude, because indeed the scene
   of duty.

   But he that has not the courage to puff at all popular surmises, and to
   esteem himself superior to the riots and mistakes of hectors; but by a
   foolish facility appears and ventures his life at the word and
   challenge of a furious sot, whose life is not worth the keeping, falls
   ingloriously, and descends to his grave with the burial of an ass;
   shame is his windingsheet, and the solemnity of his funeral, the
   reprehension of the wise, the pity of the good, and the laughter of his
   companions; who can make sport at the loss of a soul, and the miseries
   of damnation.

   And thus I have shewn the several cases in which duels are unlawful;
   and I suppose I preach to an auditory that needs no other argument
   against them, than the demonstration of their unlawfulness; yet since
   other arguments there are, I think a truth cannot be too much
   confirmed.

   1. And amongst these, the judgment of men generally condemning them is
   no contemptible one. I have already observed what an ignominious name
   the name of gladiator was amongst the heathen Romans: and in the laws
   of the Lombards, even while they permitted the use of those duels, they
   branded them with a mark of infamy. Incerti sumus de judicio Dei, et
   multos audivimus per pugnam sine justa causa suam causam perdere. Sed
   propter consuetudinem gentis nostrae Longobardorum legem impiam vetare
   non possumus. They called it an impious law, even while they suffered
   it to continue; and declared that they did so, because the corruption
   and vice of the nation was too strong for them, and beyond the control
   of remedies. The canon law, even to those that died in justs or
   tiltings, (which were but in a manner the shadows of a duel,) yet
   denied them the privilege of Christian burial, in the fifth book of the
   Decretals of Gregory, chap. i. de Torneamentis. And if you will, you
   may to these add the judgment of the council of Trent, orthodox enough
   in this matter, where their interest gave them no cause to be
   otherwise, sess. xxv. chap. 19. Detestabilis duellorum usus fabricante
   diabolo introductus, ut cruenta corporum morte animarum etiam perniciem
   lucretur, ex Christiano orbe penitus exterminetur. Were it as needful
   as it is easy, many more authorities might be added, to discountenance
   this profane practice: but I suppose these are enough to give more
   credit to the refusal of a duel, than can accrue upon the acceptance of
   it, from the opinion and vogue of debauched persons; whose infamy will
   not let their censure be a reproach.

   2. But the second and chief argument shall be taken from the wretched
   consequences of the thing itself; which are twofold:

   (1.) Such as attend the conquered person.

   (2.) Such as attend the conqueror.

   As for the conquered person, he is sure of these two evils.

   (1.) A disastrous death. And surely it ought to be a very great gain
   that is to counterbalance the loss of life; something more than the
   reputation of not giving the wall, not enduring a slighting word or a
   trivial disrespect; which might otherwise have been confuted by
   silence, conquered by contempt, and outlived by the next hour.

   But now all the labour and expense of a man's former education, all the
   hopes and usefulness of his remaining years, the expectations of his
   friends, and perhaps the supports of a family, are lopt off at a blow,
   extinguished in a moment, with an overplus of misery from the sadness
   of the occasion.

   It is a sad thing for any hopeful man, in the vigour of his years, to
   be carried off by a plague or a fever, or an unfortunate accident; but
   still all that is uncomfortable in these is, that the man is dead; but
   there is no criminal circumstance, from the manner of his death, to
   embitter his remembrance: he did not die by a sin, or by any thing that
   might stain his surviving name or endanger his future condition. It was
   the action of Providence, which piety will, and mortality must submit
   to.

   But he that dies in a duel, so falls to the earth, that it is to be
   feared he falls much lower; and that the iron enters deeper into his
   soul than into his body, and kills much further than it reaches. And
   this introduces the other fatal consequence which attends the person
   thus vanquished, and that is,

   (2.) Death eternal. When two persons come into the field upon such an
   expedition, they defy one another, they defy the laws both of God and
   man, and they defy hell: their business is, which shall send the other
   to that place of misery first. For certainly whosoever quits the body
   with the marks of murder and revenge fresh upon his soul, and passes
   from his conquering adversary to his dreadful Judge, shall in that
   world be condemned for a murderer, though it was his ill hap to be
   murdered in this.

   Nay, there will lie a double charge of murder upon him: namely, for
   being both the unjust occasion of his own death, and the designer of
   his adversary's: for it is the design that makes the murderer, and not
   the event and issue of the action, which is wholly contingent and
   extrinsical to the will. For shall a man be therefore accounted no
   murderer, because he had less courage, less skill, or less luck than
   his opposite? because his purpose was stronger than his arm? or because
   his foot slipt, or his misguided rapier hit upon a rib, and kept the
   fatal point from the regions of life, and so gave the adversary
   opportunity to be more sure and mischievous in his thrust? All which
   plea or excuse amounts to no more than this, that he would have slain
   his adversary with all his heart, but was prevented, and could not.

   I neither will nor dare pronounce any thing in limitation of the extent
   of God's mercy; but this I shall say, that according to the standing
   rule and tenor of God's revealed will, he that dies in a duel undertook
   upon an unjust cause, affords no ground for any one to judge that he is
   saved: for he dies in his sin, directing his sword to his brother's
   heart; so that there is nothing but his last breath passing between his
   murderous intention and the final giving up of his accounts to God;
   before whom he has no other cause to allege for his dying in this
   manner, but that he was proud, passionate, or revengeful; sad
   qualifications to recommend a man to the tribunal of such a Judge.

   We have seen here the miserable consequences that befall the conquered
   dueller. Let us now, in the next place, take a survey of those that
   befall the conqueror: and these also are three.

   (1.) In case he is apprehended: the law has provided that for him which
   he did for his adversary, but in a more ignominious manner. The rope
   and the gibbet is to be his portion; die he must; and what honour a man
   wins or saves, by that which gives him an opportunity of being hanged,
   is hard to be understood; but he that mistakes the cart for a triumphal
   chariot, or the gallow-tree for a triumphal arch, may apply himself to
   the obtaining such victories as these.

   (2.) But secondly, suppose that he escapes by flight; yet then he quits
   his country, and lives a banished man, and like Cain, having murdered
   his brother, he presently betakes himself to wander about the world,
   leaving behind him the confiscation of his goods, a family lamenting,
   and perhaps starving; and some of them peradventure dying for grief,
   and so feeling the murderous influence of his action as really, though
   not in the same manner, as his slain adversary.

   Surely these will be sad accidents to a man in cold blood, when the
   fury of his passion, which abused his reason, and represented revenge
   so pleasant, shall be over, and transmit the thing naked to his
   recovered judgment, to be considered according to its real aspect and
   all its sharp events.

   By this time, undoubtedly, he will see how much better it had been for
   him to have kept himself quiet and innocent in the peaceable enjoyment
   of his friends, his estate, and country; than to wander as an indigent
   murderer in a strange land, from whence the sense of his guilt, the
   severity of the laws, and the exasperation of the murdered person's
   friends, ready to prosecute those laws against him, continually terrify
   him from all thoughts of a return.

   (3.) But, in the third and last place, we will suppose the man to have
   better fortune: that he has fought and killed his adversary, and so
   satisfied his revenge; and moreover, that through the intercession of
   great friends, willing to share his guilt, and to derive some of the
   blood upon their own heads, he has not by flight escaped, but by a full
   acquitment outbraved justice, and triumphed over the law, and so stands
   secure as to all temporal retribution. But still, after all this, may
   we not ask concerning such an one, is all well within? How fares it
   with him in the court of conscience? Is he able to keep off the grim
   arrests of that? Can he drown the cry of blood, and bribe his own
   thoughts to let him alone? Can he fray off the vulture from his breast,
   that night and day is gnawing his heart, and wounding it with ghastly
   and amazing reflections?

   Whether it is, that God has done it for the defence of men's lives, or
   whether it is the unnaturalness of the sin, or whatsoever else may be
   the cause, certain it is, that there is nothing which dogs the
   conscience so incessantly, fastens upon it so closely, and tears it so
   furiously, as the dismal sense of blood-guiltiness.

   The man perhaps endeavours to be merry, he goes about his business, he
   enjoys his cups and his jolly company: and possibly, if he fought for
   revenge, he is applauded and "admired by some; if he fought for a
   mistress, he is smiled upon for a day. But when, in the midst of all
   his gaieties, his conscience shall come and round him in the ear: Sir,
   you are to remember that you have murdered a man, and what is more, you
   have murdered a soul; you have sacrificed an immortal nature, the image
   of God, and the price of Christ's blood, to a pique, a punctilio, to
   the loves of a pitiful creature, lighter than vanity, and emptier than
   the air: and these are the worthy causes for which your brother now
   lies in the regions of darkness and misery, without relief, without
   recovery; an eternal sacrifice to a short passion, a rash anger, and a
   sudden revenge.

   Now when these reasonings shall be joined with the considerations of
   the divine justice, and the retributions that Heaven reserves for
   blood; these sad reckonings, that are in store for the successful
   acquitted murderer: believe it, where these thoughts shall lay hold of
   the conscience, they will leave their marks behind them.

   But if the man feels none of these stings or remorses, his condition is
   infinitely worse: he is sealed up under a spirit of searedness, and
   reprobation, and an invincible curse. And it is a sign that God intends
   him not the grace of repentance, perhaps for denying his brother the
   opportunities of it, by a sudden death; and sending him out of the
   world in such a condition, that it were ten thousand times better for
   himself never to have come into the world, than that he should leave it
   under the like.

   I have nothing more to say concerning such a person, but that his sin
   has put him into such an estate, that, living or dying, he is
   unavoidably miserable.

SERMON XLIX.

  ROMANS xii. 18.

   If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
   men.

   YOU may remember that the second particular laid down for the
   prosecution of these words, was to assign the measures and proportions
   by which the duty of living peaceably was to be determined: which I
   shewed were contained within the bounds of lawful.

   In my inquiries into which, I undertook the resolution of several
   cases. As, concerning the lawfulness of war; of keeping or breaking the
   peace with the magistrate; as also of duels. All which I have already
   finished; so that there remain only two more to be discussed. One of
   which is,

   Whether it be lawful to repel force by force, so as to kill another in
   one's own defence?

   The matter of which question is very different from that about duels.
   For a duel is a fight freely and voluntarily undertook by the offer of
   one party, and the acceptance of the other. But this is a sudden, a
   violent, and unforeseen assault, in respect of him that is assaulted:
   who thereupon enters not into combat upon any precedent choice or
   deliberate appointment; but upon the sudden alarms of force and
   necessity, and the compulsions of an extreme danger.

   In which condition we are to suppose the man cut off from all
   possibility of flying, shut up from all succour by a rescue, or remedy
   by the law; but drove into those straits, both of place, time, and all
   other circumstances, that all evasion is rendered desperate and
   impossible, but through the blood of his adversary.

   In this case I affirm it to be lawful for a man to save himself by
   destroying his enemy, and that upon these two reasons.

   1. The first taken from that which we have already insisted upon; the
   great natural right of self-preservation: which right is as full in
   particular persons as in public bodies. It is the very firstborn of all
   the rudiments of nature; and the very ground and reason of its actions;
   not instilled by precept, but suggested by instinct. A man is no more
   instructed to this, than he is to be an hungry or thirsty, when nature
   wants its due refection. And that as to this particular the rights of
   nature are not abridged by Christian religion, will appear from the

   Second argument, taken from that place where Christ commands his
   disciples to provide themselves swords: but to have allowed them the
   instruments of defence, and at the same time to have forbid the use of
   them as unlawful, had been highly irrational. I suppose Christ did not
   command those poor fishermen to wear swords for ornament only, as men
   do nowadays; but that he might countenance them in the management of
   their own preservation, amidst those many unjust violences and
   assaults, that were likely enough to attend men odious to the world for
   the promulgation of severe truths.

   Add to this the suffrage of the civil law, where the code in the
   Cornelian law de Sicariis utters itself thus: Is qui aggressorem vel
   quemcunque alium in dubio vitae discrimine constitutus occiderit,
   nullam ob id factum calumniam metuere debet. And further, in the
   Aquilian law, to the same purpose: Vim vi repellere omnes leges
   omniaque jura permittunt.

   So that we have seen the verdict of nature, of Christ, and of the civil
   law, in the present case; and he whom these absolve is a just and an
   innocent person, whatsoever other law may condemn him.

   Yet since nature, in the present corruption of mankind, is weak and
   dark, and so apt to misjudge of the necessity of self-defence;
   oftentimes making that to be so, which indeed is nothing else but an
   unnecessary fear or a sinful revenge; it being a very easy thing to
   clothe an unlawful action or design with a lawful name: therefore it
   concerns us so to assert the privilege, as to take off the danger; and
   this will be done by stating it under its due limitations.

   In order to which, I shall endeavour to clear these three inquiries.

   1st, What are those things, for the necessary defence of which it may
   be lawful to kill the unjust invader?

   2dly, What are the conditions required to render that defence lawful?

   3dly, Who are the persons against whom we may justly manage such a
   defence?

   And first for the things that may be thus defended.

   1. The first is life; the eminent and certain danger of which does
   lawfully unsheath every man's sword in the defence of it. For where it
   is lawful to live, it is lawful to do all those things without which
   life cannot be preserved. Life is a purchase to be rated at the loss of
   all things else. He that loses it, loses all the world with it, and
   every thing dies, as to the fruition of the dying man. There is no
   reparation to be made for it, either in kind or any thing else, as in
   some degree it may be done in all other losses. For he that loses his
   friend or his honour may be repaid with an estate, though not to an
   equality of compensation. But a lost life can be repaid with no
   enjoyment, since it is the foundation of all other enjoyments; and no
   man enjoys any thing but the living.

   For can we think that a pompous burial or a fine tomb will make the
   dead any amends, or to have a few mournful words spoken of him for
   fashion-sake, as, that he was an excellent person, and that it was a
   loss to the public that he should be snatched away by such a disaster;
   which words, being dead, he cannot hear; and if alive, perhaps would
   not much regard.

   But all this while the man continues the portion of worms and
   rottenness, and the great injury of death maintains its full effect
   upon him. All after-honours and commemorations being but like the
   serving up of a banquet to a grave, or like the ceremony of courtship
   and compliment to the cold flints and the insensible rocks.

   2. When a man is in imminent danger of the mutilation of a leg or an
   arm, or the like, it is lawful to prevent the loss of either by the
   death of the assailant. For who knows but the loss of a part may bring
   the destruction of the whole. Where the danger is indefinite, there the
   utmost and the greatest is to be feared, and proportion ably to be
   provided against.

   The man perhaps in the issue of the conflict may lose but a finger, but
   thereupon his hand may gangrene, and then his arm, and from thence the
   mischief reach his heart: or he may receive but a blow only, which blow
   may sow the seeds of death in his body, in an imposthume, which shall
   grow and prevail, and at length break, and bear him to his grave. In
   which case there is no doubt but the man is murdered, though it be ten
   years before he dies, as truly as if he had breathed his last the very
   next minute. For he murders a man, who gives him a hurt, upon which
   death certainly and irrecoverably follows, whatsoever the time of it
   chance to be. The cause may have its effect, be the distance of time or
   place what it will, so long as it reaches it by the connection of a
   certain influence. And he that pulls one end of the chain, moves the
   remotest link of it as surely, as if he did it by an immediate touch.

   But suppose that death should not follow upon the loss of a limb, and
   moreover (which is yet impossible) that the assaulted person knew so
   much, yet nature no less dictates the preservation of every part; it
   being as natural to a man to be entire and perfect, as to be, and to
   have all his limbs, as any one of them. Besides that it is often worse
   than death itself to live with the deformities and pains of a
   shattered, mangled body; as a burden to one's self, and a contempt to
   others. From which miseries there are few, but, were it in their power,
   would ransom themselves with the price of the world; and of their blood
   too, did not the awe of God and the terrors of another death keep them
   from breaking the uncomfortable prison of such a body, to pass to an
   eternal execution.

   3. When a person's chastity is invaded by force, it is granted on all
   hands to be lawful to kill the person that invades it. For this is as
   irreparable as life itself; it is lost but once, and if it should come
   in competition with life, it would be judged more valuable. Upon which
   ground, Tamar, had she had strength and courage enough, might have
   saved her brother Absalom the labour of killing Amnon, and prevented an
   unjust revenge by a just defence.

   To lose one's life is indeed a misery, but it is no dishonour; but the
   ravished person is dishonoured, her glory stained, and the lustre of
   that reputation by which she lives and stands accepted in the world, is
   blasted for ever.

   I know no parent, who deserves to be a parent, who had not rather see a
   child dead, than defloured. Virginius rescued his daughter from the
   lust and violence of Appius Clodius the decemvir, by stabbing her dead
   with his own hand. I am not concerned to warrant his action; but surely
   it argues the value that the very heathen put upon their chastity, when
   the very design against it was thought fit to be prevented by the death
   of the innocent, and to be revenged upon the nocent, even to the
   subversion of a government.

   4. In the fourth place, as for the preservation of estate or goods, the
   case admits of some more doubt. And there are opinions both for the
   affirmative and the negative.

   Those who hold the negative argue,

   First, From the law of Moses, which, in Exodus xxii. 2, 3,
   distinguishes the case of a thief robbing by day and by night, allowing
   it for lawful to kill him, if he makes an invasion in the night;
   whereas if he is killed in the day, the same law avouches the man that
   killed him guilty of murder.

   Of which difference, these two reasons are alleged.

   (1.) Because it cannot be distinguished in the night, whether he comes
   barely to steal or to murder also; and therefore it is lawful to kill
   him, not considered merely as a thief, but upon just suspicion that he
   might come as a murderer.

   (2.) Because goods taken away in the night leave the person robbed
   destitute of all means by which to discover the robber, and
   consequently of all legal means by which to recover what he had lost.

   Ans. This is true, and upon the strength of this very ground I answer
   this argument brought from the Mosaic law, by affirming, that howsoever
   the letter runs, yet the design of that law was not to make every
   killing of a thief in the day-time murder, but that usually and
   ordinarily it was to be accounted so. For since the law makes it lawful
   to kill a thief in the night, because at that time all people being
   usually disposed to their rest, it supposes that there are no witnesses
   present, by whose means the injured man might have right against him at
   law: but unlawful to kill him in the day, because then it supposes that
   there may be witnesses, as for the most part there are. Yet since
   sometimes it so falls out, that there neither are nor can be any; it
   will follow, by analogy of reason, that a man under such circumstances
   is permitted to deal with a thief as in the night; since the very cause
   for which he was permitted to do it then, does equally take place now.

   (2.) In the second place, some argue against the lawfulness of killing
   a robber for the preservation of our goods, from the tenor of the
   gospel, and the design of Christian religion; which bids the professors
   of it despise and trample upon these temporal things, and therefore
   certainly permits them not to prevent the loss of them with the blood
   of any one who should presume to take them. To this I answer, that the
   gospel commands us only to despise these things comparatively, in
   reference to spiritual and eternal felicities. Otherwise if the words
   be understood absolutely, it could not be lawful for us so much as to
   defend our lives; since some texts in the letter of them command us no
   less to despise these, than those other enjoyments.

   I conclude therefore for the affirmative, that it is lawful for a man
   to defend his estate and goods against an unjust force, even with the
   death of him who offers that force, if they cannot be retained and
   possessed otherwise.

   The reason is, because they are the means and support of life, and
   therefore are to be reckoned in the same account with life itself. If
   one should say, that it were lawful for a man to knock him on the head,
   that should offer to batter down his house to the ground before his
   face; but that he was by no means to touch him, in case he only took
   away the chief pillar, upon which the house leaned; notwithstanding
   that upon the removal of that pillar it must fall as unavoidably as if
   it were pulled down: surely such a distinction were grossly absurd and
   ridiculous.

   The case is the same here. Neither does that reply take off the
   argument, that a man may live though his estate be lost, as by labour,
   charity, or the getting of another. For this is accidental, and it may
   fall out otherwise. And every man is to look upon what he possesses as
   his only subsistence; since he is not certain, upon the loss of it, to
   have any other: nay, he is certain that at the present he has none; nor
   is like to have any for the future, unless some accident or opportunity
   of a livelihood offers itself, which he is not to suppose or build
   upon, it being wholly uncertain and contingent; especially, so as to
   take him off from his dependence upon that which is certain and
   present.

   Should a man put his whole estate into a jewel; either for concealment
   of his estate, as being otherwise in danger, or for some other
   advantage or convenience; and should be set upon for it by a thief upon
   the road, so that, all hope of rescue being out of the way, there
   remained no other means to preserve it but by killing the robber upon
   the place; I must confess, I can see no solid reason, why he might not
   do justice upon him, and right to himself, by sending him out of the
   world, with his blood upon his own head. If any excellent and pious
   persons have chose to do otherwise, the thief was beholden to them; and
   they have only quitted their own right, which lays no injunction at all
   upon others to quit theirs.

   For if a man sets upon me in the highway to kill me, all grant that I
   may in my own defence kill him; but if he would only take my money,
   that, it seems, I must relinquish by any means rather than take his
   life. But let the reason of the difference be assigned. If I ask, what
   makes it lawful for me to kill him in the former case? it will be
   answered surely, to preserve my life. But I reply, Is not my life as
   much destroyed if I am starved, as if I am stabbed? And when my money
   is once gone, I am sure I may be starved, and none can assure me that I
   shall not. For am I certain that I shall find a bag of money or a table
   spread in the road, or that people will be so charitable, as upon free
   cost to keep me from hunger and cold? which annoyances, unless they
   will do so, must as surely despatch me, as either a rapier thrust into
   my bowels, or a bullet sent to my heart.

   Neither is that further exception of any moment, that there is no
   proportion in point of value between the loss of money and the loss of
   a life. For in the present case my money, compared to my enemy's life,
   is not to be considered barely as such a sum of money, but as it is the
   necessary support of my life: so that really, and in effect, the
   comparison is between his life and mine; in which I conclude myself
   warranted, by the rights and laws of nature, to prefer my own before
   his. Nay, if it were but a sixpence that he would rifle me of, and I
   had no other visible subsistence in the world but that poor sum, I
   might lawfully defend that, as I would myself, that is, with the death
   of my enemy; and count it as equal a stake against his life, as if it
   were ten thousand millions.

   And thus I have shewn those four things which it is lawful for a man
   thus to defend; namely, life, limbs, chastity, and estate: where,
   before I pass any further, I shall add this, that whatsoever it is
   lawful for a man to do in these cases for himself, the same also is
   lawful for him to do in the same danger and extremity of his neighbour.
   The reason is, because the measure and standard of his love to his
   neighbour, is to be the love that he bears to himself.

   Which yet, by the way, is to be understood under equal cases and
   circumstances; for though we are commanded to love our neighbour as
   ourselves, yet it follows not, but when the danger must inevitably fall
   upon one of us, we may preserve ourselves before our neighbour;
   because, in the same condition, we are bound to desire no more for
   ourselves, but that our neighbour should save us in the next place to
   himself; and therefore, by virtue of this precept, he can desire no
   more of us. In a word, we are to love our neighbour as ourselves,
   putting him into the same condition and circumstances in reference to
   us, as we are in reference to him: and therefore, as I myself could not
   in reason desire, but that my neighbour, in a danger equal to us both,
   should first defend himself; so my neighbour cannot deny, but that I
   should do as much for myself under this condition, as I allow him to do
   for himself under the same. But this by way of digression.

   Certain it is, that the defence of our neighbour in his extremity
   engages us to all those extraordinary courses that we took for our own
   preservation. Upon this account it was, that Abraham armed his
   household, and slew kings for the rescue of -\his kinsman Lot, took
   captive by them, Genesis xiv. 14, 15. And there is no man, whose
   concerns and obligations terminate within himself; but he is a relative
   person, and must own a debt to friendship, to consanguinity, and
   society. For as in the natural body the whole is maintained by that
   sympathy and mutual feeling, that the members have of the condition of
   each other; by which, when any of them is in distress, it calls for and
   receives help and relief from all the rest: so it is, according to its
   proportion, in the political body, which is only an aggregate,
   artificial man. Every particular person lies under an obligation to
   come in to the succour of his endangered brother, as the hand would
   presently lift itself up in the defence of the leg or the face, to
   repel and beat off whatsoever would annoy them. And the contrary would
   be barbarous and absurd, a perverting of the designs of nature, which,
   by thus leaving the interest of every part single in itself, and
   divided from and independent upon the concernment of its fellows, would
   quickly draw a ruin and dissolution upon the whole fabric. That man who
   could stand and see another stripped or hacked in pieces by a thief or
   a rogue, and not at all concern himself in his rescue, is a traitor to
   the laws of humanity and religion; he commits murder with his eyes, and
   sheds blood by not striking a blow; and shall one day account to God
   for the guilt of that action, that was as criminally permitted by him,
   as done by the other.

   2dly, I come now to the second thing, which is, to shew the conditions
   required to legalize such a defence of ourselves and fortunes. And they
   are these.

   (1.) That the violence offered be so apparent, and withal so great and
   pressing, that there can be no other means of escaping it, but by
   killing the adversary: otherwise, if a man makes it great by his own
   presumptions and fears, and so makes it necessary to himself to repel
   that injury with a mortal wound from his rapier, which he might have
   done with a blow of a switch or a thrust of his arm, he is a murderer;
   nor will it excuse him to plead a danger which was only created by his
   own apprehensions. Thus in the late rebellion, when some persons, by
   the guilt of great villainies, had exasperated majesty, and so having
   deserved, were pleased also to fear the just consequences of their
   actions; they were so bold as to strike the first blow, and then so
   impudent as to say that they did it in their own defence. But that
   saying of Vibius Crispus, commended by Quintilian, may be here fitly
   applied, Quis tibi sic timere permisit? Fear greatens and redoubles
   every evil, it stretches the shadow, and enlarges the suspicion: but
   blood must not be shed upon surmise.

   That which must warrant a man in this before God and his conscience,
   must be a danger as manifest as the light; a life even perishing, and
   in the very jaws of death: not an hazard that may be disputed, but an
   extremity that calls and cries, and admits of no answer but an
   immediate deliverance. And if in this case a life be taken away, he
   only is a murderer that deserved, not he that inflicted the blow.

   (2.) It is required, that all possibility of recourse to the magistrate
   for a legal protection be taken away. In which case the law leaves
   every man to his own natural defence. For men are not made for laws,
   but laws for the good and preservation of men: and therefore, though
   they enjoin the injured person to fly to them for succour, yet, when he
   is surrounded with such circumstances as render such access to them
   impossible; and in the mean time that life, for the preservation of
   which those laws were designed, is under an unavoidable danger, without
   flying to other remedies; should those laws tie a man's hand in such a
   case, they were only snares and traps, and means to deliver a man naked
   and undefended to be devoured by his enemy.

   But, as I observed before, war is a remedy upon the failure of law. And
   when the supreme and fatal law of necessity comes to be in force, all
   inferior obligations disband and vanish: and the law that tells a man
   that no particular person's injury can take from him his right to live,
   ought to take place, and both to direct him what he is to do in this
   affair, and to absolve him when he has done.

   (3.) In the third place, it is required that a man in the act of
   defending himself designs merely his own defence, without any hatred or
   bitter purpose of revenge towards the person who thus invades him. A
   lawful action may be depraved and changed by the intervenience of an
   ill intention. Jehu executed the command of God in extirpating the
   house of Ahab, and consequently that action of his was lawful; but yet
   we find that the same action was reckoned to him for sin, because a
   particular malice and design against Ahab's house mingled with it, and
   so altered the whole complexion of the performance.

   To discern whether a man in these defensive conflicts be acted by a
   purpose of self-defence, pure and unmixed from any spice of revenge, I
   confess is very difficult, in case the assault shall be continued till
   it determines in the death of one party. But if the defendant chance to
   prevail over the assailant to that degree, as to be able to secure
   himself from him without taking of his life; and yet shall not be
   brought to give over, or acquiesce, till he has despatched him: though
   his first stroke in this engagement was but defence, and so lawful; yet
   the sharpness of revenge growing upon his spirit in the midst of the
   action, it is to be feared that the last stroke was murder, and so will
   pass in the accounts of Heaven.

   And thus much for the second thing, namely, to shew the conditions
   required to render the killing of another in our own defence lawful

   3dly, The third, which I shall despatch in a word or two, is to inquire
   who are the persons against whom we may lawfully thus defend ourselves.
   And for this, I cannot conceive that any doubt can be raised, but
   concerning these two, a magistrate and a parent. As for the magistrate,
   the grounds that I have already laid of non-resistance, by virtue of
   every subject's quitting his natural right of defending himself against
   the magistrate, and resigning up all power of resistance into his
   governor's hands, sufficiently proves, that this doctrine gives no
   countenance to the subject in repelling any invasion made upon him by
   his prince.

   But as for a parent; the son has made no such resignation of his right
   up to him. And therefore there are not wanting some casuists among the
   Jesuits, who have ventured to own the lawfulness of a man's defending
   himself against parents as well as kings, and all superiors whatsoever;
   even with the death of those who shall invade him. But yet I affirm,
   that for a son in any case whatsoever to take away his father's life,
   from whence, under God, he received his own, seems to imply such a
   turpitude in the thing itself, and to offer such a grievance to nature,
   that he is to choose to die rather than, upon any inducement of
   extremity, to stain his hands in the blood of his father. This I will
   grant, that in case a father shall unjustly assault the life of his
   son; his son may proceed to defend himself so far as to disarm him,
   shut him up, and bind him; but to kill him is unnatural and
   intolerable. And if a son cannot otherwise secure his life from his
   father's violence, it is more eligible to die a thousand deaths, than
   to make such a monstrous and inhuman trespass upon so sacred a name and
   relation.

   And thus I have endeavoured both to clear and to assert the doctrine of
   self-defence in its due latitude. In all which discourse I am not
   sensible that I have uttered any thing but the voice of nature, and the
   rightly explained sense of religion.

   As for those who assert the contrary, and by taking from mankind all
   right of self-preservation, would have them still live in the world as
   naked as they came into it; I shall not wish them any hurt, but if I
   would, I could scarce wish them a greater, than that they might feel
   the full effect and influence of their own opinion.

   IV. The fourth and last case to be resolved is; Since to prosecute
   another in courts of judicature is in its kind a certain breach of the
   mutual bond of peace, whether it be allowable for Christians thus to
   prosecute and to go to law one with another?

   It may perhaps, at first sight, seem a strange and an insolent design,
   to bring a thing vouched by custom, owned by practice, and established
   by authority, under dispute: yet since it is no less our duty to be
   able to give a reason of what we do, than of what we believe; and since
   there are not wanting scriptures, to whose rules we profess to submit
   our practice, yet in appearance contrary to this; and since there are
   also some in the world, who think they have sufficient ground from
   those scriptures to entertain a contrary opinion; I conceive I may,
   without blame, enter into a disquisition of a thing already
   controverted; that so, by an impartial survey of the reasons of both
   sides, we may settle our future practice upon such sure grounds, that
   if it appears we have been in the wrong, we may be convinced, and
   brought off from, but if in the right, we may be confirmed in the thing
   hitherto allowed by us.

   As for those who have been so bold as to arraign the courts of law
   themselves, they are the anabaptists; who succeed into all the
   principles and opinions of the old anabaptists, those sons of
   confusion, that once so infested Germany: concerning the nature of
   whose opinions I cannot but judge this, that those who own a design to
   remove and cast down all human laws and judgments, ought to be persons
   either absolutely, and even to a necessity innocent, or very highly
   malefactors; the former of which might oppose them as needless; the
   latter, as dreadful and destructive. As for their innocence; the
   stories of their barbarous 1 rebellions, murders, and the desolations
   made by them, have settled men's judgments concerning that. And
   therefore, if their opinions grow from their guilt, in conjunction with
   their ignorance; as it cannot appear from what root else they should
   grow; I shall endeavour to remove the latter, leaving the laws
   themselves to deal with the former.

   In the management of this question, I shall, 1. Examine the arguments
   brought against the allowableness of Christians going to law. 2.
   Consider what may be argued and alleged for it. 3. Propose the
   conditions required to warrant men in such a practice.

   1. First of all then, their arguments seem principally to bear upon two
   places of scripture.

   (1.) The first is, that formerly hinted by me, and reserved to be
   discussed in its proper place here, which is in Matthew v. 40, where
   Christ determines that general precept of not resisting evil, to an
   utter abolition of all lawsuits; commanding every disciple of his, that
   in case any man will sue him at law, and take away his coat, he should
   let him have his cloak also. And certainly there is scarce any thing
   more indispensably necessary to a man's subsistence, than his raiment.
   But now if a man shall be obliged even to relinquish this, and resign
   it up to the hand of violence, rather than to recover it by a legal
   trial, it must needs follow, that the rigour of this command cuts off
   all pretences of going to law whatsoever.

   In answer to this, I cannot but observe, that it is the custom of this
   sort of men still to argue from the letter of scripture, in abstraction
   from the sense; and without any pondering either of the occasion,
   circumstances, or coherence of the text, immediately to fly and fasten
   upon the bare outside of the expression.

   Two things, therefore, may be answered to this text.

   1. That it is not certain, that what we render by suing at law
   signifies any such thing; the Greek is to the'lonti soi krithenai; but
   kri'nomai signifies to strive, war, and contend with another by force;
   so that it is all one with ma'chesthai, kai` eri'zesthai' soi. But to
   sue another at law is kri'nein; and that with an accusative case, to
   the'lonti' se kri'nein; and to be sued in the passive, kri'nomai:
   according to which, to the'lonti' soi krithenai, taking soi for upo`
   sou, must signify, to him that is willing to be sued by thee at law:
   the meaning being this; He that has took thy coat from thee, and is
   willing to be brought by thee into a trial for it, to him give thy
   cloak also. Which sense, besides that it is highly incongruous, to`n
   chitona' sou labein should have gone before soi krithenai, and so the
   words have run thus: To him that is desirous to take thy coat., and
   then to go to law with thee for it: and not preposterously, To him that
   is desirous to go to law with thee, and to take thy coat, to him give
   thy cloak also; which is to make the going to law antecedent to the
   wrong or injury about which men go to law.

   It is more probable therefore, that the sense of the text is this; If
   any one would unjustly contend with thee, and forcibly take away thy
   cloak, let him have thy coat also. According to which sense, the words
   speak nothing at all of the suits or trials at law. And this
   interpretation, grounded upon the propriety of the word, and so fully
   agreeing both with what goes before, and with what follows after, if
   any one will positively insist upon it, I do verily believe, cannot by
   any solid reason be disproved.

   2. But because I think such respect is to be had to the translation,
   that it is not, but upon very urgent necessity, to be receded from;
   therefore, in the second place, I add,

   That these words are to be interpreted with analogy to the design
   carried on by Christ throughout this whole chapter, which is, to shew
   the perverse and sinful practice of the Jews, in which they were
   abetted by the pharisees; and withal to declare, of how much contrary a
   temper his disciples and followers ought to be.

   Now the custom of the Jews was, upon the receiving any injury, to
   pursue that law of retaliation so fiercely and bitterly, that sometimes
   (as I have observed before) one private man would execute it upon
   another; and when they could not safely or conveniently do it
   themselves, but were forced to implore the help of the magistrate, and
   to drag the injurious person before him; yet they did it with so much
   acrimony and gall, and such designs of personal revenge, that it
   sufficiently appeared to any impartial or judicious eye, that in all
   their prosecutions of offenders they did not so much consult either the
   satisfaction of justice, or their own necessary reparation, as indeed
   seldom needing any at all, as they did the fruitless gratification of a
   remorseless, vindictive humour.

   Hereupon Christ reads a contrary lecture of patience, meekness, and
   quietness to his disciples, telling them, that in case they should have
   any thing injuriously purloined from them, they should rather sit down
   under the loss of that and a much greater thing too, than with so much
   virulence and exasperation of mind, as was common amongst the Jews, and
   unreprehended, not to say countenanced by the pharisees, pursue the
   recovery of their former right. These words therefore do not absolutely
   prohibit them, being injured, to endeavour a just reparation; but
   conditionally rather to quit the benefit of justice, than to follow it
   in a sinful manner.

   They are a sublime precept of patience, upon a wrong offered to our
   goods, parallel to those words, If any one smite thee on the right
   cheek, turn the other also; which enjoins the same measure of patience
   upon a wrong offered to our persons. And consequently, as heretofore,
   in the exposition of those, I shewed from Christ's own practice, the
   best comment upon his precepts, that they were not to be understood
   according to the rigid import of the letter, as if every man were bound
   to covet injuries and to court affronts; so I affirm also, that this
   command is not to be exacted according to the bare surface of the
   words, but to be enlarged to the allowance and latitude of a figure, as
   being indeed just such another hyperbole. Which is a trope, that to set
   forth the greatness of a thing more emphatically, words it in
   expressions greater than really it is. And thus much in answer to what
   they argue from this place of scripture.

   (2.) The next great place, which some think to speak as fully to their
   purpose as this, is that in 1 Cor. vi. 7, Now there is utterly a fault
   amongst you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do you not
   rather take wrong f why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be
   defrauded? Which words certainly amount to a pregnant and full
   prohibition of all going to law, since they declare it to be our duty
   rather to suffer, nay, even to embrace any wrong, than by such means to
   recover our right.

   But to this I answer,

   1. That what we render a fault, is in the Greek not ama'rtema, but only
   e'ttema, which signifies properly a weakness or defect; and such do not
   always, or of necessity, carry sin along with them. According to which
   sense, the apostle does not condemn their going to law, as a thing in
   itself sinful or unjust; but as low, and weak, and not answerable to
   that greatness and generosity of spirit, which became persons owning so
   excellent a profession.

   2. But in the second place, admitting that the apostle's design here is
   to discountenance this practice, not only as weak and illaudable, but
   also as sinful and disallowable; yet I affirm, that he accounted it not
   sinful from the very nature of the action, but only the irregularity of
   the circumstance; that they went to law upon every slight occasion,
   before unbelievers, in verse 1. And though to go to law be very
   allowable, yet for Christians to prosecute one another before the
   tribunals of infidels, for those injuries which they might fairly
   compromise by the arbitration and decision of persons of their own
   body, was a thing that reflected an high disgrace, and left a great
   scandal upon Christian religion; and consequently as great a guilt upon
   those who brought the scandal.

   In short, the apostle here either reprehends them only for going to law
   before unbelievers, or barely for going to law, as being a thing
   utterly unjust in itself. If he designs only the former, as it is clear
   from the whole chain of the context from the first verse to the ninth
   that he does; then it concludes nothing against the latter, but that
   before a believing judge, and a Christian court, with a due observance
   of other circumstances, Christians may right themselves at law. But if
   it be said, that the apostle directs the edge of this reproof against
   the very action itself; then let it be made out, how the apostle can
   accord himself with himself, who suffers Christians to go to law before
   the saints, in ver. 1, Dare any of you, having a matter against
   another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? Which
   shews, that what he prohibits under one, in the very same breath he
   permits under the other. Nay, he proceeds to give reasons why they
   should manage the judgment of these things themselves, in ver. 2, 3, If
   the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest
   matters? And, know ye not that ye shall judge angels? how much more
   things pertaining to this life? And again, in ver. 5; I speak to your
   shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man amongst you? no, not one
   that shall be able to judge between his brethren? And now, is it not as
   clear from all these places, as if they were writ with a sunbeam, that
   the apostle's intention is not levelled against their going to law, but
   against the persons before whom they did it? That they chose to
   discover and rip up the sores of the church, before such infidels as
   would deride them, rather than before Christians, who would endeavour
   to conceal and cure them.

   The only thing that can be replied here, is, that in those primitive
   times of Christianity, the Christians had no tribunals or power of
   judging, as being under the jurisdiction of heathen potentates: and
   therefore what they did in order to the deciding of controversies and
   suits between man and man, they did not do as judges armed with the
   civil power, but as arbitrators chose and consented to amongst
   themselves, for the ending and composing of differences. And therefore,
   though it might be lawful to bring one's cause before such judges, yet
   it cannot now be lawful to sue a brother in any of our courts, properly
   so called, as holding a power of jurisdiction from the magistrate.

   But to this I answer; that this is so far from overthrowing or
   weakening the thing which it is brought to disprove, that it is a
   notable argument to confirm it: for if the apostles allowed it as
   lawful for them to bring their causes before Christians, that they
   might exercise a judicial act in deciding them, who yet were not endued
   with any legal, judicial authority from the magistrate; certainly it
   were highly strange and irrational, to prohibit men to seek for the
   same judicial acts, from such as were both Christians, and also
   empowered with such a judicial authority from the civil governor. In a
   word, it would amount to this; that Christians might try their causes
   before Christians, not having any legal jurisdiction for that purpose,
   but only the consent of the contending parties. But when the same
   persons come to have the stamp of public authority, enabling them so to
   do by virtue of their office; why then, all trials before them must
   presently cease to be lawful, and become only a betraying of the rights
   and privileges of believers. I shall say no more of this wild and
   inconsequent deduction, but that it is an argument fit to be found only
   in the mouth of those, whose custom it is to dispute against reason,
   and to fight against government.

   3. The third argument against the allowableness of Christians going to
   law, is that strict command that lies upon them to forgive injuries,
   and consequently not to prosecute them in courts of judicature,
   forasmuch as these two seem utterly inconsistent.

   But to this also I reply, that in most injuries we are to consider and
   distinguish two things: first, The right that is lost. Secondly, The
   offence done to whom it is lost. And though it may be my duty to
   forgive the offence done me by him that violently takes away my right;
   yet it follows not that I must therefore quit my right; but may, with
   full allowance of equity and piety, endeavour the regaining of that,
   while I fully remit the other.

   And that this is not a mere verbal distinction without a difference, is
   evident from hence: that supposing that somebody robs me of my goods,
   and I recover them all to the value of the utmost farthing; yet still
   after this recovery it is certain that the man has done me an injury,
   and reason and religion will oblige him to ask me forgiveness; which it
   could not do, supposing that the wrong did not continue, even after I
   was repossessed of what I had lost.

   It is clear therefore, that the prosecution of one's right at law does
   yet leave a fair scope for the exercise of forgiveness; and
   consequently that they may not exclude or justle out one another.

   I cannot think of any thing else in scripture that seems to cast any
   probability of favour upon this opinion: and therefore looking upon the
   proof of it as desperate upon this account, I proceed to the second
   thing; which is to shew what may be argued for the allowableness of
   Christians prosecuting their rights in courts of judicature.

   But beforehand I shall premise this: That the ground upon which all
   such prosecutions proceed is twofold. 1. Restitution; and, 2.
   Punishment. That is, a man is sued either to restore what he has took
   from another; or brought into court for some offence or mischief done
   by him, for which, since no restitution can be made, he is to sustain
   some penalty for the satisfaction of the law. In which two cases,
   though it is obvious to see that a man may prosecute another for the
   restitution of something took from him, without any thoughts of
   bitterness or revenge; yet since the punishment of another cannot at
   all redound to my advantage or reparation, it may be inquired, what can
   warrant a man in his prosecution of another, only to bring him to this,
   without being chargeable with the designs of revenge.

   To this I answer; that his obligation and subjection to the community,
   of which he is a member, engages him to this. For every man is bound to
   endeavour the good and preservation of the public, and consequently to
   prosecute a thief or a murderer, though personally they have not
   injured him, forasmuch as such persons have made a breach upon society
   and common justice; which requires a reparation: yea, and that so
   strictly, that if a man is robbed, though, being master of his own
   right, he might choose whether upon that score he would prosecute him
   for such robbery; yet since by the same there is an injury done to the
   public, which he cannot pardon, the law binds him to prosecute the
   robber; and makes him liable to be prosecuted himself, in case he
   should not. I conclude therefore, that all these prosecutions of a man
   in the courts of law are just and allowable. And so I pass to the
   arguments for the proof of the assertion; which are these.

   1. To endeavour the execution of justice in the proper acts of it
   between man and man, is allowable before God, and not repugnant to
   religion: but without going to law, there can be no such endeavour for
   the execution of justice, and consequently it is to be admitted. That
   the former is not repugnant to religion is clear; for then justice and
   religion would be contrary, which would be to cast an high aspersion
   upon both.

   Justice is the noblest dictate issuing from the principles of improved
   nature, and nature, which is the law of God written in our hearts,
   cannot contradict his law as it is written in his word. God cannot
   write the same thing a duty in one law, and a sin in the other. Justice
   came down from heaven, and descended upon mankind, as a communication
   of a divine perfection flowing from him whose great attribute is to be
   the Just One, and the re warder of every man according to his works.

   As for the assumption of the argument, that the exercise of this great
   blessing of the world, justice, cannot take place, unless it be lawful
   to prosecute offenders before courts and judges; it is a thing that
   requires no laborious proof. For can we expect that thieves and
   murderers should come and surrender their persons to the vengeance of
   the law freely, and of their own accord, as scorning all arrests, and
   preventing attachments by sheriffs, constables, and such other
   unnecessary instruments of force? Will they arraign themselves, be both
   jury and evidence, and stand convict by the generous openness of their
   own confession?

   When and where do we read of any instance or example of such strange
   transactions? When men by frequent villainies have lost even common
   honesty, may justice expect satisfaction from their ingenuity? But
   these are unlikelihoods not to be insisted upon; and we may well
   venture the issue of the whole controversy upon this, that when these
   things come to pass, then the prosecution of causes at law will cease
   to be allowable.

   2. The second argument is this; that if Christian religion absolutely
   prohibits and disallows all pursuit of a man's right at law, then the
   strict observance of this religion unavoidably draws after it the utter
   dissolution of all government and society; a sad consequence, but
   naturally issuing from such an antecedent.

   For does not society consist in a due distinction of propriety amongst
   men, and in their peaceable and secure enjoying that, of which they are
   proprietors? Do not all public bodies bear upon the great basis of meum
   and tuum between particular persons, and upon the provision it makes to
   protect those persons in their respective titles to what they possess?

   And moreover, is not the foundation of all just possession a just
   acquisition; as by gift, labour, or the like, by which the world shares
   the common benefits of nature, dividing to each man his portion, and
   enclosing it to him from the encroachment and pretences of all others?
   These things, I suppose, must be granted to be the very fundamentals
   and first uniting principles of society.

   But now, if there be no coercive power to call men to account for their
   actions; when the world shall be infested with the violent and the
   unjust, who will not labour, but yet possess; who are nobody's heirs,
   and yet will inherit; raising a new claim, upon force, rapine, and
   oppression: what will become of order, of propriety, and right? all
   those hinges upon which the affairs of mankind and the peace of nations
   move and depend?

   He that has the strongest arm, the sharpest sword, the boldest front,
   and the falsest heart, must possess the world. Whatsoever he grasps
   must be his own; right and possession will be terms convertible. The
   meek and the injured part of mankind shall retain a right to nothing,
   but to patience under the insultations of the mighty and the unjust,
   and shall see that they can be lawfully nothing else but miserable,
   when the very plea of the law itself is rendered unlawful.

   And, what is the greatest misery of all, these bonds of oppression must
   be bound upon men by the ties of religion. Thieves rob us of our goods,
   and then this robs us of our remedies. And men will persuade us, that
   Jesus Christ makes it our duty to be poor, wretched, injured, forlorn,
   and destitute, as often as it shall please the lawless avarice and
   insolence of our enemies to make us so.

   Had the primitive Christians owned this to have been the genius and
   true intent of what they professed, it would quickly have hissed
   Christianity out of the world, as the bane of government, and the
   destroyer of whatsoever was settled, regular, and excellent amongst
   men. It would have exposed it both to the scorn and hatred of all
   governors. And the setting up the profession of it in any kingdom would
   have been like the bringing of a public plague into the bowels of a
   nation; or the courting of a foreign invasion, to trample down all
   before them with ruin and confusion. For surely the removal of all
   courts of judicature would have had no less mischievous effects upon a
   people, than either of those annoyances. But had this been the design
   of Christianity, there is no doubt but all nations would have stood
   upon their guard, and kept it off like a pest; and courts of judicature
   would sooner have suppressed this religion, than this religion could
   have beat down those courts.

   I conclude therefore, that it is far from the purpose of Christ's
   doctrine to forbid injured persons to take their course at law; under
   the gospel, courts are to be as much open as churches. And to plead the
   cause of the afflicted, the fatherless, and the widow, is but part of
   that great office which God has honoured, by sometimes assuming it to
   himself. Christianity came to invest the world with new helps and
   privileges, and not to abridge men of their old. This religion has
   provided no asylum for thieves or murderers; it neither secures nor
   sanctifies wrong or oppression. And therefore that opinion, which lays
   this as a block in their way who would proceed to a legal recovery of
   their rights, is to be rejected, as absurd and insufferable.

   Yet since men are too prone to stretch their just allowances beyond
   their bounds, to abuse privileges, and to spoil a due action by undue
   circumstances of prosecution; I shall therefore, in the third and last
   place, briefly propose those conditions that are required to warrant
   men in their law-proceedings and contentions. And they are three.

   1. First, that a man takes not this course against any one, but upon a
   very great and urgent cause. Every little wrong and trespass is not a
   sufficient warrant for me to disturb my neighbour's peace, and to make
   him miserable. It must be a loud and a clamorous injury, that has broke
   in upon a man's reputation or estate, so that one cannot be entire nor
   the other safe without a reparation, which must give him a lawful call
   to use so sharp a remedy.

   But those uncharitable, unworthy motives, that usually act men in these
   prosecutions, sufficiently declare how much they deviate from the rules
   of religion: for what more usual than such kind of speeches; "I will
   spend five hundred, a thousand pounds, but I will have my will." So
   that, it seems, it is not so much to have right, as to have their will,
   for which some go to law. But let me say to such, that God will spend a
   thousand, nay, ten thousand curses upon them, but that he will fully
   punish such a wicked and unmerciful disposition.

   2. Supposing that the wrong is great, and calls for reparation, yet in
   the next place it is required that a man be willing, upon any tolerable
   and just terms, to agree with his adversary, rather than to proceed to
   a suit: otherwise he does not sacrifice to justice or to necessity, but
   to a litigious humour and an ill-nature, that loves contention for
   contention's sake, and descends to it, not as a remedy, but a
   recreation: he designs not to advantage himself, but to afflict and
   harass his adversary; and therefore is willing to undergo the trouble
   and misery of following the suit himself, only for the base pleasure of
   seeing another miserable.

   For surely it must be a very strange height of virulence, that shall
   make a man thus prefer the continuance of a quarrel before an amicable
   composure of it! when Providence is pleased to order the state of
   things so, that litigiousness is not only a great, but also a very
   troublesome, laborious, and costly sin. A man cannot be wicked in this
   respect, but with the expense of much money, the labour of long
   attendances, and the anxiety of much care. And when a man has wisely
   made a shift to recover one hundred pound with the expense of three,
   and for many terms run up and down, backwards and forwards, sedulously
   and industriously to no purpose; he will find those words of the
   apostle to the Corinthians, ready upon every slight cause to prosecute
   one another at law, Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not
   suffer yourselves to be defrauded? to have been not so much a lesson of
   piety, as of policy, thrift, and good husbandry. And surely if we
   compare the charges, vexation, and noise of a suit, with that pitiful
   design which for the most part is drove at by it; if thus contentiously
   to go to law be a sin, as undoubtedly it is; why then we need look no
   further, nor enjoin such an one any other penance, but that he should
   go to law again.

   3. But thirdly and lastly, supposing that both the wrong is in itself
   very great, and no satisfaction or conditions of agreement are offered
   by him that did it, but that the injured person must of necessity
   commence a suit against him; yet then it is required, that he manage it
   by the rule of charity, and not with any purpose to revenge himself
   upon his adversary. But certainly it is a very rare thing, and seldom
   found, to see a man of so clear a breast, so sincere a design, as to
   have waded through such prosecutions without any interposal of
   vindictive thoughts. The action indeed (as I have proved) is in itself
   lawful, but the person that is to manage it is weak and sinful, and it
   is ten to one but his corruption strikes in, and bears a share in what
   he does; and then the issue of the whole business turns but to the
   accounts of sin: and when the suit is ended here below, there is an
   action of revenge brought against him in the court above. And
   therefore, though he who thus chooses to right himself, does lawfully;
   yet (except in cases of extremity) certainly that man does more safely,
   who considers that he is but weak, and so offers not himself to the
   temptation.

   And thus I have finished the resolution of the last case propounded,
   and I hope have stated the controversy with that truth and equality,
   that I have not at all derogated from the law of God, while I asserted
   the laws of men.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON L.

  ROMANS xii. 18.

   If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
   men.

   WHEN I first entered upon these words, I laid the prosecution of them
   in the discussion of these four particulars.

   I. To shew what was included in this great duty of living peaceably.

   II. What were the measures and proportions by which it was to be
   determined.

   III. What were the means by which it was to be effected.

   IV. What were the motives and arguments by which it might be enforced.

   The two first of these I have at length despatched; and the two last,
   as containing nothing of controversy, but being of plain and practical
   consideration, I shall finish in this discourse, and conclude this
   subject.

   And first, for the means conducible to our performance of this
   excellent duty, I shall, amongst those many that possibly each man's
   particular experience may better suggest to him, select and reckon
   these.

   1. A careful suppression of all distasteful, but however of all
   aggravating apprehensions of any ill turn or unkind behaviour from men.
   He that will preserve himself in a regular course of acting, must not
   only attend the last issues of the performance, but watch the
   beginnings, and secure the fountains of action; and he will find it but
   a vain attempt to oppose it in its birth, when he should have
   encountered it in its conception. A great sin or a great virtue is a
   long time in forming and preparing within, and passing through many
   faculties before it is ripe for execution. And when that chain of
   preparations is laid, this perhaps is then necessary and unavoidable.

   As when a man has fixed his thoughts upon an affront offered him,
   resented it sharply, and rolled it in his mind a long time, so that the
   rancour of those thoughts begin to reach and infect the passions, and
   they begin to rise and swell, and those also to possess the will, so
   that this espouses it into full resolves and purposes of revenge: it is
   then too late to command a man, under these dispositions and
   proximities of action, to be peaceable; he is possessed and full, and
   admits of no advice. The malicious design has got head and maturity;
   and therefore will certainly pass into act, and rage in a man's
   behaviour, to the degree of railing, or downright blows, or perhaps
   bloodshed; or some other instance of a great mischief.

   But had a man, by an early wariness and observance of his teeming
   thoughts, crushed those infant sharpnesses, those first disgusts and
   grudgings, that began to sour and torment his whole mind, he would have
   found the humour curable and conquerable; and for all these seeds, and
   little essays of disturbance, yet, as to the main event of practice, he
   must have passed for a peaceable man.

   Has a man therefore received an injury, a disrespect, or something at
   least that he thinks to be so; if he would now maintain himself in a
   due composure of spirit, and stop the sallyings out of an hasty and
   indecent revenge, and all this with success and a certainty of effect;
   let him first arrest his thoughts, and divert them to some other
   object. Let him but do this easy violence to himself, as to think of
   something else: amongst those thousand things in the world that may be
   thought on, let him fix upon any one; as, his business, his studies, or
   the news of the time: but amongst other things, let the thoughts be
   directed rather to reconciling objects, such as are apt to leave a
   pleasure and a sweetness upon the mind; as a man's lawful and innocent
   recreations, the delights of a journey, of a cured sickness or an
   escaped danger, or the like. But chiefly, let the thoughts be busied
   upon such things as are peculiar and proper antidotes against the
   grudge conceived. As, let a man remember whether he never received a
   courtesy from that person who he thinks has provoked him; and let him
   consider, whether that courtesy did not outweigh the present injury;
   and was not done with greater circumstances of kindness, than this of
   disrespect. Now by such arts and methods of diverting the thoughts, the
   quick sense of the injury will by degrees be eluded, weakened, and
   baffled into nothing: and the grudge will strike a man's apprehensions,
   but as a gentle breath of air does his face, with a transient,
   undiscernible touch, leaving behind it neither sign nor impression.

   For we must know that it is the morose dwelling of the thoughts upon an
   injury, a long and sullen meditation upon a wrong, that incorporates
   and rivets it into the mind. And upon this reason it is ill affronting
   the melancholy and the thinking man, whose natural temper and
   complexion lays what he has observed before him, by more frequent
   remembrances, and more stable and permanent representations; so that
   the mind has opportunity to carry its examination to every particular
   circumstance, part, degree, and occasion of the affront, brooding upon
   it with such a close and continued intention, till it binds the
   remembrance and resentment of it upon the soul with bands of iron and
   links of brass, never to be dissolved, or fetched asunder, by time, or
   kindness, or any after-attempts of reconciliation.

   If a man will indulge his thoughts upon a disrespect offered him, he
   will find how by degrees they will raise and advance, and get the
   mastery of him. That which first did but lightly move, shall presently
   warm, then heat, afterwards chafe, and at length fire and inflame him:
   and now the evil is grown mighty and invincible; and swelled into a
   strange unlimitedness, so that that which perhaps but a week or two ago
   was no more than a slight displeasure, and to be smiled, or talked, or
   slept away, is now like to go off like a clap of thunder, to scatter an
   huge ruin, and determine in something dismal and tragical.

   We shall find that this way of thinking had the like effect upon David,
   but upon a better subject, in Psalm xxxix. 3, My heart was hot within
   me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue. We
   see here the gradation by which this holy man's thoughts led his zeal
   up to its full height. In like manner, when an injury has passed upon a
   man, he begins to muse upon it, and upon this his heart grows hot
   within him, and at length the fire burns, and then he speaks with his
   tongue; perhaps railing and reviling: and it is well, if in the issue
   he does not also strike with his hand. The lion has not always such a
   present supply of fierceness as to fit him to fly upon his prey, till,
   by the echoes of his own roarings, and the frequent striking of himself
   with his train, he has called up his drowsy spirits, and summoned his
   rage to attend his appetite, and so fully chafed himself into his
   natural fury; and then he is a lion indeed, and to meet him is death,
   and to behold him a terror next to it.

   This is exactly the case of the angry and contentious man; he provokes
   and works up himself to a passion by a restless employment of thought
   upon some injury done him; till from a man he grows into a beast of
   prey, and becomes implacable and intolerable. Surely therefore it
   concerns the virtuous and the wary, and such as know how absolutely
   necessary it is to conduct every action of piety by the rules of
   prudence, to endeavour peaceableness, by keeping down the first
   inconsiderable annoyances and disturbances of it, which like the
   mustard seeds in their first sowing are very small and contemptible,
   but being grown up, shoot out into branches and arms, spread into a
   vast compass, and settle into a firm strength and consistency of body.

   Compare a disgust in its beginnings and after its continuance, in the
   first appearance and the last effects of it; and we shall find the
   disproportions monstrous and unmeasurable. No man is able to give laws
   to an overgrown humour, and to grapple with a corruption ripe and armed
   with all its advantages. Who would think, when he sees a little
   spring-head, and beholds the narrowness of its circle, its quiet
   bubblings and small emissions, that by that time this little thing had
   crope three or four miles off, it should be spacious in its breadth,
   formidable in its depth, grow insolent in a tempest, rise and foam and
   wrestle with the winds, laugh at every thing in its way, and bear its
   conquering stream over dams and locks, and all opposition? Why thus
   also it is with the mind of man: after he is offended, if he will not
   be brought to discharge his thoughts of the offence, he may think and
   think so long, till he has thought a distasteful apprehension into an
   action of murder.

   But as in order to a man's keeping of the peace, both with himself and
   others, it highly lies upon him to give no entertainment to disgustful
   thoughts, conceived from the behaviour of men towards him; so he is
   much more to abandon and take heed of all aggravating thoughts. If he
   will not pass over and forget an offence, at least he is not to
   heighten it; to make that great, which is but small; and numerous, that
   is but single. If a man were to chastise a child for a fault, and
   presently by an error of fancy should persuade himself, that certainly
   that child was some great porter, and should measure out stripes to him
   accordingly; there is no doubt but the injury would quickly appear in a
   sad effect.

   There are indeed no venial sins towards God, but there are between men;
   and therefore he who shall prosecute a venial offence with a mortal
   hatred, and swell a molehill into a mountain, beholding every thing
   under new created heights and additions; he betrays a turbulent
   disposition, and a mind to which peace and the spirit of peace is
   wholly a stranger.

   It is not unusual to hear such speeches fall from some mouths: He did
   such a thing purposely to spite me; had he not known that I disgusted
   it, it had never been spoke or done by him. Whereas perhaps the man, in
   the word or action for which he is censured, thought no hurt, much less
   designed any: but did it by an innocent carelessness, not sufficiently
   alarmed by an experience of the baseness, the falseness, and the
   exceptiousness of men, to set a greater caution or guard upon his
   behaviour: or perhaps, take it at the worst, it was a word extorted
   from him by the exasperation of his spirit, and before he was aware,
   borne upon the wings of passion, and so quickly out of his reach, and
   not to be recalled.

   But shall we now play the exactors and the tyrants, squeezing every
   supposed irregularity till we fetch blood, and according to that
   unworthy course condemned in Isaiah xxix. 21, make a man an offender
   for a word? Are we so perfect ourselves, as to need no allowances, no
   remissions, no favourable interpretations of what we do or say? Or are
   we so unjust, as when we need these things ourselves, to deny them to
   others?

   Would any one be willing to be took upon an advantage? to have every
   slip and weakness of his discourse critically observed, every
   inadvertency in his behaviour maliciously scanned, and at length
   heightened, and blown up to a crime, or a great accusation? Surely
   there is no man so privileged from the common lot of humanity or
   natural affections, but that he is sometimes more open and gay, free
   and unconcerned, and so obnoxious to the unseasonable rigours of a
   watching, ill-natured adversary. And, on the other side, there is no
   man but sometimes suffers the vicissitude of trouble, business,
   thought, and indisposition of mind, that may cast a roughness upon his
   deportment, and for a while interrupt the complaisance of his converse.

   And shall these things be now counted grounds sufficient to build a
   dislike upon, that shall vent itself in the disturbance of a man's
   peace, the hatred of his person, the undermining of his interest, and
   the extinguishing his reputation. It is as certain as certainty itself,
   that oftentimes they do so: and therefore I have nothing to say more as
   to this particular, but to make use of that prayer of St. Paul, 2
   Thess. iii. 2, God deliver us from unreasonable men: for the way of
   peace such have not known.

   And thus much for the first means to help us in the duty of living
   peaceably; namely, a mature and careful suppression of all distasteful,
   but especially of all aggravating apprehensions, either of the
   defective or faulty instances of men's behaviour towards us.

   2. A second sovereign means conducing to the same great purpose, is the
   forbearing of all pragmatical or malicious informations against those
   with whom we converse. It was a worthy saying of Solomon, well
   beseeming that reputation of wisdom which he stands renowned for in
   holy writ, that he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. The
   carrying of a tale, and reporting what such an one said or such an one
   did, is the way to sow such grudges, to kindle such heart-burnings
   between persons, as oftentimes break forth and flame to the consumption
   of families, courts, and perhaps at length of cities and kingdoms. The
   mischief such incendiaries do is incredible, as being indeed for the
   most part inevitable. And a vine or a rose-tree may as well flourish
   when there is a secret worm lurking and gnawing at the root of them; as
   the peace of those societies thrive, that have such concealed plagues
   wrapt up in their heart and bowels.

   For let us consider the case a little: there is perhaps in some united
   body, collection, or society of men, some pick-thank caterpillar or
   other, who, either to ingratiate himself with some great one, or to
   mischief some whom he maligns, or peradventure both, comes and cringes
   and whispers, and tells his story, and possibly with some dissembled
   expressions of respect to the person whom he is about to ruin: as, that
   he is heartily sorry that such an one, whom he had always an esteem
   for, should so misbehave and forget himself, as to be guilty of such
   things as he found and heard him to be; and indeed was a long time
   before he could believe any such matter of him, out of the great honour
   he bore him. Nevertheless thus and thus it is, and he is troubled that
   he should be forced to be the messenger of any thing to his
   disadvantage.

   Well, the good man has told his story, and the secret bolt is shot: let
   us now see into how many cursed consequences this viperous piece of
   villainy is like to spread itself; and that, whether we consider the
   accusation as true or as false; as relating to the person accused, or
   to him before whom he is accused. And first we will take the allegation
   that such informers usually make in their own behalf, that truly they
   said nothing but what was truth, and they conceive truth may be
   lawfully spoken. Very good! Be it therefore a truth. But yet give me
   leave to ask such persons a few questions: as, whether a truth may not
   be reported with as malicious a design as the greatest falsity that
   ever was hatched in hell; and whether to tell a truth with the purposes
   of malice, be not a sin of as black an hue in the accounts of Heaven,
   as to contrive and tell a downright lie. I would also ask, whether the
   person who told this truth would have been as ready to tell it, had it
   made for the other's advantage as much as it does for his prejudice:
   and whether he would be willing that every thing should be told and
   published which is true of himself. I believe the answer to these
   interrogatories would appear but very lame and imperfect.

   But since truth is a thing that seldom dwells in the mouths and
   discourses of informers, we will suppose the accusation to be, as for
   the most part it is, really false; and that either as to the very
   matter of it, there being absolutely no such thing as is reported; or
   at least in respect of some portion and circumstance of the narration;
   some little thing being added, over and above the true state of the
   matter, or something being concealed that should have been mentioned;
   either of which may make such an alteration in the case, that that
   which one way is innocent and allowable, the other way becomes impious,
   vile, and criminal. It is in such reports as it is in numbers, the
   addition or detraction but of one unit makes it presently another
   number.

   But now, if we proceed further, and direct the consequences of this
   degenerous practice to the persons concerned in it; as first, to him
   that is informed against: we shall find that, whether the information
   be true or false, his condition is very miserable. For if it be true,
   all opportunities of deprecating his offence, and of reconciling
   himself to the person offended, are cut off, and took out of his hands;
   but in the mean time, the accusation lies festering in the other's mind
   to whom it is delivered, waiting only for an occasion suddenly to
   attack or ruin the poor man, who knows not of the cloud which hangs
   over him, nor of the snare that is spread under him; but is snapt and
   destroyed before he is aware, without any remedy or escape.

   But if the things deposed against him be false, as frequently they both
   are and may very well be, by reason of the accuser's presumption that
   he shall never be brought to vouch or prove what he has said; why then
   an innocent person unheard, untried, and bereaved of all power to clear
   himself, and to confute his accuser, is concluded against, and
   condemned; his sentence is passed, the purpose of his ruin sealed, and
   the man is blown up before ever he understands that there is so much as
   any crime, accusation, or accuser of him in the world.

   And is not this an horrid and a barbarous thing, and a perversion of
   the very designs of society? For to what purpose do men unite and
   convene into corporations, if the mischiefs they suffer under them are
   greater than those that attend them in a state of dispersion and open
   hostility?

   Certainly it is a grievance to nature, and to that common reason and
   justice which presides over mankind, to see a brave, an upright, and a
   virtuous person fall by the informations and base arts of an atheist, a
   sycophant, and an empty dressed fellow; such an one, that, if but one
   third part of mankind were like him, neither God nor man would think
   the world worth preservation. And yet such are the men that overthrow
   virtue, disappoint merit, and render the rewards of the good and the
   vicious accidental and promiscuous; and in a word, are the pests and
   vermin that disturb and infest society.

   But neither is the poor, accused, ruined person the only one that is
   abused and injured by the false and malicious informer, but even he who
   by such information is brought to ruin him. For is it not the worst of
   injuries, that such a wretch should make a great person the instrument
   of his sin, and the prosecutor of his malice; and all this by abusing
   his intellectuals with a lie? deceiving and cheating him with false
   persuasions, in order to a gaining him to a base or a cruel action;
   first blinding his eye, and then using his hand, and making him to do
   that upon a false representation of things, which, had he been rightly
   informed of, he would not have done for a world. It is like the making
   of a man drunk, and then causing him to sign a deed for the passing
   away of his estate. In short, it is a daring encroachment, and an
   intolerable injury. And if there were any one that might lawfully not
   be forgiven, it is this.

   But the abuse rests not here; for such sycophants by these practices do
   not only abuse men in their understanding, their interest, and their
   peace, by first making them to believe a falsehood, and then to
   sacrifice a friend or an innocent man to such a belief; but further,
   they abuse them in that very instance for which they accuse others. It
   being very frequent, nay my own little experience has observed it, that
   those who are so officious, by the traducing of others, to fawn, cog,
   and flatter men to their faces, are as apt to vilify them behind their
   backs as any other whatsoever: nay, the matter of the accusation by
   which they secretly stab others, are usually some unwary expressions
   slipt from those persons, while they have been trapanned into a
   compliance with the informer's discourse, in his undervaluing,
   upbraiding, and detracting from the same men, before whom afterwards he
   is so diligent to accuse them.

   Now in this case there is nothing so much to be wished for, as that
   some lucky hand of Providence would bring the person informed against,
   and the person to whom he was informed against, together; that they
   might compare notes, and confer what the informer had said on both
   sides. And the truth is, so it falls out by a strange connection and
   trace of events, that usually such whisperers are discovered, and that
   that which passing from the mouth is but a whisper, from the echo and
   rebound becomes a voice: the effect of which is, that a vile person
   comes to be understood, and then to be abhorred, and to be pointed at
   as he passes by, with such kind of elogies as these; "There goes a
   person for whom no one breathing was ever the better, but many ruined,
   blasted, and undone; the scourge of society, a spit-poison, a viper,
   and to be abandoned and shunned by all companies, like a mortal
   infection: and yet withal so despicable, so detested, and that amidst
   the greatest successes of his base projects, that the condition of him
   who is most ruined by him, even while he is ruined, is much more
   eligible, and desirable; as of the two, I know no man, but had rather
   be spit upon by a toad than be a toad."

   I wonder what such persons think, or propose to themselves, when they
   come to affront God in his house, praying, hearing sermons, and
   receiving sacraments; when there is no sin or corruption incident to
   the depraved nature of man, that more peculiarly unfits them for this
   divine and blessed duty, than the sin that we have been discoursing of.
   And I am confident, that when such a person thrusts himself upon the
   ordinance, and receives the consecrated elements; he yet partakes no
   more of the body and blood of Christ, or the real benefits of them,
   than the rat that gnaws the bread, a creature like himself, close,
   mischievous, and contemptible.

   We have seen here how much such persons and practices interrupt the
   peace of societies; but yet we are to know that the burden of this
   charge is not so wholly to lie upon the framers and bringers of such
   informations, but that some is to rest upon those also who are ready to
   hear them. For as there is a parity of guilt between the thief and the
   receiver, so there seems to be the like between the teller and the
   hearer of a malicious report; and that upon very great reason. For who
   would knock, where he despaired of entrance? or what husbandman would
   cast his seed but into an open and a prepared furrow? so it is most
   certain, that ill tongues would be idle, if ill ears were not open. And
   therefore it was an apposite saying of one of the ancients, that both
   the teller and the hearer of false stories ought equally to be hanged,
   but one by the tongue, the other by the ears: and were every one of
   them so served, I suppose nobody would be so fond of those many
   mischiefs brought by such persons upon the peace of the world, as to be
   concerned to cut them down, unless, perhaps, by cutting off the
   forementioned parts, by which they hung.

   But when there is a conspiracy and an agreement on both sides, and one
   ill-nature tells a tale, and another ill-nature thanks him for it; and
   so encourages him in the custom, by shewing how ready he is to hear his
   words, and to do the intended mischief; so that the ball is kept up, by
   being tossed from one hand to the other: let not that society or
   company of men, who are blessed with such persons amongst them, expect
   any such thing as peace; they may as well expect that the winter sun
   will ripen their summer fruits, or the breath of the north wind
   preserve their blossoms. No, they will find, that the blasts of
   contention will blow and whistle about their ears, and a storm arise,
   which shall endanger their tranquillity to an utter shipwreck, without
   any possibility of being appeased, but by throwing such wretches and
   renegadoes from God and good-nature overboard.

   Let this therefore be the second means to advance us in the duty of
   living peaceably; namely, to abominate such practices ourselves, and to
   discountenance them in others. It is a prescription easy and sovereign,
   and such an one as will not fail in the experiment: but according to
   the proportions of its efficacy, will manifest a certain and an happy
   influence, for the restoring of peace, and the refreshing of human
   converse: for when the troublers of Israel are removed, the trouble of
   it must needs cease.

   And thus much for the second means of maintaining the duty of
   peaceableness.

   3. The third that I shall prescribe is, that men would be willing in
   some cases to wave the prosecution of their rights, and not too
   rigorously to insist upon them. There are some things which it may be
   lawful for a man to do, but falling under cross circumstances, may be
   infinitely inexpedient. To require reparation for a wrong, is a thing
   good and lawful; but sometimes it may be done so unseasonably, that
   peace, which is a much better thing, is lost by it. That same stomachus
   cedere nescius found in most, is the thing that foments quarrels, and
   keeps men at such unpeaceable distances. I will not lose my right, says
   one; and I will suffer no wrong, says another: and so they enter into a
   conflict, both pulling and contesting, till the quietness of society is
   torn asunder betwixt them. Now it is here apparent, that unless one of
   these shall relinquish what he supposes to be his right, the
   controversy must of necessity be perpetual. But certainly peace is an
   enjoyment so high, that it deserves to be bought at the rate of some
   lesser abridgments; and a man shall find that he never does himself so
   much right, as when, upon such an occasion, he parts with his right. It
   may possibly be of some difficulty to assign all those instances in
   which peace may challenge this of us, as to surrender a right for its
   preservation; and though cases of this nature are as numberless and
   indefinite as particular actions and their circumstances; yet, to
   contribute something to the conduct of our practice in so weighty and
   concerning a matter, I shall presume to set down some.

   (1.) As first, when the recovery of a right, according to the best
   judgment that human reason can pass upon things, seems impossible:
   prudence and duty then calls upon a man to surcease the prosecution of
   that, and rather to follow peace. It will perhaps be replied here, that
   this case is superfluous and absurd, for no rational man will endeavour
   after that which he apprehends impossible. I answer, that this seems
   true indeed, did all that were rational act rationally. But besides,
   supposing this also; yet unless a man acts virtuously as well as
   rationally, he may propose to himself the prosecution of a thing
   impossible, not indeed with a design to obtain that thing, but for some
   other end or purpose; as either to gratify an humour, or to annoy an
   enemy, or the like. As for instance, he that should prosecute a poor
   widow, not worth above two mites, for the debt of a thousand talents
   due to him from her, yet by reason of this her great poverty,
   contracted by losses and misfortunes, utterly unpayable; that man
   prosecutes an impossible thing, and at the same time knows it to be so,
   and accordingly despairs of the recovery of his debt, yet he continues
   the suit, because his disposition may incline him to be troublesome,
   vexatious, and unmerciful; and where money is not to be had, to pay
   himself with revenge. He may be one that tastes the calamities of a
   ruined adversary with an high relish, that finds a music in the widow's
   sighs, and a sweetness in her tears.

   But now, in such a case is it not rational to conclude, that
   Christianity calls us to peace, rather than to a fruitless prosecution
   of a desperate right? where Providence, by taking away all possibility
   and means of payment, seems to have decided the case for pardon, and
   the opportunities of exercising a Christian grace.

   We may be also called to the same duty of not demanding our right, when
   the power and villainy of the oppressor put the regaining of it under
   an impossibility. But you will reply; This is a very hard saying: for
   ought any one's injustice to prejudice me in the claim of my right? I
   answer, no: if that claim had any likely prospect of a recovery.
   Otherwise, what rational effect can follow it? for by all a man's
   clamours and suits for right, he is not at all benefited, and yet the
   peace is disturbed; nay, it is enough to stamp his action irrational,
   that he loses his own peace without the least recompence; all his
   endeavours expiring into air, and vanishing with no effect: for the
   door of justice is shut, and his little attempts cannot force it open.

   It is a thing in itself lawful and commendable, for a subject to vouch
   and assert the title of his prince. But should it so fall out, that a
   tyrant and an usurper steps up into his throne, and there surrounds
   himself with armed legions, and a prevailing interest, so that justice
   and loyalty are forced to shrink in their heads, and so all purposes of
   resistance become wholly insignificant; will any one say, that it is
   here the duty of any particular person to stand forth and defend his
   prince's claim, in defiance of the usurper, by which neither his
   prince's right is in the least advantaged, nor the oppressor's power at
   all weakened or infringed; but yet the common peace is interrupted, and
   a ruin brought upon his own head, and the head of his confederates.

   Thus, when a bird comes to be immured in the cage, being took from its
   natural range in the air and the woods, and begins to feel the injury
   of a restraint and the closeness of a prison, it strives and flutters
   to recover its native liberty; and perhaps with striving breaks a wing
   or a leg, and so pines away: and after all this unquietness, is yet
   forced at last to die in the cage.

   It is so with a person overpowered in his right, and bereaved of it by
   those with whom he cannot grapple. Christianity and reason command him
   not here to labour in vain, but to make a virtue of necessity, and to
   acquiesce, expecting the issues of Providence, which disposes of things
   by a rule known only to itself. And by so doing a man is no worse than
   he was before; but the peace is maintained, and the rewards of patience
   may be well expected.

   (2.) In the second place, it seems to be a man's duty to quit the claim
   of his right, when that right is but trivial, small, and
   inconsiderable, but the recovery of it troublesome and contentious.
   That which being lost makes a man not much the poorer, nor recovered,
   much the richer, cannot authorize him to enter into the turmoil, the
   din, and noise of a suit, or a long contest.

   Nothing can warrant a man in these courses but necessity, or a great
   inconvenience; which, in the supposed instance, is not pleadable. But
   he proceeds upon the dictates of humour, the suggestions of revenge,
   and the instigations of an unquiet disposition: the consequences of
   which, in this world, are but ill; and the rewards of them in the next
   much worse.

   This whole method is like the applying of corrosives, and caustics, and
   the most tormenting remedies, to remove the pain of a cut finger, or
   like the listing of armies to chase away flies: the means and the
   design are hugely disproportionable.

   (3.) In the third place, it seems to be a man's duty to recede from his
   claim of any particular right, when for the injury done him he has a
   recompence offered him, in some good equivalent, and perhaps greater,
   though of another kind. A man has deposited a jewel in another's hand;
   the jewel comes to be lost or stolen: but the person to whose keeping
   it was intrusted is willing to make him satisfaction, in paying him the
   full value of it in money, or in giving him another of a greater price.
   In which case, should the person endamaged utterly refuse all such
   satisfaction, and rigidly insist upon the restitution of that
   individual thing, he declares himself a son of contention, an enemy of
   peace, and an unreasonable exactor.

   Nay, the equity of this extends even to those losses, for which,
   perhaps, no recompence perfectly equivalent can be made; yet, when the
   utmost that the thing is capable of comes to be tendered, justice,
   acting by the rules of charity, will tie up the injured man from
   righting himself by any further prosecutions. As for instance, we will
   suppose a man defamed, and injured in his reputation; in this case, the
   word that gave him the wound cannot be unsaid again, or revoked, any
   more than a spent hour be called back, or yesterday brought again upon
   the stage of time; but it is gone, and past recovery. Yet the mischief
   done by this word is permanent and great; it has spilt a man's good
   name upon the ground; which, like spilt water, cannot be gathered up
   again. But after this, the slanderer comes to be touched with remorse
   and sorrow for what he has done, acknowledges and deprecates his fault
   before his slandered brother; retracts his words as publicly as they
   were spoke, offers him a large sum of money or a great advantage: what
   now is the injured person to do in this condition? True it is that a
   good name is unvaluable; and all the pelf in the world is not an equal
   ransom for it. Yet it is also as true, that no quarrel, how just
   soever, ought to be immortal; but ought to be let fall upon due
   reparation: and the very nature of this case admits of no other or
   greater reparation than what has been offered. Should it therefore be
   flung back in the offerer's face, and the action of slander go on
   rigorously and inexorably, I am afraid the scene would be altered, and
   that he who prosecutes his right, having yet more malice than right of
   his side, would, in the estimate of the supreme Judge, from the injured
   person turn to be the injurious.

   The like may be said in the loss of a limb, or any part of the body, as
   an eye or an arm. Certain it is, that he who has struck out my eye, or
   cut off my arm, has not the magazines of nature so in his power, as to
   be able to give me another; nor will all his estate recompense the
   injury of a maimed, deformed body: yet if he will endeavour to give me
   the best recompence my sad condition will receive, and make up the loss
   of these with supplies of other advantages, I must be contented, and
   lie down patiently under my calamity, no longer owning it under the
   notion of an injury from the man that did it, but as a sad providence
   from heaven, as an arrow shot from the bow in the clouds, to punish my
   sins and to exercise my patience. And therefore all suits and actions
   and endeavours after a severe retribution, must be let fall; I must not
   vex, worry, and undo him. The eye that God has left me must not be evil
   because man has robbed me of the other; nor the remaining arm stretched
   out to revenge the blow that lopped off its fellow.

   And thus I have shewn the cases in which the duty we all owe to peace
   may command us sometimes to remit the rigid prosecutions of our right;
   which was the third means proposed to give success to our endeavours
   after peaceableness.

   4. A fourth is, much to reflect upon the great example of Christ, and
   the strict injunction lying upon us to follow it. We shall find that
   his whole life went in a constant recession from his own rights, in
   order to the tranquillity and peace of the public: he was born heir to
   the kingdom of the Jews, yet never vouched his title, but quietly saw
   the sceptre in an usurper's hand, and lived and died under the
   government of those who had no right to govern. When tribute was
   demanded of him, he clearly demonstrated the case to Peter, in Matthew
   xvii. 24, 25, 26, that they had neither right to demand, nor he
   obligation to pay any; yet, in verse 27, we find that he would be at
   the expense of little less than a miracle, rather than, by refusing to
   obey an unjust exaction, to disturb the peace. Lest we should offend
   them, says he to Peter, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take
   up the fish that first cometh up; and thou shall find a piece of money
   in his mouth: that take, and give for me and thee. But what if they had
   been offended, it had been but an offence taken, not given: for where
   nothing is due, nothing was to be paid, nor consequently to be
   demanded; yet so tender was he of the public peace, that he waved all
   these pleas and argumentations, and complied with the common practice.

   Nay, and what is more, in the great concernment of his life, rather
   than occasion a tumult, or any unpeaceable disorder, though amongst
   persons then about the greatest villainy that ever the sun saw; he
   quitted the grand right of self-preservation: which case, though it was
   peculiar and extraordinary, and so obliges not us to every particular
   of the action; yet the design of peaceableness, which induced him to
   such a behaviour, calls for our imitation in general, that we should be
   willing to brook many high inconveniences, rather than be the occasions
   of any public disturbance. They sent out an inconsiderable company with
   swords and staves to apprehend him; but what could this pitiful body of
   men have done to prejudice his life, who, with much more ease than
   Peter drew his sword, could have summoned more angels to his
   assistance, than there were legions of men marching under the Roman
   eagles? But he chose rather to resign himself silently and
   unresistingly, like a lamb to the slaughter, and so to recommend the
   excellency of patience to all his disciples, in a strange instance and
   a great example.

   Now I suppose that it needs not much labour to evince, that what Christ
   did, upon a moral account,, equally engages the practice of his
   disciples, according to their proper degree and proportion. And
   therefore we are to study those divine lessons of peace, to admire, and
   conform to his behaviour, to transcribe his copy, and to read a precept
   in every one of his actions. And this is the fourth means to enable us
   to quit ourselves in the great duty of peaceableness.

   5. The fifth and last which I shall propose, which surely, for its
   efficacy and virtue, will be inferior to none of the former, is this;
   not to adhere too pertinaciously and strictly to our own judgments of
   things doubtful in themselves, in opposition to the judgment of our
   superiors, or others, who may be rationally supposed more skilful in
   those things. If we pursue most of those contentions which afflict the
   world, to their first principle, we shall find that they issue from
   pride, and pride from self-opinion, and a strange persuasion that men
   have of their knowledge of those things of which they are indeed
   ignorant. I am not for the implicit faith of the papists, or for any
   man to pluck out his own eyes, and to be guided by another man's, in
   matters plain, obvious, and apprehensible; and of which common reason,
   without the assistance of art and study, is a competent judge. But
   surely, in things difficult and controverted, the learned, who have
   made it their business to wade into those depths, should be consulted,
   and trusted to, before the rash and illiterate determinations of any
   particular man whatsoever.

   The not doing of which, I am sure, has ruined the peace of this poor
   church, and shook it into such unsettlements, that the youngest person
   alive is not like to see it recovered to its full strength, vigour, and
   establishment. There is not the least retainer to a conventicle, but
   thinks he understands the whole business of religion, as well as the
   most studied and profound doctor in the nation. And for those things
   that by pious and mature deliberation, grounded upon the word of God,
   and the constant practice of antiquity, have been ordained for the
   better and more decent management of divine worship, there is scarce
   any preaching, discontented ignoramus, any groaning old woman, or any
   factious shopkeeper, who, for want of custom, sits reading the Bible,
   but will very pertly, and, as they think, also very judiciously, call
   them in question. For of those many thousands who use to read the
   scripture, there are few who understand it, and fewer who think they do
   not; whereupon they venture on all occasions to affix such bold
   interpretations on the most concerning passages, as either their
   interest or their ignorance shall suggest.

   And having upon such pitiful grounds took up an opinion, they are as
   ready to fight for it, and to assert it with the last drop of their
   blood. Armies shall be raised, swords drawn, and the peace of a kingdom
   sacrificed to a notion, as absurdly conceived as impudently defended.
   Laws must be repealed, or lie unexecuted, customs abrogated, and
   sovereignty itself must be forced to bow before the exceptions of a
   tender conscience, and to give way to every religious opiniator, who is
   pleased to judge his peculiar sentiments in sacred matters the great
   standard of truth, to which all must conform. For though they deny a
   conformity to the church in its constitutions, yet they think it very
   reasonable, nay, necessary, that the church should conform to them;
   whereas it is most certain from experience, that such persons seldom
   persist so steadily in any one opinion, as for a year's space to
   conform thoroughly to themselves.

   I conclude therefore, that there is no such bane of the common peace,
   as a confident singularity of opinion: for men's opinions shall rule
   their practices, and when their practices shall get head and
   countenance, they shall overrule the laws. If when men shall refuse to
   yield obedience to statute and government, and for such refusal plead,
   that their conscience will not give them leave to think such obedience
   lawful, and for this assign no other reason, but because they are
   resolved to think so, or allege some places of scripture, which they
   will be sure to understand in their own sense, though persons much more
   numerous and knowing than they understand them in a far different one;
   and then, after all, shall have this accepted by governors, as a
   sufficient reason to exempt them from the common obligation that the
   law designs to lay upon every subject; there is no doubt but that, by
   this course, the very foundation of peace and government will quickly
   be unsettled, and the whole fabric of church and state thrown back into
   its former confusion.

   And thus much for the third particular proposed for the handling the
   words, namely, to shew by what means we might be enabled to the great
   duty of living peaceably. I come now to the fourth and last, which is
   to shew,

   IV. What are the motives and arguments by which this duty may be
   enforced. I suppose, many may be gathered here and there from what has
   been already delivered, and therefore I shall be the briefer in this.

   1. The first enforcing argument that I shall propound, shall be taken
   from the excellency of the thing itself; which indeed is so great, that
   the highest appellations of honour recorded in scripture are derived
   from peace. God himself is pleased to insert it amongst his own titles,
   and to be called the God of peace, Rom. xv. 33. It is also the
   honourable name of the Messiah, that he was to be the Prince of Peace,
   Isaiah ix. 6; and that in the most eminent manner that could be: for he
   designed the time of his nativity when there was a general peace over
   the whole world in the reign of Augustus Caesar. And the first message
   that was sent from heaven upon his nativity was a message of peace;
   Luke ii. 14, Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace, goodwill
   towards men. The whole doctrine that by himself and his apostles he
   preached to mankind is called the gospel of peace, and the word of
   peace, Rom. x. 15. The last legacy that he bequeathed to his disciples
   at his departure out of the world was a legacy of peace; John xiv. 27,
   My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
   giveth, give I unto you. And the works of the Holy Ghost in the hearts
   of believers are expressed by the same thing, Galat. v. 22. The fruit
   of the Spirit is love, joy, peace. And in the last place, both the
   effects and rewards of piety are set forth by this, Rom. xv. 13, The
   God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. In a word,
   there is no one virtue or excellent quality in the world, from which
   there be half so many denominations of honour and expressions of
   blessing taken by the penmen of holy writ, as from peace. It is the
   very style and phrase of scripture; and if I should endeavour to
   mention how often it is thus used in it, I must not so much quote
   particular texts, as transcribe books and chapters.

   Now certainly that must needs be a glorious thing, that thus gives
   titles of glory to the Prince of glory, that thus fills the heraldry of
   heaven, and calls gifts, graces, blessings, and every good thing, after
   its own name. The heathen custom was to derive their names of honour
   from the triumphs of war, as Numidicus, Asiaticus, Africanus: but
   Christian religion, that came to unite and cement society, to compose
   differences, and to conquer minds only, has made up its catalogue of
   honours with names of peace, a virtue of a more benign nature, that can
   adorn one man without the disgrace of another.

   2. The second motive to peace shall be taken from the excellency of the
   principle from which peaceableness of spirit proceeds. It is from a
   pious, a generous, and a great mind. Little things are querulous; and
   the wasp much more angry and troublesome than the eagle. He that can
   slight affronts, despise revenge, and rather suffer an inconvenience
   than employ his passion to remove it, declares himself above the
   injuries of men, and that though others would disturb him, yet he will
   not be disturbed, he is too strong to be shaken; and so, has both his
   quietness and his reputation in his own keeping.

   Now certainly it is more desirable to be such a person, than to be a
   subject and a slave to every man's distemper and imprudence; for so he
   is whom every man is able to exasperate and disquiet: he has let go his
   happiness, and put it into the power of those who regard not their own;
   and therefore is forced to be miserable, whensoever any other man shall
   think fit to be proud, insolent, and passionate. I suppose I need no
   greater argument to recommend a peaceable temper, than the misery of
   such a condition.

   3. The third motive to peace shall be taken from the consequent
   blessing entailed upon it by a peculiar promise, Matth. v. 9, Blessed
   are the peacemakers; and I may add, by a parity of reason, no less
   blessed are the peace-preservers. The treasures of heaven are opened,
   and the designs of Providence laid, to serve the interest of the
   peaceable. All contingencies, unusual passages and casualties of
   affairs, shall conspire into an happy event, in reference to such
   persons. For when God intends a blessing, a blessing with an emphasis
   and a peculiarity, as he does here, he takes a man into a nearer
   tuition, espouses his concerns, directs his actions, and orders his
   occasions.

   I do not doubt but the blessing here pronounced to the peaceable is
   such an one as reaches heaven, and runs forth into eternity, and does
   not determine in these transient enjoyments and earthly felicities; yet
   since these also lie in the bowels of the promise, and may come in as a
   fair overplus, or serve as a comfortable earnest of those greater
   happinesses that as yet are but within our prospect; I shall take
   notice of two instances of this blessing, that will certainly attend
   the peaceable in this world.

   (1.) The first is an easy, undisturbed, and quiet enjoyment of
   themselves. While a man is careful to keep the peace with others, he
   will in the rebound find the influence of it upon himself. He has no
   enmities to prosecute, no revenges to beware of, no suspicions to
   discompose his mind. But he that will disturb others, of necessity
   casts himself under all those evils. For he that affronts or injures a
   man, must be at the trouble to make that affront good; he must also
   expect that the affronted person waits for an opportunity to repay him
   with a shrewd recompence: whereupon he is to be always upon his guard,
   to hearken and look about, and contrive how he may frustrate the
   intended blow. All which is a continual torment and a sad vexation; and
   like being upon the watch every night, while others are at their rest.

   But then the chiefest misery of all is this, that as it is a very
   restless, so it is a very needless condition. For what necessity is
   there that I should undertake the trouble of troubling another? Why
   should I take so much pains to be disturbed and out of order, when the
   charge at which I may purchase my own quietness is no greater than only
   to let other men enjoy theirs? If I should strike any one a great blow
   on the teeth, it is very probable that I may bruise my own hand as well
   as hurt his face.

   But the peaceable man is composed and settled in the most of those
   disturbances that embroil the world round about him. He can sleep in a
   storm, because he had no hand in the raising it. He conjured no evil
   spirit up, and so is not put upon the trouble to conjure him down
   again. He is like a sword resting in its scabbard, which, by that
   means, both hurts nobody and preserves itself.

   (2.) The other instance of the great blessing attending the peaceable
   in this world, is that honour and reputation which such a temper of
   mind and course of life fixes upon their persons. Every one looks upon
   such a man as a public blessing, as a gift from heaven, as an help and
   remedy to the frailties and miseries of mankind. There is none but is
   forced to confess that he has been the better for such an one; and
   consequently, to acknowledge a debt to Providence, that ever he knew
   him or conversed with him.

   But on the contrary, is there any one that prays for or honours a
   plague, a rat, a serpent, or, which is worse than all, a false and a
   malicious informer? As amongst all the trees and plants of the earth
   the bramble is the most troublesome, so it is also the most
   contemptible. It is the great and notable curse of the earth to bear
   briers and thorns: and it is also their doom to be burnt; and I know
   nobody that would find a miss of them.

   For when such persons are removed, afflicted society seems to have a
   little respite and time of breathing: for while they have scope to act
   the mischief of their temper, they are like some flies, that first by
   their venom make a sore, and then set upon it and afflict it.

   But it being the nature of mankind to fasten an honour there only where
   they find either something like to God, or beneficial to themselves;
   let not such nuisances think, that any generous mind can either honour
   or affect them; for such can be considerable for nothing, but because
   they are able to do mischief; and I know nothing so vile or base in
   nature, but that sometimes it has power to do hurt. Is there any thing
   more weak and pitiful than a flea or a gnat? and yet they have sting
   and sharpness enough to trouble a wise man.

   It is therefore the peaceable mind only, the mind which studies how to
   compose, and heal, and bind up the bleeding wounds of society, that is
   truly great and honourable. The name of such is like an ointment poured
   forth, which we know is both healing and fragrant. Honour and respect
   court them and pursue them; and when they have finished a glorious life
   here, ennobled by the good offices done by them, their report survives
   them, and their memory is blessed. Their name is glorified upon earth,
   and their souls in heaven.

SERMON LI

  ROMANS vi. 23.

   The wages of sin is death.

   THE two great things which make such a disturbance in the world, are
   sin and death; the latter both the effect and punishment of the former.
   Sin, I confess, is an obvious subject, and the theme almost of every
   discourse; but yet it is not discoursed of so much, but that it is
   committed much more: it being like that ill custom spoken of by Tacitus
   in Rome, semper vetabitur, semper retinebitur.

   But while the danger continues, we must not give over the alarm; nor
   think a discourse of sin superfluous, while the commission of it is
   continual, and yet the prevention necessary.

   In the words, we have a near and a close conjunction between the
   greatest object of the world's love, which is sin, and the greatest
   object of its hatred, which is death. And we see them presented to us
   in such a vicinity, that they are in the very confines of one another;
   death treading upon the heels of sin, its hateful, yet its inseparable
   companion. And it is wonderful to consider, that men should so eagerly
   court the antecedent, and yet so strangely detest the consequent; that
   they should pour gall into the fountain, and yet cry out of the
   bitterness of the stream: and lastly, which is of all things the most
   unreasonable, that a workman should complain, that he is paid his
   wages.

   The scope and design of the words I shall draw forth, and prosecute in
   the discussion of these three following things.

   I. I shall shew what sin is, which is here followed with so severe a
   penalty as death.

   II. I shall shew what is comprised in death, which is here allotted for
   the sinner's wages.

   III. And lastly, I shall shew in what respect death is properly called
   the wages of sin. Of each of which in their order. And,

   I. For the first of these, what sin is. And according to the most known
   and received definition of it, it is anomi'a, a breach of the law; a
   transgression, or leaping over those boundaries which the eternal
   wisdom of God has set to a rational nature: a receding from that exact
   rule and measure which God has prescribed to moral actions. This is the
   general notion of it; but as for the particular difficulties, disputes,
   and controversies, which some have started upon this subject, and by
   which they have made the law of God almost as ambiguous and voluminous
   as the laws of men, I shall wave them all; and not being desirous to be
   either nice or prolix, shall speak of sin only under that known
   division of it, into original and actual.

   1. And first, for original sin. It may seem strange perhaps, that sin
   bears date with our very being; and indeed, in some respect, prevents
   it. That we were sinners before we were born; and seem to have been
   held in the womb, not only as infants for the birth, but as malefactors
   in a prison. And that, if we look upon our interest in this world, our
   forfeit was much earlier than our possession: We are, says the apostle,
   by nature children of wrath, Ephes. ii. 3. Not only by depravation, or
   custom, and ill-contracted habits, but by nature; the first principle
   and source of action. And nature we know is as entire, though not as
   strong in an infant, as in a grown man. Indeed the strength of man's
   natural corruption is so great, that every man is born an adult sinner.
   Sin is the only thing in the world which never had an infancy, that
   knew no minority. Tantillus puer, tantus peccator, says St. Austin.
   Could we view things in semine, and look through principles, what a
   nest of impurities might we see in the heart of the least infant! like
   a knot of little snakes wrapt up in a dunghill! What a radical,
   productive force of sin might we behold in all his faculties, ready
   upon occasion, and the maturities of age, to display itself with a
   cursed fertility!

   There are some, I know, who deny that which we here call original sin,
   to be indeed properly any sin at all; and will have it at the most, not
   to be our fault, but our infelicity. And their reason is, because
   nothing can be truly and properly sin, which is not voluntary: but
   original corruption in infants cannot be voluntary; since it precedes
   all exercise of their rational powers, their understanding and their
   will.

   But to this I answer, that original corruption in every infant is
   voluntary, not indeed in his own person, but in Adam his
   representative; whose actions, while he stood in that capacity, were
   virtually, and by way of imputation, the acts of all his posterity: as
   amongst us, when a person serves in parliament, all that he votes in
   that public capacity or condition, is truly and politically to be
   esteemed the vote of all those persons for whom he stands, and serves
   as representative. Now inasmuch as Adam's sin was free and voluntary,
   and also imputed to all his posterity; it follows, that their original
   corruption, the direct and proper effect of this sin, must be equally
   voluntary; and being withal irregular, must needs be sinful.

   Age and ripeness of years does not give being, but only opportunity to
   sin. That principle, which lay dormant and unactive before, is then
   drawn forth into sinful acts and commissions. When a man is grown up,
   his corruption does not begin to exist, but to appear; and to spend
   upon that stock, which it had long before.

   Pelagius indeed tells us, that the sons of Adam came to be sinners only
   by imitation. But then, I would know of him, what those first
   inclinations are, which dispose us to such bad imitations? Certainly,
   that cannot but be sinful, which so powerfully, and almost forcibly
   inclines us to sin.

   We may conclude therefore, that even this original, native corruption
   renders the persons who have it obnoxious and liable to death. An evil
   heart will condemn us, though Providence should prevent its running
   forth into an evil life. Sin is sin, whether it rests in the
   inclinations, or shoots out into the practice; and a toad is full of
   poison, though he never spits it.

   2. The other branch, or rather sort of sin, is that which we call
   actual. This is the highest improvement of the former: the constant
   flux and ebullition of that corrupt fountain in the course of a vicious
   life: that abundance of the heart declared in expressions, and made
   visible in actions. It is that which St. John calls the works of the
   devil, 1 John iii. 8, and the apostle Paul, the deeds of the flesh,
   Rom. viii. 13, and a walking and living after the flesh; with other
   such like descriptions.

   Now actual sin may be considered two ways.

   (1.) According to the subject-matter of it.

   (2.) According to the degree.

   For the first; considered according to the subject-matter of it, it is
   divided into the sin of our words, the sin of our actions, and the sin
   of our desires; according to that short, but full account given of it
   by the schools, that it is dictum, factum, aut concupitum contra legem
   Dei. Something said, done, or desired against the rule of God's law.

   (1.) And first, for the sin of our words; the irregularity of them is,
   no doubt, sinful, and imprints a guilt upon the speaker. We cannot say
   in that lofty strain of those in Psalm xii. 4, Our tongues are our own:
   who is lord over us? No; we have both a lord and a law over us; and our
   tongues are not so much our own, as to privilege the greatest princes
   and the most illustrious drolls from being responsible for their
   extravagance. A word is quickly spoke, but the guilt of it abides; like
   an arrow, it flies swift, and it sticks fast. And our Saviour assures
   us, that every idle word stands upon record to be one day accounted
   for. And that word is such, which is either directed to no end, or not
   to a right one. A defect in either of which leaves an immorality behind
   it. For, as it is in Matthew xii. 37, By thy words thou shalt be
   justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. Thy own tongue
   shall give in evidence against thee; and thy soul shall pass to hell
   through thy own mouth.

   (2.) The second sort of actual sin is the sin of our external actions;
   that is, of such as are performed, not by immediate production or
   emanation from the will, but by command of the will upon some exterior
   part or member of the body, as the proper instrument of action. Such as
   are the acts of theft, murder, uncleanness, and the like. To prove
   which to be sins, no more is required but only to read over the law of
   God, and to acknowledge its authority. They being wrote in such big,
   broad, and legible characters, that the times of the grossest ignorance
   were never ignorant of the guilt and turpitude inseparably inherent in
   them. And where the written letter of the law came not, there,
   according to the apostle's phrase, men, as to these particulars, were a
   law to themselves, and by perusing that little book, which every man
   carried in his own breast, could quickly find enough, both to discover
   and to condemn those enormities.

   (3.) The third sort of actual sin is the sin of our desires. Desires
   are the first issues and sallyings out of the soul to unlawful objects.
   They are sin, as it were, in its first formation. For as soon as the
   heart has once conceived this fatal seed, it first quickens and begins
   to stir in desire: concupiscence is the prime and leading sin, which
   gives life and influence to all the rest, so that the ground and
   principal prohibition of the law is, Thou shalt not covet. And in
   Matthew v. we see how severely the gospel arraigns the very first
   movings of every irregular appetite, making them equal to the gross
   perpetration of the sin. And indeed action is only a consummation of
   desire; and could we imagine an outward action performable without it,
   it would be rather the shell and outside of a sin, than properly a sin
   itself.

   Now all these three ways, namely, by word, action, and desire, does sin
   actually put forth itself. And this is the division of it, as
   considered according to its subject-matter.

   The other consideration of actual sin is according to the degree or
   measure of it; and so also it is distinguished into several degrees and
   proportions, according to which it is either enhanced or lessened in
   its malignity.

   (1.) As first, when a man is engaged in a sinful course by surprise and
   infirmity, and the extreme frailty of his corrupt nature; when the
   customs of the world, and the unruliness of his affections, all
   conspiring with outward circumstances, do, like a torrent, beat him out
   of the paths of virtue, and, as it were, whether he will or no, drive
   and bear him forward in the broad road to perdition: which I take to be
   frequently the condition of the dangerous, unwary, hardy part of a
   man's life, his youth; in which generally desire is high, and reason
   low; temptations ready, and religion afar off. And in such a case, if a
   strict education, and an early infusion of virtue, does not prepossess
   and season the heart, and thereby prevent the powers of sin in their
   first and most furious eruptions; how is a desperate wretch drawn forth
   into open rebellion against his Maker, into a contempt of all goodness,
   and a love of those ways that can tend to and end in nothing but his
   confusion? And yet this is the most tolerable condition that sin
   designs to bring the sinner into. I call it the most tolerable, because
   sin, left to its natural course and tendency, would and may plunge him
   into a much worse. Nevertheless, if a remedy does not maturely
   interpose, this must certainly prove fatal, and the end and wages of it
   will be death.

   (2.) The second degree of actual sin is, when a man pursues a course of
   sin against the reluctancies of an awakened conscience, and the
   endeavours of his conversion: when salvation waits and knocks at the
   door of his heart, and he both bolts it out and drives it away: when he
   fights with the word, and struggles with the Spirit; and, as it were,
   resolves to perish in spite of mercy itself, and of the means of grace.
   This we may see exemplified by several instances both in the Old
   Testament and the New. Thus God upbraids the house of Israel, Isai. i.
   5, Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt yet more and
   more. And is there any thing more frequent than complaints of their
   backsliding, their playing fast and loose with God; and their sinning
   against all God's methods of reclaiming sinners? Isai. lvii. 17, I was
   wroth, says God. and smote him: I hid myself, and was wroth, and he
   went on frowardly in the way of his own heart. Here we see God angry,
   and the sinner unconcerned; God smiting, and yet the sinner still
   proceeding.

   And the like examples we find of the Jews sinning in our Saviour's
   time: they sinned against clear light and irresistible conviction; with
   an hard heart and a daring hand. If ye were blind, says our Saviour,
   John ix. 41, ye should not have had sin. No, they sinned knowingly and
   resolutely, with an open eye and a bare face, as if they would even
   look conscience itself out of countenance. If our Saviour did wonders
   and miracles before them, they encountered miracle with miracle, and
   were as miraculous in their obstinacy as he in his mighty works.

   Now this is a more robust, improved, and confirmed way of sinning, than
   any sinner, upon his first entrance into and engagement in the service
   of sin, ever rises to; and it takes in many grains of guilt and
   malignity which were not in the former; it inflames the sinner's
   reckoning; it alters the nature and changes the colour of his sin, and
   sets it off with a deeper stamp and a more crimson die.

   (3.) The third and last degree of actual sin is, when a man sins, not
   only in opposition, but also in defiance to conscience; so breaking all
   bonds, so trampling upon all convictions, that he becomes not only
   unruly and untractable, but finally obstinate and incorrigible. And
   this is the utmost, the ne plus ultra of impiety, which shuts the door
   of mercy, and seals the decree of damnation.

   For this we are to reckon upon, that there is a certain pitch of sin, a
   certain degree of wickedness, though known to God himself alone, beyond
   which, God never pardons; (not that it is in its nature impardonable,
   but that God, according to the wise and unsearchable economy of his
   dealing with sinners, after such an height of provocation, withdraws
   his grace, and surceases the operations of his Spirit, by which alone
   the heart can be effectually changed or wrought upon.) So that these
   being thus withdrawn, the sinner never actually repents or returns; but
   being left to himself, and the uncontrolled sway of his own
   corruptions, he still goes on sinning, till he ends his wretched course
   in final impenitence.

   And this, no doubt, is the true sense of all those scriptures that
   represent God limiting his grace to a certain day: the neglect of which
   (like the last and fatal line drawn under the sinner's accounts) leaves
   him nothing more to expect, but a dreadful payment; or, as the apostle
   calls it, a fearful looking for of judgment. For as soon as ever the
   sinner has filled the cup of God's wrath, the next infusion makes it
   run over.

   And thus I have shewn the several degrees of actual sin, the several
   steps and descents by which the sinner goes down into the regions of
   death and the bottomless pit.

   Now this differs from original sin thus, that that is properly the
   seed, this the harvest; that merits, this actually procures death. For
   although as soon as ever the seed be cast in, there is a design to
   reap; yet, for the most part, God does not actually put in the sickle,
   till continuance in sin has made the sinner ripe for destruction.

   II. Come we now to the second general thing proposed; which is, to shew
   what is included and comprised in death, which is here allotted for the
   sinner's wages.

   Death is the great enemy of nature, the devourer of mankind; that which
   is continually destroying and making havock of the creation: and we
   shall see the full latitude of it, if we consider it as it stands
   divided into temporal and eternal.

   1. And first, for death temporal. We must not take it in that
   restrained sense, as it imports only the separation of the soul from
   the body: for that is rather the consummation of death, than death
   itself; it is properly the ending stroke, the last blow given to the
   falling tree.

   But we must take it in a larger compass and comprehension; as it is a
   summary and compendious abridgment of all those evils which afflict
   human nature; of all those calamities and disasters, which by degrees
   weaken, and at length dissolve the body.

   Look upon those harbingers and forerunners of death, diseases; they are
   but some of the wages of sin paid us beforehand. What are pains and
   aches, and the torments of the gout and of the stone, which lie pulling
   at our earthly tabernacle, but so many ministers and under-agents of
   death? What are catarrhs and ulcers, coughs and dropsies, but so many
   mementos of an hastening dissolution, so many foretastes of the grave?
   What is a consumption, but a lingering, gradual rotting, before we are
   laid under ground? What is a burning fever, but hell in a shorter and a
   weaker fire?

   And to these diseases of the body we may add the consuming cares and
   troubles of the mind; the toil, and labour, and racking intention of
   the brain; all made necessary by the first sin of man; and which do as
   really, though not as sensibly impair and exhaust the vitals, as the
   most visible, corporeal diseases do, or can do; and let in death to the
   body, though by another door.

   Moreover, to these miseries, which reach us in our persons, we may
   subjoin those which attend our condition; those which we are liable to
   in our names and estates; as the shame and infamy, which makes men a
   scorn to others, and a burden to themselves; which takes off the gloss
   and air of all other enjoyments, and damps the quickness, the vigour,
   and vivacity of the spirit. Also the miseries of poverty and want,
   which leave the necessities and the conveniencies, that is to say, the
   second necessities of nature unsupplied: when a man shall be forced to
   make his meals upon hunger and expectation; to be clothed with rags,
   and to converse with filth; and to live only upon those alms which the
   covetousness or the surfeit of other men can spare.

   Now all these things are so many breaches made upon our happiness and
   well-being, without which life is not life, but a bare, thin, insipid
   existence; and therefore certainly we cannot deny them to be parts of
   death, unless perhaps from this reason, that upon a true estimate of
   things, they are indeed much worse.

   And thus we have seen death in the first fruits of it; how by degrees
   it creeps upon us, how many engines it plants against us, how many
   assaults it gives, till at length it ends its fatal progress in the
   final divorce which it makes between soul and body, never resting, till
   it has abased us to our primitive earth, and to the dishonours of
   stench, rottenness, and putrefaction.

   2. But secondly, the grand payment of the sinner's wages is in death
   eternal: in comparison of which, the other can scarce be called death;
   but only a transient change, a short darkness upon nature; easily
   borne, or at least quickly past.

   But when eternity comes into the balance, it adds an infinity to the
   weight, and sinks it down to an immense disparity. Eternal death is not
   only the sinner's punishment, but his amazement: no thought, no created
   reason can take the length of an endless duration.

   But there are also some other concomitant properties of this death,
   which vastly increase and aggravate the horror of it, besides the bare
   considerations of its eternity.

   (1.) As first, that it bereaves a man of all the pleasures and comforts
   which he enjoyed in this world; the loss of which, how poor and
   contemptible soever they are in themselves, yet surely must needs be
   very afflictive to him who had placed his whole entire happiness in
   them: and therefore to be stript of all these, and to be cast naked and
   forlorn into utter darkness and desertion, cannot but be infinitely
   tormenting, though a man should meet with no other tormentors in that
   place. For to have strong, eager, immense desires, and a perpetual bar
   and divorce put between them and their beloved objects, will of itself
   be hell enough, though the worm should die, and the fire should be
   quenched.

   For how will the drunkard, the epicure, and the wanton bear the absence
   and removal of those things that alone used to please their fancy and
   to gratify their lust! For here will be neither ball nor masks, plays
   nor mistresses, for the gallant to entertain himself with; here will be
   company indeed good store, but no good-fellowship; roaring enough, but
   no ranting in this place. With what a killing regret must the condemned
   worldling look back upon his rich manors and his large estate, his
   parks and his pleasant gardens! to which there is now no return for
   him, but only by thought and remembrance; which can serve him for
   nothing, but to heighten his anguish by a bitter comparison of his past
   and present condition. And this is some of the fruit of sin, which by
   carrying out the heart to a vicious, irregular enjoyment of the things
   of this life, which quickly have an end, treasures up in the same heart
   materials for such a sorrow as shall have none.

   (2.) Eternal death bereaves the soul of that infinite, inexpressible
   good, the beatific fruition of God. The greatest and the quickest
   misery of a condemned sinner is the sense of loss. And if the loss of
   those puny temporal enjoyments make so great a part of his punishment,
   as I have shewn it does, what then shall we say of the loss of that,
   which was the only thing which gave life and spirit to all those
   enjoyments! which gave them that substance, and suitableness to our
   nature, as to render them properly felicities! For all the comfort that
   God conveys to the creature, comes from the sensible, refreshing
   discoveries of his presence. In thy presence, says the Psalmist, there
   is fulness of joy, Psalm xvi. 11. This is the reviving light which
   scatters all the darknesses and dismal blacks of sorrow; that wipes off
   all tears; the happy sunshine, which dries up those disconsolate dews.
   For as it is the presence of the king which makes the court; so it is
   the peculiar presence of God which makes heaven; which is not so much
   the name of a place, as of a state or condition.

   But now there is an everlasting cloud drawn between this and a sinner
   under damnation. God hides himself for ever; so that this is the sum
   and height of the sinner's doom, that he is condemned eternally to feel
   God's hand, and never to see his face.

   (3.) And lastly, eternal death fills both body and soul with most
   intense pain, and the highest torment and anguish which can be received
   within a created, finite capacity. All the woes, griefs, and terrors
   which humanity can labour under, shall then, as it were, unite, and
   really seize upon the soul at once. I am tormented in this flame, says
   the rich man, Luke xvi. 24. And surely a bed of flames is but an uneasy
   thing for a man to roll himself upon to all eternity. The sufferings
   which shall attend this estate, no tongue can express, no heart can
   conceive. Pain shall possess the body; horror, agony, and despair,
   shall rack the mind: so that the whole man shall be made the receptacle
   and scene of misery, the tragical scene for vengeance to act its utmost
   upon, and to shew how far a creature is capable of being tormented
   without the loss of its being; the continuance of which, under those
   circumstances, is but a miserable privilege, and would gladly be
   exchanged for annihilation. For every lash which God then gives the
   sinner shall be with a scorpion; every pain which he inflicts shall be
   more eager than appetite, more cruel than revenge; every faculty, both
   of soul and body, shall have its distinct, proper, and peculiar torment
   applied to it, and be directly struck there, where it has the quickest,
   the tenderest, and the sharpest sense of any painful impression.

   God seldom punishes or afflicts in this world, but it is with some
   allay of mercy; some mixture of clemency, which even in the midst of
   misery may yet support hope. But when sin has lodged the. sinner in
   hell, the cup which God then administers shall be all justice without
   mercy, all wrath and venom, all dregs and yet no bottom; a cup never to
   be drank off, inexhaustibly full, inconceivably bitter.

   But I shall use no other argument to evince the greatness of those
   torments but only this, that the Devil shall be the instrument of their
   execution. And surely a mortal enemy will be a dreadful executioner;
   and the punishment which an infinite justice inflicts by the hand of an
   implacable malice must needs be intolerable.

   And thus I have despatched the second general thing proposed; which was
   to shew, what is included and comprised in death, which is here
   allotted for the sinner's wages. I proceed now to the

   Third and last; which is to shew, in what respect death is properly
   called the wages of sin. I conceive it may be upon these two following
   accounts.

   1. Because the payment of wages still presupposes service and labour.
   And undoubtedly the service of sin is of all others the most painful
   and laborious. It will engross all a man's industry, drink up all his
   time; it is a drudgery without intermission, a business without
   vacation.

   We read of the mystery of iniquity; and certainly the mystery of no
   trade can be attained without a long and a constant sedulity. Nemo
   repente fit turpissimus. It is the business of a life to be a complete
   sinner.

   Such as are the commands of sin, such must be also the service. But the
   commands of sin are for their number continual, for their vehemence
   importunate, and for their burden tyrannical.

   Sin is said to conceive and to bring forth; and there is no birth
   without pain and travail. God condemned Adam upon his transgression to
   the turmoils of sweat and labour: but one would have thought, that he
   might have spared this malediction, when labour is not only the
   consequent, but the very nature of sin. To dig the earth is man's
   punishment; but the sin which deserves it, is the greater labour.

   For is there any work so toilsome, so full of fatigue and weariness, as
   to be always at the call of an unlimited appetite, at the command of an
   insatiable corruption? The Greek is emphatical, and describes the
   nature of sin in its name; for poneri'a, which signifies sin or
   wickedness, takes its derivation from po'nos, which signifies labour.
   So that the readiest way, it seems, to fulfil the apostle's precept in
   1 Thess. iv. 11, of studying to be quiet, is to study to be innocent.

   And were there nothing else in sin but the discomposing and ruffling of
   that serene quiet, and undisturbed frame of spirit, which naturally
   attends a true and steady virtue, it were enough to endear the one, and
   to discommend the other. For sin seldom acts, but in the strength of
   some passion: and passion never moves but with tumult and agitation:
   there being scarce any passion but has its contrary to thwart and to
   encounter it; so that still the actings of them represent a kind of
   little war in the soul: and accordingly, as the prophet Isaiah says of
   every battle of the warrior, so we may say of every stirring of an high
   passion, that it is with confused noise. The still voice of reason is
   drowned, the sober counsels of religion are stifled, and not heard. And
   must not that man, think we, needs be very miserable, who has always
   such a din and hurry in his breast? His passions raging, and his
   vicious appetites haling and pulling him, sometimes to this object,
   sometimes to a contrary! So that what through the clamour, and what
   through the convulsion of exorbitant clashing desires, the soul is in a
   rent, distracted condition; like Actaeon amongst his dogs, that first
   bawl about his ears, and then tear him to pieces.

   The truth of this is sufficiently manifest, from the general theory of
   the thing itself; but the same will appear yet more evidently by
   running over particular instances.

   And first, take the voluptuous, debauched epicure. What hour of his
   life is vacant from the slavish injunctions of his vice? Is he not
   continually spending both his time and his subsistence to gratify his
   taste? and, as it were, to draw all the elements to his table, to make
   a sacrifice to the deity of his belly? And then, how uneasy are the
   consequences of his luxury! when he is to grapple with surfeit and
   indigestion, with his morning fumes and crudities, and other low and
   ignoble distempers, the effects of a brutish eating; thus having his
   stomach always like a kitchen, both for fulness and for filth.

   And next, for the intemperate drinker: is not his life a continual
   toil? To be sitting up when others sleep, and to go to bed when others
   rise; to be exposed to drunken quarrels and to sordid converse; to have
   redness of eyes, rheums, and distillations; a weakened body, and a
   besotted mind?

   And then for the adulterer and unclean person: upon what hard
   employments does his lust put him! first to contrive, plot, and compass
   its satisfaction, and then to avoid the furies of an enraged jealousy,
   and to keep off the shame of an infamous discovery. We find the
   adulterer, in Job xxiv. 16, digging through houses, till at length,
   perhaps, he digs his own grave too; and by a laborious pursuit comes to
   an ignominious end.

   And lastly, for the covetous, scraping usurer. It is a question whether
   he gathers or keeps his pelf with most anxiety: he is restless to get,
   and fearful to lose; but always solicitous, and at work. And perhaps
   those who labour in the mines are not so busy as those who own them.
   But I need say no more of such a person but this, that his business is
   as vast and endless as his desires; and greater it cannot be.

   And thus I have shewn the toil of sin, in several particulars, to which
   many more might be added. In short, if idleness were not a sin, there
   was scarce any sin but what is laborious.

   So that now the retribution of death following such hard and painful
   service, may properly bear the denomination of wages; and be reputed
   rather a payment than a punishment.

   2. The other reason why death is called the wages of sin, is because
   wages do always imply a merit in the work, requiring such a
   compensation. Sin and death are compared together as sowing and
   reaping: and we all account it a thing of the highest reason and equity
   in the world, that he who sows should also reap: He who sows to the
   flesh, says the apostle, Gal. vi. 8, shall of the flesh reap
   corruption. The evil of sin is every way commensurate to the evil of
   death; retaliation is the very nature and spirit of justice; and that a
   man who does an action contrary to another's good, should be made to
   expiate it by a suffering contrary to his own, is but proportion.

   But to this, some make that trite and popular objection; that since the
   same is the measure and extent of things contrary; and since our good
   works cannot merit eternal life; it should follow also, that neither
   can our sins, our evil works, merit eternal death.

   But to this I answer, that the case is very different in these two. For
   to the nature of merit, it is required that the action be not due: but
   now every good action being enjoined and commanded by the law of God,
   is thereby made due, and consequently cannot merit: whereas, on the
   contrary, a sinful action being quid indebitum, altogether undue; and
   not at all commanded, but prohibited, it becomes properly meritorious;
   and, according to the malignity of its nature, it merits eternal death.

   But some will yet further urge; that in regard a sinful action is in
   itself but of a finite nature, and withal proceeds from a finite agent;
   there seems to be nothing of proportion between that, and an endless,
   eternal punishment. For what is man but a weak, mutable creature at the
   best? And what is sin, but a vanishing action, which is performed in
   the compass of a few minutes, and not to be laid in the scale with the
   inexhaustible measures of perpetuity?

   But to this also we answer, that the merit of sin is not to be rated,
   either by the substance of the act, or by the narrowness and poorness
   of the agent; but it is to be measured by the proportions of its
   object, and the greatness of the person against whom it is done. And
   therefore being committed against an infinite majesty, it greatens, and
   rises to the height of an infinite demerit.

   Nevertheless, because men are apt to think that God treats them upon
   hard terms, and to view sin with a more favourable eye, I shall in a
   word or two shew what there is in the nature of sin, which renders it
   so highly provoking, as to deserve the greatest evil that omnipotence
   itself can inflict upon the creature. And,

   1st, Sin is a direct stroke at God's sovereignty. Hence we read of the
   kingdom of Satan, in contradistinction to the kingdom of God: and in
   the conversion of a sinner, when grace is wrought in the heart, the
   kingdom of God is said to come into it: and the whole economy of the
   gospel is styled the kingdom of heaven. So that sin had translated
   God's subjects into a new dominion: as amongst men, he who has
   committed a felony or a murder, usually flies the territories of his
   lawful prince; and so living in another kingdom, puts himself under the
   necessity of a new subjection.

   Thus sin invades the throne of God, usurps his royalty, and snatches at
   his sceptre. But now there is nothing so tender, and sensibly jealous
   of the least encroachment, as prerogative; the throne admits of no
   partner, endures no competitor. Rule and enjoy all Egypt, says Pharaoh
   to Joseph, but still with this reserve, that in the throne I will be
   greater than thou.

   No wonder therefore if God punishes sin, which is indeed treason
   against the King of kings, with death; for it puts the question, Who
   shall reign? It grasps at all, it strikes high, and is properly a blow
   given to the supremacy.

   2dly, Sin strikes at God's very being. In Psalm xiv. 1, The fool, that
   is, the sinner, has said in his heart, There is no God; and if this be
   his belief, it is so, because it was first his desire. Sin would step
   not only into God's throne, but also into his room.

   And it matters not, that the infinite perfection of God sets him far
   above the boldest reaches of his rebel-creature. For it is enough to
   see the attempts of malice: God takes an estimate of the sinner by his
   will; he is as much a serpent now he hisses, as if he stung: for
   whatsoever a man has an heart to wish, if he had power he would
   certainly effect.

   And now, if all this malignity lies wrapt up in the bowels of sin, let
   none wonder how it comes to deserve death; but admire rather, that God
   has not invented something greater than death, if possible, to revenge
   the provocation.

   And thus I have finished the third and last general thing proposed to
   be handled from the words: from which, and all the foregoing
   particulars, what can we so naturally and so directly infer, and learn,
   as the infinite, incredible folly, which acts and possesses the heart
   of man in all its purposes to sin! still proposing to the sinner
   nothing but pleasure and enjoyment, advantage and emolument, from the
   commission of that which will infallibly subject him to all the
   miseries and killing sorrows that humanity is capable of. Sin plays the
   bait before him, the bait of a little, contemptible, silly pleasure or
   profit; but it hides from his view that fatal hook, which shall strike
   through his heart and liver, and by which that great catcher and
   devourer of souls shall hold him fast, and drag him down to his eternal
   execution The consequent appendant miseries of sin are studiously kept
   from the sinner's notice; his eye must not see what his heart will
   certainly rue; but he goes on pleasantly and unconcernedly, and acts a
   more cruel, inhuman butchery upon his own soul, than ever any
   self-murderer did upon his own body.

   I shall close up all with that excellent saying of the wisest of men,
   in Prov. xiv. 9, that fools make a mock at sin. Fools they are indeed
   for doing so. But is it possible, for any thing that wears the name of
   reason, to be so much a fool, as to make a mock at death too? Will a
   man play with hell, dally with a scorpion, and sport himself with
   everlasting burnings?

   In every sin which a man deliberately commits, he takes down a draught
   of deadly poison. In every lust which he cherishes, he embraces a
   dagger, and opens his bosom to destruction.

   In fine, I have endeavoured to shew what sin is, and what death is, the
   certain inevitable wages of sin; and so, have only this short advice to
   add, and to conclude with: he who likes the wages, let him go about the
   work.

SERMON LII.

  MATTHEW v. 8.

   Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

   IT may at first seem something wonderful, especially since the times of
   the gospel, that there should be so few men in the world happy, when
   happiness is so freely offered and proposed by God, and withal so
   universally and eagerly desired by men. But the obviousness of the
   reason will quickly supersede the wonder, if we consider the perverse
   and preposterous way of men's acting: who, at the same time,
   passionately pursue the end, and yet overlook the means; catch at the
   good proposed, but abhor the condition of the proposal. For all would
   enjoy the felicity of seeing God, but scarce any can brook so severe a
   duty as to maintain a pure heart; all would behold so entertaining and
   glorious a sight, but few are willing to crowd for it into the narrow
   way. Men would reconcile their future happiness with their present
   ease, pass to glory without submitting to the methods of grace. So that
   the grand reason that so many go to hell, is because they would go to
   heaven for nothing: the truth is, they would not go, but be caught up
   to heaven; they would (if I may use the expression) coach it to the
   other world, as Elias did; but to live as the same Elias did in this
   world, that they cannot bear. In fine, if we could peruse the black
   roll of all those who have perished eternally, we should find that the
   generality of men are lost, because they cannot eat, drink, sleep, and
   play themselves into salvation.

   But this great sermon of our Saviour teaches us much other things; a
   sermon fraught with the most refined and elevated doctrine, the most
   sublime and absolute morality that ever was vented into the world: far
   before all the precepts and most applauded doctrine of the
   philosophers; yea, as far before them in perfection and purity, as they
   were before Christianity in time. For they only played upon the surface
   and outside of virtue, gilding the actions, and giving some little
   varnish to the external behaviour of men: but Christianity looks
   through all this, searches the reins, and pierces into the inmost
   recesses of the soul, never resting till it stabs sin, and places
   virtue in the very heart.

   An eminent instance of which we have in these words; which being so
   very plain and easy in themselves, ought not to be encumbered with any
   superfluous explication: and therefore I shall pass immediately to the
   discussion of them; which I shall manage under these four following
   heads. As,

   I. I shall shew what it is to be pure in heart.

   II. What it is to see God.

   III. How this purity of heart fits and qualifies the soul for the sight
   or vision of God.

   IV. And lastly, make some brief use and application of the whole.

   I. And for the first of these, we must know, that the nature of purity
   in general cannot be better explained, than by its opposition to these
   two things.

   1. To mixture. 2. To pollution.

   1. And first of all, it excludes mixture; that is to say, all
   conjunction with any different or inferior nature; purity still infers
   simplicity: gold cannot be called pure, though never so great in bulk,
   if it has but the least alloy of a baser metal. Though there be in the
   heart seeds of virtue, principles of goodness and morality; yet if
   blended with a greater, or an equal degree of corruption, that heart
   cannot challenge the denomination of pure: for, as Solomon says,
   Eccles. x. 1, even so small a thing as a fly falling into the
   apothecary's ointment will give it an offensive savour; and one grain
   of folly will taint all the honour of him who has a reputation for
   wisdom. In this sense also is purity ascribed to the word or law of
   God, in Psalm cxix. 140; Thy word is pure, therefore thy servant loveth
   it: which is an elogy that cannot be truly given to any other laws in
   the world, no not to those of the most renowned lawgivers, as of
   Lycurgus, Solon, or Plato in his Commonwealth, whose laws, though they
   enjoined many worthy, virtuous, and noble actions, yet still were
   debased by the addition of something vile and filthy, not only allowed,
   but sometimes also commended by them; still there was a vein of
   immorality running through them, that corrupted and defiled the whole
   channel, and the best of human laws have still some mixture of
   imperfection.

   But now all mixture or composition is a kind of confusion; attempting
   unity, where nature has made variety and distinction. It raises a
   certain war or faction in the same compound; and the very cause of
   death, dissolution, and putrefaction, in all sublunary bodies, is from
   the contest and clashing of contrary qualities upon mixture; which
   never takes away the innate enmity of contraries, though it may compose
   their present quarrel. Christ states this matter fully in Matth. vi.
   24, No man, says he, can serve two masters; for he will love the one,
   and hate the other. In like manner, it is impossible for two opposite
   principles so to unite and mix themselves in the same heart, as equally
   to command and share its obedience by such just proportions, that it
   should at the same time seriously intend the service of virtue and the
   gratification of a vice. Now to give things their due and exact
   appellations, I conceive, in the sense hitherto spoken of, a pure heart
   is properly the same with that which is called in scripture a single
   heart.

   2. Purity excludes also pollution, that is, all adherence of filth and
   outward contagion; as a fountain is said to be pure, when there is no
   dirt or soil cast into it, that may discolour or defile it. If the
   guilt of any gross sinful act cleaves to the conscience, that
   conscience presently loses its purity and virginity. Every such sin
   falls upon it like a blot of ink upon the finest linen or the cleanest
   paper. In this sense St. Paul enjoins purity to Timothy; 1 Tim. v. 22,
   Keep thyself pure, that is, free from the least taint of vice or
   scandal. In this sense also St. Paul declares himself, in Acts xx. 26,
   pure from the blood of all men; that is, clear from the guilt or charge
   of the murderous neglect of souls. So that a pure heart thus taken,, is
   properly the same with that which David calls a clean heart; Psalm li.
   10, Create in me, O God, a clean heart. For so much of inherent sin, so
   much of filth and foulness. The very frame and make of man's heart is
   but dust; but sin degrades it still lower, and turns it into dirt.

   Having thus shewn what purity is in the general notion of it, I shall
   now endeavour to shew wherein the purity of the heart consists. And
   that,

   First, by way of negation. It does not consist in the external exercise
   of religion; the heart does not always write itself upon the outward
   actions. These may shine and glister, while that in the mean time may
   be noisome and impure. In a pool you may see the uppermost water clear,
   but if you cast your eye to the bottom, you shall see that to be dirt
   and mud. To rate a man's internals by his externals, and what works in
   his breast by what appears in his face, is a rule very fallible. For we
   often see specious practices spread over vile and base principles; as a
   rotten, unwholesome body may be clothed and covered with the finest
   silks. There is often a me'ga cha'sma, many leagues distance between a
   man's behaviour and his heart. In Isaiah xxix. 13, we have some drawing
   near to God with their mouth, and honouring him with their lips, of
   whom it is said in the very next words, that their heart was far from
   him. Lip-devotion signifies but little. Judas could afford our Saviour
   the lip, while he was actually betraying him to his mortal enemies. It
   is in this case with the soul as with the body, the inward vital state
   of it is not always known by the colour or complexion. For I suppose we
   are not now to learn, that the grand governing principle of the world
   is hypocrisy. And while it is so, in judging of men's words and
   actions, it is but too often necessary to read them backwards. For
   though, naturally indeed, they are signs, and signs of the thoughts and
   affections of the mind; yet art may, and usually does make them much
   otherwise. And it is odds, but he mistakes seldomest, who judges of men
   quite contrary to what they appear: so seldom do the inward and the
   outward man correspond with one another. And if this were not so, the
   prerogative of divine knowledge in judging of a man's internals would
   not be much superior to the sagacity of an human inspection. For that
   can read all that is legible to the eye, all that can incur into the
   outward senses.

   But still we must observe, that this assertion of not judging by the
   outward actions, is to be understood only of good actions, not of bad.
   For although an act materially and outwardly good may proceed from an
   heart which is stark naught; yet where the outward actions are bad, it
   is certain that the heart cannot be good. For the matter of the action,
   which is properly that which comes into the outward view, may be good,
   and yet the action itself, upon other accounts, be absolutely evil: but
   if the matter of the action be evil, (since evil is from any defect,)
   the whole action must be so too. And consequently, since a good tree
   cannot produce evil fruit, it is manifest that the heart which
   produces, and presides over those actions, is and must be evil.

   But to return to what we were before about: that the outward piety of a
   man's behaviour cannot certainly argue a pious and a pure heart, is
   evident, because there may be assigned several other principles, short
   of real piety, and yet sufficient to produce such a behaviour. As,

   1st, A virtuous and strict education. Many are born into the world, not
   only with the general taint of original sin, but also with such
   particular propensions, such predominant inclinations to vice, that
   they are as fruitful a soil for the Devil to plant in, and afford as
   much fuel for sin to flame out upon, as it is possible for the utmost
   corruption of human nature to supply them with. But God, who in his
   most wise providence restrains many whom he never renews, has many ways
   to prevent the outrageous eruption of this vicious principle. And one
   great one is this of a pious education; which may lay such strong
   fetters, such powerful restrictions upon the heart, that it shall not
   be able to lash out into those excesses and enormities, which the more
   licentious and debauched part of the world wallow in: yet still, though
   by this the unclean bird be caged up, the uncleanness of its nature is
   not hereby changed. For as no raking or harrowing can alter the nature
   of a barren ground, though it may smooth and level it to the eye; so
   neither can those early disciplines of parents and tutors extirpate the
   innate appetites of the soul, and turn a bad heart into a good: they
   may indeed draw some plausible lines of civility upon the outward
   carriage and conversation, but to conquer a natural inclination is the
   work of an higher power. Nevertheless it must be always looked upon as
   an high mercy, where God is pleased to do so much for a man as this
   comes to; and whosoever he is, who in his minority has been kept from
   those extravagances which his depraved nature would otherwise have
   carried him out to, and so has grown up under the eye of a careful and
   severe tuition, has cause with bended knees to acknowledge the mercy of
   being born of religious parents, and bred up under virtuous and
   discreet governors; and to bless God, without any danger of Pharisaical
   arrogance, that upon this account he is not as many other men are. But
   still (as I have noted) all this is but the sweeping and garnishing of
   the house; and though education may sometimes do that, yet it is grace
   only that can keep out the unclean spirit. And consequently such a
   person, notwithstanding all this outward flourish of behaviour, must
   yet know that his heart may be all this while as really unrenewed, and
   upon that score as impure, as the heart of those, who, not being
   hampered with such early preventions, break forth into the most open
   and flagitious practices.

   2dly, The circumstances and occasions of a man's life may be such as
   shall constrain him to appear in an outwardly pious dress. As when a
   man's dependance is upon persons virtuous and religious, and the whole
   scene of his life cast under those eyes that shall both observe and
   hate his impiety, there it is not for his interest to uncase and
   discover himself, and to follow the lure and dictates of a voluptuous
   humour. While Judas was to associate himself with Christ and his
   disciples, it concerned him, though he was really a devil, yet to
   personate and act the saint.

   Moreover, when Providence has put a man into a low, a mean, or an
   afflicted condition, the supplies and opportunities of many vices are
   thereby cut off, and the man is not able to shew himself, or to draw
   forth those base qualities which lie lurking in his breast. He neither
   drinks, nor whores, nor goes to plays, but he may thank his purse, not
   his heart for it. Want and poverty bind him to his good behaviour: and
   Providence thinks fit, in kindness to the world, to chain up the fury
   and violence of his passions by the straitness of his fortunes. For
   such is the boundless pride and insolence of some natures, that should
   they meet with estates equal to the grasp of their desires, and have
   the plenties of the world flow in with the full swing and career of
   their appetites, they would be intolerable. Society would even groan
   under them, and neither heaven nor earth would endure them; so that
   there is a necessity, that penury and scarcity should discipline, and,
   as it were, diet them into sober courses. But still, amidst all these
   restraints, the mind of such an one may be as base, as filthy, and as
   prone to all lewdness, as the mind of a thoroughpaced rebel may be to
   his old game, after an act of oblivion. For by all this, Providence
   only ties his hands, grace does not change his heart.

   3dly, The care and tenderness a man has of his honour, may engage him
   to demean himself with some show of piety and religion. For there is
   scarce any one so vicious (some few monsters, some years since amongst
   us, excepted) as to desire or judge it for their credit, to be thought
   so. But generally, as every such person would gladly die the death of
   the righteous, so he would willingly live with the credit and
   reputation of the righteous too. The principle of honour (even with
   persons not styled honourable) will go a great way; and a man will be
   at the cost of a few seemingly virtuous actions to be reputed a
   virtuous person. Men use to go to church in their best clothes; and it
   is for their credit to put on the fairest appearance in a religious
   performance. We read how far this principle carried the pharisees; and
   what a glorious outside the love of glory put upon them. They prayed,
   they fasted, they gave alms, and in short had the very art of
   mortification; and yet within were full of all fraud, extortion, and
   excess, and (in a word) of themselves. There were none, whose behaviour
   shined brighter in the eyes of men, nor whose heart was more loathsome
   in the eyes of God; for they did all to be seen and talked of; and (as
   it were) to ride in triumph upon the tongues of men; and, in fine, were
   the arrantest puritans in the world, those only of a later date
   excepted, who, it is confessed, have infinitely outdone their original.
   For all the religion of those pharisees flowed only from the beholder's
   eye, and not from their own heart. They made broad their phylacteries,
   and enlarged the borders of their garments, taking the measure of both
   by the breadth and largeness of their latitudinarian consciences; which
   were of such ample and capacious dimensions, that after they had
   breathed themselves into a stomach by a long prayer, they could easily
   swallow a thousand widows' estates, lands, tenements and all, for the
   first course, and the revenues of a crown and church for the second, of
   which we can bring aprobatum est for a demonstration.

   Machiavel himself, though no great friend to religion, yet affirms, and
   very frequently too, that the appearance and reputation of religion is
   advantageous; and that, we know, is not to be acquired without many
   instances of practice, which may affect and dazzle the spectators into
   admiration, and then make them vent that admiration in applause. But
   what is all this to the purity of the heart, to the sanctity of the
   inner man? It is all but the acting of a part, a piece of pageantry, a
   mere contrivance of ambition, nothing but dress and disguise, and may
   possibly procure a man some glory in this world, but none, in the next.

   Now in all these motives to a religious behaviour, we may observe this
   of them, that they are forced and preternatural, and raise a motion
   which they are not able to keep up. As when we see a stone thrown
   upwards, it moves only from the impression of an outward force, and not
   from the activity of an inward principle; and therefore it quickly
   sinks, and falls to the ground. In like manner, when there is not a
   stock or habit of purity in the heart, constantly and uniformly to
   diffuse the same into the outward actions, the appearance of piety will
   be found too thin and weak to support itself long. And let that man,
   whosoever he is, who acts in the ways of piety and virtue only upon the
   force and spring of external inducements, be warily observed and
   attended to, and it is a thousand to one but that some time or other
   his vice gives his hypocrisy the slip, and lays him open to the world,
   and convinces all about him, that how fair and specious soever the
   structure seemed to be which he had raised, yet the foundation of it
   was laid in the sand, or, which is worse, in the mud.

   From all which I conclude, that purity of heart neither consists in,
   nor can certainly be proved by any external religious performances
   whatsoever. In the

   Second place therefore, to shew positively wherein it does consist: it
   consists properly in an inward change and renovation of the heart, by
   the infusion of such a principle into it, as naturally suits and
   complies with whatsoever is pure, holy, and commanded by God. It is not
   a thing born, or brought into the world with us, nor yet reared upon
   the stock of nature by any art, industry, or cultivation of our own
   whatsoever. No, it is and must be the product of a new creation. Nor
   can all our sorrows and tears of themselves wash or purify the heart;
   but the Spirit of God must move upon the face of those waters, and form
   in it the new creature, or the heart will continue in its native filth,
   chaos, and confusion for ever. Now where such a principle of purity is,
   it will be like a strong bias, continually inclining and carrying out
   the soul, and that even in its most vigorous appetites, to what is
   pure. For as we rationally gather and learn the nature of a thing from
   the quality of those things which agree or disagree with it; so when
   the heart kindly and naturally closes with the purity and excellency of
   the divine precepts, but on the other side carries a certain aversion
   to, and loathing of the sordid, unclean suggestions of sin, it is an
   argument that it is advanced into new principles and inclinations, and
   purified from those foul habits which it was originally polluted with.

   Now there are three things more especially (amongst many others that
   might be mentioned) in which this purity of the heart does certainly
   and infallibly manifest itself. As,

   (1.) In the purity and untainted sanctity of the thoughts. The range of
   the thoughts is free, and may defy the inspection of the most curious
   and inquisitive mortal beholder: they walk in such a retirement as is
   open to no eye, but to that alone, to which nothing can be hid. Now
   when a man shall carry so strict an hand over these, as to admit of no
   parley with vice, no, not in his thoughts; when yet he knows, that if
   he should be never so free and familiar with it there, no man breathing
   could either observe or reproach him for it: this surely argues, that
   he loves virtue for itself, and that purity, instead of being his
   design, is become his nature. For what Solomon says of the dissembling
   churl in Prov. xxiii. 7, that as he thinketh in his heart, even so is
   he, the same may be said of every man living, in respect of that
   principle which sways and governs his mind, be it what it will.

   For since the thoughts are so quick as to prevent all deliberation, and
   withal so unruly, as for the most part to admit of no control from
   reason, when it would either command or carry them out to, or remand,
   and take them off from any object; it follows, that whatsoever they run
   out freely and spontaneously upon, that the mind is full of, taken up
   and possessed with, so that it is, as it were, a mighty spring,
   incessantly and powerfully possessing and bending the thoughts that
   way. And therefore, let a man's outward actions seem never so pure,
   never so unblameable; yet if the constant or main stream of his
   thoughts runs impure; if they take a liberty to rove over and delight
   in filthy, unclean objects; and if, where the practice of villainy is
   restrained, it is yet supplied by an active imagination; there a man
   may be said to be more cautious and reserved indeed, but not at all the
   more holy. For it is an undoubted argument, that his heart is of the
   same temper: since wheresoever the main haunt of the thoughts is, there
   must the heart be also.

   (2.) The purity of the heart is infallibly seen in a sanctified
   regulation of the desires. The first step and advance of the soul is
   into thought, the second into desire. Now the desires have the same
   privilege of secrecy and freedom with the thoughts; and if you would
   collect and argue the nature of the mind from either of them, the
   argument from these is as evident, and perhaps more forcible, than from
   the other. For the will is the great scene and subject of vice and
   virtue; and the desires are the immediate issues of that. No outward
   force or art whatsoever can stop the vent and passage of desire: but
   the whole soul flows forth in its inclinations; and therefore,
   wheresoever they may be discerned, they are the most true, proper, and
   unfailing interpreters of the heart. For what else means the Spirit of
   God by that noted expression in Prov. xxiii. 26, My son, give me thy
   heart; but that a man should give God the strongest and most forcible
   operations, and (as I may so express it) the firstborn of his heart,
   his desires.

   There was nothing from which David gathered the sincerity and goodness
   of his heart so much as from the free and natural flow of his desires;
   in Psalm cxix. 20, My soul, says he, breaketh for the longing desire
   that it hath to thy judgments at all times. And in Psalm lxxiii. 25,
   There is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of thee. Also in
   Isaiah xxvi. 9 With my soul have I desired thee in the night-season,
   says the holy prophet. And again, in Psalm xxxviii. 9, David sums up
   his final appeal to God, concerning the integrity of his heart, in
   these words; Lord, all my desire is before thee.

   So that if any man now would certainly know whether his heart be pure,
   he has here a compendious and sure way of trial: let him read over his
   desires, and strictly observe the motions of his will and affections.
   When he is upon the performance of any holy duty, let him see whether
   or no his desires keep him company in it; when the allurement of any
   sinful pleasure or profit plays itself before him, let him see whether
   his desires do not reach out after it, though perhaps his hand dares
   not. And this will give him faithful information, and such as will
   never deceive him; for desire is properly the pulse of the inner man,
   and as the heart is affected, so that beats.

   (3.) The third, and that not the least argument of a pure heart, is a
   fearful and solicitous avoiding of every thing that may tend to sully
   or defile it. It perfectly hates sin, and therefore dreads the
   occasions of it: it makes a man know no other way of working out his
   salvation, but with fear and trembling. And in this great work, the
   trembling hand is still the steadiest, and the fearful heart the most
   likely to be victorious. For we must know, that there is nothing almost
   which we meet with, nothing which comes before us, but may be to us an
   occasion of sin: some things indeed are so directly, and others are so
   by accident. And therefore, whosoever he is, who would be wise unto
   salvation, must absolutely fly from the former, and warily observe
   himself in the use of the latter. For as the apostle says, that the
   wisdom from above is first pure; so we may with equal truth affirm
   convertibly, that the purity which is from above is first wise: that is
   to say, it considers and casts about for the best methods, how to guard
   and secure itself against the assaults and stratagems of the grand
   enemy, who would destroy it. And for this cause, be a thing or practice
   never so lawful in itself, yet if, either through human frailty or the
   Devil's subtilty, it is like to prove a snare to a man, and to engage
   him in some course or other which is not lawful; a principle of true
   genuine purity will be sure to keep aloof off from it; and by no means
   admit the enemy into the outworks, where it is careful to defend the
   main fort. A man of an heart so disposed will say within himself, "I
   will not venture into such a company, I will not use such a recreation,
   I will not go to this ball nor to that play, for I know not how my mind
   may serve me under such circumstances; God may leave me to myself, and
   my strength may fail me, and my own heart betray me. If I tempt God,
   God may commission the Devil to tempt me, and so the serpent slide into
   my bosom before I am aware." No, such an one will carefully avoid those
   spiritual pest-houses, where scarce any thing is to be heard or seen,
   but what tends to the corruption of good manners; and from whence not
   one of a thousand returns, but infected with the love of vice, or at
   least with the hatred of it very much abated from what it was before.
   And that, I assure you, is no inconsiderable point gained by the
   tempter; as those who have any experience of their own hearts
   sufficiently know. He who has no mind to trade with the Devil, should
   be so wise as to keep away from his shop.

   In vain therefore does any one pretend to a pure heart, who puts
   himself into the tempter's walk, into the very road and highway to sin
   and debauchery. For can any one really hate to be defiled, and yet
   handle and embrace pitch? abhor all impurity, and yet plant himself in
   the very neighbourhood and confines of it? A pure heart is a tender
   heart, and such an one as will smite the breast that holds it upon
   sight of the very garment that is spotted with the flesh; such an one
   as feels the least breath that may blow upon its innocence, and, in a
   word, dreads the very first approaches and remote dangers of that fatal
   contagion.

   And thus much for the first general thing proposed; which was to shew,
   what this purity of the heart is, and wherein it does consist. I
   proceed now to the

   Second, which is to explain, what it is to see God. The enjoyment which
   blessed spirits have of God in the other world is, both in the language
   of scripture and of the schools, generally expressed to us by their
   seeing God; as in Matt, xviii. 10, it is said of the angels, that they
   always behold the face of God in heaven: and in 1 Cor. xiii. 12 it is
   said, that hereafter we shall see God face to face; with several other
   places to the same purpose.

   Now concerning a man's thus seeing God, the schools raise several
   disputes, but the most considerable of them may come under these two
   heads.

   1st, In regard every man shall be raised with a body as well as a soul,
   they question, whether this vision shall be wholly mental, and
   transacted within the soul; or whether the body shall be refined and
   sublimated to such a perfection, and nearness to the spiritual nature,
   as to be also made a sharer in it? And whether it be possible for a
   corporeal substance to see an incorporeal? To which, those who had
   rather be wise unto sobriety, than pronounce boldly of such things as
   their present condition renders them uncapable of judging of certainly,
   give these answers.

   (1.) That the knowledge of this is mere curiosity, and consequently
   such as a man may be without, and yet know never the less of what he is
   really concerned to know. (2.) That there is no express scripture to
   decide it either way; and natural philosophy is an incompetent judge in
   matters which can be known only by revelation. But,

   2dly, In the next place, they put the question, whether the soul shall
   enjoy God, its chief good, by an act of the understanding in its
   intuition of him, or by an act of the will in its adhesion to him. And
   there are those who fiercely dispute it on both sides.

   But to this also it may be answered, that as the soul shall enjoy a
   perfect good, so it must enjoy it after a perfect manner, so as to
   diffuse the enjoyment into every faculty that is capable of it: that is
   to say, it must enjoy it agreeably to a rational nature; which first
   receives a good by the apprehensions of the intellect, and then
   transmits it to the adhesion and embraces of the will. For a rational
   soul cannot love any good heartily, but it must first understand it;
   nor can it understand an excellent good thoroughly, but it must also
   love it. And consequently, I conclude, that the soul's fruition of God
   is neither precisely by an act of the understanding, nor yet of the
   will, but jointly and adequately of both. But I shall not run out any
   further into these controversies, as bearing no such necessary relation
   to the matter before us.

   Briefly therefore, by our seeing God is meant, and under it comprised,
   the whole enjoyment of the felicities of the other life; as by seeing
   the sun, is set forth the entire, total enjoyment of this life; as in
   Eccl. vii. 11, By wisdom, says the preacher, there is profit to those
   who see the sun; that is, to those who are alive in the world. The
   Greeks also use the same phrase, idein pha'os eeli'oio being frequently
   used by Homer for the whole enjoyment of this life; and the Latins have
   the like expression, luce privari, to be deprived of the light, being
   with them an usual phrase for a man's losing his life.

   Now our enjoyment of God is expressed to us by our seeing him, rather
   than by any other way, I conceive, for these reasons.

   (1.) Because the sense of seeing represents the object with greater
   clearness and evidence, than any of the other senses. Light, the great
   discoverer both of itself and of all things else, is apprehended only
   by seeing; and the eyewitness, we know, is still the most authentic.
   God will then shew himself to the soul so plainly and manifestly, he
   will so open and display his divine perfections to the understanding,
   that we shall know him as fully and clearly, as we do now those things
   which we actually see before our eyes; though still (as we must all
   along suppose) after much another way.

   (2.) A second reason is, because the sense of seeing is of all the
   other senses the most universally exercised and employed. For as long
   as a man lives, every moment that he converses in the world, he is
   still looking upon something or other; except it be when he is asleep,
   during which time he can scarce be said to live. And therefore since
   our enjoyment of God hereafter shall be so continual and without
   interruption, as to leave no vacant minute which shall not be taken up
   and filled with that glorious fruition, it is upon this account most
   appositely and properly described to us, by our seeing him. For in
   sight and thought (if in any thing) we have the perpetual motion.

   (3.) A third reason of this expression may be, because the sense of
   seeing is the sense of pleasure and delight; and that upon which the
   whole comfort of our life principally depends. For, says the wise man
   in Ecclesiast. xi. 7, the light is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing
   for the eyes to behold the sun. And we know that it is much a greater
   pleasure for a man to see his friend, than only to hear from him. Put
   out the eyes, shut but those windows, and the soul will presently be
   filled with sadness, and horror, and a dismal Egyptian darkness; which
   we know is to be reckoned amongst the greatest of the Egyptian plagues.

   Since therefore the enjoyment of God is the highest bliss and pleasure,
   the most sublime and ravishing delight; for so the scripture speaks of
   it, in Matt. xxv. 23, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord: and in Psalm
   xvi. 11, In thy presence there is fulness of joy, and at thy right hand
   there are pleasures for evermore:--I say, since the nature of this
   blessedness carries in it the height of joy and rational pleasure, by
   what could it be more livelily set forth to us than by the perceptions
   of that sense and faculty, which conveys the most quickening and
   exalting refreshments to the soul?

   (4.) And lastly; our enjoyment of God is expressed to us by our seeing
   him, because the sight is of all the other senses the most
   comprehensive and insatiable. In Eccles. i. 8, The eye (says the wise
   man) is not satisfied with seeing. That is to say, let it take in never
   so much of its object, it never surfeits. It is neither subject to
   satiety nor lassitude. It could presently run over and drink in the
   beauties of one world, and in the strength of that repast travel fresh
   into another. For still the more it takes in, the greater is its
   capacity to take in more. And in a word, it is the only sense, to which
   satisfaction procures an appetite.

   In this respect therefore it gives us the fittest representation of our
   enjoyment of God in glory: who is a good of that immense latitude, that
   inexhaustible fulness, as to satisfy, or rather satiate the greediest
   and most grasping appetites of the soul. It is he only who can fill the
   eye, and keep pace with desire; and, in a word, answer all those
   cravings and emptinesses of a rational nature, which the whole creation
   together could never yet do. There will then flow in such a torrent of
   delight upon all our apprehensive faculties, that the soul will be even
   overcome, and lost in the enjoyment. As when a vessel is thrown into a
   river, the river first fills it, and then swallows it up. This
   therefore is the sum of our happiness in the next world, that we shall
   see God, and experiment that which we never could in this world;
   namely, that we shall so see, as to be filled with seeing.

   And thus I have despatched the second general head proposed from the
   words; which was to explain what is meant by our seeing God: I come now
   to the

   Third, which is to shew, how this purity of heart fits and qualifies
   the soul for the sight or vision of God. And to give you a short state
   and account of this, it does it, in a word, by causing a suitableness
   between God and the soul, and by removing whatsoever may debar or
   hinder that intimate communion and intercourse, which ought to be,
   between such a creature and its Creator: now during the soul's
   impurity, God is utterly unsuitable to it; and that in a double
   respect.

   1. Of the great unlikeness; and, 2. Of the contrariety, which is
   between them.

   1. And first, for the unlikeness. It is evident, from the clearest and
   most acknowledged principles of reason, that there can be no true
   enjoyment, but where there is a certain agreeableness or congruity
   between the object and the faculty; and if so, what pleasure can it be
   to a filthy polluted person to converse with those glories which shall
   both astonish and reproach him? What enjoyment can dirt have in the
   embraces of a sunbeam? God is infinitely pure, and till the soul has
   some degrees of purity too, it is no more fit nor able to behold him,
   than the black mire of the streets to reflect the orient colours of the
   rainbow upon the sun which shines upon it. God loves not to look upon
   any spiritual being, unless he can see his own image and likeness in
   it; and that cannot be seen, where the mirror is foul that should
   represent it.

   2. The next ground of the unsuitableness between God and the soul, is
   that great contrariety which a state of impurity causes between them.
   For it is this which makes the soul look upon God as an enemy, as
   clothed with terror, and as a consuming fire; and upon itself as
   obnoxious, and fit fuel to be preyed upon and devoured by such a fire.
   The divine holiness is indeed in itself most amiable, but yet a
   dreadful and confounding sight to a guilty and defiled soul; as the
   very light itself, we know, though it be the glory of the creation, and
   the joy of the universe, is yet a frightful and an abhorred thing to
   thieves and robbers, and to such beasts of prey as lie only in caves
   and dens, and converse with nothing but filth and darkness under
   ground.

   Heaven is set forth to us as the great mansion of happiness and
   pleasure, but it is so only to the soul which is prepared for it, and
   by the renovation of its qualities made congenial to it. But to a soul
   possessed with the power and guilt of sin, it can be no more a delight,
   than the openest and the sweetest air can be to the fish; which
   perishes in the region and element which preserves its proper
   inhabitants, and dies by that which keeps us alive.

   And thus we have seen how want of purity utterly incapacitates the soul
   to enjoy God; namely, by rendering it both unlike him and contrary to
   him. God's infinite holiness, and his transcendent, amazing brightness,
   meeting with an impure nature, both shames and consumes it; as the day
   not only discommends, but also expels and drives away the night. Thou
   art of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, says the prophet Habakkuk,
   i. 13. In a word, God is too pure either to see it, or to be seen by
   it; and therefore none but the pure in heart can behold him. And so I
   pass to the

   Fourth and last thing proposed; which was to make some brief use and
   application of the foregoing particulars. And what better use can be
   made of them, than to correct our too great easiness and credulity, in
   judging of the spiritual estate either of ourselves or others. To judge
   indeed too favourably of others is an error on the right hand: for
   charity is to pass sentence there, which is a virtue of a benign
   nature, and whose office is still to think, as well as speak the best
   of things and persons. Nevertheless, it is one thing to believe
   charitably, and another to pronounce confidently; and more than the
   former we cannot do, where the knowledge of the heart is locked up from
   us; as it is of all men's hearts, besides our own. And in judging of
   ourselves, I am sure it is charity to suspect the worst, and for every
   man to probe and descend into his own heart by a strict, accurate, and
   impartial examination of it. For, from the heart are the issues of life
   and death, and from the same must be fetched the evidences of our title
   to either.

   We see many frequent our churches, hear sermons, and attend upon
   prayers; they are civil in their carriage, upright in their dealings,
   and there is no great blot or blemish visible upon their conversation;
   and God forbid, but a due value should be put upon such excellent
   preparatives to religion: but after all, will these qualifications
   certainly prove and place us amongst the pure in heart? Will men set up
   for heaven and eternity upon this stock? and venture their salvation
   upon this bottom? If they do, it may chance to prove a venture indeed.
   For do not our Saviour's own words convince us, that the outside of the
   platter may be clean, and bright too, and yet in the inside remain full
   of all filth and nastiness? So that while one entertains the eye, the
   other may turn the stomach.

   If we would prevent the judgment of God, we must imitate it; and judge
   of ourselves, as he will judge of us: that is, by the heart, and by the
   principles which rule there. And for this, let every man be but true to
   the resolves of his own conscience, and he will seldom need any other
   casuist. As for those late specious professions of religion amongst us,
   and those high strains of purity above the rest of the world, together
   with boastings of a more intimate converse with God, and acquaintance
   with the mystery of godliness, and the like; they are generally nothing
   else but terms of art, and tricks used by spiritual mountebanks, to
   impose upon the credulous and unwary; and signify but little to that
   all-searching Judge, who judges neither by fine words nor fair
   pretences. For let men say, or pray, or pretend what they will, he who
   has a covetous heart, is in the sight of God a covetous wretch. And he
   who has a proud, a lustful, or a revengeful heart, passes in the
   accounts of heaven for a proud, a lustful, and a revengeful person. And
   he who can harbour schism or faction, sacrilege or rebellion, either in
   principle or design, though he prays never so devoutly, never so loud,
   and long, with all the postures of a solemn hypocrisy, as a sad look
   and a doleful tone; yet let him take it from the word of truth itself,
   that he has nothing either pure or pious in his heart: for the main
   spring, the heart, is out of order; and therefore the motion of the
   wheels must needs be so. too.

   Briefly, and in a word, and with that to conclude: he who has nothing
   to entitle him to this blessedness of seeing God, but a civil,
   inoffensive smoothness of behaviour, a demure face, and a formal,
   customary attendance upon a few religious duties, without a thorough
   renovation of the great principle within him, and a sanctified
   disposition of heart, may indeed hereafter see God, but then he is like
   to see him only as his judge.

   To which God be rendered and ascribed, as is most due, all praise,
   might, majesty, and dominion, both now and for evermore. Amen.

SERMON LIII.

  GALATIANS v. 24.

   And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections
   and lusts.

   IT is common to all sects and institutions to have some distinguishing
   badges and characteristic names, by which they both express and
   distinguish their profession. But Christ, that came into the world not
   to imitate, but to correct and transcend both that of the Jews and of
   the philosophers, sequesters his doctrine from the empty formality of
   names, reducing it to its inward vigour and spirituality. So that even
   in respect of the most solemn appellation, we find that Christianity
   was some time in the world before the name of Christian; perhaps to
   convince the world, that religion is not a bare name, and that men
   might be Christians before they were called so; as daily experience
   demonstrates that they are often called so before they are.

   And indeed the name of Christian, without the nature, leaves no more
   impression upon the soul, than the baptismal water that conveys it does
   upon the face. Wherefore Christ gives another-guess badge and mark of
   Christianity; such an one as constitutes the very essence of it; for
   still it is the same thing that gives both nature and difference to
   beings. Now this discriminating mark is in short comprised in the
   crucifixion of the flesh and the lusts thereof.

   For the explication of which words, I shall shew,

   I, What is meant by being Christ's.

   II. What by the flesh with the affections and lusts.

   I. For the first of these. To be Christ's is to accept of and have an
   interest in Christ, as he is offered and proposed in the gospel. Now
   Christ is offered and held forth to every particular person that
   expects to be saved by him under three offices; 1. his prophetical, 2.
   his kingly, and 3. his sacerdotal. In which account I give you not only
   the number of his offices, but also their order, as they stand related
   to us. And this order and economy of them is founded upon the very
   nature of the thing, and the natural order of religious actions. For in
   the procedure of nature there must be, 1. the knowledge of a duty; 2.
   the performance of it; 3. the reward. Correspondent to these is the
   economy of Christ's offices. For, 1. by Christ's prophetic office,
   revealing his mind to us, we come to know his will. 2. Then by his
   kingly office, ruling and governing us, we come to yield obedience to
   that will. 3. And thirdly, by his sacerdotal or priestly office, we
   come to receive the fruit of that obedience in our justification and
   salvation. For we must not think that our obedience is rewarded with
   eternal life for its own merit, but it is the merit of Christ's
   sacrifice that procures this reward to our obedience.

   Some indeed preposterously misplace these, and make us partake of the
   benefit of Christ's priestly office in the forgiveness of our sins, and
   our reconcilement to God, before we are brought under the sceptre of
   his kingly office by our obedience. But such must know that our
   interest in Christ as a lord and king to rule us, does precede, if not
   also cause, our interest in him as a priest to save us. For the gospel
   perverts not the order of nature; the work must still go before the
   reward. And those shall never share in the benefit of Christ's
   sacrifice, who have not submitted to the rule of his sceptre.

   Now therefore, to sum this up into a firm conclusion, he, and he alone,
   is properly said to be Christ's, who, upon a sound knowledge of and a
   sincere obedience to Christ's will, stands justified and reconciled to
   God by the merit of his death and sufferings: and thus he is perfectly
   Christ's, who has an interest in him considered under every one of his
   offices. This may serve to overthrow the wild and irrational
   justification of the antinomians, libertines, and lazy solifidians, who
   upon this ground only judge themselves to be Christ's, because they
   believe they are: a way of justification, for its easiness, rather to
   be wished true than to be thought so. But easy things in religion are
   always suspicious, if not false; and such will find, that their belief
   is not the rule of God's proceeding.

   II. In the next place we are to see what is meant by the flesh, and the
   affections and lusts. By the first I suppose I need not tell you that
   it cannot be understood of the corporeal bulk of man, which together
   with the soul makes up the whole compound; but it is rather a metonymy
   of the part for the whole, or perhaps more properly, of the subject for
   the adjunct, the flesh for the sin adherent to the flesh, as shall be
   made out by and by. In the mean time by flesh we are to understand the
   whole entire body of sin and corruption, that inbred proneness in our
   nature to all evil, in one word expressed by concupiscence, usually
   called by the schoolmen fomes; that fuel, or combustible matter in the
   soul, that is apt to be fired by every temptation; the womb that
   conceives and brings forth all actual impurities, styled in the next
   words affections and lusts. By which we are not to understand only the
   brutish affections of carnal sensuality, but indifferently all the
   actual eruptions of that accursed principle, all the streams that issue
   from that impure fountain; for as by the flesh is denoted the original
   depraved disposition of the heart, so by the other is signified the
   drawing forth of that propensity or principle into the several
   commissions of sin through the course of our lives; flesh is the fuel,
   and lust the flame.

   Having thus given the explication of the words, and shewn what is to be
   understood by being Christ's, and what by the flesh and its affections,

   We shall lay the further prosecution of the text in these two things.

   I. To shew why this vitiosity and corrupt habit of nature comes to have
   this denomination of flesh.

   II. What is imported by the crucifying of it.

   For the first of these. The whole depravation of our nature comes to be
   called flesh for these reasons.

   1. Because of its situation and place, which is principally in the
   flesh. Here it is placed, here it is enthroned. Concupiscence, I shew,
   was the radix of all sin, and all the several kinds of sin, to which
   men are severally inclined, are only so many modifications or different
   postures of concupiscence; and concupiscence itself follows the crasis
   and temperature of the body; as we know the liquor for the present
   receives the figure of the vessel into which it is infused. If you
   would know why one man is proud, another cruel, another intemperate or
   luxurious, you are not to repair so much to Aristotle's Ethics, or the
   writings of other moralists, as to those of Galen, or of some
   anatomists, to find the reason of these different tempers; for
   doubtless they arise from the different quality of the blood and the
   motion of the spirits in those several persons; which things themselves
   depend upon the climate, diet, and air, in which men are born and bred.
   Hence we see that those of the same climate are usually disposed to the
   same sin. Whereupon some have presumed to set down the standing
   characters of several nations; as that the Grecians are false; the
   Spaniards formal, grave, and proud; the French wordy, fickle, and
   fantastic; the Italians lustful; and the English mutinous and insolent
   to governors. And these characters, if true, seem to agree to these
   several nations, not only for one age, but successively in all
   generations: as waters of a river running in the same channel always
   retain the same colour, taste, and breed the same sorts of fish. And it
   is not to be questioned, but that it was the same humour that raised
   the barons' wars, and since acted higher in the late rebellion. I do
   not believe a transmigration of souls, but surely there is something to
   be observed that looks very like a transmigration of tempers and
   manners; so constantly does posterity succeed into the humours,
   appetites, and ways of their progenitors.

   But let not any one gather from what has been said, that I place sin in
   the body only, not in the soul also: for in the body I place only the
   first seeds and occasions of it, which immediately, upon the sociation
   of the soul with the body, communicates and transfuses the contagion to
   that likewise; as we see in stills and alembics, though the fire put
   under, and the materials put within them, lie in the lower part, yet
   they send up a steam and exhalation, which settles into drops in the
   upper part: so all the perturbations of bodily affections, though they
   are seated in the body, which is the lower part, yet they continually
   exhale and breathe forth sinful vapours, that leave a guilt and an
   impurity upon the soul; yea, even upon the top and commanding
   faculties, the understanding and the will: though, to pursue that
   similitude a little further, as that which rises from the bottom of the
   still is but a vapour, and becomes not a drop till it settles upon the
   upper part of it, so that which comes from the body is but a bare
   disturbance, and comes not to the proper form and nature of a sin, till
   consented to and owned by the soul. From what has been laid down,
   Aristotle observes, that intemperance and luxury about things that
   affect the body and grosser senses leaves a kind of stupidity and
   sottishness upon the mind also; as the uppermost part of the chimney is
   blacked by the fire that burns below.

   How the body should affect the soul, that which is material work upon
   that which is immaterial, is, I confess, a problem hardly resolved in
   philosophy; but experience shews the truth of the thing by its apparent
   and undeniable effects: and reason itself will not prove that we ought
   to reject the thing, because we are ignorant of the manner, unless
   reason would prove also, that we might know every thing. But where
   philosophy seems to contradict a divine truth, there it is to be
   reputed vain, and we are to fetch the decision of the case from faith.

   Divines, in the matter of original sin, which upon good grounds we
   believe, though I suppose few can explain the way of its propagation;
   they (I say) acknowledge that the soul, which is by immediate creation
   infused by God into the body, comes pure, unspotted, and untainted with
   the least sin; but upon the union and conjunction of it with the body,
   it contracts a pollution, and so the whole man becomes presently
   sinful; as the purest water issuing from the fountain, when it slides
   into a dirty and a muddy kennel, it immediately loses its clearness and
   virginity, and becomes as filthy as the place in which it runs. This
   discovers that it is the body that first sullies and besmears the soul;
   here is the malum propter vicinum malum, this is the unhappy
   neighbourhood; for no sooner are they joined, no sooner are the body
   and the soul made brothers, but they are brethren in iniquity.

   Conformable to what has been said is the verdict of the holy scripture.
   Hear the exclamation of St. Paul, Rom. vii. 24, O wretched man that I
   am! who shall deliver me from this body of death? It was his body that
   wounded, that, as it were, stifled his soul: hence it cries out, as one
   sinking in a bog or quagmire, for immediate deliverance. This sociable
   evil, this treacherous companion, is the enticer and betrayer to all
   sin. Hence again Paul lays the stress and load of all upon this in the
   eighteenth verse of the same chapter, In me, that is, my flesh, (says
   he,) there dwelleth no good thing. He earned his prison about him, nay,
   his bane, his poison, had he not had an antidote from grace: it was a
   magazine for the weapons of unrighteousness, a full, endless,
   inexhaustible storehouse of all filth and corruption.

   This truth, that sin has its first situation and place in the flesh,
   and that from hence it borrows its name in common dialect of scripture,
   is yet further clear from this; that the most mortified and sanctified
   persons in the world cannot by any means wholly discharge themselves
   from the relicks of sin and concupiscence while they are yet in the
   body; as having soaked and insinuated itself into the very vital
   constitution of it: but immediately after they die, and the soul comes
   to be delivered from the body, we hold that the sanctification of it is
   then perfect and consummate; so that it sins no more, the very being,
   as well as the guilt of sin, is then destroyed; the soul is then
   sprightly, pure, and vigorous, like the spirit or quintessence of a
   liquor extracted from the dregs and the captivity of matter; or like a
   pleasant bird that is released from a nasty cage: the soul then finds
   its activity restored with its purity, and so mounts up to heaven,
   where it enjoys its Maker by a bright and a clear intuition, and
   converses with him for ever: and this is an evident demonstration that
   the vitiosity of our nature is first situate and fixed in the flesh.

   The papists indeed hold that the souls of the saints, at least of the
   plebeian and ordinary saints, are not immediately, upon the dissolution
   of the body, freed wholly from the being and inherency of sin, but are
   sent into a place called purgatory, where the fire is to calcine and
   purge off the dross of sin from the soul, before it can be fitted for
   the society of the blessed. But this is a fabulous and a gross conceit,
   and, were it not gainful, unworthy the patronage of any learned popish
   writer. For how can the fire burn the soul? and then how can it burn
   off sin? Do we think that sin sticks upon the soul like rust upon a
   piece of iron? But these things are so ridiculous and absurd, that to
   repeat them is to confute them.

   2. The vitiosity of our nature is called flesh, because of its close,
   inseparable nearness to the soul. There is an intimate conjunction and
   union between the soul and sin; and the intimacy of their coherence is
   the cause of the intimacy of their friendship. Sin is fixed in the
   heart, and therefore it lies in the bosom. Hence, to shew the
   individual estate and the indissoluble tie of matrimony, the Spirit
   takes a similitude from this, Matthew xix. 5, and says, They two shall
   be one flesh.

   The soul, while it is embodied, can no more be divided from sin, than
   the body itself can be considered without flesh. The nearness between
   these two, our soul and our corruption, is so great, that it arises to
   a kind of identity: hence to deny and conquer our sin is, in scripture
   language, to deny ourselves, implying that sin adheres so close to us,
   that it is a kind of second self.

   I do not say that the substance of the soul is evil, or that the being
   and nature of it is sinful; but that the stain of sin contracted by it
   clings so fast to it, that it is scarce to be fetched off. Blackness is
   not the substance of the ink, yet it is inseparable from it.

   See the nearness of sin to the soul, by observing the ways and means by
   which God endeavours to part them, and without which they cannot be
   divided. No less than the blood of the Son of God to wash off the stain
   of sin; no less than the Spirit of God to subdue the power; nothing but
   an infinite price, joined with an infinite power, can work the
   division. Hence the effectual sin-conquering force of the word is
   expressed by this dividing quality, Heb. iv. 12; It is quick and
   powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the
   dividing asunder of soul and spirit, of the joints and marrow. Is there
   any thing more closely united than the joint and the marrow? than the
   soul and the spirit? Yes, the soul and sin. Hereupon, the word being to
   disenthral the soul from it, must have the same effect upon it that the
   sword has upon the body, which is, by penetration and dividing the
   continuity of the parts; for every wound is properly division, an
   opening or loosening the compactness and closeness of the thing upon
   which the impression is made. Wherefore, if the great business of the
   word is to wound and divide the soul from sin, it follows, that they
   were once intimately and closely cemented together; the connection
   between these two is a Gordian knot, that cannot be dissolved but by
   this spiritual sword.

   We misapply the command of loving our neighbour, and misplace our
   affection; for sin is our nearest neighbour, and we love that most; it
   cleaves, it adheres, it sticks to us; but it is as the viper did to
   Paul's hand. And we may say of it as Christ did of Judas, He that
   betrays me is with me: sin is, as it were, engrafted into the soul, and
   thereby made connatural to it, and consequently as a stock upon which
   another scion is engrafted; the soul does not bring forth its own
   natural fruit, but the fruit of sin.

   They are mutually knit and entwined one within the other. Hence the
   power of remitting sins is in the gospel termed, Matth. xvi. 19, the
   power of loosing, as the contrary is of binding. Sin has bound itself
   as close upon the soul as the bonds or fetters that pinion and hold
   fast an imprisoned malefactor.

   The same union is yet further evident from the state of every
   unsanctified, unregenerate person in his death: at which great change,
   though he leaves his body, he retains his sin; that still keeps close
   to his side, and follows him into another world. A man's corruption, if
   dying in his sin, is to him like a bad servant or an unfaithful
   soldier; though it lives with him, yet it will be sure not to die with
   him. And this may be the second reason of this denomination.

   3. A third reason why the vitiosity of our nature is called flesh is,
   because of its dearness to us. And this founded upon the former, for
   vicinity is one cause of love. Now there is nothing that we prosecute
   with a more affectionate tenderness than our flesh; for as the apostle
   says, Ephes. v. 29, No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth
   and cherisheth it. How does the soul sympathize with it, either in its
   sufferings or its comforts! one would think that reason was even
   swallowed up in sense: how does every change of weather affect the
   mind! how sensible is it of every winter's blast, every summer's heat,
   of the sweetness of ease and the tortures of pain, as if, by conversing
   with the body, it even grew corporeal. If any the least member is hurt,
   what a general auxiliary, what a concurrent help is there from all the
   rest! the eye bewails, the tongue bemoans, and the hand plasters and
   foments it; and all this to rescue a base carcass from that which will
   one day certainly attach it, death and dissolution.

   But in the mean time the conscience may be wounded, the soul bruised
   and broke with the fatal blows of sin and temptation, and lie even
   gasping at the brink of eternal death, and yet we feel no pain there,
   neither seek for a remedy; it may faint and bleed, and we never ask
   whether there is any balm in Gilead, any spiritual surgeon to pour oil
   into our wounds. For see whether it is not the usual custom of men not
   to think of their souls till their body is given over; nor to send for
   the divine, till they are left by the physician; so dear is this flesh
   to us: for if it were not so, could we think the drunkard would ruin
   his soul to please his palate? would the unclean person pawn eternity
   for the gratification of a base appetite?

   Nay, take a survey of all the arts, the trades, and the most prized
   inventions in the world, and you will find ten to four found out and
   employed either to please or adorn the flesh: it is for this that the
   artificer labours, and the merchant ventures; and we compass sea and
   land ten times oftener to make a gallant, than to make a proselyte.
   Justly therefore upon this account also does the Spirit express our sin
   by the name of flesh, for this has an equal share in our love.

   Sin is our darling, our Delilah, the queen regent of our affections; it
   fills all our thoughts, engrosses our desires, and challenges the
   service of all our actions. Can there be any greater love than the love
   of a mother to her child? And we know the scripture tells us, that sin
   is conceived and brought forth by the soul, James i. 15. Doubt not
   therefore but it shall be cherished and beloved as a child; it is the
   firstborn of the soul, the beginning of its strength; but it is such a
   firstborn to it as Reuben was to Jacob; such an one as he had for ever
   cause to curse.

   I shall not stand to shew the excessive love that the miserable,
   bewitched soul of man bears to sin, much less shall I stand to prove
   it. Let it suffice us to observe, from the constant, uncessant
   practices of the world, that there is no cost, study, travail, and
   labour, either to preserve health, to defend life, or to endear
   friends, which is not with an abundant overplus of charge and expense
   freely and greedily laid out upon the satisfaction of sin, and that in
   its most tyrannical and unreasonable demands. What that man in Micah
   vi. 7 proffers for the expiation, many hundreds would give for the
   preservation of their sin; thousands of rams, and ten thousands of
   rivers oil, yea, the fruit of his body for the sin of his soul: so dear
   does sin usually cost men in this world, though much dearer in another.

   This is their paramour, they court it, they go a whoring after it, as
   the usual scripture expression is: they will not, though you fling the
   vengeance of God and the fire of hell in their faces, be plucked away,
   but, maugre all curses or promises, terrors or entreaties, they will
   even die in the fatal embraces of their dear but killing corruption:
   and as some will rather rot and perish, and be eat through with a
   gangrene or an ulcer, than undergo the painful cutting and lancing of
   their flesh, because they are delicate and tender of it; so the soul
   will, through the same tenderness to a cruel lust, see itself
   overgrown, infected, poisoned, and at length ruined by it, rather than
   remedy and remove it, by the healing severity of a thorough
   mortification. Let this therefore be the third and last reason why the
   Spirit has here set forth the pravity and corruption of our nature by
   the name of flesh.

   Now what has been hitherto discoursed of may, by way of inference,
   suggest these things to our consideration.

   1. The deplorable estate of fallen man; whose condition is now such,
   that he carries his plague about him, and wears it something nearer to
   him than his shirt; that he encloses a viper in his bowels, feeds and
   maintains, and is passionately fond of his mortal enemy; and, what is
   the greatest misery of all, has it not in his power to be otherwise; he
   has a body that is not so much the instrument, or servant, as the
   dungeon of his soul: and sin holds him by such bonds of pleasure, so
   strong, so suitable to his perverted and diseased inclinations, that
   his ruin is presented to him as his interest, and nothing gratifies,
   delights, or wins upon him, but that which dishonours his Maker, and
   certainly destroys himself.

   2. The next thing offered from hence to our thoughts is, the great
   difficulty of the duty of mortification: this is a greater work than
   men are aware of: it is indeed the killing of an enemy, but of such an
   enemy as a man thinks his friend, and loves as his child; and how hard
   it is to put the knife to the throat of an Isaac is easily imaginable.
   What! part with that that came into the world with me, and has ever
   since lived and conversed with me, that continually lies down and rises
   up with me, that has even incorporated itself into my nature, seized
   all my appetites, and possessed all my faculties, so that it is the
   centre and principle of all my pleasures, and that which gives a relish
   and a quickness to every object! This is an hard saying, and an harder
   undertaking. He must be a good orator that should persuade a man to
   stick daggers and needles in his flesh, to strip his bones, and in a
   manner to tear his nature over his ears; yet to mortify a sin is
   something like it: but alas! it would go near to nonplus the most
   artificial persuader, to bring a man to part with the covering of his
   body; but how much more with the vestment of his soul!

   Surely there is no love to God less than that which will induce a man
   to lay down his life for God, that can enforce him to mortify a
   corruption for him; and this, one would think, should awaken those who
   sacrifice to their own dreams, who spread themselves paths of roses to
   a fool's paradise, and design heaven upon those terms of easiness that
   the gospel knows not of: but it is an attempt that will cost many a
   smart blow, many a bitter rencounter, and many a passage through the
   fiery furnace, before the innate filth of our nature can be severed
   from us. And whatsoever measures a man may propose to himself, he will
   find, that to mortify a lust, and to be a Christian, is an harder work
   than now and then to lift up his eyes, to cry, Lord! Lord! or to hear
   an absolution, which perhaps does not at all belong to him.

   3. In the third and last place, this declares to us the mean and sordid
   employment of every sinner: he serves the flesh, that is, he is a
   drudge and a scavenger to the most inferior part of his nature. It is a
   low and an unmanly thing for any person to be laborious and solicitous,
   and to spend much time in dressing and adorning his body; it shews him
   to be a fop, a trifle, and a mere picture: but then how much more
   ignoble must it be to attend upon his body, in the dishonourable
   provisions for the lusts and corruptions of it!

   If it be a preferment to handle sores and ulcers, to converse with
   diseases, and all the filth of a distempered body, then may it pass for
   a generous employment, to be sedulous in obeying the dictates of sin
   and the commands of the flesh; but as the service of God is perfect
   freedom, so the service of the flesh is perfect, entire, complete
   slavery.

   II. I proceed now to the second general thing proposed for the handling
   of the words, and that is, to shew what is imported by the crucifixion
   of the flesh; under which I shall do these things.

   1. I shall shew what is the reason of the use of it in this place.

   2. What is the full force, sense, and significance of it.

   3. Prescribe some means for enabling us to the duty signified by it.

   4. Make some useful corollaries and deductions from the whole.

   1. For the first of these: this word is here used by way of allusion to
   Christ, of whose behaviour and sufferings every Christian is to be a
   living copy and representation. Christ will have his death an example
   to excite, as well as a sacrifice to save: and there is no passage in
   his life and death but is intended for our instruction, as well as our
   salvation. Upon this score we are bid to put on Christ, as a garment,
   Rom. xiii. 14. For as in a garment there is an apposite fitness and
   commensuration of each part of that to every part of the body; so there
   is nothing in the whole series of Christ's life and death, but ought in
   some measure to be answered and transcribed by every believer; as
   affording to us for every action not only a pattern, but a motive.

   We read of Christ's nativity: here every Christian is to turn an
   history into a precept, and read in himself the necessity of a new
   birth. We find the passion and the crucifixion of Christ for sin: now
   what can this better suggest to us, than the crucifying sin, the cause
   of his crucifixion? We read and admire his resurrection from the dead:
   certainly this might infer in us a spiritual resurrection from the
   death of sin and the grave, and stench of corruption.

   Nay, if we have that Christian dexterity and skill of a proper
   application of these passages, we shall find a correspondent,
   homogeneous quality derived from each. We shall die with him, and we
   shall rise with him: we shall find something in his cross that shall
   kill our sins; something in his resurrection that shall revive our
   graces: for if we transfer and place it even upon a natural cause, what
   is it else, but for the body to sympathize with the head?

   The Socinians indeed place the whole business of our redemption upon a
   bare imitation; and the truth is, to say no more, (if you will admit
   the expression,) they do indeed make Christ an example, and that in a
   much more ignominious way than the Jews did. But now though they place
   the whole redemption wrought by Christ in a bare following and
   expressing his example, let not us therefore transgress into the other
   extreme, and totally exclude this imitation; for undoubtedly Christ in
   all his sufferings left us a pattern, as well as paid a price.

   There is none that seems to have so evangelical and raised a notion of
   this, as the apostle Paul in Galat. ii. 20, I am crucified with Christ,
   nevertheless I live. Paul seems to be recovered to his spiritual life,
   as the youth upon whom Elisha stretched himself. The prophet put his
   face to the other's face, his eyes, his mouth, his hands, to the eyes,
   mouth, and hands of the other; and so, by an adequate application of
   his body to each part, he brought him at length to enjoy the same life
   with himself.

   Thus Paul as it were stretched himself upon the same cross with Christ,
   and by exactly conforming to his sufferings and death, was advanced to
   the similitude of his life. Hence it is said, 2 Tim. ii. 12, If we
   suffer with him, we shall also reign with him. And Paul, in that
   excellent discourse, Phil, iii. 10, vents an heavenly passionate
   desire, that he might know the power of Christ's resurrection and the
   fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death. And
   thus to endeavour to be like Christ is a laudable, nay, a dutiful
   ambition; it is our sin to worship, but our duty to be his picture: for
   doubtless every Christian is obliged not only to obey, but also to
   represent his Saviour.

   Certainly Paul, in Galat. vi. 14, where he says, that he is crucified
   to the world, and tells the believing Romans, in Rom. vi. 6, that their
   old man is crucified with Christ, could have expressed the same thing
   by other words sufficiently significant, as, that he was mortified, and
   his worldly desires extinguished, and that their corruptions were
   abated, weakened, and subdued; but he rather says crucified. The other,
   indeed, would have expressed his purity, but this, by a peculiar
   significance imports his Christianity, as not only declaring an
   excellent life, but also the example that caused it. It is like fair
   writing, with the copy prefixed and set above it. The business of a
   Christian is not invention, but imitation: and because he is too
   ignorant to prescribe to himself, all his perfection is to follow, and
   Christ gives every Christian this comprehensive, summary compendium of
   his duty, Let him take up his cross and follow me. And if we would
   abridge all religion into this short dichotomy, the sum of our belief
   is Christ, and of our obedience conformity.

   Having thus shewn the reason of the use of the word here, I proceed now
   to the second thing, which is,

   2. To shew the full force and significance of it.

   Crucifying therefore, as it is here applied to the corruption and
   depraved sinful disposition of our nature, imports these four things:

   (1.) The death of it. The cross is the instrument of death, and to
   crucify is to kill. A few interrupted assaults and combats with a man's
   corruption will not suffice; he may give it some blows, and wounds, and
   bruises, but after all these it may recover; and we know the seed of
   the woman was not only to bruise, but to break the serpent's head.

   He that will crucify his sin must pursue it to the very death. Many,
   after they have been something humbled for their sin, and for a while
   have used the means of mortification, so as to terrify it from a
   present acting, and have took off something of the edge of its fury,
   conclude that the day is won, and the enemy routed, when by sad
   experience they find at length that it is but a retreat, and the return
   is more furious and dangerous than ever. An enemy is never overcome
   till he is killed; and those only act like wise men who think so.

   We are to crucify our corruptions, as the Jews did Christ; the
   whippings, scourgings, and buffetings were but the forerunners and
   beginnings of the grand suffering that was intended. It was his life
   and his blood that they thirsted after. Now it is but for a man to
   change the scene, and act the same upon his own corruption. Sin stands
   as a malefactor condemned to death by the law of God; and God has
   intrusted every man with the execution of his own sin; and God will
   require life for life; so that if a man lets his sin escape alive, the
   life of his soul must be its ransom.

   There is nothing that betrays and ruins men, as to the great concerns
   of their eternal happiness, so much as half and imperfect
   mortifications of their sin, but supposed to be perfect and complete:
   for they give sin rather a respite than a ruin; a time of breathing and
   of re-collecting its strength, and a more prevailing insinuation upon
   the heart, upon the vicissitude and the return: so that a man is
   strangely baffled and set backwards in the main work of repentance,
   while he sees all his endeavours unravelled, and his sin grow upon him
   afresh, like weeds only cropt and cut, whereas they should have been
   rooted up.

   If a man thinks that he has given a shrewd blow to his lust, let him
   know that this is an argument for him to pursue his advantage, and to
   redouble his strokes upon it, to a perfect conquest, rather than to
   acquiesce, as if he had achieved something sufficient to acquit himself
   in the combat. The utmost cruelty to an inveterate enemy is always
   successful, if sufficiently powerful; but if a man shall content
   himself to have given such an adversary a scratch on the hand, when he
   might and should have stabbed him to the heart, let him thank himself,
   if in the issue he fall by a recovered fury, and dies by that strength
   that he spared to his own ruin.

   Wherefore when we are thus commanded to crucify the flesh, let every
   one understand the full latitude of this precept; and remember that he
   is charged to kill his corruption. God's hatred is directed to the life
   and being of sin; and for a man to spare that, is to be absurdly cruel
   to his own soul. To strike it, to war against it, without designing its
   death, is but hypocrisy. A Saul may captivate and imprison an Agag, but
   a pious Samuel will slay him.

   (2.) As it implies death, so it further imports a violent death. Sin
   never dies of age. It is as when a young man dies in the full fire and
   strength of his youth by some vehement distemper; it as it were tears
   and forces and fires his soul out of his body. He that will come and
   fight it out with his corruption to the last, shall find, that it will
   sell its life at a dear rate; it will strive and fight for it, and many
   a doubtful conflict will pass between that and the soul. It may give a
   man many a wound, many a foil, and many a disheartening blow: for,
   believe it, the strong man will fight for his possession.

   Never think to dispossess him by a bare summons, or imagine that a man
   can recover the mastery of his heart and his affections by a few
   prayers and broken humiliations. No, such a mortifying course must be
   taken, and such constant violences and severities used, as shall try
   and shake every power of the soul, before a corruption can be
   despatched. The conquest had need be glorious, for it will be found, by
   sharp experience, that the combat will be dangerous.

   The soul is engaged with such an enemy as will require both the onsets
   of force and the stratagems of art. Sin will never quit its hold
   quietly; but, like the Devil, who if we hear is conjured down, it is
   always in a storm. That man that allows himself in his sin, and humours
   his corruption, let him consider, that if God ever intend to save him
   from it, what it will cost him to conquer it; kill it he must, but then
   it will not be killed like a lamb, which resists not the knife, but
   like a wolf or a wild boar; he must run it down and conquer it, before
   he can kill it; and though God do give him the grace to conquer it in
   the issue, yet he must go the hazard and the dubious adventure of being
   conquered himself. When a man is put to effect any thing with violence,
   it is troublesome to him that does, as well as grievous to him that
   suffers it. This therefore is the second thing implied in the
   crucifixion of sin, to despatch it by a violent death.

   (3.) To crucify the flesh with the affections of it imports a painful,
   bitter, and vexatious death. Let us but reflect upon our Saviour: he
   was nailed to the tree, and that through those parts which were most
   apprehensive of pain, the hands and the feet; which members, by reason
   of the concurrence of the nerves and sinews there, must needs be of
   quickest sense: thus he hung, in the extremity of torture, till,
   through the unsupportable pressures of pain, he at length gave up the
   ghost.

   Now we are still to take the former observation along with us, that the
   occasion of the use of this expression here is an allusion to Christ's
   crucifixion: so that the crucifying the flesh must express the pain
   also, or the resemblance would not be perfect. This supposed, it would
   be well that such as are quick and forward to profess the name and
   undertake the rigour of a Christian course, would first sit down and
   calculate and ponder the difficulties, the hard, grating, and
   afflicting contrariety that it bears to the flesh. They are to live as
   upon the rack; to hear the cries of a tormented, dying corruption,
   without relenting; when our greatest desires thirst and beg for
   satisfaction, they are to be answered only with renewed exercises of
   mortification; when we have got them upon the cross, we are to treat
   them as the Jews did Christ; when they thirst and call out for their
   former pleasures, to give them the vinegar and the gall of sharper and
   sharper severities. The cravings of our dearest and most beloved
   affections are to be denied; and what a torment is it when desire is
   upon the career, to separate between the enjoyment and the appetite! It
   is like rending the skin from the flesh, or the flesh from the bone:
   yet this is to be done; nor are we to be surprised with wonder at it;
   for certainly no man was ever crucified without pain.

   The punishment of the cross is of all others the quickest and the most
   acute; it is the universal stretching of all the limbs from the joints,
   so universal, that there is not the least part, sinew, or fibre in the
   body, but it is distended. So the mortification of sin is to be so
   general and diffused, as not only to fix upon the bulk and body of sin,
   but to stretch the inquisition to every the least desire, the most
   lurking and secret affection; for assuredly there is something more
   than ordinary implied in this expression of crucifying sin: it cannot
   but import the most rugged, cruel, and remorseless dealing with it that
   is imaginable. And however men are nice and favourable to their
   corruption, yet did they consider what endless pains, what unspeakable
   torments, their corrupt affections and lusts prepare for them, even
   self-love could not but be religion enough to make them prevent such
   miseries, by first inflicting them upon the author.

   Every man should remember, that for all his indulgence to sin, sin will
   not spare him; even that corruption that lies in his bosom will
   prosecute him, and cry out for justice against him at the judgment of
   the great day. Besides, why should we grudge at the painfulness of this
   duty, when it is confessed, that every wound given to sin cannot but
   pain the sinner; but then if we consider withal, that God has decreed
   to pardon and save none, without giving them some taste of the smart
   and bitter fruit of sin, we have cause to adore his mercy in this, that
   the pain we take in mortifying sin, will be the only pain that we shall
   ever endure for it.

   (4.) In the fourth and last place, crucifixion denotes a shameful and a
   cursed death; it is such an one as was marked out and signalized with a
   peculiar malediction, even of old, by God himself, Deut. xxi. 23, He
   that is hanged on a tree is accursed of God; and for the shame of it,
   it is so great amongst all nations, that the infamy were a sufficient
   punishment, without the pain: so that the Romans used it to slaves
   only, and the vilest malefactors. Hence, in Heb. vi. 6, such apostates
   as are said by their unworthy behaviour to crucify Christ, are said
   also to put him to an open shame.

   Thus therefore must the corruption and vitiosity of our nature be dealt
   with. God has doomed it to death, without the benefit of so much as
   dying honourably. If there be any scorn, loathing, and detestation due
   to a dying offender, certainly it is much more due to the sin that made
   him so. Hereupon God has provided one great instrument for the
   mortifying of sin, which is the irksome shame of confession: I do not
   mean the auricular, pickpocket confession of the papists, but public
   confession, such an one as David exercised, when he confessed his sins
   before the whole congregation; and such an one as the primitive
   Christian church required of scandalous excommunicate persons, before
   they were readmitted into its communion. And indeed if we consider the
   temper of man's mind, confession is of all other penalties the most
   shameful; shameful I mean to sin, though glorious to the confessing
   sinner.

   Hence also humiliation for sin is expressed by taking shame to
   ourselves. And certainly if shame is not judicially awarded as the
   punishment, it will naturally follow as the fruit and effect of sin.
   See all the cursed deaths, the confusion and consternation that attends
   malefactors: it is all to be ascribed to this cursed cause, that they
   would not shame their sin, and therefore their sin has now shamed and
   confounded them. Considering therefore how sin has stained the beauty
   of our nature, and covered it with the shames and dishonours of
   corruption, whatsoever we do or can inflict upon it of this kind, it is
   not so much a punishment from the law of God, as a proper retaliation
   from ourselves.

   Having thus shewn what is imported by the crucifying of sin, I proceed
   now to the third thing proposed.

   3. Which is, to prescribe some means for the enabling of us to the
   performance of this duty. Two therefore I shall mention as conducible
   to this crucifixion of the flesh, with its affections and lusts.

   (1.) The first is a constant and pertinacious denying them in all their
   cravings for satisfaction. A man by fasting too long may come to lose
   his stomach; so an affection abridged and tied up from its proper
   gratification comes by degrees to be chastised and even wearied into
   sobriety; for frequent disappointments in a thing eagerly desired will
   at length leave a kind of indifference in the desires as to that thing.
   As on the contrary, every gratification of a corrupt appetite
   exasperates, calls forth, and enlarges it to new, and greater, and more
   restless expectations.

   Let a man therefore begin the crucifixion of his flesh in these
   negative mortifications; that is, when his voluptuous humour is
   clamorous for pleasure, let him not answer any of those calls: if he
   would not maintain it, let him not feed it: he will find that so much
   as it wants of food, it will lose of its fierceness. This is the course
   taken for the taming of wild beasts, to reduce and order them by the
   disciplines of hunger, by long and frequent frustrations of their
   ravenous appetites.

   And the reason of this course is founded in a natural cause. For though
   the design of every appetite is to purvey for nature, and to derive
   strength to that by receiving such and such objects; yet by the same
   means it first feeds and strengthens itself. It being like some
   collectors of public monies, who indeed are employed and intended to
   serve the exchequer, but yet in the mean time use to be very kind to
   themselves. In a word, the defraudation of the appetites of sin weakens
   the whole body of sin and themselves also; as on the other side all
   satisfaction corroborates and inflames them.

   And he that takes up a resolution to crucify his intemperance, luxury,
   or uncleanness, yet when they call for their usual refection, and a
   fair occasion knocks at his door, or his companions call upon him, has
   no power to deny either the entreaty of his appetite within, or to
   slight the invitation of tempting objects from without, he may as well
   expect to tame a wolf by feeding him, or to extinguish a flame by
   heaping fuel upon it, as to mortify a sin upon these terms. His attempt
   is absurd, his success desperate, and his lust must and will prevail.

   2. The other means to crucify a corrupt affection, is to encounter it
   by actions of the opposite virtue. This differs from the former thus:
   that that was only the denying of fuel to a fire, but this a pouring
   water upon it, and so vanquishing it by the prevalence of a contrary
   element. He that is profane, let him subdue his profaneness by the
   exercise of prayer and meditation. He that is covetous, let him
   dispossess his mind of that vice by actions of charity and liberality:
   for as vicious actions frequently repeated produce a vicious habit,
   that infects and ferments the whole soul; so the like frequent
   repetition of virtuous actions does by degrees loosen, and at length
   totally unfix and drive out that habit of vice. Now this is both the
   nobler and the speedier way of conquest: as it is more glorious to
   break open than to starve a city, and to take it by force than by
   surrender. Both indeed are equally conquests, but the latter is the
   greater triumph.

   And thus much for the means by which we may be enabled to crucify the
   flesh with the affections and lusts.

   4. Come we now to the fourth and last thing, viz. To see what may be
   drawn by way of consequence and deduction from what has hitherto been
   delivered.

   (1.) First of all then we collect the high concernment and the absolute
   necessity of every man's crucifying his carnal, worldly affections. I
   know no work so difficult and unpleasing, but its necessity is an
   abundant argument to enforce it. And I suppose every one will grant,
   that it is necessary for him to be a Christian: yet unless he has
   crucified the flesh he cannot be so, and his assuming that title is
   only a nullity and an usurpation.

   Upon this small hinge therefore turns the grand determination of our
   eternal estate, whether as to happiness or misery. The whole round of
   man's happiness, from the first dawnings of it in the revelations of
   grace, to the last consummation of it in glory, runs solely and
   entirely upon this. Without this, not so much as the blessing of word
   and sacraments, but it is poisoned with a curse. For first, he that
   comes to Christ's table who is not Christ's, is in God's esteem only as
   a dog catching at the children's bread. He that prays to Christ, and
   yet is not Christ's, is but as a rebel presenting a petition; if he
   intrudes into the participation of ordinances, and the society of the
   saints, he is a guest without either invitation or wedding garment,
   where his best entertainment will be the imprisonment of a malefactor,
   instead of the welcome of a guest. On the other hand, take all the
   solid happiness of this life, and the hopes of a better, the privileges
   of the sanctified, and the eternal fruitions of the glorified, and they
   are all compendiously but fully couched in this one word, to be
   Christ's.

   (2.) In the next place, we gather a standing and infallible criterion,
   by which to distinguish those that are not Christ's from those that
   are, and consequently to convince us how few Christians there are in
   the world; or, to speak more closely, how few Christians there are in
   Christendom; and that the common use and acceptation of this word is
   much larger than its real signification. Much the greater number and
   proportion of men lie wallowing in all the filth and the pollutions of
   the flesh. But I suppose the precedent discourse has been a sufficient
   demonstration, that he and he alone has a right to this glorious
   appellative of a Christian, and to the privileges that attend it, who
   has mastered his depraved nature, cashiered his corrupt inclinations,
   and offered violence to his dearest, when sinful affections; so that he
   overcomes and triumphs, and sees his sin bleeding at his feet. In sum,
   he only is Christ's who has executed the utmost of that pious cruelty
   upon his sin, that we have seen hitherto imported by crucifixion.

   But it will be replied, that this is an hard and a discouraging
   assertion, that none should be reputed Christ's, unless he has fully
   crucified and destroyed his sin.

   But to this I answer, that we must here distinguish of a twofold
   destruction of sin, 1. In respect of a total abolition: thus every one
   that is Christ's must have destroyed his sin in design and purpose;
   this he must intend, whatsoever God enables him to effect; this must be
   aimed at, whatsoever is reached. 2. In respect of a sincere, though
   imperfect indication: and thus every one must actually destroy his sin;
   that is, he must actually begin and be about the work. Where we may
   observe, that this is properly, nay, with an emphatical significance,
   implied by crucifixion; for a man is not dead as soon as crucified. We
   know our Saviour and the two thieves hung some hours upon the cross
   before they breathed their last: so sin, though it is not immediately
   dead, yet it is truly crucified if it is a dying. It may struggle for
   life, indeed, yet for all that it may be under the pangs and power of
   death.

   But to shew what is the least degree of the crucifixion of sin
   indispensably required to entitle a man to this transcendent privilege
   of being Christ's, I shall lay down this position, viz. that he in a
   true evangelical sense is to be reputed Christ's, who has crucified his
   sin, as to an active resolution against it; I say active resolution;
   where this term active does not illustrate, but imply the nature of it.
   There is a kind of identity in these terms active resolution, as when
   we say, a rational man, where the predicate does not describe, but
   include the subject.

   Which, by the way, is a sure, unfailing rule for men to try the
   sincerity of their resolutions by. Many are prone to think, that they
   are resolved against sin, when indeed they only deceive and abuse
   themselves, and are not so: for that is no resolution that is not
   seconded with vigorous, suitable endeavours: if it is not active, it is
   not so much as resolution. But he that pursues, and backs, and follows
   home purpose with endeavour, resolution with action, he has given his
   corruption its deathblow; he has crucified it; and if he does not
   intermit this course, he shall see his victory completed in the death
   of his adversary. And thus I affirm, that the crucifixion of sin
   realized in a sincere though partial mortification of it, makes a man a
   believer, instates him in grace, entitles him to glory, and, in a word,
   renders him truly Christ's.

   And indeed, if this does not, we may conclude, according to that of our
   Saviour, though in a different sense, when the Son of man comes will he
   find faith upon the earth? For if this be rejected as no sufficient
   condition to interest a man in the merits of Christ's death, and the
   redemption he has purchased, as God indeed has limited the number of
   saints to very few, so I am afraid that upon these terms we shall
   reduce it almost to none, and make the passage to heaven yet narrower
   than ever God made it; who, even in the midst of a sinner's
   condemnation, is the God that delights to save, and not to condemn.

   To which God be rendered and ascribed, &c.

SERMON LIV.

  HABAKKUK ii. 12.

   Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood.

   THIS short prophecy, out of which I have selected this portion of
   scripture to discourse of upon this sad and solemn occasion, was
   uttered (as interpreters do conjecture, for know it certainly they
   cannot) about the latter end of the reign of king Josiah, or at least
   in the following reign of his son, but however some time before the
   Babylonish captivity, that being the great event which it foretells,
   and the chief subject of which it treats.

   The whole prophecy contains in it these two parts: 1st, A double
   complaint made by the prophet: 2dly, A double answer returned to it by
   God.

   1. And first for the complaint. The prophet cries out of the horrid
   impiety, the great perfidiousness, and general corruption of the Jewish
   nation, then grown to that height, that he was forced to invoke the
   justice of heaven against them, as being too strong for all human
   control, too big for reproof, and fit only to upbraid the means of
   grace by their incorrigible impenitence under them.

   This loud and grievous complaint of his prophet, God answers with the
   denunciation of a severe judgment against the persons complained of, by
   bringing in upon them an army of the Chaldeans, that hasty and bitter
   nation, as they are styled in the sixth verse of the first chapter,
   persons that should act all the insolences upon them, that victory in
   conjunction with ill-nature could prompt them to: men whose hearts were
   flint, and their bowels brass; who knew not what it was to pity or
   relent, but were utter strangers to humanity, and uncapable of shewing
   compassion: but upon all these accounts so much the fitter to be
   instrumental to the divine vengeance, now enflamed against them, and to
   surpass, if possible, the severity of the sentence by the fierceness of
   the execution.

   Which dreadful answer of God is so far from satisfying the prophet's
   complaint, that it only exasperates his grief, and provokes him to
   another, in which he expostulates with God the method of this his
   judgment, that he should punish the wickedness of his people by persons
   so much viler and wickeder than themselves; that vice should be
   employed to punish sin, and that his church should be chastised, and,
   if you will, reformed by persons notable for nothing but blood and
   rapine, luxury and idolatry.

   To this complaint also God is pleased to rejoin, and to clear the
   justice, equity, and reason of his proceeding, by shewing that it was
   not to be rated by the qualification of the instruments made use of in
   it; which instruments he would be sure to account with when they had
   done his work; and that, as he designed his people for the rod, so he
   designed the rod itself for the fire. He assures his prophet, and with
   him all pious and humble persons, who could lift their faith above
   their sense, that as Nebuchadnezzar and his army were not for any worth
   or piety in themselves suffered to captivate and trample upon God's
   people, and to make havock of and vent their rage against the church;
   so that they themselves should infallibly have their turns in the
   course and circulation of divine justice, and be strictly reckoned with
   for their intolerable pride, their insatiable avarice, and their
   unhuman and remorseless cruelty, shewn in the spoil and waste they had
   made upon all nations round about them for the propagation of their
   empire, which they were still enlarging as their desires, and their
   desires as hell, as it is expressed in the fifth verse of the second
   chapter: for all this, I say, the prophet is assured that these
   victorious sons of Belial should pay severely, when God should think
   fit to rebuild Jerusalem upon the ruins of Babylon; and to convince the
   proud and the cruel, that he neither loves nor values his scourge,
   though he is sometimes constrained to use it.

   The words of the text contain in them a woe or curse, denounced
   personally and directly against the great head of the Chaldean empire
   Nebuchadnezzar, but by consequence against the whole empire itself. The
   curse is both for the ground, object, and measures of it considerable:
   and therefore I shall cast the prosecution of the words into these five
   particulars.

   I. I shall shew the ground or cause of this curse, which the text
   declares to be, that justly abhorred sin of blood-guiltiness.

   II. I shall shew the condition of the person against whom this curse
   was denounced. He was such an one as had actually set up and
   established a government by blood.

   III. I shall shew the latitude and extent of the curse, and what is
   comprehended in it.

   IV. I shall shew the reasons why a curse or woe is so peculiarly
   denounced against this sin.

   V. And lastly, I shall apply all briefly to the present sad occasion.

   I. And first for the ground and cause of the curse here denounced,
   which was the crying, crimson sin of bloodshed; a sin, in the hatred
   and detestation of which heaven and earth seem to strive for the
   mastery. The first great disturbance in the world after the fall of man
   was by a murderer; whom the vengeance of God pursued to that degree,
   that he professed that his punishment was greater than he could bear,
   though he himself could not say, that it was greater than he had
   deserved. Accordingly in all succeeding generations it has still been
   the care of Providence, both by civil and religious means, to
   extinguish all principles of savageness in the minds of men, and to
   make friendship and tenderness over men's lives a great part of
   religion. But by nothing has this been so highly endeavoured, as by the
   rules and constitution of Christianity, the last and noblest revelation
   that God has made of his mind and will to the sons of men. In which all
   acts of fierceness, violence, and barbarity, are so strictly provided
   against, that there are few injuries in which patience and sufferance
   are not recommended instead of the most just and reasonable pretensions
   to revenge: nay, and so very tender is it of men's lives, that it
   secures them against the very first approaches and preparations to
   murder, by dashing even angry thoughts, and denouncing damnation to
   vilifying, provoking words: so that we have both law and gospel equally
   rising up against this monstrous sin: and the sentence of both
   confirmed by the eternal voice of reason speaking in the law of
   nations: and so all passing this concurrent judgment, that whosoever
   sheds man's blood, ought by man to have his blood shed. A judgment made
   up of all the justice and equity that it is possible for reason and
   religion to infuse into a law.

   But now the execution of this law being upon no grounds of reason to be
   committed to every private hand, God has found it necessary to deposit
   it only in the hands of his vicegerents, whom he intrusts and deputes
   as his lieutenants in the government and protection of the several
   societies of mankind; and so both to ennoble and guard their sceptres,
   by appropriating to the same hands the use of the sword of justice too.
   From which it follows, that the law has not the same aspect upon
   sovereign princes, that it has upon the rest of men; nor that the sword
   can, by any mortal power, be authorized against the life of him to whom
   the sole use of it is by divine right ascribed. Upon which account, if
   it so fall out that a prince invades either the estate or life of a
   subject, that law, that draws the sword of justice upon the life of any
   private person doing the same things, has no power or efficacy at all
   to do the same execution upon the supreme magistrate, whose supremacy,
   allowing him neither equal nor superior, renders all legal acts of
   punishment or coercion upon him (the nature of which is still to
   descend) utterly impossible.

   But what! does God then approve, or at least connive at those wicked
   actions in princes, that he so severely takes revenge of in others? No,
   certainly, the guilt is the same in both, and under an equal abhorrence
   with God, and shall equally be accounted for; but the difference is
   this, that while God punishes inferior malefactors by the hands of
   princes, he takes the punishment of princes wholly into his own: and
   surely no guilty person is like to speed at all the better for having
   his cause brought before him who has an infinite wisdom to search into,
   and an infinite power to revenge his guilt. It is God's prerogative to
   be the sole judge of princes, and heaven only is that high court of
   justice, where kings can be legally arraigned, tried, and condemned.
   God has woes enough in store to humble the highest and the proudest
   tyrant, without needing the assistance of any of his rebel subjects;
   and therefore such courses for the curbing or pulling down of princes
   is neither the cause of God nor the defence of religion, but the
   doctrine of devils, and the dictates of that which in the judgment of
   God himself is worse than witchcraft. For be a king never so savage,
   bloody, or unjust, he is, under all these respects, to be looked upon
   as a plague or a punishment sent by God upon the people, whose duty I
   am sure is to submit, be the punishment what it will. And however, that
   nation is like to find but a strange recovery, be its distemper what it
   will, if its cure must be a rebellion.

   II. The second thing to be considered is, the condition of the person
   against whom this woe or curse is denounced. He was such an one as had
   actually established a government and built a city with blood. We know
   that as soon as Cain had murdered his brother, he presently betook
   himself to the building of a city. And so indeed it falls out, that
   bloodiness has usually a connection with building, and that upon some
   ground of reason: forasmuch as men, by shedding of blood, are enabled
   to build cities, and set up governments; and then because such cities
   being once built, and governments set up, do secure the shedders of
   blood from the vengeance due to their sin. The person here spoken of I
   am sure eminently served his turn by his cruelty and bloodiness in both
   these respects, as having thereby reared, or at least hugely augmented
   the most magnificent city that ever was; even Babylon, the stupendous
   metropolis of the eastern monarchy, then the governess of the world: a
   city so strong and great, that it might well promise its builder
   sufficient defence against any mortal power, that should presume to
   call him to account for any of those slaughters and depredations, by
   which he had been enabled thus to build it. So that it is not for
   nothing, that the prophet here expresses the whole Chaldean monarchy by
   this city, which was of such incredible strength, glory, and vast
   dimensions, that it might well pass for one of the wonders of the
   world, and render it almost doubtful whether Babylon should be
   accounted in the Chaldean empire, or the Chaldean empire be said to be
   in Babylon. The account the world has had of the Assyrian monarchy, the
   first and greatest of all the four, is indeed but small and imperfect;
   but so far as the scattered fragments of antiquity have been able to
   inform us, we may guess at the unparalleled greatness of the structure
   by the magnificence of its remains. For if we consider the spaciousness
   of this city of Babylon, it is reported to have been about four hundred
   and fifty-eight of our English miles in circuit: yea, so exceeding wide
   and ample was it, that three days after it was taken, one part of the
   city knew nothing of what had befallen the other. The wall that
   encompassed it was two hundred cubits high, and so thick withal, that
   two coaches might meet upon the breadth of it. It opened itself at an
   hundred gates, and those all of brass; which whole wall was the work of
   Nebuchadnezzar, though falsely ascribed to Semiramis. Add to all this,
   the horti pensiles, art's miraculous emulation of nature, that is, vast
   gardens and woods planted upon the battlements of towers, and bearing
   trees fifty foot in height: such prodigious instances of the grandeur
   of this city have the most authentic historians, both Greek and Latin,
   transmitted to us. So that Nebuchadnezzar might well vaunt himself upon
   the survey of such a mighty structure, as, in Daniel iv. 29, 30, we
   find that he does to some purpose; where we have him walking in the
   palace of his kingdom, and thus braving it to himself: Is not this
   great Babylon, that I have built for the house of my kingdom, and by
   the might of my power? Words that sufficiently declare the speaker of
   them to have little regarded either God or man. And surely while he
   uttered them, he thought himself in a condition rather to rival and
   defy heaven, than to fear it, and far above the reach of all woes or
   curses.

   But when God shall send a curse, it shall go with a vengeance, and make
   its way into the very heart of Babylon, climb its high walls, and break
   through its brass gates, and drive the tyrant with these very words in
   his mouth from his throne and all his imperial glories, to herd it with
   the beasts of the field, till a better mind should fit him for a better
   condition. For it is worth our observing, that God takes a peculiar
   delight to surprise and seize upon a great guilt in the height of its
   pride and bravery, and in the very midst of all its strengths and
   presumed securities. He delights to commission his curse to arrest a
   bloody Ahab, just as he is going to take possession of the price of
   blood, and to dash out the brains of a murderous Abimelech in the very
   head of his army. These are the triumphs of judgment, and the glorious
   trophies of blood-revenging justice.

   III. The third thing proposed was, to shew the latitude and extent of
   this woe or curse, and what is comprehended in it. Concerning which,
   there is no doubt but it includes the miseries of both worlds, present
   and future. And if we go no further than the present, it is grievous
   enough, and made up of these following ingredients.

   1. That it fastens a general hatred and detestation upon such men's
   persons. For cruelty and bloodiness, armed with power, is the proper
   motive and the dreadful object of men's fears; and fear and hatred
   usually keep company; it being very hard, if not impossible, to assign
   that person, who has not the same share and proportion in men's hatred,
   that he has in their fears. Every man flies from such an one, as from a
   public ruin or a walking calamity, who, which way soever he turns
   himself, both looks and brings certain desolation. He converses amongst
   the living as an enemy to men's lives; as a sword or a dagger, which
   the nearer it comes, the more dangerous it is.

   Cruelty alarms and calls up all the passions of human nature, and puts
   them into a posture of hostility and defiance. Every heart swells
   against a tyrant, as against a common enemy of mankind, and blood rises
   at the sight of blood; and certainly it is none of the least of
   miseries for a man to be justly hated; for though it be tied up and
   restrained from its utmost effects, yet the very breathings of it are
   malignant, the silent grudgings and glances of it ominous and fatal. A
   great part of the happiness of this life is, to enjoy a free and
   amicable converse with such as live about us; and therefore an
   ingenuous nature cannot but account it a real plague, to see a cloud in
   every countenance he beholds; to observe the black and lowering aspects
   of a reserved malice, and, as it were, to read his doom in every face,
   and to gather his fortune from another's forehead.

   Who so hated as Cain, Nebuchadnezzar, Saul, Herod, and such other
   bloodsuckers? All the glory of their power and magnificence was
   smothered in the hatred of their cruelty, deriving a just hatred upon
   their persons: for it is the concernment of mankind, and of humanity
   itself, to abhor such destroyers. He that shews the power he has over
   men's lives only by taking them away, must not think to command or
   reign over their affections.

   Neither is this hatred without an equal scorn; for the same temper that
   is cruel is also sordid and degenerous, and consequently as fit an
   object for contempt. What so cruel, and withal so base, as a wolf? But
   on the other side, true worth and fortitude is never bloody. Gold, the
   noblest of metals, is healing and restorative; and it is only iron, the
   vilest, with which we wound and destroy.

   Let this therefore be the first ingredient of the woe discharged
   against the tyrant and bloody person, to be universally hated and
   scorned; to go no whither, but with a retinue of curses at his heels;
   to be murdered in the wishes, and assassinated in the very looks of his
   subjects. He who is a monster, and an exception from human nature, may
   perhaps count this nothing, and say with Lucius Sylla, the murdering,
   proscribing dictator of Rome, Oderint dum metuant; but he that is
   sensible that man was born for society, that is, to love and to be
   loved, must in this case look upon himself as an outlaw and an exile
   from the converse, and consequently from the felicity and proper
   enjoyments of mankind.

   2. The second ingredient of the woe here denounced against bloody
   persons is, the torment of continual jealousy and suspicion. He that is
   injurious, is naturally suspicious; and he that knows that he deserves
   enemies, will always suppose that he has them, and perhaps at length by
   suspecting come to make them so.

   But now, is it not the height of misery thus like a wild beast still to
   fear and to be feared? for the mind to be perpetually struggling with
   its own surmises, and first to create torments, and then to feel them?
   The breast of a tyrant is like a sea, it swallows up and devours
   others, and is still restless, troubled, and unquiet in itself. Could
   Herod the Great be more poorly and basely unhappy, than to be afraid of
   poor sucking infants, and not to think himself safe in the throne,
   unless he stormed nurseries and invaded cradles? A kingdom can be
   desirable upon no other account, but because it seems to command more
   of the materials of happiness, and to afford greater opportunities of
   satisfaction to the desires of a rational nature, than can possibly be
   had in any inferior condition. But now what real happiness can that
   prince or great man find, that has his mind depraved into such a
   jealous, suspicious temper? What can all the enjoyments of a court or
   kingdom profit, when the tormentor within shall imbitter them all, and
   the paleness of fear and death sit perpetually upon his heart? What
   pleasure can it afford to cast roses into that bosom, that feels the
   gnawings of the wolf?

   And therefore if the tyrant is brought to this pass, as to feel the
   reflections of his tyranny over others in that which his own jealousy
   exercises upon himself, and if his own thoughts plot and conspire
   against him, his very diadem is but a splendid mockery, his throne a
   rack, and all his royalty nothing else but a great and magnificent
   misery.

   3. The third ingredient denounced against him that endeavours to raise
   and settle a government with blood is, the shortness and certain
   dissolution of the government that he endeavours so to establish. There
   is no way by which God so usually punishes villainous designs, as the
   disappointment of them, by those very methods and instruments by which
   they were to have been accomplished. It is, as I may so say, the great
   sport of Providence, to ruin unjust titles and usurped government by
   their very supports. But of all the means employed by tyrants for this
   purpose, there is none so frequently made use of, though none so often
   proves fatal to the user, as this of savageness and cruelty; innocent
   blood always proving but a bad cement to build the walls of a city
   with. For how do such governments pass the world like so many furious
   blasts of wind, violent and short! as it were out of breath and
   expiring with their own violence. How do tyrants, having by much blood
   and rapine advanced themselves to the sovereign power of a kingdom,
   like so many fatal comets, shine and blaze, and fright the world below
   them, in those upper regions for a while, but still portend their own
   downfall and destruction? For was it not thus with those traitorous
   captains of Israel, who kinged themselves by slaying their masters and
   reigning in their stead? How quickly was their usurped government at an
   end! How soon did they meet with others who did the like for them! Had
   Zimri peace, who slew his master? Such governments quickly fall and
   moulder away, like clods dissolved with blood.

   Was it not thus also with Cinna and Marius, and afterwards with Sylla
   himself, who had nothing of Dictator Perpetuus but the name?

   How soon was the family of bloody Saul extinct! And for Herod the
   Great, did not the same cruelty, for which he deserved to be childless,
   almost make him so? Archelaus, the only son he left, succeeding but to
   part of his kingdom, and that too but for a short time. And when
   afterwards Herod Antipas the tetrarch was routed, and lost all his army
   in a war with Aretas, king of Arabia, and when by the subtilty of
   Agrippa he was outwitted and outed of all, and also banished, Josephus
   himself says, that even the Jews ascribed all this to a divine
   vengeance upon him for the barbarous and unjust murder of John the
   Baptist.

   And for the Jews themselves, does not Christ, in the very same place in
   which he foretells the ruin and destruction of Jerusalem, upbraid that
   bloody city with her killing God's prophets, and stoning those that
   were sent unto her?

   And lastly, whereas the high priest counselled the putting of Christ to
   death, lest otherwise the Romans should come upon them, and destroy
   both their nation and government; is it not evident to any one not
   obstinately blind, that the very guilt of his blood brought that
   destruction upon them from the Romans, who not long after sacked their
   city, burnt the temple, killed, crucified, sold, and dispersed the
   inhabitants; that is, used them as they had used Christ, till at length
   they took away both their place and nation? Woe to the bloody city,
   says the prophet, in Ezek, xxiv. 6.

   The sin of blood is a destroying, wasting, murdering sin; murdering
   others, besides those whom it kills; it breaks the back of governments,
   sinks families, destroys for the future, reaches into successions, and
   cuts off posterities.

   4. The fourth ingredient of the woe here denounced against the bloody
   builders of governments, is the sad and dismal end that usually attends
   such persons. He that delights to swim in blood, is for the most part
   at length drowned in it; and there is a kind of fatal circulation by
   which blood frequently wheels about and returns upon the shedder of it.
   How did Cyrus the Persian verify this by a peculiar significancy of
   death, having his head cut off, and thrown into a tub of blood! How did
   the fratricide Romulus die, being torn in pieces by the senate! How did
   Sylla expire in a murdering fit, causing one to be strangled before him
   in his chamber, and with that passion so disturbing himself, and
   enraging his distemper, that within a few hours he breathed out his own
   bloody soul!

   And, to come to the sacred story, how did Samuel treat Agag? As thy
   sword has made many childless, so shall thy mother be childless amongst
   women. And then for Herod the Great, who so barbarously murdered those
   poor innocents; he died indeed in his bed, as well as our late grand
   regicide; but with so much horror and disaster, that for some days
   before he died, he snatched at a knife to have murdered, or rather to
   have killed himself; and so to have done that, which only wanted
   another and an higher hand to have made it a just execution. But upon
   none did the revenging hand of divine justice appear more signally than
   upon Herod Agrippa, mentioned in the twelfth of the Acts; who, to
   please the Jews, and thereby to confirm himself in his kingdom, having
   slain James, the brother of John, with the sword, proceeded to take
   Peter also. But we read in what terrible strange manner, even in the
   height of his pride and glory, he was smote by God, infested with
   worms, and made a living carcass; thus anticipating the effects of
   death, and suffering the curse of the grave before he descended into
   the ground.

   Should I endeavour to give a full rehearsal of all such like instances,
   I must transcribe the stories of all times, which are scarce fuller of
   pages, than of examples of this kind. Blood seldom escapes revenge,
   since it is so easily followed and found out by its own traces. And
   thus much for the third thing proposed; which was, to shew the latitude
   and extent of the curse or woe here denounced against bloody persons,
   and the several plagues comprehended in it. I come now to the fourth
   particular, which is,

   IV. To shew the reasons why a curse or woe is so peculiarly denounced
   against this sin.

   Many may be assigned, but I shall produce only these.

   1. The first is, because the sin of bloodshed makes the most direct
   breach upon human society, of which the providence of God owns the
   peculiar care and protection.

   Concerning which we must observe, that every man has naturally a right
   to enjoy such things as are suitable to and required by the rational
   appetites of his nature; in the due and lawful satisfaction of which
   properly consists his well-being in this world, which is every man's
   birthright by an irrevocable charter from God and nature. For whosoever
   is born, has a right to live; and whosoever has a right to live, has a
   right also to live well. Now that men might the better secure both
   their lives or being, and withal compass such lawful satisfactions to
   themselves, as should be requisite to their well-being, they first
   entered into society, and then, to preserve society, put themselves
   under government. So that the end of society is a man's enjoyment of
   himself, and the end of government is society. For in the first and
   most natural intention of it, no governor, merely as such, is made
   absolute lord of the lives or proprietor of the estates of those whom
   he governs, but only a trustee by God to secure them in the free
   possession and enjoyment of both. And therefore that governor that
   wrings away a man's estate, or destroys his life, not yet forfeited to
   the community he lives in by any crime, is in God's account a thief and
   a murderer, and so shall hereafter be dealt with by him as such; though
   in the mean time (as I said before) neither reason nor religion can
   authorize the subjects to revenge these injuries upon their governor.

   From whence we learn the reason why God so much concerns himself to
   punish the unjust shedder of blood; first, because he is the great
   trespasser upon human society, by being destructive to the lives of
   men; and next, because if he who is so chances to be a sovereign
   prince, there is no provision in the ordinary course of human justice
   to call such a destroyer to account.

   As for the life of man, it is an enjoyment in comparison of which
   nature scarce values all others: this is the very apple of his eye,
   sensible of the least touch, and irrecoverable after the first loss.
   For if a man loses his estate, he may get another; and if he loses his
   reputation, he may perhaps recover it; or if he cannot, he may live
   without it, not very happily indeed, but yet he may live. But if the
   tyrant takes away his life, there is no retrieving of that; this sweeps
   away being and well-being at one blow: the dying man parts with all at
   one breath, and is but one remove from annihilation; not so much as his
   very thoughts remaining, but they also perish, Psalm cxlvi. 4.

   And now when a tyrant by shedding blood has provoked civil justice, and
   by shedding so much has put himself beyond the reach of it, does not
   the matter itself seem to appeal to a superior providence, to invoke
   the justice of Heaven to make bare its arm in the behalf of injured and
   oppressed right?

   Blood certainly shall not go unrevenged, though it be the greatest
   Herod that sheds it, and the meanest infant that loses it; though whole
   parliaments and armies shall conspire against the life of the innocent
   and the helpless. Briefly, it belongs to God, as the supreme governor
   of the world, to revenge such grand and unnatural violations of the
   societies of mankind, committed to the tuition of his providence.

   2. The second reason why God so peculiarly denounces a woe against the
   sin of bloodiness, is not only for the malignity of the sin itself, but
   also for the malignity of those sins that almost always go in
   conjunction with it, particularly for the abhorred sins of fraud,
   deceitfulness, and hypocrisy. The two great things that make such a
   breach upon the peace and settlement of the world are force and fraud.
   For all men that are miserable become so either by being driven or
   cheated out of their enjoyments. Hence the Spirit of God, in Psalm lv.
   25, joins the bloody and deceitful man together. And does not Christ
   himself call Herod, that murdered John the Baptist, fox; a beast
   notable for his craft, as well as for sucking of blood?

   If we look into history, we shall scarce find any one remarkably cruel,
   who was not also noted for his dissimulation. But we need not much
   trouble histories; for has not all the bloodshed amongst us, from the
   blood of the prince to that of the peasant, issued from the most devout
   pretences of reformation? Has not the nation been massacred by
   sanctified murderers, who came into the field masked with covenants and
   protestations, quoting scripture while they cut throats, and singing
   psalms while they plundered towns; destroying their prince's armies and
   shooting at his person, while in the mean time they swore that they
   fought for him?

   But this way and method of proceeding is but natural. For men must be
   first deceived out of their guards and defences, before they can be
   exposed to the utmost violences. The bird must be caught in the snare,
   and the fish beguiled with the bait, before they can be killed.

   But now there is scarce any thing that God hates more thoroughly, and
   punishes more severely, than deceit and falseness; for it is most
   properly a defiance of God; who is always either solemnly invoked, or
   at least tacitly supposed, for the great witness of the sincerity of
   men's dealings; and if men use not truth in these, the great bond of
   converse is dissolved.

   No wonder therefore if bloodiness draw after it such a woe, having
   always such a sin in its company, and if the curse falls heavy, being
   procured by two of the greatest sins in the closest conjunction.

   And thus much for the fourth particular, which was to shew the several
   ingredients contained within the compass or latitude of the curse or
   woe here denounced. I descend now to,

   V. The fifth and last, which is, to apply all to this present occasion.

   I shew at the beginning, that ever since the creation of mankind, God
   has all along manifested such a solicitous care for the lives of men,
   the noblest of all his creatures, that he has not secured them only by
   severe laws established against murder, but also by making kindness,
   mercy, and benevolence a great part of religion; and of all other
   religions, has he chiefly wove these excellent and benign qualities
   into the very heart and vital constitution of Christianity. By how much
   the more detestable, and for ever accursed, must those miscreants
   appear, who have slurred and bespattered the best, the purest, and most
   peaceable of all religions, by entitling it to all the rapines they
   have acted, and all the blood they have imbrued their hands in, as shed
   by the immediate impulse of God's Spirit, and for the defence and
   preservation of religion! How much this nation has been concerned in
   this black charge, we need no other argument than this fatal day to
   convince us; on which was acted the most disloyal, barbarous, and
   inhuman piece of villainy, and that with all the solemn disguises of
   piety and religion, that mortal men were ever yet guilty of, since
   there was such a thing as sovereignty acknowledged, or such a thing as
   religion professed upon the face of the earth.

   But to shew further how close and home the subject-matter of the text
   comes to the business of this annual solemnity, we will survey the
   correspondence that is between them, as to the three main things
   contained in the words. The first was a charge of unjust effusion of
   blood. The second was the end or design for which it was shed, namely,
   the setting up of a government. And the third and last was a woe or
   curse denounced against the person that endeavours to establish himself
   by such a course.

   As for the first, we must know, that all unjust bloodshed is twofold.
   1. Either public, and acted by and upon a community, as in a war. Or,
   2. Personal, in the assassination of any particular man.

   1. As for that which is public; it is as certain, that he who takes
   away a man's life in a war, commenced upon an unjust cause, and without
   just authority, is as truly a murderer, as he that enters his
   neighbour's house, and there stabs him within his own walls. And as for
   the late war, upon the account of all laws, both of God and man,
   whether we respect the cause for which it was raised, which was, the
   removal of grievances, where there were none, or the persons that
   carried it on, who were subjects armed against their prince, it was in
   all the parts and circumstances of it a perfect, open, and most
   barefaced rebellion. For not all the Calvins, Bezas, Knoxes, Buchanans,
   or Paraeus's in Christendom, with all their principles of anarchy and
   democracy, so studiously maintained in their respective writings, can
   by any solid reason make out the lawfulness of subjects taking arms
   against their prince. For if government be the effect and product of
   reason, it is impossible for disobedience to found itself upon reason:
   and therefore our rebels found it necessary to balk and decry this, and
   to fetch a warrant for all their villainies from ecstasy and
   inspiration. But besides, if we translate the whole matter from the
   merit of the cause to that of the person, no people under heaven had
   less ground to complain of, much less to fight against their prince,
   than the English then had, who at that time swimmed in a full enjoyment
   of all things but a thankful mind; no prince's reign having ever put
   subjects into a condition so like that of princes, as the peaceable
   part of the reign of king Charles the First: which indeed was the true
   cause that made them kick at those breasts that fed them, and strike at
   that royal oak under whose shadow they enjoyed so much ease, plenty,
   and prosperity.

   2. The other sort of unjust bloodshed is, the assassination of
   particular persons: and had not our bloodsuckers their slaughterhouses
   and courts of mock justice, as well as the high places of the field, to
   act their butcheries upon? Strafford and Canterbury lead the way, both
   as forerunners of, and introductions to the shedding of a more sacred
   blood, the stain of which will dye the English calendar for ever, and
   the cry of which sober persons much fear continues still, and rings
   aloud in heaven, whatsoever arts have been used, and still are, to
   silence it here on earth. For it was the blood of one, who had those
   two things eminently in conjunction, either of which alone should be a
   sufficient safeguard to the life of him that has them, to wit,
   innocence and sovereignty. For innocence ought to protect the life of
   the meanest subject, and sovereignty to secure the person of the
   highest criminal. But we scorn that word when we speak of this blessed
   martyr, whose virtues were larger than his dominions, and will make his
   enemies more infamous than their own vices.

   Blood therefore we see has been shed amongst us to some purpose: the
   first thing in which the text is answered by the business of this day.

   The second was, the end or design for which the blood here spoken of
   was shed, namely, the erecting or setting up of a government. And was
   not the very same thing drove at by all our pious murderers? For out of
   the ruins of a glorious church and monarchy, and all those slaughtered
   heaps of men sacrificed to the cause of loyalty on one side, and of
   rebellion on the other, did there not at length rise up a misshapen,
   monstrous beast with many heads, called a commonwealth; a pack of
   insolent, beggarly tyrants, who lorded it as long as they were able,
   till at length they were forced to surrender and pass over all their
   usurped power into the hands of their great Beelzebub, the prime rebel
   and regicide, by whom they had done all their mighty works? And so
   their commonwealth wheeled about again into a monarchy. All those
   rivulets of tyranny, as it were, emptying and discharging themselves
   into that great gulf or dead sea of all baseness, cruelty, and
   hypocrisy: a fellow that had torn and trampled upon all those
   obligations, either civil or sacred, by which human society does
   subsist; who, by abusing religion, breaking oaths, mocking of God, and
   murdering his prince, at length grasped the sovereign power of these
   three kingdoms, and then called himself their protector, with the same
   truth and propriety that a wolf or a bear may be said to protect the
   flocks they worry and tear in pieces.

   So then, the parallel we see holds good thus far; that our villains
   reared themselves a government by the blood they shed, as well as those
   mentioned by the prophet in the text.

   And now, in the third and last place, have they not, think we, also as
   full a right and title to the woe and curse there denounced in the same
   words? Yes, assuredly; there being no persons under heaven that more
   deserved to drink off the very dregs of God's vengeance, and to empty
   all his quivers, than these monsters did.

   As for the curse that befell these bloody builders of government, I
   shew, that it manifested itself eminently in two respects.

   1. In the shortness of the government so set up. And was it long that
   these murderers of their prince possessed the government they so
   usurped? Within five years their infant commonwealth expired; and in
   five years more Cromwell's mushroom monarchy was at an end, in spite of
   all the prophecies of those impostors, that would lengthen out his life
   and government out of Daniel and the Revelations, telling him, that
   there was thirty years more generation-work (as they canted it) cut out
   for him; and that it was contrary to the methods of Providence, having
   raised up such an extraordinary instrument, to lay him aside, till he
   had finished his work. But God, who understood his own counsels better
   than such saucy interpreters, knew that this wretch had disturbed the
   world too long already; and so in his good time sent him to his own
   place.

   2. Another part of the curse attending the bloody raisers of
   government, was the general hatred that always follows such persons.
   And of this I think our usurpers had as large a portion as ever light
   upon the heads of mortal men. For in the most flourishing estate of all
   their greatness they were encompassed with curses as well as armies;
   men being scarce able to keep down the inward boilings of revenge, and
   to restrain their tongues and hands from ministering to that fulness of
   hatred that swelled within their hearts. Men hated them even in the
   behalf of human nature, and for the vindication of common humanity. And
   still so much and so justly abhorred are they, that all the pardons and
   indulgences, all the good words, all the great offices and preferments
   that can be bestowed upon them, will never be able to sweeten their
   memory, nor rescue them from the detestation of all sober persons and
   true lovers of their country. And the truth is, to speak the severest
   words of these vipers is not (as some call it) a sacrificing to any
   personal heat or private revenge; but a real serving of the public
   interest of society, and the doing an act of mere charity to the
   innocent and to posterity, who, by hearing with what abhorrence such
   miscreants are mentioned, will dread the imitation of those villainies,
   that have derived such an odium and infamy upon the actors of them. Nor
   can I think that any one can concern himself against the ripping up of
   the baseness of the king's murderers, even in the harshest, that is,
   the most proper terms, but such as have been either the relations,
   officers, or servants of that grand regicide, and consequently whose
   unlimited puritan-consciences will equally serve them to act and thrive
   under any government whatsoever.

   But it is well that there is a punishment for villains in the general
   hatred of mankind; and this is the lot, this the punishment of our
   rebels: but as for any other penalties that use to descend upon
   traitors and murderers from the hand of human vengeance, these they
   have for the most part escaped, as having rebelled under a lucky star,
   which has prospered their villainies and secured their persons in this
   world, till the great Judge of all things shall recognise the cause of
   abused majesty and religion in another, and there award such a sentence
   upon the violators of them, as shall demonstrate to men and angels,
   that verily God is righteous; doubtless there is a God that judgeth the
   world.

   To whom be rendered and ascribed, as is most due, all praise, might,
   majesty, and dominion, both now and for evermore. Amen.

SERMON LV.

  1 JOHN iii. 8.

   For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy
   the works of the Devil.

   THERE is nothing that contributes so much to the right understanding of
   the nature of any thing or action, as a true notion of the proper end
   and design of it; the ignorance of which bereaves mankind of many of
   the blessings of heaven: because oftentimes while they enjoy the thing,
   they yet mistake its use; and so pervert the intentions of mercy, and
   become miserable amidst the very means of happiness.

   Certainly therefore it concerns men infinitely, not to entertain an
   error about the greatest of God's favours, and the very masterpiece of
   his goodness, the sending of his Son into the world. The meaning of
   which providence should we misconstrue, we should frustrate our grand
   and last remedy, and perish, not for want, but for misapplication of
   the means of life. Wherefore this divine apostle, who had been honoured
   with so near an admittance into his master's mind, and lain so
   familiarly in the bosom of truth, endeavours to give the world a right
   information about this so great and concerning affair in this chapter,
   and particularly in these words; in which we have these two parts.

   I. An account of Christ's coming into the world, in this expression;
   The Son of God was manifested.

   II. The end and design of his coming; which was, to destroy the works
   of the Devil.

   I. As for the first of these, the manifestation of the Son of God,
   though it principally relates to the actual coming of Christ into the
   world, according to my application of it to the present purpose, yet it
   is a term of a larger comprehension; and so ought to carry our notice
   both to passages before and after his nativity. For as in the coming of
   a prince, or great person, to any place, the pomp of harbingers and
   messengers is as it were some appearance of him before he is seen; so
   Christ declared himself at vast distances of time, by many semblances
   and intimations, enough to raise, though not to satisfy the world's
   expectation.

   We shall find him first exhibited in promises, and those as early as
   the first need of a Saviour, even immediately after the fall; by such
   an hasty provision of mercy, that there might be no dark interval
   between man's misery and his hope of recovery; Gen. iii. 15, The seed
   of the woman shall break the serpent's head. He was afterwards further
   shadowed out in types and sacrifices, and such other emblems and arts
   of signification; still with this method of proceeding, that the
   manifestation brightened and grew greater and greater, according to the
   nearer and nearer approach of the full discovery.

   He that at first was known only as the seed of the woman, was in
   process of time known to be the seed of Abraham, Gen. xxii. 18. And
   after that, the seed of David, in Isaiah xi. 1. And from thence
   proceeding to greater particularities relating to the manner of his
   coming, he was known to be born of a virgin, Isaiah vii. 14. And for
   the place where; to be born at Bethlem, Micah v. 2. And for his person
   and condition, that he should be a man of sorrows, Isaiah liii. 3. And
   that he should suffer and die for sin, verse 8. That he should rise
   again, Psalm xvi. 10. That he should ascend into heaven, and lead
   captivity captive, &c. Psalm lxviii. 18. That he should reign till he
   had subdued his enemies, and saw the world brought under him, Psalm cx.
   1. Thus by a continual gradation the promise advanced itself with
   further steps and increases, shining more and more unto a perfect day;
   displaying fresh and fuller discoveries through the several ages of the
   world; every new degree of manifestation being a mercy great enough to
   oblige an age.

   But when at length prophecy ripened into event, and shadows gave way
   upon the actual appearance of the substance, in the birth of Christ,
   yet then, though the Son of God could be but once born, he ceased not
   to be frequently manifested: there was a choir of angels to proclaim
   his nativity, and a new star to be his herald; the wise men of the east
   came to worship a new sun, where they saw and acknowledged the first
   miracle of his birth, a star appearing when the sun was up. When he
   disputed with the doctors, every argument was a demonstration of his
   deity; and during the whole course of his ministry, all the mighty
   works he did were further manifestations of a divine nature wrapped up
   in the flesh: even his death proved, that there was something in him
   that could not die; and the very effects of mortality, by a strange
   antiperistasis, declared him to be immortal; 1 Pet. iii. 18, Put to
   death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. And lastly, after all
   this, the perfection and height of evidence shone forth in the
   stupendous passage of his resurrection; in which, according to the
   apostle Paul's phrase, Rom. i. 4, he was declared to be the Son of God
   with power. God made it his business to shew him publicly, to hold him
   up to be seen, admired, and believed in. Every thing that concerned him
   was writ in capital letters, and such as might not only entertain, but
   help the sight.

   Now upon the strength of this consideration it is, that we pronounce
   the Jews inexcusable for persisting in their unbelief. Concerning which
   as we are to observe, that in order to the convincing of men's belief,
   it is not only required that the proposition, proposed to be believed,
   be in itself true, but that it also appear such; so Christ, to comply
   with the strictest methods of human reason, asserted his being the Son
   of God with such invincible arguments, that he was manifested to be so:
   yea, and to that degree, that the Jews' rejection of him is not stated
   upon ignorance, or the cause of it want of evidence in the thing that
   they were to know; but upon the malice and depravation of their wills
   acting counter to their knowledge, in John xv. 24; If I had not done
   amongst them the works which no other man did, they had not had sin:
   but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. It was not
   a blind hatred; they saw well enough what they did: they had an open,
   as well as an evil eye; a resolved obstinacy to outlook the sun and
   outstare the light.

   For so was Christ, he was the light of the world; and nothing is more
   manifest or visible than that which manifests both itself and all
   things else; and needs no invitation to the eye, but will certainly
   enter, unless it be forcibly kept out.

   But they were purposed not to believe their eyes; to question whether
   it was day when the sun shined; to doubt whether he that did the works
   of God was sent by God; whether miracles could prove any thing, or
   signs could signify; and lastly, whether he that fulfilled all
   prophecies was intended by them. It is clear therefore, that the Jews
   rejected the Son of God, not because he was not manifested, but because
   they delighted to be ignorant, and to be sceptics and unbelievers even
   in spite of evidence.

   And thus much for the first thing, the manifestation of the Son of God:
   pass we now to the next, which is, the end of his manifestation, that
   he might destroy the works of the Devil.

   In the prosecution of which I shall first shew, 1. What were those
   works of the Devil that the Son of God destroyed: 2. And secondly, the
   means and ways by which he destroyed them.

   1st. For the first of these. I reduce the works of the Devil, destroyed
   by the manifestation of the Son of God, to these three: 1. Delusion: 2.
   Sin: 3. Death.

   There is a natural coherence and concatenation between these: for sin
   being a voluntary action, and so the issue of the will, presupposes a
   default in the understanding, which was to conduct the will in its
   choices: and then when the delusion and inadvertency of the
   understanding has betrayed the will to sin, the consequent and effect
   of sin is death. Christ therefore, that came to repair the breaches and
   to cure the miseries of human nature, and to redeem it from that
   phrensy into which it had cast itself, designs the removal and conquest
   of all these three.

   1. And first for delusion. The Devil, as his masterpiece and first art
   of ruining mankind, was busy to sow the seeds of error and fallacy in
   the guide of action, their understanding. And surely he has not gained
   higher trophies over any faculty of man's nature than this. For where,
   upon a survey of the world lying under gentilism, can we find truth
   even in principles of speculation, but much less in those of practice?

   As for the first fundamental thing, the original of nature and the
   beginning of the world; what dissonant and various opinions may we
   find, and consonant in nothing but their absurdity! Some will not allow
   it to have had any beginning; others refer it to accident. And those
   who acknowledge it to have been efficiently framed and produced by an
   infinite eternal mind, yet assert the matter and rude chaos, out of
   which he framed it, to have been as old, or rather as eternal as the
   artificer. Thus ridiculously making two eternals, and one of them
   infinitely imperfect; whereas the very notion of eternity and
   self-existence, pursued into its due consequences, must of necessity
   infer an infinite perfection in all other respects whatsoever. For all
   imperfection and finiteness proceeds from the restraint of a superior
   cause: and what cause could limit that which had no cause; and keep
   that which had its being from itself, from having all the perfections
   of being?

   And for the principles of practice, they were equally ridiculous and
   uncertain. Some fixed the chief good of man in pleasure, some in
   contemplation, and some thrust the means into the place of the end, and
   made the chief good of man to act virtuously; whereas indeed the chief
   good was to enjoy God, and the way to attain it was to act virtuously.
   And then if you would know what they understood by acting virtuously,
   you would find them stating the rates of virtue so, that many actions
   were taken into that number, which we account vicious and
   unwarrantable. Ambition was an excellent thing amongst them, and an
   insatiable desire of honour a current virtue. Lust, if it did not
   proceed to adultery, that is, to a downright act of injustice, was
   accounted a very innocent and allowable recreation. In a word, they
   were at an infinite loss where to state the ground and reason of men's
   actions; and all their practical maxims were deficient at least, if not
   unjust.

   And for those that acknowledged God for the end of all that they were
   to do, yet did they pursue the enjoyment of that end by means any ways
   suitable or proportionable to it? Did they worship him as God? No, we
   know, that they waxed vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
   heart was darkened: they changed the glory of the eternal, all-wise,
   incorruptible God, into the images of silly, sinful, mortal men; nay,
   and what is yet more incredible and intolerable, into the similitude of
   beasts, and fowls, and creeping things. All this time worshipping the
   works of their own hands, or at least using them as instruments of
   worship and proper conveyances of divine adoration to God himself, held
   forth to them by such ways of representation; which was a great
   absurdity in reason, a great impiety in religion, and an horrible
   injury and affront to the Deity: for could any thing be more injurious,
   than that men should take their notions of God from such resemblances;
   and then depress their religious worship of him to the proportion of
   those notions?

   Now all this was done by the wisest of the heathens, by the
   philosophers, the sages, the governors and teachers of the rest of the
   world; and if these could so degenerate and ride down their reason to
   such a strange weakness and deception, what can we think of the rout
   and the vulgar, who could not salve their idolatry with art and
   distinction? They certainly were in outer darkness, in such thick
   darkness as might be felt. Their priests' images were their realities;
   and what they saw with their eyes they worshipped with their heart,
   thinking of no other deity but what shined upon them in the golden
   statue or the curious picture; still raising their devotion as the
   skill of the graver had advanced the object.

   But then, since the exercise of virtue is not to be bound upon men's
   consciences, (at least respecting the generality of men,) but by hopes
   and fears grounded upon the proposal of future rewards and punishments;
   if we look further, and consider how they acquitted themselves in
   giving an account of these to the world, we need require no further
   account of the error and delusion under which the Devil had sealed
   them. All the reward they proposed to virtue, even in its greatest
   austerities, self-denials, and forbearances, was to live for ever in
   the Elysian fields. A goodly reward indeed; a man must forego many of
   his pleasures, defy his clamorous appetites, and submit to many
   inconveniences in pursuing the rigidum honestum, the harshnesses of
   virtue: and afterwards, for all this, we shall be gratified with taking
   a turn now and then in a fair meadow.

   And then the punishments they designed for ill lives were no ways
   inferior in point of unlikelihood and absurdity: as the filling of tubs
   full of holes, which let out the water as fast as it was poured in. The
   rolling of a great stone up a steep mountain, which perpetually
   returned back upon the person that forced it upwards. The being whipt
   with snakes by three furies. The being bound hand and foot upon a rock,
   and having one's liver gnawed by a vulture; still growing and renewing
   itself according as it was devoured. These and such like old wives' or
   old poets' fables they amused the world withal; which could keep nobody
   that was witty from being wicked: all awe and dread vanishing upon the
   discovery of such ill-contrived cheats, such thin and transparent
   fallacies.

   Yet this was the economy of the religion of the gentiles before the
   coming of the Messiah. And for that little handful of men, that God
   chose from the rest of the world, to impart his law to them, the church
   of the Jews; even this, sometimes before the birth of Christ, was like
   an enclosed garden overrun with weeds, the very influences it lived
   under being noxious and pestilential. Their fountains were poisoned:
   their teachers were only so many authentic perverters of the law; so
   many doctors of heresy and immorality; abusing the authority of Moses
   while they sat in his chair. So that there was a kind of universal
   error and delusion, and that in matters of the greatest importance,
   spread over all nations, by that diligent, indefatigable enemy of truth
   and mankind the Devil. This being his groundwork, to delude men's
   apprehensions, that so he might command their services: and so blind
   were their eyes, that he might lead them whither he would.

   2. The second great work of the Devil to be destroyed by the
   manifestation of the Son of God, was sin. It were a sad story to give a
   full account of this. For the truth is, the Devil deceived men only for
   this cause, to make them sinful. And such was his cursed success in
   this attempt, and the vile fertility of this ill thing brought by him
   into the world, that it conveyed a general infection into all the
   faculties of man: so that at length the thoughts of his heart were
   evil, and only evil, and that continually, Gen. vi. 5. It had so
   corrupted and fouled the world, that it put God to attempt the
   cleansing of it by a deluge. But neither so was the work effected; for
   after so many sinners were cashiered, yet sin still survived, and grew
   and multiplied, like a plant rather watered only than drowned; thriving
   and increasing as fast as those that peopled the world by a commission
   and command from heaven.

   It would be a fearful sight to see those sins that have stained man's
   nature ranked into their several kinds and degrees, and displayed in
   their filthy colours: to see one nation branded with one vice; another
   nation notorious for another; and each in some degree tainted with all.
   St. John tells us, that the whole world lies in wickedness, 1 John v.
   19. And St. Paul gives us a large account of the vices of the gentile
   world, in Rom. i. from the 26th verse to the end of the chapter. They
   were possessed with vile affections, acted by unnatural lusts,
   delivered over to a reprobate mind, being filled with all
   unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
   full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, &c. And for a
   concluding epiphonema, it is said of them in the last verse, that
   knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are
   worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that
   do them. And certainly for men to take pleasure not only in their own
   sins, but also in the sins of other men, is the very height and
   perfection of an overgrown impiety: yet thus far were they arrived.
   Every one delighted to see the sin of his own temper and practice
   exemplified, and so in a manner countenanced by another man's
   behaviour; to see himself transcribed, and his vice propagated into the
   manners of those that were about him.

   And to proceed further, their vice did not only reign in their ordinary
   converse, but also got into their divine worship: and as before I shew
   that they worshipped their gods idolatrously and foolishly; so their
   histories tell us that they worshipped them also viciously: revels,
   drunkenness, and lasciviousness, were the peculiar homage and religious
   service that they performed to them. What were their bacchanalia, but
   solemn debauches in honour of a drunken deity? And the rites of their
   bona dea, in which Publius Clodius was deprehended under the habit of a
   woman, were transacted with so much filth and villainous impurity, that
   they are scarce to be thought of without a trespass upon modesty. Now
   certainly if these courses could propitiate or please their deities,
   there could be no such dishonour or defiance to them, as the practices
   of virtue and sobriety.

   We see here to what a maturity sin was grown amongst the heathens: and
   amongst the Jews it was not much shortened in its progress. For what
   are all the writings of the prophets, but so many loud declarations of
   the prevailing sway that sin had amongst them? How does Isaiah
   complain, that the faithful city was become an harlot! Isaiah i. 21.
   How does Jeremy bemoan himself, that he was constrained to dwell and
   converse with so much impiety, in chap. ix. 2; Oh that I had in the
   wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my
   people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of
   treacherous men. And again, in verse 4, Take ye heed every one of his
   neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will
   utterly supplant. It seems there was scarce truth and sincerity enough
   amongst them to serve the common intercourses of society and human
   life. The truth is, he that fully enlarges himself upon this theme must
   be endless and infinite, and declaim to eternity. But now when such an
   enormous corruption of manners had seized upon the church, to whom was
   committed the law of God, and the living oracles, and all the means of
   instruction to piety and virtue, and whatsoever was excellent; what was
   to be expected, but that God should either destroy or reform the world?

   And therefore having pitched upon the latter, it was now full time for
   him to send his Son, to cleanse this Augean stable, to purge away the
   dross of the world; for this was the design of his coming, Mal. iii. 2,
   3, to be like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's sope, to purify the
   sons of Levi, and to purge them as gold and silver; and if it were
   possible, to recover the world to its former innocence, or at least to
   such a degree of it, as to break the sceptre and kingdom of the wicked
   one, who triumphed in the possession that he had got of men's hearts,
   by the sin that dwelt there, and raged in their lives.

   Would we know the great purpose that brought Christ out of his Father's
   bosom, and clothed him with the infirmities and meannesses of our
   nature, and made him submit to all the indignities that an obscure
   birth, an indigent life, and an ignominious death could bring upon him?
   Why it was not through these miseries to acquire a crown, and to
   advance his glory; for this he had by an eternal birthright, beyond any
   increase or addition; and his glorification did not so much invest him
   with any new honour, as restore to him his old.

   But all this long and miraculous scene of transactions was to redeem
   poor mortal men from the beloved bonds and shackles of their sins, to
   disenslave them from the tyranny of ruling corruptions; to dispossess
   the usurper, and to introduce the kingdom of God, by setting it up
   first in men's minds; to recover all their faculties to the liberty of
   innocence and purity; and so, in a word, to restore men both to God and
   to themselves.

   Now if this were the grand design of Christ's coming into the world, to
   conquer and destroy sin; certainly it concerns us not to celebrate the
   memory of that coming by any thing that may contradict the design of
   it. To be vain, and dissolute, and intemperate, are strange
   commemorations of his nativity, who was born into the world to make men
   otherwise. It is indeed such a solemnity as is the proper and deserved
   object of our joy; but then it is to be such a joy as is in heaven, of
   which divine love is the principle, and purity the chief ingredient.
   And thus much for the second grand work of the Devil, which Christ was
   manifested to destroy, namely sin.

   3. The third and last is death, the inseparable concomitant of the
   former. This is the Devil's triumphing work, by which he vaunts and
   shews forth the spoils of our conquered nature, the marks and trophies
   of his unhappy victory. For since the first entrance of sin into the
   world, death has dwelt amongst us, and continued, and with a perpetual,
   irresistible success prevailed over us. Rom. v. 12. Sin entered into
   the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that
   all have sinned. Sin, as it were, opened the sluice, and death
   immediately, like a mighty torrent, rushed in, and overwhelmed the
   world. Or like a commanding enemy, it invaded mankind with a ruining,
   destructive army following it. Plagues, fevers, catarrhs, consumptions,
   shame, poverty, and infinite accidental disasters; and the rear of all
   brought up with death eternal.

   But now Christ, intending to be a perfect Saviour, came to destroy this
   enemy also; for the apostle tells us, in 1 Cor. xv. 26, that the last
   enemy that shall be destroyed is death. Where yet it is not to be
   understood, that this benefit of Christ is to extend to all men; but to
   those only who should believe, and be renewed by the Spirit, and become
   the sons of God; these are the persons over whom the second death shall
   have no power. For since this deliverance proceeds upon the conditions
   of faith and obedience, those who reach not these conditions are not at
   all concerned in it; but remaining in sin, are consigned over to death.
   But some will say, Do not saints and believers die as well as the
   wicked and unbelievers? I answer, that though they do, yet the sting of
   death is taken away; so that from a curse, it is made a means to
   translate them to a better life; and that sickness, misery, or temporal
   death, that has nothing of curse or punishment in it, but, on the
   contrary, ends in that that gives an end to all misery, according to
   the estimate of God, comes not into the accounts of death. And this is
   sufficient to render Christ truly and properly a conqueror of death;
   that he actually conquers and destroys it in some, and has it in his
   power to do it in all others, would they but come up to those terms
   upon which only he is pleased to do it.

   2dly. And thus I have shewn what those works of the Devil are, for the
   destruction of which the Son of God was manifested. I come now to the
   last thing proposed, which is to shew, what are the ways and means by
   which he destroys them. Where we must observe, that as those works of
   the Devil were three, so Christ encounters them by those three distinct
   offices belonging to him as mediator.

   1. As a prophet, he destroys and removes that delusion that had
   possessed the world, by those divine and saving discoveries of truth
   exhibited in the doctrine and religion promulged by him. The apostle
   tells the Athenians, that before the coming of Christ God winked at the
   ignorance and idolatry that had blinded the gentiles; but after his
   coming, commanded all men every where to repent, Acts xvii. 30. And in
   chap. xiv. 15, he tells the men of Lystra, that the design of his
   preaching was, that they should turn from those vanities unto the
   living God. And still we find, that according as the gospel found
   reception and success, men began to be undeceived, and to shake off the
   yoke of their former delusions. In Acts xix. 19 we find, that upon the
   preaching of the gospel, those that were addicted to magic and
   conjuration, brought their books, though of never so great value, and
   burnt them publicly, as a sacrifice to the honour of Christ, and a
   solemn owning of the efficacy of that religion. And again, in 2 Tim. i.
   10, the apostle tells us, that it was Christ that brought life and
   immortality to light. The heathens' notion about the future estate of
   souls was absurd and phantastic; and that which the Jews had was but
   dim and obscure: but Christ cleared it up to mankind, under evidence
   and demonstration; he uttered things kept secret from the foundation of
   the world; he unlocked and opened the cabinet of God's hidden counsels,
   and has afforded means to enlarge men's knowledge in proportion to
   their concernment.

   In a word, the doctrine of Christ gives the best account of the nature
   of God and of the nature of man; of the first entrance of sin into the
   world, and of its cure and remedy: of those terms upon which God will
   transact with mankind, and upon which men must approach to God in point
   of worship, and depend upon him in reference to rewards. And this is
   the circle of knowledge necessary and sufficient to make mankind what
   they so much desire to be, happy. Which if it be sought for any where
   but in the discoveries of Christianity, it is like seeking for the
   living amongst the dead; or the expectation of a vintage from a field
   of thistles. All that the philosophers teach about these things is
   either falsity or conjecture; and so tends either to make men sinful,
   or at the best unsatisfied.

   But Christ was to be a light to the gentiles; and there is no cozenage
   in the light, no fallacy in the day: wheresoever he shines, mists
   presently vanish, and delusions disappear.

   2. As for the second work of the Devil, sin, this the Son of God
   destroyed as a priest, by that satisfaction that he payed down for it;
   and by that supply of grace that he purchased, for the conquering and
   rooting it out of the hearts of believers. By the former he destroys
   the guilt of sin, by the latter the power. Christ when he was in his
   lowest condition, suffering upon the cross as a malefactor, even then
   he broke the chief support of the Devil's kingdom, and triumphed over
   his strongest principality, in cashiering the guilt and loosing the
   bands of sin by a full expiation.

   Sin, that has so much venom in it as to poison a whole creation, to
   kindle an eternal fire and an unsupportable wrath, to shut up the
   bowels of an infinite mercy to poor perishing creatures, and, in a
   word, to overturn and confound the whole universe; yet being once
   satisfied for, it is a weak and harmless thing; it is a lion without
   teeth, or a snake without a sting.

   But none could make it so but the Son of God, the eternal high priest
   of souls, who exhausted the guilt and full measure of its malignity, by
   a superabundant ransom given for sinners to the offended justice of his
   Father.

   3. As for the third and last work of the Devil, which is death; this
   Christ, as he is a king, destroys by his power: for it is he that has
   the keys of life and death,, opening where none shuts, and shutting
   where none opens: this even amongst men is the peculiar prerogative of
   princes. At the command of Christ the sea shall give up its dead, the
   graves shall open, and deliver up their trust; and all the devourers of
   nature shall make a faithful restitution.

   And surely this is that which should comfort every Christian when he is
   upon his death-bed, and about to lay his head upon a pillow of dust,
   and to take his long sleep; that he has the greatest ground in the
   world to expect that he shall rise again, if an omnipotence can awaken
   him, if the eternal Son of God can snap asunder the bonds of death, and
   if the word of the King of kings can give him assurance of all this.

   Christ has fully finished the work for which he was manifested; he has
   vanquished the Devil, beat down all his forts, frustrated his
   stratagems; and so having delivered his elect, in spite of delusion,
   sin, and death, and all other destructive contrivances for the ruin of
   souls; as a king and a conqueror he is set down at the right hand of
   the Most High, receiving the homage of praises and hallelujahs from
   saints and angels, who are continually saying, Blessing, honour, glory,
   and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb,
   for ever and ever.

   To whom, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, do we also render and
   ascribe, as is most due, all praise, might, majesty, and dominion, both
   now and for ever. Amen.

SERMON LVI.

  MATTHEW ii. 3.

   And when Herod the king heard these things, he was troubled, and all
   Jerusalem with him.

   THOUGH all the works of God, even the most common, and such as every
   day meet our senses in the ordinary course of nature, carry in them a
   grandeur and magnificence great enough to entertain the observation of
   the most curious, and to raise the admiration of the most knowing; yet
   it has still been the method of divine Providence to point out
   extraordinary events and passages with some peculiar characters of
   remark; such as may alarm the minds and engage the eyes of the world,
   in a more exact observance of, and attention to, the hand of God, in
   such great changes. And very observable it is, that the alteration of
   states and kingdoms, the rise and dissolution of governments, the birth
   and death of persons eminent in their generations, have for the most
   part been signalized with some unusual phenomena in nature; sometimes
   in the earth, sometimes in the sea, and sometimes in the heavens
   themselves: God thereby shewing that the great affairs of the world
   proceed not without his own particular notice; and therefore certainly
   ought much more to challenge ours. And of this method of Providence, as
   the reason on God's part cannot but be most wise, so on man's (the more
   is our just shame) it is no less than necessary: for that natural
   proneness in most men to irreligion seems to gather strength from
   nothing more than from an observation of the constant uninterrupted
   course of nature, from which some are but too ready to think,
   whatsoever they speak, that nature is its own god, because they never
   see it controlled; that things always were, and always will be, as now
   they are; and in a word, that the world is unchangeable, when they do
   not see it changed. God therefore is sometimes pleased to interpose
   with an high hand, and to vary the usual course of nature, thereby to
   convince mankind, that this great fabric is not an automaton, so as to
   move itself; nor yet unaccountable, so as to acknowledge no superior
   law: but that it acts, or is rather acted by that eternal Spirit, and
   governed by that almighty and all-wise Artificer, that can order,
   govern, transpose, and, if occasion requires, take asunder the parts of
   it, as in his infinite wisdom he shall judge fit.

   But of all the strange passages and prodigies by which God introduced
   great persons into the world, none were so notable as those that
   ushered in the nativity of this glorious first-born of the creation,
   our blessed Saviour. And indeed great reason it was, that he that was
   Lord of heaven should have his descending into the flesh graced and
   owned with the testimonies of stars and angels, one shining and the
   other singing at so great a blessing coming upon mankind. Accordingly
   the evangelist in this chapter makes it his design and business to
   recount some of those notable circumstances that attended our Saviour's
   birth, which we may reduce to these two heads.

   I. The solemn address and homage made to him by the wise men of the
   east.

   II. Herod's behaviour thereupon.

   For the first of these, there are in this general passage these
   particulars considerable.

   1. Who and what those wise men were.

   2. From whence they came.

   3. About what time they came to Jerusalem.

   4. What that star was that appeared to them.

   5. How they could collect our Saviour's birth by that star.

   Of each of which in their order.

   1. And first for the first of these. The persons here rendered wise men
   (and that certainly with great truth and judgment) are in the Greek
   termed ma'goi, and in the Latin magi. The origination of which word
   some take from the Hebrew radix, signifying in the participle benoni in
   hiphil, one that meditates or mutters. Some from a Syro-Arabic word,
   signifying explorare or scrutari. Others from a Persian word, but what
   that word is none pretends to know: though since it is probable that
   these magi did first exist amongst the Persians, it is also not
   improbable but that both name and thing might have their original in
   the same place.

   As for the use of the word, it is different. At first it was taken,
   doubtless, not only in an honest, but also in an honourable sense; and
   the magia of the ancients was nothing else but a profound insight into
   all truth, natural, political, and divine. So that Suidas gives this
   account of the word, ma'goi para` Pe'rsais oi philo'sophoi, they were
   the Persian philosophers. And that they were divines also is clear; for
   Xenophon in his 8th book, peri` Ku'rpou paidei'as, commends the piety
   of Cyrus and his care of religion, for his appointing magi to preside
   in their sacred choirs, and to manage the offering of sacrifices, to'te
   proton katesta'thesan oi ma'goi umnein tou`s Theou`s, &c. And that this
   also was a name given to such as were skilled in politic matters is no
   less evident; for the great counsellors of the Persian kings were
   called magi; and Cicero affirms, in his 3d book De natura Deorum, that
   none was ever admitted to the Persian throne, but such as had been
   thoroughly instructed and trained up by these magi. For, as Plato says
   in his Alcibiades, it was their work, basilika` dida'skein, to teach
   and instil into them the arts of government.

   Now this discourse is only to shew, that the acception of the word
   amongst the Greeks and Latins, and other modern languages that speak
   after them, by which magus signifies no better than a wizard or
   conjurer, is through abuse and degeneration: the ill practices of some
   who wore this name, having by little and little disgraced the name
   itself into a bad sense.

   As for the acception of it here by our evangelist, I doubt not but it
   is in a good sense, and that the persons here spoken of were great
   scholars, men well studied in the works of nature, and probably most
   seen in the mysteries of astrology, the chief and principal part of the
   eastern learning, For the proof of which, this observation is very
   considerable, that the word ma'goi applied to the Latins, Greeks, or
   Egyptians themselves, is for the most part used in a bad sense; but the
   same authors applying it to the Chaldeans and Persians intend it in a
   good; and that these men mentioned by the evangelist were Persians,
   shall presently be made at least very probable.

   As for the condition and quality of these magi, or wise men, some
   contend, though I think more eagerly than conclusively, that they were
   kings; and for the proof of it allege several places of scripture; as
   first, that of Psalm lxxii. 10, The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
   shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
   But what is this to those who came not from Tarshish nor from Sheba,
   but from Persia, as shall be made appear hereafter? Besides that those
   words are literally spoke of Solomon, in whom they were eminently
   fulfilled; for we know what commerce he had with those parts, and we
   have also a full rehearsal of the great visit and present made him by
   the queen of Sheba.

   They allege also that place in Isaiah lx. 3, The gentiles shall come to
   thy light, and kings to the glory of thy rising; with other such texts,
   which they call proofs; though so unconclusive and impertinent to the
   matter in hand, that they prove nothing but the folly and absurdity of
   those that allege them.

   To the whole matter therefore I answer, that it is most improbable that
   these men were kings; and that the behaviour of Herod and the Jews
   toward them seems clearly to evince so much. For there was no mention
   of any pompous, kingly reception, but on the contrary, he treats them
   as imperiously as he would have done his servants or his footmen, in
   ver. 8, And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go, search diligently
   for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again.
   Which surely sounds not like language fit to bespeak princes in. Those
   indeed whose chief religion is to rebel against princes might possibly
   talk to them also at this rate; but it is not to be imagined that the
   rest of the world were yet arrived to this perfection.

   It is evident therefore that Herod received them not as kings, no, nor
   with that respect that is due to the ambassadors of kings; but rather
   as any of our inferior magistrates would nowadays receive some Polonian
   or Hungarian, that should come to him about a brief, or for a licence
   to shew some strange, outlandish feats upon a stage.

   But lastly, this is an undeniable argument that they were not kings,
   that the evangelist is thus silent of it. For since it is manifest that
   his design was to set forth Christ's birth, and to render it as notable
   and conspicuous as he could from those passages that did attend it; it
   is not imaginable that he would have omitted this, that would have
   added so much of lustre and credit to it in the eyes of the world. The
   omission of it is indeed so hugely improbable, that, all things
   considered, it may almost pass for impossible.

   2. The second thing here proposed to our consideration was the place
   from whence these wise men came. The evangelist describes it only by a
   general term, ap' anatolon, from the east. But the east is of a large
   compass, and therefore we may well direct our inquiries to something
   that is more particular.

   Some therefore are of opinion, that these wise men came from Arabia,
   and that part of it that is called Arabia Felix, which lay eastward to
   Jerusalem; especially since their presents consisted of gold, myrrh,
   and frankincense, the proper commodities of those places: for Arabia
   afforded gold, and the adjoining Sabea afforded plenty of all manner of
   spices and perfumes.

   Others there are that affirm these wise men to have come from Chaldea
   or Assyria.

   I shall not trouble myself to produce or confute the several reasons
   upon which either of these opinions are built; but briefly give my
   reasons why neither of them can be admitted.

   For the first. They could not come from Arabia, because there never was
   in Arabia any sort or sect of men known or distinguished by the name of
   magi; and therefore to bring these men from Arabia were altogether as
   absurd, as if in story we should bring the Brachmans, or Indian
   philosophers, from the Orcades, or the Druids from America.

   And as for that reason, that the materials of their presents were the
   native commodities of those regions, it proves nothing; since other
   countries afforded them besides, and however might have them otherwise
   by importation. And when men make presents, they do not always pitch
   upon such things as grow in their own countries, but upon the best and
   richest that they have in their possession.

   In the next place for Assyria or Chaldea: they could not come from
   thence neither, forasmuch as they lay northwards to Jerusalem: so that
   frequently in the prophets, when God threatens the Jews with an
   invasion from the Assyrians, they are still called a nation or army
   coming from the north. But the evangelist expressly says, that these
   men came ap' anatolon, from the east, to which words this opinion is
   utterly irreconcileable.

   Having thus removed these two opinions, I judge it most probable that
   they came from Persia; which as it is confirmed by the concurrent
   testimonies of the most eminent divines, both ancient and modern, so
   there wants not also solid reasons to persuade the same.

   (1.) The first of which shall be taken from this; that this sort of men
   most flourished in Persia: they were most famous there. And I believe
   there may be better arguments brought to prove that the magi had their
   first rise there, than any can be brought to the contrary.

   (2.) The second reason shall be taken from the situation of the place,
   Persia being situate eastward to Judea; so that it exactly answers the
   words of the evangelist.

   (3.) The third and last shall be taken from the manner of their doing
   homage to Christ, which was that used by the Persians in expressing
   their homage to kings, namely, by gifts and presents.

   These reasons seem probably to evince that these magi, or wise men,
   came from Persia: and we must know, that in matters of this nature,
   where demonstrations are not to be had, probable conjectures, burdened
   with no inconvenient consequences, are the best arguments, and such as
   any rational mind may well acquiesce in. And thus much for the place
   from whence these wise men came.

   3. The third thing proposed was, the time when they came to Jerusalem;
   for some affirm them not to have come to Jerusalem till two years after
   the birth of Christ, grounding this their assertion upon what is said
   in ver. 16, that Herod sent and slew all the children in and about
   Bethlehem, from two years old and under, according to the time which he
   had diligently inquired of the wise men. Whence they infer Christ to
   have been two years old at the time of the wise men's arrival at
   Jerusalem. But the words of the text import the time to have been but
   very small between the birth of one and the coming of the other; for it
   is said in ver. 1, that when Jesus was born, behold the wise men came;
   which word idou`, behold, according to the phrase of scripture, is
   equivalent with forthwith, or presently, as might be made out by sundry
   parallel places. Besides, that the wise men at their coining found
   Christ in Bethlehem, where yet it is certain that Joseph and Mary
   tarried not above forty days, the time appointed by the law for her
   purification; from whence it follows, that the coming of the wise men
   must needs have been within the compass of those forty days. As for
   that argument grounded upon Herod's killing the children of two years
   old and under, according to the time of his inquiring of the wise men,
   the solution of it is very easy, if we reckon those two years before
   the time of his inquiry, and not those two years that immediately
   followed it. The reason of which is manifest, forasmuch as the wise men
   spoke not of Christ as yet to be born, but of him as actually born;
   though the precise time when, they declared not, nor perhaps knew. And
   therefore Herod, whose design was to secure himself from a rival king,
   whom he heard was already born, killed all the children that were born
   within the space of two years before the coming of the wise men and his
   inquiring of them. From whence it follows, that the time of the wise
   men's coming to Jerusalem was some few days after the birth of Christ,
   probably nine or ten, and that they worshipped him at Bethlehem about
   the twelfth, the day still observed by the church for its
   commemoration.

   And now, as we have here removed the opinion of those that state the
   time of the wise men's coming to Jerusalem two years after the birth of
   Christ; so another opinion, that makes the star to have appeared two
   years before Christ's birth, is no less to be rejected, since they gave
   it the appellation of his star upon this account, that it then declared
   him to have been born. And whereas some, in defence of this opinion,
   allege the improbability of their coming from Persia in so few days, I
   answer, that if they be allowed to have come from those parts of it
   that lay nearest to Jerusalem, (as well they may,) it is not improbable
   at all; since a very learned commentator upon this place says, that
   some parts of Persia were not distant from Jerusalem ultra ducentas
   leucas, which, reckoning five hundred paces to a leuca, as some do,
   amount to an hundred of our miles. If fifteen hundred, as Ammianus
   Marcellinus does, then they make three hundred of our miles. The former
   of which they might go in that time very easily, and the latter with no
   such extraordinary great difficulty; considering that camels, the
   beasts of travel in those countries, are said even with great burdens
   to despatch forty of those leucas, that is, according to the latter and
   greater computation, threescore of our miles in a day. And thus much
   for the third thing, viz. the time of these wise men's coming to
   Jerusalem.

   4. The fourth thing proposed to be considered was, what this star was.
   Where though some have affirmed it to have been of the same nature with
   those that have their proper place and motion in the celestial orbs,
   and though that omnipotent God, that made the sun stand still at one
   time, and go back at another, cannot be denied to have been able to
   have commanded any of the stars upon such a message and employment, yet
   that he actually did so is not necessary for us here to assert, there
   being otherwise sufficient reasons to persuade us that this was not a
   real star of the same kind with those heavenly bodies, but only a
   bright meteor formed by the immediate power of God into the resemblance
   and similitude of a star, and so by a singular act of his providence
   used and directed to this great purpose. For had it been indeed a real
   star, there can hardly any reason be assigned why it should not have
   appeared to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as well as to those wise men
   in their journey from thence to Bethlehem; which yet it is clear that
   it did not, from the evangelist's being wholly silent of it; who
   otherwise would undoubtedly have recorded it as a passage, than which
   none could be more efficacious, to upbraid the Jews with the
   unreasonableness of their unbelief. Nor does its being called a star
   prove it to have been really so: it being so usual, both in scripture
   and common speech, to call the resemblances of things by the names of
   those things themselves, comets and falling stars still obtaining this
   appellation, which yet have nothing of stars in them but the name.

   5. The fifth and last thing proposed to be discussed was, how these
   wise men could collect or come to know our Saviour's birth by their
   seeing this star. Evident it is from the words that they had a full and
   clear knowledge of it: for they spake of it as of a thing granted; and
   therefore they ask not whether or no he was born, but where he was
   born. And they call it emphatically his star; We have seen his star in
   the east; implying that it pointed him out by a certain and peculiar
   designation.

   To this I answer; that all knowledge must commence upon principles
   either natural or supernatural.

   If they draw it from the former, it must have been either,

   1. From the principles of astrology; and here, for the confutation of
   this, would the time and measure of this exercise permit, the vanity of
   this science might easily be shewn, from the weakness of its
   principles; the confessions of such as have been most reputed for their
   skill in it; and, what is stronger than their confessions, from their
   frequent mistakes and deceptions in their most confident predictions;
   which sufficiently prove the greatest pretenders to it to be indeed but
   mere planetaries; that is, as we may well interpret it from the force
   of the word, such as use to err and to be deceived, and consequently,
   that nothing certain can be concluded from their principles.

   2. Or secondly, if these men's knowledge of Christ's birth by the star
   were natural, the former way being removed, it must needs have been
   from tradition. And as to this, some affirm that they gathered it from
   that prophecy of Balaam continued down to them by report from his time,
   which prophecy is recorded in Numb. xxiv. 17, that a star should rise
   out of Jacob; and also that they might learn it from several prophecies
   of the sibyls, one of which sibyls prophesied in Persia. But how much
   soever these prophecies of the sibyls may have obtained in the world,
   yet most of them relating to Christ are proved by the learned Casaubon
   to be spurious and supposititious, and by all wise men believed to be
   such.

   Others affirm, that this might have been first learned from the Jews,
   in the time of their dispersion. But especially from some remaining
   traditions of Daniel. And certainly, when we consider how much this
   prophet writes of the kingdom and coming of the Messiah, it is no ways
   improbable but that he might otherwise, both by writing and word of
   mouth, leave many things behind him concerning the same. All which,
   through the greatness of the place he held in the Persian court, and
   the vast repute that he had for his knowledge and learning, might
   easily find both a general and a lasting reception.

   It cannot therefore be rationally denied, but that these wise men might
   be much directed by such helps as these. But yet I affirm that these
   were not sufficient; so that we must be forced to derive their
   knowledge of Christ by this star from a supernatural cause; that is,
   from the immediate revelation of God: how, or in what manner, that
   revelation was effected, it is not necessary for us to know; but that
   they were such persons, to whom God upon other occasions did vouchsafe
   extraordinary revelations, is clear from the twelfth verse, where it is
   said, that they were admonished by God in a dream not to return to
   Herod. Now it is very probable that the same God who warned them of
   their danger, first suggested to them this great discovery; especially
   since it was not so difficult to escape the one, as to find out the
   other. We must conclude therefore, that it was neither their own skill,
   nor yet the light of that star, that taught them the meaning of that
   star. But Leo states the matter rightly in his fourth sermon upon the
   Epiphany: Praeter illam stellae speciem quae corporeum incitavit
   obtutum, fulgentior veritatis radius eorum corda perdocuit. Star-light
   is but a dim light to read the small characters of such mysteries by.
   He only that made the stars could discover it; even that God who rules
   their influences, and knows their significations.

   And thus much for the first notable circumstance of our Saviour's
   nativity, namely, the solemn address of the wise men to him from the
   east, upon the appearance of a star. I come now to the

   Second, which was, Herod's behaviour thereupon; who being a person so
   largely spoken of in the Jewish story, so particularly noted by the
   evangelist, and made yet more notable by having the birth of the great
   Saviour of the world fall in his reign, he may well deserve our
   particular consideration: accordingly we will consider him in these
   three respects.

   1. In respect of his condition and temper in reference to his
   government of Judea.

   2. Of his behaviour and deportment upon this particular accident.

   3. Of the influence this his behaviour had upon those under his
   government.

   And first for the first of these; we will take an account of his
   condition and temper in reference to the government held by him, by
   these three things recorded of him, both in sacred and profane story.

   1st, His usurpation: 2dly, His cruelty: and 3dly, His magnificence.

   1. And first for his usurpation. When the government of Judea was took
   from the Asmoneans, the last of which that reigned was Antigonus, this
   Herod, the youngest son of Antipater, an Idumean, (who had grown up
   under Hyrcanus, being by him employed in the chief management of the
   affairs of his kingdom,) through the favour of Marcus Antonius, was by
   the Roman senate declared king of the Jews; in which dignity, to the
   wonder of many, he was also confirmed afterwards by Augustus himself.
   But Herod had a good purse, and having also well experienced Jugurtha's
   observation of Rome, that it was urbs venalis, knew how to open it for
   his advantage as well as any man living: which, together with his great
   courage and resolution, lifted him up to, and settled him in a royal
   throne, so much above the pitch of any thing that by his birth he could
   pretend to. But let men be usurpers, and as false and wicked as they
   will, yet God is still righteous, and will serve and bring about his
   righteous purposes, even by their wickedness. And I question not but
   the success of Herod's projects was chiefly from the special providence
   of God, while the villainy of them was wholly from himself: for by this
   strange and unexpected translation of the Jewish government, in setting
   the crown of it upon a stranger's head, was exactly fulfilled that
   eminent and most remarkable prophecy of the Messias, in Gen. xlix. 10,
   That the sceptre should not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
   between his feet, until Shiloh come.

   2. The second thing observable of him was his cruelty. We have already
   seen him seated in the Jewish throne, though an usurper and an
   intruder, and one who had no other title to that sovereignty, but the
   gift of those who had no right to give it. However, being thus
   possessed of it, he must have recourse to the common method of
   usurpers, and maintain by blood what he had got by injustice.
   Accordingly he assassinates all such as he could but suspect might be
   his competitors. Aristobulus, the last of the Asmonean race, and
   preferred by him at the instigation of his wife Mariamne to the high
   priesthood, because the affections of the people were towards him, was
   by his appointment treacherously drowned. Nor spares he Hyrcanus
   himself, his predecessor, though now in the extremity of old age, and
   the person who had raised his father Antipater to that pitch as to give
   him, his son, the possibilities of a kingdom, and consequently of doing
   all this mischief. Nay, and his beloved wife Mariamne also, and his own
   sons Alexander and Aristobulus, and, at length too, his base son
   Antipater; and, which was the most unparalleled piece of barbarity that
   ever was acted, last of all, those poor infants also, (which we shall
   presently speak of,) they must all fall a sacrifice to his remorseless
   cruelty: so that neither the innocence of infancy, the venerableness
   and impotence of old age, the sacred obligations of gratitude, the love
   of a wife, nor, lastly, the endearing relation of a son, could prevail
   any thing against the inhuman resolves of his base and cruel
   disposition; which gave occasion to that sarcastical speech of Caesar
   Augustus concerning him; "That it was better to be Herod's hog, than
   his son." For as a proselyted Jew, he would not meddle with the former;
   but as worse than a Jew, he barbarously procured the murder of the
   latter.

   3. The third thing observable in the temper of this Herod was his
   magnificence. There was none that reigned over the Jews, Solomon only
   excepted, that left such glorious monuments of building behind them as
   did Herod. The temple, the arx Antonia, and his own houses,
   sufficiently declared his vast and boundless spirit: any one of which
   had been enough to have ennobled the reign of any one prince: but this
   was all for which he was laudable: God sometimes thinking it fit to
   give a man some one good quality to season his many bad ones; and so to
   keep him sweet above-ground. Herod did many things of public advantage,
   and yet he scarce deserved the reputation of a public spirit, when the
   end and design drove at by him in all he did was his own private glory,
   and the gratification of his ambition. The consideration of which may
   teach us how great a riddle the actions of most men are, even in their
   most specious and public undertakings. The action may be sometimes of a
   national emolument, and yet the spring and design that moves it be but
   personal. Few men know what disguises are worn upon the public face of
   things, and how much the world is beholding to some men's pride and
   vain-glory, which often supply the office of charity in those worthy
   benefactions they pass upon the public; while, in the mean time, the
   good of those that are benefited by such works is the least thing in
   the thoughts of those that did them. So far from impossible or improper
   was that supposition made by the apostle Paul in 1 Cor. xiii. 3, of a
   man's bestowing all his goods upon the poor, and yet not having
   charity. For it is not the bulk or outside of the action, but the mind
   and spirit directing it, that stamps it charitable. Men may give large
   sums, and do generous actions, upon as great designs of selfishness as
   ever the vilest miser or usurer entertained, when he amassed heaps upon
   heaps within his greedy coffers; only with this difference indeed, that
   one in all this feeds his pride, the other his covetousness. But surely
   pride is as much a vice as covetousness, though not always of so ill
   effect to those that are about it. It is not what a man does, but how,
   and why, that denominates his action good or evil before God. Herod may
   be Herod still, for all his building of a temple.

   And thus much for the three qualifications observable in Herod's
   person.

   2. The second thing to be considered of him was, his behaviour upon
   this particular occasion of the wise men's coming to Jerusalem from the
   east, to inquire after him that was born king of the Jews, at the
   nativity of our blessed Saviour; which behaviour of his shews itself in
   these two things.

   1. In that trouble and anxiety of mind that he conceived upon this
   news. He was full of suspicious, misgiving, and perplexing thoughts,
   what the issue of things might be, and how he should be able to
   maintain himself in the throne, against the claim of the right owner,
   which he knew he held by no other title but that of injury and
   usurpation.

   2. His behaviour shews itself in that wretched course he took to secure
   himself against his supposed competitor; which was by slaying all the
   children born in and near to Bethlehem, from two years old and under;
   the time within which he had learnt from the wise men that Christ must
   have been born.

   It must be confessed here (which yet certainly is very strange) that
   Josephus, who is so particular in recording most things relating to
   Herod's reign, yet speaks not a word either of the birth of Christ, or
   of the appearance of the star, or of the wise men's coming to Herod
   thereupon; nor, lastly, of the massacre of these children. All of which
   (one would think) were too great and too considerable passages to be
   passed over in silence by such an historian as Josephus.

   However, this ought not to shake our faith of these things at all;
   since if the evangelists had falsified in these narratives, it is
   infinitely improbable, that the enemies of the Christian religion, who
   could so easily have convinced them of such falsification, should not
   some time or other have objected it against the truth of our religion,
   which yet they never did; but on the other hand, it is hugely probable,
   that Josephus, a great zealot in the Jewish religion, and consequently
   a mortal hater of ours, might, out of his hatred of it, omit the
   relation of these passages which were likely to give it so much
   reputation in the world. But as for the passage of his murdering the
   infants, Ludovicus Capellus is of opinion, that in that place where
   Josephus says, that Herod, drawing near his death, summoned the noblest
   of the Jews by a menacing edict from all parts of Judea, and shutting
   them up, gave order to his sister Salome, and her husband Alexas, to
   see them all put to the sword after his death; it was Josephus's
   intent, by this device, to slubber over the massacre of these
   innocents; thus not wholly omitting it, and yet by so obscure a
   narrative not clearly and plainly discovering it. But whether this
   observation have any weight in it or no, I hope the testimony of those
   whose writings have been opposed, but never yet confuted, or convinced
   of falsity, will have more authority and credit with us, than the
   ambiguity and shuffling of a partial historian.

   3. The third thing proposed to be considered by us was, the influence
   that this behaviour of Herod had upon those under his government. For
   the text tells us, that not only he was troubled himself, but that all
   Jerusalem was also troubled with him: yet not for any love they bore
   him, we may be sure. But they were troubled and disturbed with the
   fears they had of what the rage and jealousy of such a tyrant might
   produce: for seldom does a tyrant confine his troubles within his own
   breast, but that those about him also go sharers in the smart of them.
   And what the prophet said of Ahab may be as truly said of Herod, and
   all such usurpers, that they are those that trouble Israel. For usually
   such persons neither rise nor fall, but at the cost of the people's
   blood, and the expense of many innocent lives. When tyrants and
   victorious rebels invade the regal power of any nation, the people must
   not expect to rest quiet either in peace or war: nor were the Jews here
   deceived in their ill-boding presages of what mischief would ensue upon
   Herod's discontents. Such a cloud could not gather over their heads for
   nothing. And long it was not before it broke out in that bloody shower
   that has been made mention of. From all which we may learn how much it
   concerns the tranquillity and happiness of a kingdom to stop the first
   pretences and encroaches of usurpers; and as much as in them lies to
   keep all Herods and Cromwells from getting into the supremacy. For as
   soon as their own guilt and suspicion shall alarm them with any fears
   of the right owner's regaining his inheritance, then presently the
   whole nation is in danger of being forced to a war, to defend and fight
   for those whom they have more heart to fight against. Or in case
   Providence shall favour them so far as to enable them to turn, their
   swords against such domestic pests, yet they must still purchase their
   delivery by a war; that is, rid themselves of one calamity by another.
   So that we see, when Herods and usurpers once ravish the government
   into their hands, whether they stand or whether they fall, all
   Jerusalem is like to be troubled with them.

   And thus I have finished what I proposed from the text, namely, the two
   grand circumstances of our Saviour's nativity. I shall now close up all
   with a resolution of this short question, Why that Jesus Christ, being
   born the right and lawful king of the Jews, yet gave way to this bloody
   usurper, and did not, either in his or his successor's time, assume the
   government himself?

   In answer to which, though I think it a solid and satisfactory reason
   of all God's actions to state them upon his mere will and pleasure; yet
   there are not wanting other reasons assignable for this.

   I shall pitch upon two.

   1. Christ balked the kingly government of the Jews, because his
   assuming it would have crossed the very design of that religion that he
   was then about to establish; which was, to unite both Jew and Gentile
   into one church or body. But this union could not possibly be effected
   till the politic economy of that nation, so interwoven with the
   ceremonial and religious, like the great partition-wall, was broken
   down. Upon good reason therefore did Christ refuse to undertake the
   kingly government, and therein the support of that nation, the politic
   constitution of which, through the special providence of God, in order
   to the propagation of the Christian religion, was now shortly to expire
   and to be done away.

   2. Christ voluntarily waved the Jewish crown, that he might hereby
   declare to the world the nature of his proper kingdom; which was to be
   wholly without the grandeur of human sovereignty and the splendour of
   earthly courts. In Luke xvii. 20 it is said, that the kingdom of God
   cometh not with observation. So we read it. But the Greek is kata`
   phantasi'an, that is, with pomp and gayety of outward appearance. For
   so the word signifies. Whereupon, in Acts xxv. 23, when Agrippa and
   Bernice came in much splendour and magnificence to visit Festus, it is
   said that they came meta` polles phantasi'as, which is there well
   rendered, with much pomp.

   This being so, men may save themselves the labour of entering into
   covenants, raising armies, and cutting of throats, to advance the
   sceptre and kingdom of Jesus Christ: for Christ has no need of their
   forces: he came to cast out such legions, and not to employ them. Here
   in this world he owns no sword but that of his Spirit, no sceptre but
   his word, no kingdom but the heart. This is his prerogative royal, to
   govern our wills, to command our inclinations, and to reign and lord it
   over our most inward affections.

   Which kingdom, God of his mercy daily propagate and increase within us.

   To which God be rendered and ascribed., as is most due, all praise,
   might., majesty, and dominion., both now and for ever. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON LVII.

  MATTHEW x. 37.

   He that loves father or mother better than me is not worthy of me.

   OUR Saviour in these words presents himself and the world together as
   competitors for our best affections; which because we never fasten upon
   any thing but for some precedent apprehension of worth in it, he
   therefore treats with us not upon terms of courtesy but reason,
   challenging a transcendent affection on our parts, because of a
   transcendent worthiness on his. He would have it before the world, for
   this cause only, that he deserves it above the world.

   Now because men might be apt to flatter themselves into a false
   persuasion of their love to Christ, the heart being no less the seat
   and shop of deceit, than it is of love; lest, I say, they might baffle
   and impose upon themselves, (as sad experience shews, that most men do
   in this particular,) our Saviour, with great art, selects and singles
   out those enjoyments that are most apt to seize and engross our
   affections, and particularly states the sincerity of our love to him,
   in the superiority of it over our love to those. An ordinary affection
   relating to an extraordinary object is no affection. When Christ is the
   thing that we are to love, between the highest degree of love and a
   total negation of it, there is no medium; as it is said of Jacob, that
   he loved Rachel, but he hated Leah; because he loved Leah the less of
   the two. So if a man loves the world in a greater degree, and Christ in
   a less, when God shall come to take an estimate of that love, he will
   make no allowance for the comparison, but account that man absolutely
   to love the world and to hate Christ. For not to value him more than
   all, is really to undervalue him.

   For the exposition of the words we must here observe, that these terms
   father and mother are not to be understood in a literal, restrained
   sense, only as they signify such relations; but they are to be taken
   more largely, as they comprise whatsoever enjoyments are dear unto us:
   it being usual in scripture to express all that is dear to us by some
   one thing that is most dear. As it is a frequent synecdoche, to express
   the whole by some one principal part. Prov. xxiii. 26, My son, give me
   thy heart. God here requires the service of the whole man; but the
   heart is only expressed, as being the prime ruling part.

   Now the affection we bear to our parents is the greatest that we are to
   bear to any worldly thing, and that deservedly. For if, under God, they
   gave us our beings, we may well return them our affections. So that
   Christ by demanding a love greater than that which upon a natural
   account is the greatest, and by preferring himself before that
   enjoyment which is the dearest, he does by consequence prefer himself
   before all the rest. For he that is above a prince, is consequentially
   above all his subjects.

   As for the next expression, he is not worthy of me; it may seem from
   hence to be inferred, that he who should love Christ above father or
   mother, or any other worldly enjoyment, would thereby become worthy of
   Christ. But yet to affirm that any man may so qualify himself, or do
   that which may render him worthy of Christ, would be apparently to
   introduce and assert the doctrine of merit; a thing of the highest
   absurdity, both in reason and religion.

   In answer to this therefore we may observe, that there is a twofold
   worthiness.

   1. A worthiness strictly and properly so called, which is according to
   the real inherent value of the thing; and so no man by the choicest of
   his endeavours can be said to be worthy of Christ. He can no more merit
   grace than he can merit glory, and both are included in Christ. Obtain
   them indeed we may, but we can never deserve them. Worthiness is a
   thing that man can never plead before God; but after we have done all,
   we are still unprofitable, and therefore still unworthy.

   2. There is a worthiness according to the gracious acceptance of God,
   which is a worthiness improperly so called: when a thing is worthy, not
   for any value in itself, but because God freely accepts it for such.
   This worth may be rather termed a fitness or a meetness, not consisting
   in merit, but in due conditional qualifications. And so he that loves
   father or mother less than Christ is in this sense worthy of him; that
   is, fitly prepared and qualified to receive him; as having that which
   God is pleased to make the only condition upon which he bestows Christ.

   These things being premised by way of exposition, I shall draw forth
   and prosecute the sense of the words in these three particulars.

   I. I shall shew what is included and comprehended in that love to
   Christ that is here mentioned in the text.

   II. I shall shew what are the reasons and motives that may induce us to
   it.

   III. What are the signs, marks, and characters whereby we may discern
   it.

   I. As for the first of these, what is included in the love here spoken
   of, I conceive it may include these five things.

   1. An esteem and valuation of Christ above all worldly enjoyments
   whatsoever. The first foundation stone of this love must be laid in
   admiration, and an high persuasion of that worth that we are to love.
   We must first believe Christ excellent, before we can account him dear.
   Those that profess and avow a love to Christ, and yet, by the secret
   verdict of their worldly minds, place a greater esteem upon a pleasure,
   upon honour, upon an estate, do indeed speak contradictions, and delude
   themselves, and may as well believe their life may remain when their
   soul is departed, as imagine that their love may go one way, and their
   esteem another. Upon which account it is clear, that Christ must be
   first raised above the world in our judgments; he must first rule
   there; he must lord it in our thoughts, and command our apprehensions.

   If we trace David through all his Psalms, he is continually breathing
   out an ardent love to God; they run all along in a strain of the
   highest affection. And this love we shall find to have been founded
   upon a proportionable esteem of God, which esteem does eminently appear
   in several expressions. How often does he repeat and insist upon this
   one, Lord, who is like unto thee? Psalm xxxv. 10, and xlxi. 19. His
   thoughts were even transported into a ravishing admiration of God's
   surpassing excellencies, before his heart could be drawn forth in love
   and affection to him; he suffered an ecstasy in his thoughts before he
   did in his desires. And again, Psalm xviii. 3, Thou art worthy to be
   praised. God's worth, presented to the soul by thoughts of esteem, is
   that which so strongly, and, as I may say, invincibly draws its
   affections. It is indeed the price of our desires, and really buys them
   before it has them.

   Some are of opinion that the dictates of the understanding have such a
   determining, controlling influence upon the will and affections, that
   they cannot but desire whatsoever the understanding shall sufficiently
   offer and propose to them as desirable. But whether or no the judgment
   does certainly and infallibly command and draw after it the acts of the
   will, (which is a controversy too big to be discussed in a sermon,) yet
   this is certain, that it does of necessity precede them, and no man can
   fix his love upon any thing, till his judgment reports it to the will
   as amiable. This must be the only gate and portal through which we must
   introduce loving thoughts of Christ into the heart; he must be first
   valued before he can be embraced. For this is undoubtedly certain, that
   nothing can have a greater share of our affections, than it has of our
   esteem.

   2. This love to Christ implies a choosing him before all other
   enjoyments. For a man to pretend affection to Christ, by extolling his
   person, admiring what he has done for us, by praising the ways of God,
   commending the practice and the practisers of godliness; and yet in the
   mean time to act and labour for the world, to live in sin, and upon all
   occasions to submit to a temptation, rather than to a precept;
   notwithstanding this strange opposition and clashing between his
   profession and his course, I suppose every rational man would read his
   judgment, not in his words, but in his choice. Laudant illa, sed ista
   legunt; he that commends such books, but reads others, only shews that
   he praises one thing but values another, and that the best interpreter
   of his mind is not what he says, but what he chooses.

   By this Moses undeniably proved both the strength and sincerity of his
   love to God and to the people of God, that he chose rather to suffer
   afflictions with them, than to enjoy all the pleasures of Pharaoh's
   court. For to have solicited their cause with Pharaoh, to have procured
   them a mitigation of their bondage, to have won them favour and a good
   opinion from the Egyptians, had indeed been signs and effects of love;
   but this was love itself. His affection was in his choice; for had he
   still chose Pharaoh's court, all other things that he could have done
   for his brethren had amounted rather to a good wish, than to a true
   affection.

   Thus, on the contrary, wicked men are said to love death: but can any
   man make his greatest evil the object of his best desire, which is
   love? No, assuredly, while he considers it as such, he cannot; but
   because it is rational from men's choice to infer and argue their love,
   they may be said therefore truly and properly to love death, because
   they choose it. And by the same reason, on the other side, a believer,
   though he may be sometimes ensnared in sin, and so brought to commit
   it, yet he cannot be said indeed to love it, because it is seldom his
   choice, but his surprise; he makes it not his end and his design. It is
   rather a sudden invasion made upon his affections, than the resolved
   purpose of his will.

   Thus therefore we see how the spirit and force of our love exerts
   itself in choice; for the design of love is to appropriate as well as
   to approximate its object to the soul: and to choose a thing is the
   first access to a propriety in it. For choice, as I may so say, is
   possession begun, and possession itself is nothing else but choice
   perfected. Barely to esteem Christ (if we may suppose a division of
   those things which indeed are not to be divided) is as much inferior to
   a choosing him, as a good look is below a good turn.

   3. Love to Christ implies service and obedience to him; the same love
   that when it is between equals is friendship, when it is from an
   inferior to a superior is obedience. Love, of all the affections, is
   the most active; hence by those who express the nature of things by
   hieroglyphics, we have it compared to fire, certainly for nothing more
   than its activity. The same arms that embrace a friend, will be as
   ready to act for him. This is the natural progress of true love, from
   the heart to the hand: where there is an inward spring, there will
   quickly be an external visible motion.

   When we have once placed our affection upon any person, the next
   inquiry naturally will be, what shall we do for him? And if this be the
   property of love when it lays itself out upon natural objects, we may
   be sure it will be heightened when it pitches upon supernatural. It is
   indeed changed, but withal advanced; the object altered, but the
   measure of the act increased. Divine and heavenly things do indeed
   refine and lop off the extravagancy, but they abate nothing of the
   vigour of our affections.

   Christ has determined the case in short, John xiv. 15, If ye love me,
   keep my commandments. There is more real love to God shewn in the least
   sincere act of obedience, than in the greatest and the most pompous
   sacrifice. Many may please themselves in their fair professions, their
   orthodox opinions, and their judgment about the ways of Christ, but God
   knows there may be much of all this, and yet but little love. It is the
   command that must try that; and believe it, the grand inquiry hereafter
   will be, not what we have thought or what we have said, but what we
   have done for Christ.

   Christ all along in scripture proposes himself to us as our Lord and
   Master; and a servant's love to his master is his service. It was the
   idle servant that God dealt with as his enemy. How does a wicked man's
   love to sin appear, but by his continual, indefatigable acting and
   working for it, obeying its commands, and fulfilling even its vilest
   lusts and most unreasonable desires! Now Christ requires that every
   believer should manifest his love to him in that height and measure,
   that a wicked person manifests his love to sin. So that when he
   required a testimonial of Peter's affection, he did not ask him what he
   thought of him, or what he was ready to profess concerning him: for we
   know he thought him to be the Son of God, Matth. xvi. 16; and he
   professed, that if all others forsook him, yet he would not, Matth.
   xxvi. 33; yet for all this he afterwards both denied and foreswore him.
   Christ therefore exacts a demonstration of his love in service and
   obedience. Peter, lovest thou me? Feed my sheep, John xxi. 17. He knew
   he that would obey and serve him, and execute his commands, loved him
   beyond all possibility of dissimulation. A man usually speaks, but he
   seldom does one thing and thinks another.

   It is natural for love, where it is both sincere and predominant, to
   subdue the party possessed with it to undertake the most servile,
   laborious, and otherwise uncomfortable offices in the behalf of him
   whom he loves. If you will admit the paradox, it makes a man do more
   than he can do. Will is instead of power, and love supplies the room of
   ability. Had the love of Christ but once thoroughly seated itself in
   our hearts, we should find that, according to that most expressive
   phrase of the apostle, it would constrain us. It were but Christ's
   saying, Go, and we should go; Do this, and we should do it. We should
   find a double command, one from Christ and one from our own affection.
   Love without works is a greater absurdity than faith without works;
   faith works by love, and love by obedience. Let none therefore ever
   think to divide himself between God and mammon; to afford his love to
   Christ, but his service to the world. If a man may honour his parents
   but not obey them, keep loyalty to his governor but rebel against him,
   then may also his love stand sincere to Christ while unseconded with
   obedience.

   It is the masterpiece of Satan and our own corruptions, to bring us
   under this persuasion, that we may love Christ without serving him: but
   believe it, it is a destructive and a damnable delusion; equal in the
   absurdity and in the danger: and I believe, if we could divide these
   two, and give the Devil his choice, he would accept of one instead of
   both: give but the Devil your service, and he would give Christ your
   love. We are apt to place all upon persuasion; but how shall we be
   disappointed when God comes to reckon with us for performance!

   4. Love to Christ implies an acting for him in opposition to all other
   things; and this is the undeceiving, infallible test of a true
   affection. We may not only value and commend, but think also that we
   serve Christ by reason of the undiscernible mixture of his and our
   interests sometimes wrapt together; so as to be persuaded that we serve
   and carry on his interest, while indeed we only serve our own in
   another dress. I believe that Jehu did not only persuade others, but
   himself also, that he served the cause of God in destroying the
   posterity of Ahab and the worshippers of Baal; when in truth, God's
   honour and his own safety, the interest of religion and of his crown,
   at that time so particularly met and combined together, that he mistook
   his own meaning, and thought he was all the time honouring of God,
   while he was only endeavouring to establish himself, and pursuing the
   designs of policy under the mask of zeal.

   But when two distinct interests are drawn forth in an open, avowed
   opposition, and visibly confront one another; when those that embrace
   one are apparently discriminated from the other, and none can embrace
   both, but a man must either testify a real affection on one side, or an
   odious indifference and neutrality, then love will appear to be love;
   dissimulation will be rendered impossible, and a man will be judged to
   love there only where he shall dare to appear.

   When Christ and the world, Christ and our honour, Christ and our
   profit, shall make two opposite parties, then is the time to try our
   affections. If one servant should follow two several persons, it were
   hard to discern whose servant he was, while they both walked quietly
   together; but should they once quarrel and come to strokes, we should
   quickly see by his assistance where he had engaged his service. The
   truth is, it is but one and the same league, that is, defensive in
   respect of our friends, and offensive to their enemies. Neither is
   there any defending of Christ's interest, without an active opposing
   that of Satan and the flesh, when the preservation of one lies in the
   destruction of the other. If Christ cannot increase, unless John
   decrease, the Baptist himself must not be spared. Because Peter would
   shew that he loved Christ above the rest, he drew his sword for him. He
   that fights for another pawns his life that he loves him: competition
   is the touchstone of reality.

   It is not to make invectives against sin and the courses of the world,
   or to speak satires against the Devil, that infallibly concludes us to
   be Christ's disciples. Those may chide very sharply, who are yet hearty
   and real friends. But shew me the person who can act with as keen a
   vigour as he speaks; who can put his foot upon the neck of his lust;
   who can be restless and active in circumventing, undermining, and
   defeating his corruption; and all this only for its implacable enmity
   to Christ; such an one indeed declares to the world by a demonstration
   of the highest evidence, that Christ bears the rule and preeminence in
   his affections.

   Had king Josiah spoke great and glorious words of his love to God's
   church, and of his hatred to idolatry, this indeed might have been a
   fair commendation of his zeal to the world, which is often deceived,
   and almost always governed by words: but it could not have at all
   commended his zeal to God, who weighs all such expressions in the
   balance of truth and reality, and finds them wanting.

   But see how this royal person's love to God manifested itself: as soon
   as he succeeded his father, and found the church generally corrupted,
   and idolatry like an usurper reigning in his kingdom, he presently
   throws down the altars, breaks the images, dismantles the high places;
   and all this in opposition to a potent, prevailing interest in his
   kingdom. A friend at court signified but little, when he was to speak
   for idolatry, where the king himself looked upon the church as his
   crown, and the purity of religion as his prerogative. And this was to
   love God and religion indeed, thus to assert them actively, by engaging
   against their fiercest opponents, and building up the divine worship
   upon the ruin of its adversaries. And surely between the most
   glittering professions, the most enlarged vows, and highest verbal
   engagements for God, and between this way of taking up and owning his
   quarrel, there is as much difference, as there is between wearing God's
   colours and fighting his battles.

   5. To assign the greatest and the sublimest instance in the last place.
   Love to Christ imports a full acquiescence in him alone, even in the
   absence and want of all other felicities: men can embrace Christ with
   riches, Christ with honour, Christ with interest, and abundantly
   satisfy themselves in so doing; though perhaps all the time they put
   but a cheat upon themselves, thinking that they follow Christ, while
   indeed they run only after the loaves. What Solomon says of wisdom,
   that they think of religion, that it is good with an inheritance.

   The Devil granted it to be an easy matter for Job to serve God in the
   midst of that great affluence, while God set an hedge round about all
   that he had: but, says he to God, Put forth thine hand, and touch him,
   strip him of all his greatness, his wealth, and honour, and he will
   curse thee to thy face; and if Job's heart had not been made of better
   metal than the heart of the most specious hypocrite in the world, the
   Devil had not been at all out in his advice, but would have certainly
   seen his prediction verified in Job's behaviour.

   Many love Christ as they love their temporal king; while he flourishes,
   and has the opportunity of obliging his dependents, they will be sure
   to stick close by his side: but would they follow him into banishment,
   and pay allegiance to majesty poor, and bare, and forlorn? And if
   Providence should debase him to so low a pitch, could they honour him
   in rags, as much as they do in purple? and give him the same homage
   wandering in the land of strangers, that they shew him riding in the
   head of his own armies?

   No; the case comes to be altered here. When indeed duty and emolument
   conspire, one may easily be performed, because in the very same action
   the other may be intended: but when they part, and virtue is to set off
   itself merely upon the stock of its own worth, there men generally look
   upon it as upon a fair woman without a portion; all will commend, but
   none will marry her.

   But this was the great and infallible demonstration, that all the
   ancient heroes in the faith gave of their love to God, that they took
   him alone for an inheritance and a patrimony, and embraced religion
   separate from all temporal accessions, as the utmost limit of their
   desires, the just measures of their designs, and the sole and ample
   object of their satisfaction. Abraham left his country, his family, his
   estate, following God upon his bare word and command. The disciples
   left all, and followed Christ; the primitive Christians and martyrs
   relinquished every worldly enjoyment even to life itself, and embarked
   all their hopes, all their fortunes and felicities, both present and
   future, in this one bottom, looking for all these, and that which was
   much better and greater than all, entirely in their religion.

   But because human nature has great arguments and reluctancies against
   such an heroic act of piety, God, that he might cast all our duties
   within the rules and measures of reason, which is the proper drawing us
   with the cords of a man, has provided greater arguments to induce us to
   such an undertaking, than flesh and blood can produce against it.

   For when he called Abraham from the very bosom of his friends and
   fortunes, he did not divert his will from one desirable object without
   proposing to it another: but he both answers his desires and obviates
   his fears, in that infinitely full and encouraging promise, Genesis xv.
   1, Fear not, Abraham: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
   A promise that might reach the very utmost of his thoughts, confute his
   doubts, and make good the reason of his obedience in all circumstances
   whatsoever. And Christ makes the same promise to all his, Matth. xix.
   29, that there is none who should leave father, or mother, or lands for
   his sake and the gospel's, but should receive an hundredfold in this
   world, and in the world to come everlasting life. That is, they should
   receive that high satisfaction, pleasure, and peace of mind, that
   should be an hundredfold greater than any that is conveyed to the heart
   of man from the vastest abundance of worldly treasures and enjoyments.
   So that in all these high instances of religion, God is pleased to
   convince as well as to command us to obedience, still interweaving
   argument with precept, and so making our love to him as rational as it
   can be religious.

   And therefore let men frame to themselves what measures of religion
   they please, yet if they cannot love and acquiesce in it, when
   Providence shall leave them nothing in the world else to bestow their
   love upon, but dispossess them of all the former delights of their eyes
   and joys of their hearts, (of which we have but too frequent and
   pregnant examples in many, whose fortunes have been ground to nothing
   by some sad calamities,) such must assure themselves that all their
   love to Christ is trifling and superficial, and far from that sincerity
   that makes it genuine, saving, and victorious over the world.

   And God knows how soon he may bring all our pretences to so severe a
   trial; and what need the weak heart of man will then have of such a
   principle to support it, when it shall find itself beat off from all
   its former holds, bereft of its supplies, and every thing on this side
   heaven frowning and looking sternly upon it. It will be then found that
   religion is not a chimera or a fancy, and that the pious man has
   something or other within him that makes him hold up his head, while
   others in the same calamity droop and despond.

   Where the love of Christ has once possessed itself of the heart, though
   a man lives in the world, yet he lives not upon it. And therefore when
   nothing is imported from without, he can say to the world as Christ did
   once to his disciples, I have meat that ye know not of. A good man,
   says Solomon, is satisfied from himself; he carries his store, his
   plenty, his friends, and his preferments about him. Nothing could more
   excellently and divinely express this condition than those words of our
   Saviour, John vii. 38, He that believes on me, as the scripture saith,
   out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. Cisterns may be
   broke, and we removed from them, or they from us; but he that has a
   fountain within him can never be athirst.

   Having thus despatched the first particular, and shewn those five
   things included in the love to Christ spoken of in the text, I proceed
   now to the

   Second; which is, to shew what are the reasons and motives that may
   induce us to this love.

   And for this I might insist upon that mighty and commanding cause of
   love, the amiableness and high perfection of Christ's person; which
   contains in it the very fulness of the Godhead bodily, all the glories
   of the Deity are wrapt up and included in it; they reach as wide as
   infinity, and as far as eternity. His vast, unlimited knowledge and
   wisdom, his uncontrollable power and his boundless goodness, are all
   objects to excite such an esteem and admiration of him as must
   naturally pass into love.

   Every thing that is but good attracts love, but that which is excellent
   commands it; and then how amiable must that nature needs be of which
   the sun, the gloriousest creature in the world, is but a glimpse, the
   light itself a shadow, and the whole universe, that is, the united
   glories of heaven and earth, but a broken copy and an imperfect
   transcript. Thou art fairer than the children of men, says the prophet
   David, Psalm xlv. 2; and beauty, all confess, is the grand, celebrated
   motive of affection. The whole song of Solomon is but a description of
   those raptures of love into which the church had been raised by a
   contemplation of the unparalleled beauties of Christ. All the
   perfections we behold and admire in the world, either in men or women,
   are but weak traces and faint imitations of the divine beauty, which is
   the original; and which would infinitely more captivate our desires,
   could we see things with an intellectual eye, as clearly as we do with
   a corporeal. But I shall not dwell upon these motives of love drawn
   from the perfection of Christ considered in himself, but as relating to
   us and to our concernments, and so I shall assign these two motives of
   our love to him.

   1. That he is best able to reward our love.

   2. That he has shewn the greatest love to us.

   1. And first for the first of these, that he is best able to reward our
   love. I confess, that to love merely for reward, is not so properly to
   love as to traffic, and flows not from affection but design. But on the
   other side, to love a worthless thing, to embrace a cloud, or for a
   vine to cling about a bramble, is not to bestow, but throw away
   affection. The recompence of reward is a thing always to be respected,
   though not to be solely intended. And the very pleasure and
   satisfaction that the mind finds in loving a worthy and a noble object,
   is a considerable reward of that very love. Virtue and religion
   composes the thoughts, answers the desires, and satisfies the
   conscience of him that loves it. The absolving clearness of which is a
   gratuity much greater than any that either the pleasure of the sin or
   of the world can bestow. The sensual epicure catches at the delights of
   sense, and lets out the whole stream of his desires upon them. But what
   answer and return do they make him? Does he not find them like the
   apples of Sodom, rotten as well as alluring, fair to the sight, but
   crumbled into ashes by the touch? How do they vanish into smoke and
   air, and nothing, and lose all their credit upon experience! Trial puts
   a period to them, as it must do to all empty, phantastic enjoyments,
   that owe their value only to distance and expectation.

   Those that have been the most insatiable lovers of pleasure, profit,
   and honour, and such other worldly incentives of love; and have had all
   their desires pursued and plied with constant surfeiting fruitions of
   them; let them at last run over all with a severe and a reflecting
   thought, and see whether they have not been rather wearied than
   satisfied, their love still determining in loathing, or at least in
   indifference. How have they been paid for all their love? Why, some
   have been paid with the wages of poverty, some of diseases, some of
   shame, but all with dissatisfaction. What fruit have we of those
   things? says the apostle most emphatically: which words are not so much
   the voice of a man, as of mankind, upon a survey of all temporal
   fruitions.. There is an emptiness during the enjoyment of them, and a
   sting in the remembrance: present they deceive, and being past they
   disturb. And now must vanity and vexation be took for a valuable price
   of that affection that Christ would purchase with the pleasures of
   virtue and the glories of heaven, with present satisfaction and future
   salvation?

   Go over the regions of hell and mansions of the damned, and there you
   will see how sin and the world have rewarded men for all the love they
   have shewn them. They have made most men miserable, even in this life;
   but did they ever make any one happy in the other? in which alone
   happiness and misery are considerable, as being there alone
   unchangeable. Consider a man making his addresses to his beloved sin,
   as Samson did to his Delilah; he courts and caresses it, sacrifices his
   strength and unbosoms his very soul to it: he breaks through bars, and
   gates, and walls, to visit it; is impatient of wanting the delights of
   its company: and now how is he recompensed for all these heights of
   love? Why, he is answered with tricks and arts, with traps and
   treacheries; he is dissembled with, and betrayed to his mortal enemies:
   those eyes are put out by the person upon whom they doted, and the lap
   he slept in delivers him into perpetual imprisonment, misery, and
   intolerable disgrace. It is impossible for a man to shew more love than
   he does to sin, and it is not possible for his bitterest enemy to pay
   him with more fatal returns. The truth is, a man in all his converse
   with sin courts a serpent, and hugs a scorpion, which will be sure to
   strike and sting him to death for all his kindness.

   But because there are other things besides sin that are apt to bid fair
   for our love, as the possessions and honours of the world, let us see
   what kind of requital they make for that great love that they find from
   their most passionate suitors and pursuers. A man perhaps loves riches
   with that vehemence of desire, that he thinks gold cannot be bought too
   dear, though the price of it be his natural rest, his health, his
   reputation, his soul, and every thing. But now after all this, what
   does he find in it to recompense such an unwearied, unconquerable love?
   Can it ease his conscience, when the injustice by which he gained it
   shall torment him? Can it reconcile him to Heaven? or afford him one
   drop of cold water in hell to cool his tongue when it has brought him
   thither?

   And why then should a man fling away the very spirit and quintessence
   of his soul, his love, upon such an ungrateful object as can make him
   no return? Would he bestow half of his watchings, his labours, and
   painful attendances, in the matters of religion, in stating businesses
   between God and his soul, he might raise himself such an interest, as
   should scorn the batteries of fortune, the injuries of time, and the
   very powers of hell; such an one as should stand victorious and
   eternal, trample upon the world, conquer death, and even outlive time
   itself, Let that thing or person therefore have our love that will give
   most for it: and this shall be the first motive or argument for our
   placing it upon Christ.

   2. The second shall be taken from this consideration, that Christ has
   shewn the greatest love to us. Love is the most natural, proper, and
   stated price of love. It is a debt that is not to be paid but in kind;
   it scorns all other return or retaliation: and Christ is so much
   beforehand with us in this respect, that should we shew him the utmost
   love that humanity is capable of exerting, yet our love could not come
   under the notion of kindness, but of gratitude: for we cannot prevent
   him in the first acts; but only answer him in the subsequent returns of
   it. It is not a giving, but a paying him our affection.

   The united voice of all the world heretofore proclaimed the baseness of
   ingratitude, and you needed not have amplified upon the topic of
   several vices, to have represented a man vile; for that charge alone of
   being ungrateful was a compendious account of all ill qualities, and
   left a greater brand upon a man, than whole volumes of satires and loud
   declamations against him.

   For the truth is, it is a vice that has in it a peculiar malignity,
   tending to dissolve and fret asunder the bands of society, and amicable
   converse between men; forasmuch as society subsists by a mutual
   intercourse of good offices; and if there were no correspondence and
   exchange of one friendly action for another, company could not be
   desirable: and a man might command the same enjoyment in the solitudes
   of a desert and an howling wilderness, that he could in a populous
   city, well inhabited, and wisely governed.

   Every ungrateful person, that receives much kindness, but repays none,
   only acts another kind of robbery, for he really withholds a due, and
   is indeed a thief within the protection of the law. Ingratitude is as
   great a sin in the sight of God, as any that is punishable by the laws
   of men; and has as little to plead for itself upon the stock of human
   infirmity as any sin whatsoever. For nature prompts and even urges a
   man to acknowledge a benefit conferred on him; and that so far, that an
   obligation no ways answered lies like a load and a burden upon an
   ingenuous mind: and a man must have debauched and worn out the natural
   impressions of ingenuity to a very great degree, before he can be
   unconcerned where he has been much obliged.

   Now Christ has obliged us with two of the highest instances of his love
   to us imaginable.

   1. That he died for us. The love of life is naturally the greatest, and
   therefore that love that so far masters this, as to induce a man to lay
   it down, must needs be transcendent and supernatural. For life is the
   first thing that nature desires, and the last that it is willing to
   part with. But how poor and low, and in what a pitiful shallow channel
   does the love of the world commonly run! Let us come and desire such an
   one to speak a favourable word or two for us to a potent friend, and
   how much of coyness and excuse and shyness shall we find! the man is
   unwilling to spend his breath in speaking, much less in dying for his
   friend. Come to another, and ask him upon the stock of a long
   acquaintance and a professed kindness, to borrow but a little money of
   him, and how quickly does he fly to his shifts, pleading poverty,
   debts, and great occasions, and any thing, rather than open his own
   bowels to refresh those of his poor neighbour! The man will not bleed
   in his purse, much less otherwise, to rescue his friend from prison,
   from disgrace, and perhaps a great disaster.

   But now how incomparably full and strong must the love of Christ needs
   have been, that could make him sacrifice even life itself for the good
   of mankind, and not only die, but die with all the heightening
   circumstances of pain and ignominy; that is, in such a manner, that
   death was the least part of the suffering! Let us but fix our thoughts
   upon Christ hanging, bleeding, and at length dying upon the cross, and
   we shall read his love to man there, in larger and more visible
   characters than the superscription that the Jews put over his head in
   so many languages. All which, and many more, were not sufficient to
   have fully expressed and set forth so incredibly great an affection.
   Every thorn was a pencil to represent, and every groan a trumpet to
   proclaim, how great a love he was then shewing to mankind.

   And now surely our love must needs be very cold, if all the blood that
   ran in our Saviour's veins cannot warm it; for all that was shed for
   us, and shed for that very purpose, that it might prevent the shedding
   of ours. Our obnoxiousness to the curse of the law for sin had exposed
   us to all the extremity of misery, and made death as due to us, as
   wages to the workman. And the divine justice (we may be sure) would
   never have been behindhand to pay us our due. The dreadful retribution
   was certain and unavoidable; and therefore, since Christ could not
   prevent, he was pleased at least to divert the blow, and to turn it
   upon himself; to take the cup of God's fury out of our hands, and to
   drink off the very dregs of it. The greatest love that men usually bear
   one another is but shew and ceremony, compliment, and a mere
   appearance, in comparison of this. This was such a love as, Solomon
   says, is strong as death; and to express it yet higher, such an one as
   was stronger than the very desires of life.

   2dly, The other transcendent instance of Christ's love to mankind was,
   that he did not only die for us, but that he died for us while we were
   enemies, and (in the phrase of scripture) enmity itself against him. It
   is possible indeed that some natures, of a nobler mould and make than
   the generality of the world, may arise to such an heroic degree of
   love, as to induce one friend to die for another. For the apostle says,
   that for a good man one would even dare to die. And we may read in
   heathen story of the noble contention of two friends, which of them
   should have the pleasure and honour of dying in the other's stead, and
   writing the inward love of his heart in the dearest blood that did
   enliven it.

   Yet still the love of Christ to mankind runs in another and an higher
   strain: for admit that one man had died for another, yet still it has
   been for his friend, that is, for something, if not of equal, yet at
   least of next esteem to life itself, in the common judgment of all.
   Human love will indeed sometimes act highly and generously, but still
   it is upon a suitable object, upon something that is amiable; and if
   there be either no fuel, or that which is unsuitable, the flame will
   certainly go out.

   But the love of Christ does not find, but make us lovely. It saw us in
   our blood, (as the prophet speaks,) wallowing in all the filth and
   impurities of our natural corruption, and then it said unto us, Live.
   Christ then laid down his life for us, when we had forfeited our own to
   him. Which strange action was, as if a prince should give himself a
   ransom for that traitor that would have murdered him; and sovereignty
   itself lie down upon the block to rescue the neck of a rebel from the
   stroke of justice. This was the method and way that Christ took in what
   he suffered for us; a method that reason might at first persuade us to
   be against nature, and that religion assures us to be above it.

   But such an one that both reason and religion cannot but convince us to
   be the highest and the most unanswerable argument for a surpassing love
   to Christ on our parts, that (be it spoke with reverence) God himself
   could afford us. An argument that must render every sin of so black and
   dismal an hue under the economy of the gospel, that there is no monster
   comparable to the sinner, to him that can hate after so much love, and
   by his ingratitude rend open those wounds afresh that were made only to
   bleed for his offences.

   Having thus shewn the reasons and arguments to enforce our love to
   Christ, I descend now to the

   Third and last thing, which is to shew the signs and characters whereby
   we may discern this love. Love is a thing that is more easily
   extinguished than concealed. It needs no herald to proclaim it, but
   wheresoever it is, it will be sure to shew itself. Fire shines as well
   as burns, and needs nothing but its own light to make it visible and
   conspicuous.

   But yet to make a clearer discovery of the sincerity of our love to
   Christ, I shall give these three signs of it.

   1. A frequent and indeed a continual thinking of him. Where your
   treasure is, (says our Saviour,) there will your heart be also. That
   is, whatsoever you love and value, that will be sure to take up your
   thoughts. Love desires the presence of the object loved, and there is
   no way to make distant things present but by thought. Thought gives a
   man the picture of his friend, by continually representing him to his
   imagination. O how love I thy law! says David; it is my meditation day
   and night. It kept him waking upon his bed, and was a greater
   refreshment to him than his natural repose. Let every man reflect upon
   his own experience, and consult the working of his own breast, and he
   will find how unable he is to shut the door upon his thoughts, and to
   keep them from running out after that thing (whatsoever it is) that has
   seized his affections. Whatsoever work he is about, whatsoever place he
   is in, still his thoughts are sure to be there.

   And can that man then pretend a love to religion, who seldom makes it
   the business of his thoughts and meditations? He that thinks of God but
   now and then, and by chance, or upon the weekly returns of a sermon,
   when the preacher interrupts his other thoughts, shews that God and
   religion are strangers to his heart and his most inward affections.
   David makes this the proper mark and the very characteristic of a
   wicked and a profane person, that God is not in all his thoughts: the
   very bent and stream of his soul is another way. Love is the bias of
   the thoughts, and continually commands and governs the motion of them.
   And therefore if a man would have an infallible account of his own
   heart, let him impartially ask himself, what hours he sets aside to
   meditate upon the matters of religion, the state of his soul, the
   conditions upon which he must be saved, and what evidences he has of
   his repentance, and his interest in the second covenant; as also to
   consider with himself the quality of his sins, and the measures of his
   sorrow; and whether after all he gets ground of his sin, or his sin of
   him. Let every man, I say, inquire of his own heart what time he allots
   for these thoughts, and whether he is not delighted when he can retire
   for this purpose; and on the contrary, grieved and displeased when by
   some cross accident or other he is diverted and took off from thus
   retreating into himself. If he finds nothing of this in the course of
   his life, (as it is to be feared very few do,) let him rest assured
   that he is not in earnest when he calls himself a Christian. For
   Christianity is not his business, his design, and consequently not his
   religion: but applied to him is only a name, and nothing else.

   2dly, The second sign of a sincere love to Christ is a willingness to
   leave the world, whensoever God shall think fit to send his messenger
   of death to summon us to a nearer converse with Christ. I desire to be
   dissolved, and to be with Christ, says the blessed apostle. For is it
   possible for any to love a friend, and not to desire to be with him?
   Upon which account I have often marvelled how some people are able to
   reconcile the sincerity of their love to Christ, with such an
   excessive, immoderate dread of death. For do they fear to be in
   Abraham's bosom, and in the arms of their Saviour? Are they unwilling
   to be completely happy, to be saved and glorified, and to have their
   hopes perfected into possession, and actually to enjoy what they
   profess themselves earnestly to expect?

   Those who have a spiritual sight of these things, and a rational
   persuasion of their title to them, surely cannot look upon that,
   through which they must pass to them, with so much horror and
   consternation. The first effect that a true and a lively faith has upon
   the soul is to conquer the fear of death: for if Christ has done any
   thing for us, he has disarmed that, and took away the grimness, the
   sting, and terror of that grand adversary.

   But some men have so set their heart and soul upon the things of this
   world, that it is death to them to think of dying: they do not so much
   depart, as are torn out of the world: and the separation between this
   and them is harder than that between their soul and their body. How
   intolerable is it to them, to think of parting with a fair estate, a
   flourishing family, and great honour! How hardly are they brought to
   exchange their heaven here below for one above! This is the mind of
   most men, and it shews itself through all their glorious pretences; but
   let those who are so minded, whatsoever love they may profess to
   Christ, rest assured of the truth of this, that they love that most
   which they are willing to relinquish last.

   3dly, A third, and indeed the principal sign of a sincere love to
   Christ, is a zeal for his honour, and an impatience to hear or see any
   indignity offered him. A person truly pious will mourn for other men's
   sins as well as for his own. Mine eyes run down with tears, says David,
   because men keep not thy commandments. He is grieved that God is
   dishonoured, whosoever the person be that does it. He weeps over the
   vicious lives of those that are round about him, though they cannot
   wound his conscience, yet because of the wound and blow that the
   scandal of them gives to religion. For it is the honour and reputation
   of that, that he espouses as his own concernment; forasmuch as every
   man even in temporal things looks upon his very personal interest as
   wrapt up in the credit of his profession. And therefore where such an
   one hears the name of God profaned, religion scoffed at and abused, his
   blood boils, and his heart grows hot within him, and he cannot but
   vindicate the honour of his Maker, in reproving the blasphemer to his
   teeth.

   Some indeed will not discourse filthily or atheistically themselves,
   but can quietly and contentedly enough hear others do so: but let such
   know, that they go sharers in the blasphemy that they do not reprehend;
   and have as little love to Christ, as that son to his father, who
   should patiently hear him reviled and traduced in company, and acquit
   himself upon this account, that he did not revile him himself: or that
   subject to his prince, who could read a libel of him with pleasure, and
   make good his loyalty to him upon this ground, that he was not the
   author of it: though in all base and unworthy actions, the difference
   between the author and the approver of them, by the judgment of all
   knowing persons, is not great.

   Never did our Saviour himself express so keen and fierce an
   indignation, as when he saw men profaning the temple, and turning his
   Father's house into a den of thieves: he then added compulsion to
   complaint, force to his words, and drove out those hucksters in the
   face of danger, and in spite of resistance, fearing neither the
   authority of the rulers nor the insolence of the rabble. Thus did
   Christ manifest his love to his Father, which love he has left as the
   pattern and standard by which we should measure our love to him.

   And thus I have given you some survey of the love that Christ exacts
   from all those who aspire to the name and privilege of Christians. You
   have seen the several parts and ingredients of it, the arguments for
   it, and, lastly, the marks and signs declaring it: which surely will be
   of some use and moment to every man to conduct him in that grand
   inquiry about his spiritual state and condition. If the love of Christ
   is not in him, the merits of Christ's death belong not to him; but he
   is a member of Satan, and a vessel of reprobation. Certainly had men a
   deep and a lively sense of that eternal misery that Christ has declared
   the portion of those who relate not to him, they would give their eyes
   no sleep, nor their thoughts any rest, till they had satisfied
   themselves of that sincerity that alone must stand between them and
   eternal wrath; and withal entitle them to those numerous and great
   blessings that lie wrapt up in the womb of that one comprehensive
   promise, that all things shall work together for the good of those that
   love God.

   To which God be rendered and ascribed, as is most due, all praise,
   might, majesty, and dominion, both now and for evermore. Amen.

SERMON LVIII.

  EPHESIANS iii. 12.

   In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of
   him.

   THERE is no duty or action of religion, in which it concerns a man to
   proceed with so much caution and exactness, as in prayer; it being the
   greatest and most solemn intercourse that earth can have with heaven;
   the nearest access to him who dwells in that light that is indeed
   inaccessible: and in a word, the most sovereign and sanctified means to
   derive blessing, happiness, glory, and all that heaven can give or
   heart desire, upon the creature.

   But since the distance between God and us is so great by nature, and
   yet greater by sin, it concerns us to see upon what terms of security
   we make our address to him: for it cannot be safe for a traitor to
   venture himself as a petitioner into the presence of his prince,
   whatsoever his wants or necessities may be. And that sin puts us in the
   very same capacity in reference to God is most sure; so that if there
   be no accommodation and reconcilement first found out, for any sinner
   to come to God, is but for him to cast himself into the arms of a
   consuming fire, to provoke an imminent wrath, to beg a curse, and to
   solicit his own damnation.

   But Christ has smoothed a way for us, and turned the tribunal of
   justice into a throne of grace; so that we are commanded to change our
   fears into faith; to lift up our heads, as well as our hands, and to
   come with a good heart, not only in respect of innocence, but also in
   respect of confidence.

   For the prosecution of the words I shall endeavour the discussion of
   these four things.

   I. That there is a certain boldness and confidence very well consisting
   with and becoming of our humblest addresses to God.

   II. That the foundation of this confidence is laid in the mediation of
   Jesus Christ.

   III. I shall shew the reasons why the mediation of Christ ought to
   minister such confidence to us in our access to God.

   IVthly and lastly, I shall shew whether or no there be any other
   ground, that may rationally embolden us in these our approaches to him.

   I. And first for the first of these, that there is a certain boldness
   and confidence very well consisting with and becoming of our humblest
   addresses to God. This is evident; for it is the very language of
   prayer to treat God with the appellation of father; and surely every
   son may own a decent confidence before his father, without any
   intrenchment either upon paternal authority or filial reverence. For
   when God by the spirit of adoption has put us into the relation of
   sons, he does not expect from us the behaviour of slaves, and allow of
   no other expresses of our honour to him but distance and amazement,
   silence and astonishment. As for the nature of this confidence, it is
   not so easily set forth by any positive description, as by the
   opposition that it bears to its extremes; which are of two sorts.

   1. In defect. 2. In excess.

   And first, for those of the first sort, that consist in defect.

   1. This confidence is in the first place opposed to desperation and
   horror of conscience. A temper that speaks aloud in those desponding
   ejaculations of the Psalmist, Psalm lxxvii. 7, 8, 9, Will the Lord cast
   off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean
   gone for ever? and doth his promise fail for evermore? Hath God
   forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?
   Every word seems to be the voice of a soul supposing itself in the very
   brink of hell, and even already singed with the everlasting burnings.
   Nor does despair here only put it to the question, as the Psalmist
   does; but takes it for a granted, concluded truth, and verily believes
   that matters stand thus between God and the despairing person; who
   looks upon God as his implacable adversary, and himself as under a
   condemning sentence that is both final and irreversible. Nothing can be
   imagined more black and dismal than those thoughts and representations,
   that such a mind frames to itself of God's power and justice. For it
   thinks that this latter is inexorable, and that the former is wholly
   employed about the execution of its severe decrees. These grim
   attributes constantly exercise and take up the meditations; which
   considered with relation to the state of a sinner, absolutely in
   themselves, and without any qualification or allays from mercy, must
   needs drive a man into all the agonies and terrors of mind that can be.
   For what can a sinner hope for, from power and justice without mercy?
   What can he expect but the extremity of wrath and revenge? a separation
   from God, and a consignation over to eternal miseries?

   But besides, if despair does sometimes think and reflect upon mercy,
   yet it expects no share in it; but supposes the bowels shut up, the
   resentings past, and the day of grace spent and gone. Now so long as it
   thus misrepresents and libels God to the conscience in all his
   attributes, how is it possible for a man to have the confidence to pray
   to him? Despair stupifies and confounds, and stops not only the mouth,
   but the very breath, and, as it were, keeps and confines a man within
   himself.

   It is natural for every thing to fly from an enemy, and while a man
   apprehends God to be so, he would if it were possible convey himself
   out of his very sight. He that presumes to ask a thing of another, is
   prompted to the doing so, by an opinion of the proneness of such a one
   to hear and relieve him in all his straits and necessities; but no man
   puts a petition into the hands of his tormentor, or asks any other
   favour of his executioner but to despatch him quickly. No man can pray
   where he cannot hope.

   That confidence therefore that must qualify us for and attend us in
   prayer, is opposed to all kind of desperation, which by making a man
   account God his enemy, and thereby forbear praying to him, makes him
   indeed his own.

   2. This confidence is opposed also to doubtings and groundless
   scrupulosities. 1 Tim. ii. 8, I will, says Paul, that men pray every
   where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. Why? Suppose
   they should doubt and waver in presenting their prayers to God; James
   i. 7, Let not such an one, says St. James, think that he shall receive
   any thing of the Lord. And the reason is plain; for no man is to pray
   for any thing, but what God both allows and commands him to pray for.
   In which case, if he doubts of the issue and success of his prayer, is
   it not clear that his suspicion upbraids either God's power, that he
   cannot, or his truth, that he will not make good the effects of his
   promise? And would any great man favour a petitioner that should
   entertain such thoughts of him? Would he not rather think himself
   affronted than honoured by such an address? Qui timide rogat, docet
   negare. No man counts himself any longer obliged to do a kindness,
   after he comes once to be suspected: for to suspect a man is to asperse
   his clearness and ingenuity, and plainly declares that we judge him not
   really to be what he pretends and appears; than which there cannot be a
   greater and a more injurious reflection upon the divine goodness.

   God does not love a misgiving, half-persuaded petitioner, that comes in
   suspense, and trembling, sometimes hopes, sometimes fluctuates, and, in
   a word, cannot be so properly said to come as a petitioner, as an
   adventurer to the throne of mercy. God loves to maintain worthy
   apprehensions of himself and of all his dealings, in the minds of such
   as serve him; and it is but reason that those apprehensions should
   shine forth in the freedom of their deportment, and in their frank
   reliance upon his readiness to give or do whatsoever shall be fit for
   them to ask.

   But it will perhaps be pleaded in defence and excuse of such doubting,
   that it arises not from, any unbecoming thoughts of God, but from the
   sense of the unworthiness of him that prays; which makes him question
   the success of his petition, notwithstanding all the divine mercy and
   liberality. And this seems to be so far from a fault, that it ought
   rather to be cherished and commended as an effect of the grace of
   humility.

   But to this I answer, that by the plea of unworthiness is meant either
   an unworthiness in point of merit; and so the argument would keep a man
   from praying for ever, forasmuch as none can ever pretend a claim of
   merit to the thing he prays for, as shall be more fully observed
   hereafter.

   Or 2dly, it is meant of an unworthiness in point of fitness to receive
   the thing prayed for; which fitness consists in that evangelical
   sincerity, that makes a man walk with that uprightness, as not to allow
   himself in any sin. But for a man to plead himself unworthy upon this
   account, is to plead himself unfit to pray: for whatsoever makes him
   fit to pray, makes him fit also to expect the thing asked for in
   prayer. This therefore concerns not the matter in debate; for the
   question is, whether he that is duly qualified for such an address to
   God, can without sin doubt of the issue of that address? Which we deny:
   otherwise it is most certainly true according to that of Solomon, that
   the prayer of the wicked is an abomination to God; and that such an one
   may not only lawfully doubt whether he shall be heard or no, but ought
   to conclude, that without all doubt he shall not be heard.

   But it may be urged further. Does not experience shew, that persons
   that are thus qualified in point of sincerity and uprightness before
   God, do not always obtain the things they sue for, but are sometimes
   answered with a repulse? For did not David earnestly pray for the life
   of his child, and yet was denied it? And the like instances might be
   produced of several other saints. Now where a man is sure that the
   prayers of the righteous are not always granted, may not he very well
   doubt of the success of his own?

   To this I answer; that in that respect that a man ought to pray for any
   thing from God, the prayer of no righteous person was ever denied. For
   every man is to pray for a thing with submission to the divine will,
   and so far as God shall think fit to grant it. And in this respect no
   man is to entertain the least doubt in prayer, but steadfastly to
   believe that God will vouchsafe him the thing he petitions for, so far
   as the ends of God's glory and his own good shall make the granting of
   that thing necessary. Otherwise for a man to expect absolutely and
   infallibly the event of whatsoever he prays for, only because he
   thought fit to pray for it, is a great folly and a bold presumption; it
   is to determine and give measures to the divine bounty and wisdom; to
   tell it what it ought to do; to send instructions to heaven, and in a
   word, it is not so properly to pray as to prescribe to God.

   Having thus shewn the two extremes to which the confidence spoken of in
   the text is opposed in point of defect, I come now to treat of those to
   which it is opposed in point of excess, and to shew, that as it
   excludes despair and doubting on the one hand, so it banishes all
   rashness and irreverence on the other. It is indeed hard for the weak
   and unsteady hearts of men to carry themselves in such an equal poise
   between both, as not to make the shunning of one inconvenience the
   falling into another; but the greater the danger is, the greater must
   be our attention to the rule.

   1. First of all then, confidence in point of excess is opposed to
   rashness and precipitation. Rashness is properly a man's sudden
   undertaking of any action, without a due examination of the grounds or
   motives that may encourage him to it, and of the reasons that may on
   the other side dehort and deter him from it: an omission of either of
   which makes it rash and unreasonable. And prayer surely, of all other
   duties and actions, ought to be a reasonable service. It calls upon him
   that undertakes it to consider before he resolves, again and again to
   consider, into what presence he is going, what the thing is that he is
   about to do, what preparedness and fitness he finds in himself for it,
   what the advantages of a right, and what the sad consequences of an
   undue performance of it are like to be.

   I have read that it has been reported of an holy person, that he used
   to bestow an whole hour at least in meditation before he kneeled down
   to that prayer which perhaps he uttered in three minutes. He that goes
   about to pray, must know that he goes about one of the weightiest and
   the grandest actions of his whole life. And therefore let him turn his
   thoughts to all the ingredients and circumstances relating to it; let
   him meditate before what a pure and a piercing eye he presents himself;
   such an one as shoots into all the corners and recesses of his heart
   like a sunbeam, as ransacks all his most concealed thoughts, views all
   the little indirect designs, the excursions and wanderings of his
   spirit, and spies out the first early buddings and inclinations of his
   corruption. And as it sees them, so it cannot but abhor and detest
   them, unless their guilt be washed off by repentance, and covered under
   the imputed righteousness of a Saviour.

   Let him consider, how it were like to fare with him, if this should
   happen to be his last prayer, and God should stop his breath in the
   very midst of it, and interrupt him with a summons into another world;
   whether, in such a case, he should be found in a fit posture to own an
   appearance at that fearful tribunal, without blushing and confusion of
   face. No man is fit to pray, that is not fit to die.

   Let him consider also, whether there are not the scores of old sins yet
   uncancelled lying upon his hand. Whether he is not in arrears to God in
   point of gratitude for past mercies, while he is begging new; and
   whether he has not abused that bounty that he is now imploring, and
   made the liberality of heaven the instrument of his vanity and the very
   proveditor for his lust; even in a literal sense turning the grace of
   God into wantonness. These things should be recollected and canvassed
   with a deep, close, and intent reflection, and all reckonings (as much
   as possible) set even between God and the soul.

   David would first wash his hands in innocency, before he would presume
   to compass God's altar, Psalm xxvi. 6. But how few are there, that
   think preparation any part of this duty! They bolt immediately into the
   presence of God, though perhaps they come but newly from doing that,
   that they would not own in the presence of men. They come with the
   guilt of fresh sins warm upon their consciences, lifting up those hands
   in prayer that were lately busied in all kind of rapine and violence,
   and joining in it with those tongues that were not long before the
   instruments of railing, filth, and obscenity. As David washed his
   hands, so such persons should do well to wash their mouths also, before
   they approached the place of divine worship, especially when they were
   to bear a part in it. With what awe and veneration did Jacob look and
   think upon the place where God had appeared to him! Gen. xxviii. 16,
   17. Surely, says he, the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And
   he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! it is none other
   but the house of God. But sad experience shews, that men nowadays
   resort to that, that they both call and think the house of God; but yet
   behave themselves in it, as if it were neither holy nor dreadful:
   though if God were not more merciful than men are sinful, they would
   feel by a severe instance that it was both.

   There is some boldness that is the effect of blindness; and surely it
   is this, that brings men to so sacred and so concerning an action as
   prayer is, with such trivial spirits, such rambling unrecollected
   thoughts, and such offensive profane behaviours. But such persons must
   know, that this is far from the boldness mentioned in the text: and
   that though God both allows and enjoins a due confidence "in our
   accesses to him, yet still they are to remember that confidence does
   not exclude caution.

   2. The confidence spoke of in the text, in point of excess is opposed
   to impudence or irreverence; which, the truth is, is but the natural
   effect and consequent of the former: for he that considers not the
   sacredness of a thing or action, cannot easily pay it that devotion and
   reverence that the dignity of it requires. There are many ways by which
   this irreverence may shew itself in prayer, but I shall more especially
   mention and insist upon two.

   (1.) The using of saucy, familiar expressions to God. A practice that
   some heretofore delighted in to that degree of extravagance, that he
   that should have stood without the church, and not seen what was doing
   within it, would have verily thought that somebody was talking to his
   equal and companion. Now the ground of this must needs have been from
   gross, low, and absurd conceptions of God, and withal very fond and
   high opinions of themselves, by which they thought themselves such
   absolute masters of his favour, and bound so close to him by election,
   that they were to bespeak him at a different rate of fellowship and
   peremptoriness from all other mortals. And accordingly, they would
   utter themselves to him as if they were perfectly acquainted with all
   his counsels, knew his mind, and read over his decrees: and if need
   were, could advise him in many matters relating to the government of
   the world.

   And therefore their usual dialect was; We know, Lord, that this and
   this is thy way of dealing with thy saints; and that thou canst not be
   angry with those whose heart is right with thee, though they may
   sometimes out of infirmity trip into a perjury, a murder, or an
   adultery. Nay, and they would tell God to his face, that he had
   revealed such a thing to them; when perhaps within two or three days
   the event proved clean contrary. When their armies were in the field,
   they would usually at home besiege God with such expressions; Lord, if
   thou shouldest forsake us, thy peculiar inheritance, who are called by
   thy name, where wouldest thou find such another praying people? And
   again; Lord, thou mayest, out of anger to the nation, deliver thy
   chosen ones into the hands of their enemies, but consider what thou
   doest. It would be endless, and indeed unsavoury, to draw forth all the
   flowers of their profane rhetoric, with which they so liberally stuffed
   their impudent harangues, which they were pleased to call prayers.

   And the rude familiarity of their expressions was attended with an
   equal rudeness of gesture and motion, throwing forth their arms,
   sweating, and carrying their whole bodies so, as if their prayer was
   indeed a wrestling with God, without a metaphor. But it is strange that
   any should be able to persuade themselves that this should be zeal, and
   the proper fervour of devotion, when common sense and good manners
   generally prompt men to a greater wariness and restraint upon
   themselves in their appearance before an earthly superior. For no man
   shakes his prince by the hand, or accosts him with an hail fellow well
   met. And if the laws and customs of nations will by no means endure
   such boldness to sovereign princes, for fear of debasing majesty, and
   so by degrees diminishing the commanding force of government, surely
   there ought to be more care used in managing our deportment toward God;
   since the impressions we have of things not seen by us are more easily
   worn off, than those that are continually renewed upon the mind by a
   converse with visible objects. And that which will bring us into a
   contempt of our earthly prince whom we see, is much more likely to
   bring us into a light esteem of our heavenly King whom we have not
   seen. We are to use such words as may not only manifest, but also
   increase our reverence; we are (as I may so say) to keep our distance
   from God, in our very approaches to him. But such undue familiarity, as
   it does for the most part arise from contempt, so it always ends in it.

   (2.) This irreverence in prayer shews itself in a man's venting his
   crude, sudden, extemporary conceptions before God. Why God should be
   pleased with that which intelligent men laugh at, I cannot understand.
   And there is nothing more loathsome and offensive to discreet ears,
   than the loose, indigested, incoherent babble of some bold,
   self-opinioned persons, who in their talk are senseless and endless.
   Some indeed sanctify their unpremeditated way of speaking to God, by
   calling it praying by the Spirit; and so entitling the Holy Ghost to
   all their impertinencies, which is to excuse or defend boldness with
   blasphemy. But surely folly is no such difficult thing, that any man
   should need to fetch it from a supernatural cause, and owe his
   absurdities to immediate inspirations. For if this be to pray by the
   Spirit, a man needs only to forget himself, to balk the use of his
   reason, and to let his words fly at random without care or observation,
   and he shall find very plentiful assistances of this nature.

   But to vindicate the Spirit of God from these unworthy imputations, and
   withal to dash such impudent pretences, we are to know, that the Spirit
   measures out his assistance to men in the use of the means proper for
   the effecting or accomplishing of any work; but suspends and denies
   that assistance, where the use of those means is neglected; for he
   cooperates with men according to the established course of working
   proper to their natures: and no man prays and preaches more by the
   Spirit, than he that bestows time and study in the orderly disposing of
   what he is to say; and so employs and exerts those faculties of mind,
   which the Spirit of God endowed him with, for the better and more exact
   management of those holy services that he stands engaged in.

   Were a man to petition his prince, or to plead at the bar for his life,
   I believe none could persuade him to venture the issue of so great an
   action upon his extempore gift. But admit that a man be never so well
   furnished with an ability of speaking suddenly and without
   premeditation; yet certainly premeditation and care would improve and
   heighten that ability, and give it a greater force and lustre in all
   performances. And if so, we are to remember that God calls for our best
   and our utmost; we are to bring the fairest and the choicest of our
   flock for an offering, and not to sacrifice a lame, unconcocted,
   wandering discourse to God, when our time and our parts are able to
   furnish us with one much more accurate and exact. When a Roman
   gentleman invited Augustus Caesar to supper, and provided him but a
   mean entertainment, Caesar very properly took him up with an Unde mihi
   tecum tanta familiaritas? Friend, pray how come you and I to be so
   familiar? Great persons think themselves entertained with respect, when
   they are entertained with splendour; and they think wisely and rightly.
   In like manner God will reject such sons of presumption and
   impertinence with disdain; and though they took no time for the making
   of their prayers, yet he will take time enough before he will grant
   them.

   But besides, to dismiss this supposition, it is indeed scarce possible,
   but much speaking without care or study must needs put the speaker upon
   unseemly repetitions and tautologies, which Christ most peculiarly
   cautions his disciples against as an heathenish thing, in Matth. vi.
   where he prescribes them that excellent form of prayer, composed with
   so much fulness, strictness, and significancy of sense, that it is
   impossible for any thing that is extempore to resemble it. He that does
   not consider and weigh every word of his prayer, will find it very
   unfit to be weighed more severely by God himself in the balance of the
   sanctuary; who will account no man to speak piously, who does not also
   speak properly in his devotions. And therefore I shall conclude this
   particular with that most divine and excellent direction given by
   Solomon concerning this matter, Ecclesiast. v. 2, Be not rash with thy
   mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God:
   for God is in heaven and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be
   few. When we speak to a superior, to use words few and expressive is
   the proper dialect of respect.

   And thus I have finished the first thing proposed for the handling of
   the words, which was to shew that there was a certain confidence well
   becoming our humblest addresses to God, and withal to demonstrate what
   this confidence was; which I have done, by shewing that it is such an
   one as stands opposed both to despair and doubting on the one hand, and
   to rashness and irreverence on the other.

   II. I come now to the second particular, which is to shew that the
   foundation of this confidence is laid in the mediation of Christ. Where
   there is a breach of amity between two persons, of which the offended
   person is much the superior, upon which account his dignity will not
   permit him to seek or offer a reconcilement; as on the other side, the
   inferior condition of him that is the offender will not let him dare to
   attempt one; it is manifest, that unless there be some third person to
   interpose between both, the breach must needs be perpetual and
   incurable. It was thus between God and man, upon his apostasy from God:
   God was too great, too glorious immediately by himself to court his
   rebel creature, and the creature too vile and obnoxious to treat with
   his injured sovereign: whereupon they must have both prepared for
   mutual acts of hostility, had not Christ, God and man, undertook to
   mediate and compromise the difference on both sides; so that every
   sinner has cause to speak to Christ as the Israelites did to Moses, an
   eminent type of him; Speak thou unto us and for us too, and we will
   hear; but let not God the father speak to us, or we to him, lest we
   die. A guilty person is but a bad advocate.

SERMON LIX.

  EPHESIANS iii. 12.

   In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of
   him.

   THE discussion of these words I shall manage in these two particulars.

   I. I shall shew that the confidence becoming a Christian, in his access
   to God by prayer, is founded upon the mediation of Christ.

   II. I shall inquire whether there be any other ground upon which this
   confidence may rationally found itself.

   And first for the first of these, that the confidence becoming a
   Christian, in his access to God by prayer, is founded upon the
   mediation of Christ.

   But now this dependence of our spiritual affairs upon Christ's
   mediation will be yet more evidently set forth in the discussion of the
   third particular:

   III. Which is, to shew the reason why Christ's mediation ought to
   minister such confidence to us in our access to God.

   He that is confident in any action grounds his confidence upon the
   great probability of the happy issue and success of that action, and
   that probability of success is grounded upon the fitness of the person
   intrusted with the management of it. In one word, therefore, the reason
   of grounding our confidence upon Christ's mediation is the
   incomparable, singular fitness of Christ for the performance of that
   work; which fitness will appear by considering him under a threefold
   relation or respect.

   1. In respect of God, the person with whom he is to mediate.

   2. In respect of men, the persons for whom he mediates.

   3. In respect of himself, who discharges this office.

   1. And first we will consider him in relation to God, with whom he is
   to mediate; who also in this business may sustain a double capacity in
   relation to Christ.

   (1.) Of a Father. (2.) Of a Judge.

   (1.) And first if we consider him as his Father, there cannot be a more
   promising ground of success in all his pleas for us. For who should be
   heard and prevail, if not a son pleading before his father? where the
   very nearness of the relation is a more commanding rhetoric than words
   and speeches can bestow upon a cause. Nature itself takes the cause in
   hand, and declaims it with more power and insinuation than the highest
   and the most persuasive oratory. To have the judge's ear is a great
   matter, but his son has his heart also. To be sure of an audience is a
   privilege that every advocate cannot attain to; but he may wait and
   wait, and at length go away unheard; and if perhaps he does obtain an
   hearing, yet he is not sure to carry it on without rubs and
   supercilious checks, that shall dishearten both his client and himself:
   he brings no advantage to the cause by his own person; so that if it
   succeeds, it must be upon the account of an invincible, prevailing
   evidence of merit. It must in a manner be its own pleader. It must
   argue and set off itself, and, without any assistances of favour,
   prevail entirely by the absolute victoriousness of truth.

   But a good cause managed by an acceptable and a favoured person, it is
   like a sharp weapon wielded by a mighty arm, that enters deeper and
   further, being drove home by a double cause, its own keenness and the
   other's strength. It is impossible indeed for the unchangeable
   rectitude of the divine nature to warp or deviate in the least manner
   from truth or justice, out of favour to persons. Yet where favour is
   consistent with justice, as oftentimes it may undoubtedly be, there the
   sonship of the advocate must needs facilitate and promote the cause.
   But however, admitting that favour can have no place in matters of this
   nature, yet it is a solid argument of comfort and encouragement to
   sinners, that their cause is in such hands as can reflect no prejudice
   or disadvantage upon it. Their advocate is not disgusted or obnoxious,
   and in need to plead for himself, before he can be in a capacity to be
   heard for his client. It is enough, that if there be any possibility of
   favour, they are sure of it; that they have an interest on their side,
   an interest founded upon the nearest and the dearest relation. They
   speak to a father by the mouth of his son, and, what is more, of his
   only son; so that they may hope with the highest reason and argument:
   and, to put an impossible supposition, though their cause should fall,
   yet their confidence is founded upon a rock.

   (2.) We will consider God relating to Christ as a Judge. And here we
   will first represent to ourselves all that the office and severity of a
   judge can engage him to. We will consider him with all the rigours of
   justice, void of favour, inflexible, immovable, and exacting all by a
   strict rule, a rule that he will not in the least recede from; a rule
   admitting of no mitigation or dispensation; but awarding to all actions
   a recompence according to the most rigid and nice proportions of
   equality and merit. We will consider him as clothing himself with all
   the terrors of mount Sinai, uttering a fiery law that speaks nothing
   but death and a curse to the disobedient, and requires the forfeit of a
   soul for every transgression. Yet notwithstanding all this, we may with
   confidence rest ourselves upon the mediation of Christ with God for
   these two reasons.

   1st. Because he appears for us not only as an advocate, but as a
   surety, paying down to God on our behalf the very utmost that his
   justice can exact. He suffered, he bled, he died for those for whom he
   intercedes; so that he brings satisfaction in one hand, while he
   presents a petition with another. He undertakes and pays the debt, and
   thereby cancels the bond; so that the law and justice itself have lost
   their hold of the sinner, and he is become a discharged and a justified
   person.

   And surely such an one may pray with confidence and hope for all the
   blessings of divine mercy, when his surety has cleared off all scores
   with his justice. He may take up the apostle's demand, Who shall lay
   any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies; and
   he may add further, It is Christ that intercedes; Christ, that brings a
   price for what he asks, that can plead a right, and, if need be, even
   appeal to God's justice.

   But secondly, we have yet another ground of building our confidence
   upon Christ's mediation with God, though considered as a Judge; because
   he himself has appointed him to this work: It was he that laid help
   upon one that is mighty, as the Psalmist says, Psalm lxxxix. 19, and
   that made the man of his right hand, the Son of man, strong for
   himself, Psalm lxxx. 17. He prepared and endowed him with
   qualifications fit for so great an employment; upon which account he is
   called the Christ, that is, the Anointed of God: for with the Jews,
   kings, priests, and prophets, that is, persons designed to the highest
   offices and charges, were initiated into them by the ceremony of
   anointing: whereupon Christ, who was to sustain all these offices, is
   said to have been anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows.

   But now, if God thus constitutes Christ a mediator between himself and
   sinners, certainly it is an evident demonstration that he will hear and
   accept him in the management of that very work that he called him to
   and put him upon. No judge commands an advocate to speak, and when he
   speaks presently shuts his ears. This would be to contradict himself,
   and to mock the other; which God's truth and goodness will not suffer
   him to do. What Christ does in this matter he does upon the very
   account of obedience, and has a call and a command to vouch for the
   success of his appearance, and therefore cannot be rejected or kept off
   as an intruder. He that bids another ask a thing of him, tells him in
   effect that he is resolved to grant it. He that invites, promises an
   admittance.

   And thus I have shewn Christ's fitness for the work of mediation in
   respect of God, and that, considered either as a Father or as a Judge.

   2. In the next place we are to consider his fitness for this work in
   reference to men, for whom he mediates; which will appear from that
   fourfold relation that he bears to them.

   1. Of a friend. 2. Of a brother. 3. Of a surety. 4. Of a lord and
   master.

   1. And first let us look upon him as a friend; that is, as one that we
   may trust with our nearest concernments as freely as ourselves. And
   Christ has solemnly owned this relation to all believers; so that we
   may with the greatest cheerfulness and assurance commit the presenting
   of our petitions to him, whose care and solicitousness for the success
   of them will be the same with ours. Friendship is an active and a
   venturous thing, and, where it is real, it will make a man bolder and
   more importunate for his friend than for himself. Now Christ has all
   the perfections of human friendship without the flaws and weaknesses of
   it: and surely he will bestow a prayer for those for whom he would
   spend a life. Though the presence of God is terrible to behold, and his
   anger much more terrible to feel, yet Christ has declined neither of
   them, but made his way to the former by a resolute undergoing of the
   latter.

   Many men will indeed profess themselves to be friends, and expect to be
   accounted so: but if at any time they are desired to speak a good word
   to a great person in the behalf of one to whom they have made all these
   professions, they will desire to be excused; they must not spend and
   lavish away an interest upon other people's advantages, but reserve it
   fresh and entire for themselves.

   Sad were the condition of sinners, should the friendship of Christ shew
   itself at this rate. A friend in the court of heaven would do them but
   little good, that would not so much as befriend them with a word. But
   Christ is interceding for us night and day, presenting our prayers to
   the Father, and making them effectual by his own.

   2. Let us consider Christ as a brother, and so we have a further cause
   to repose a confidence in him, in point of his mediation for us. For
   although it does not always fall out that the nearest relations are the
   best friends, yet it is a fault that they are not so; and therefore we
   may be sure that Christ, who cannot commit a fault, cannot but equal
   the nearness of the relation he bears to us with a proportionable
   measure of affection. He is the Son of God by nature, and because we
   cannot be so too, he has made us so by adoption; John i. 12, To as many
   as received him, he gave power to become the sons of God. So that he
   has even united us into one family with himself: Ephes. iii. 15; By
   whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. Nay, and to advance
   the relation yet nearer, because it was impossible for dust and ashes
   to aspire to a participation of the divine nature, he was pleased to
   descend to the assumption of ours, and to become the Son of man not by
   adoption only, but really and naturally: to be bone of our bone, and
   flesh of our flesh; to own the same human affections, and, in a word,
   not to decline our very infirmities.

   Which being so, we may very well own all that confidence of succeeding
   through the mediation of Christ, that the fidelity of a friend and the
   dearness of a brother may administer to us. For should a brother
   prevaricate and prove false, nature itself would seem to fly in his
   face, and upbraid his unhuman perfidiousness. Society would mark him
   out as a common enemy to mankind, and unfit for converse.

   Brotherhood unites persons by a certain tie that is not only forcible,
   but sacred; and to violate it by any falseness or treachery of
   behaviour is to injure not only a man, but even humanity itself. And
   therefore whatsoever business any one puts into his brother's hands, he
   counts as secure as if it were in his own. And we may be sure that
   Christ will be as much more concerned for our affairs than an earthly
   brother, as such a brother would be more than an ordinary acquaintance.

   3. Let us consider Christ as our surety; and so we shall find the same,
   if not a greater cause of being confident of him as our mediator. It is
   not every friend nor every brother that will be a surety, since the
   love that must raise one to undertake this even amongst men, must be a
   love greater than he bears to himself: for he that ventures to be a
   surety for another, ventures an undoing for his sake; and there is not
   any thing less to be wondered at in common life, than to see such
   persons undone: so that nothing is more certain in human affairs, than
   that assertion of Solomon, that he that hateth suretyship is sure.

   But the debt that Christ was our surety for, was as much greater than
   the greatest that befalls men in worldly matters, as eternity is
   greater than time, as heaven is above earth, and the executions of an
   infinite wrath above the slight, weak revenges of a mortal power. He
   bore our iniquities, Isaiah liii. and placed himself before the justice
   of his Father, as responsible for all that the law could charge us
   with: and being made thus obnoxious by his own free choice, wrath came
   upon him to the uttermost: he drank off the cup of God's fury, and
   squeezed out the very dregs. All this he did in our stead, in our room,
   in our persons, whom he represented in all that great action.

   And now, after such an experiment of his love to us, can we doubt that
   he will stick at the lesser and lower instances of kindness? that he
   will refuse to manage and enforce our petitions at the throne of grace,
   who did not refuse to make himself an offering to justice? We may rest
   assured that he will not be wanting to the prosecution of our interest,
   who, by the very office that he has undertook, has made our interest
   his own.

   4thly and lastly, for the further confirmation of our confidence, in
   our addresses to God, we will consider Christ under a very different
   relation from all the former, and that is, as he is our lord and
   master. Majestas et amor, sovereignty and love, (as the poet observes,)
   do but ill cohabit in the same breast; and the truth is, love prompts
   to service, and sovereignty imports dominion, and so proceed in a very
   contrary strain. Yet Christ has united them both in himself: for as he
   is the most absolute of lords, so he is the best and the most faithful
   of friends, the kindest brother, and the ablest surety. Nay, and he has
   founded our friendship and our subjection to him, things very
   different, upon the same bottom, which is, obedience to his laws; John
   xv. 14, Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. And
   elsewhere he tells us of the homage we owe him, in John xiii. 13, Ye
   call me Lord and Master: and ye do well; for so I am. But this
   relation, though it speaks superiority and distance, yet it imports
   also kindness and protection. For what master is there, of a worthy and
   a generous spirit, that does not espouse the interest and good of his
   servant, and esteem himself answerable for it as for a trust, which all
   the principles of religion, humanity, and good-nature will call him to
   an account for?

   Christ shews sufficiently how far he owns himself concerned for his
   servants, where he declares, that he looks upon every courtesy or
   injury done to the least of them as done to himself, in Matt. xxv. 45.
   And as he owns them before men, so he is not ashamed to acknowledge
   them before his Father in heaven; to further their prayers, to endear
   their persons, to recommend their services, and, in a word, to be their
   constant, indefatigable intercessor.

   Now, under this relation of lord, I suppose we may consider that also
   by which Christ owns himself for our head; than which there cannot be
   one more peculiarly fitted to encourage us in the business of prayer.
   For when any of the members are aggrieved, or ill at ease, it is the
   head that must complain and cry out for relief. Nor needs it any
   intelligence from the afflicted part; but it feels it by a quick
   sympathy, and utters what it feels by a kind of necessity. And it is as
   impossible for an arm or a leg to be broke, and the head to be
   unconcerned, as for any member of the mystical body of Christ to be
   under a pressing calamity, and for Christ, the head, not to be sensible
   of that misery, and to vent his sense of it by a vigorous intercession
   with his Father for its removal.

   And thus I have shewn those four relations that Christ bears to
   believers; every one of which is a pregnant and a forcible argument for
   us to depend upon his mediation for the success of our prayers and the
   acceptance of our persons, in all our addresses to the Father.

   3. I come now, in the third and last place, to demonstrate the fitness
   of Christ to be a mediator for us, by considering him in respect of
   himself, and those qualifications inherent in him, which so
   particularly qualify and dispose him for this work: of which I shall
   mention and insist upon three.

   1. That he is perfectly acquainted with all our wants and necessities.

   2. That he is heartily sensible of and concerned about them.

   3. That he is best able to express and set them forth to the Father.

   1. And first for the first of these, his acquaintance with our
   condition. We need not spend much time or labour to inform our advocate
   of our case: for his omniscience is beforehand with us: he knows all
   our affairs, and, what is more, our hearts, better than we ourselves.
   And it is our happiness that he does so; for by this means he is able
   to supply the defects of our prayers, and to beg those things for us
   that our ignorance was not aware of. And what is yet a greater
   advantage, he is upon this account able also to correct our prayers.
   For such is the shortness of our understanding and the weakness of our
   affections, that we pray sometimes for those things that would prove
   our bane and our destruction: we beg heartily for a mischief, and
   importune God to be so favourable as to ruin us at our desire. In which
   case surely it concerns us to have somebody to counter-petition us, and
   to ask a fish while we are begging for a serpent; and to be so kind to
   us as to keep our prayers from being granted.

   A man perhaps is visited with sickness, and passing his days in pain
   and languishing, puts up many an hearty prayer to God to restore him to
   health and ease; but all this time he is ignorant of the end and design
   of this visitation: for possibly the distemper of his body is every day
   ministering to the cure of his soul, to the mortification of his pride,
   his lust, and worldly-mindedness: and perhaps God, who foresees all
   accidents, and knows upon what little wheels and hinges the events of
   things move, understands assuredly that his sickness removes him out of
   harm's way, and secures him from those peculiar occasions of sin, that,
   being well and healthful, he would inevitably fall into, and perhaps
   deplorably fall by. But now Christ has a full comprehension of all
   these possibilities, and knows what would promote and what would annoy
   every man in his spiritual estate: he knows when sickness will set a
   man nearer to heaven than health can do; when poverty, banishment, and
   affliction, subserve the purposes of grace, and the great interests of
   eternity, better than all the affluence of fortune, the highest
   preferments, and the most undisturbed prosperity.

   As it is an happiness for some men not to be left to their own choice,
   but to resign themselves up to the guidance and disposal of one of
   greater experience; so it is the safest course for many not to be
   permitted to stand or fall according to their own prayers. For it is
   not always piety or discretion that indites them, but an impatience of
   some present grievance, or a passionate desire of some earthly
   enjoyment, affections that in many circumstances border too near upon
   sin: and therefore the prayers that proceed from them are never granted
   by God but in anger, and with an intent to punish and to blast the
   person that makes them.

   Such prayers are never seconded or backed by Christ's intercession,
   unless for the begging of their pardon, and excusing their folly and
   their unfitness; and then God may be said most graciously to hear them,
   when for the mediation of Christ he pardons and denies them: which
   mediation of his takes its measures of acting, not by our desires, but
   our wants; of which he is the most competent judge, as being more privy
   to them than our very consciences; for they may be deceived and
   deluded, but he cannot. And thus much for the first thing that
   qualifies Christ to be our mediator, that he knows every thing
   belonging to our spiritual estate certainly and infallibly.

   2. The second is, that he is heartily sensible of, and concerned about
   whatsoever concerns us. Without which his knowledge would avail us but
   little. For the bare knowing of a thing engages no man to act in it.
   And therefore Christ is represented to us as one that is touched with
   the sense of our infirmities, as sharing our griefs, and bearing a part
   in our sorrows; which very thing renders him a merciful high priest,
   and ready to intercede for us with the same vehemence and importunity,
   that by a personal endurance of those miseries he might be prompted to
   for himself. He that would speak earnestly and forcibly of any thing,
   must work it into his heart by a lively and a keen sense of it, as well
   as into his head by a clear knowledge and apprehension. For where the
   heart is engaged, all the actions follow: no part or power of the soul
   can be unactive when that is stirred; and being once moved itself, it
   moves all the rest.

   Now it is the heart of Christ that every believer has an interest in:
   and we know that he carries that in his breast that intercedes for us
   with him, as well as he with the Father. He does not only hear our
   sighs, but also feels the cause of them: and if we suffer by the direct
   impressions of pain, he also suffers by the movings and yearnings of
   his own compassion: so that in a manner our relief is his own ease; and
   that deliverance that disburdens our minds, does also by consequence
   discharge his.

   When he was to leave the world, we read how sensible he was of the
   disconsolate condition of his disciples; and that he promised to send
   the Spirit to them for no cause more than to be their Comforter; and to
   allay those sorrows that upon his departure he foresaw would fill their
   hearts: he seemed actually to feel their grief, while it was yet but
   future, and to come: that is, before they could have any feeling of it
   themselves. This concernment therefore of his for us, is another thing
   that greatly fits him for the office of a mediator.

   3. The third and last is, his transcendent and more than human ability
   to express and set forth every thing that may be pleaded in our behalf
   to the best advantage; which is the peculiar qualification of a good
   advocate, and that which makes the two former considerable. For admit
   that he both knows his client's cause, and is heartily and warmly
   concerned for it, yet if his tongue and his eloquence doth not serve
   him to draw forth those thoughts and those affections in a suitable
   defence of it, he is rather a good man and a good friend, than a good
   advocate or mediator.

   But now is there any one that may compare with Christ in respect of
   this faculty? to whom God has given the tongue of the wise; a tongue
   speaking with authority, commanding men, and persuading God: nay, and
   who himself was able to give his disciples such a tongue, as all their
   adversaries, though never so learned and eloquent, were not able to
   resist. That prayer that perhaps is by much ado sighed and sobbed out
   by the penitent, his grief interrupting his words, yet as it arrives to
   the throne of God from the mouth of our Mediator, it comes with a grace
   and a force superior to all human rhetoric; it enters the presence and
   pierces the ears of the Almighty; and, in a word, prevails in that
   manner, as if it were almighty itself.

   And here I cannot but observe, how the qualities of Christ as our
   mediator pleading for us do particularly mate and confront those of the
   Devil our grand adversary pleading against us. For as Christ is most
   knowing of our spiritual estate, and every thing relating to it; so is
   the Devil most industrious and inquisitive to give himself an exact
   information of the same. As Christ is most tenderly concerned for us,
   so is the Devil most maliciously and inveterately set against us. And
   lastly, as Christ has all the strengths and treasures of elocution to
   employ in our defence, so is the Devil restless and artificial in
   drawing up our charge and accusation with all the heightening,
   aggravating language, that a great wit and a redundant malice can
   afford. But in all this he is outdone; even as much as the Creator can
   outdo a creature: so that we need not use any further elogy of Christ's
   mediatorship than this, that he is a greater and a more potent
   advocate, than the Devil himself can be an accuser.

   And thus I have at length demonstrated the eminent fitness of Christ
   for the office of mediator, upon a treble account or respect; namely,
   in respect of God, of us, and of himself: and so have finished the
   third particular proposed for the handling of the words; which was, to
   shew the reason why Christ's mediation ought to minister such
   confidence to us in our access to God.

SERMON LX.

  EPHESIANS iii. 12.

   In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of
   him.

   THE prosecution of these words was first cast into the discussion of
   these four particulars.

   I. That there is a certain boldness or confidence very well consisting
   with and becoming of our humblest addresses to God.

   II. That the foundation of this confidence is laid in the mediation of
   Christ.

   III. To shew the reason why the mediation of Christ ought to minister
   such confidence to us in our access to God.

   IVthly and lastly, to shew, whether there were any other ground that
   might rationally embolden us in these our addresses to him.

   Having finished the three first of these, I proceed now to the fourth.
   What reason we have to raise a confidence about the success of our
   prayers, upon the mediation of Christ, has been already declared; but
   since we cannot have too many pillars for so great a superstructure to
   lean upon, it will not be amiss to see whether there be any other means
   to give efficacy and success to them.

   If there is, it must be either, 1. Something within, or 2dly, Something
   without us.

   As for any thing within us, that may thus prevail with God, it must be
   presumed to be the merit of our good actions, which by their intrinsic
   worth and value may lay claim to his acceptance. It cannot, I confess,
   be the direct business of this discourse to treat of the merit of good
   works. But for our direction, so far as may concern the present subject
   and occasion, I affirm, that it is impossible, not only for sinful men,
   but for any mere creature, though of never so excellent and exalted a
   nature, properly to merit any thing from God, and that briefly for
   these two reasons.

   1. Because none can merit of another but by doing something of himself
   and absolutely by his own power, for the advantage of him from whom he
   merits, without that person's help or assistance. But what can any
   thing that the creature can do advantage God? What can all the men and
   angels contribute or add to the divine happiness or perfection? And if
   we should suppose that any action of theirs might, yet it could not be
   meritorious, forasmuch as they do every thing by a power and an ability
   conveyed to them by God; so that in their most refined and holiest
   performances, they offer God but what is his own, the effect and
   product of his grace working within them, and raising them to do what
   they do. The talent they trade with was given them, nay, and what is
   more, the very power of trading with it was given them too: so that
   both in their being and operations they are another's, and stand
   accountable for all to a superior bounty; and restitution surely is not
   merit.

   2dly. To merit is to do something over and above what is due, no two
   things in the world being more directly contrary than debt and merit.
   But now it is impossible for any created agent to do any thing above
   its duty, forasmuch as its duty obliges it to do the utmost that it
   can. It is clear therefore that for any one, even the brightest angel
   in heaven, to think of meriting, is but a dream and a chimera; but then
   for us, who are obnoxious upon the account of several sins and breaches
   of the law, to entertain the least thought of it, is much more absurd
   and intolerable, and consequently, if we build any confidence in our
   addresses to God upon our merits, we build upon the sand; and what the
   issue of such a building is like to be, we may easily conclude.

   It remains therefore that if there be any other ground of this
   confidence, it must be something without us. And if so, it must be the
   help and intercession either, 1. Of angels, or 2. Of the saints.

   1. And first for the angels, that they cannot be presumed to mediate
   for us, and present our prayers before God, I suppose may be made
   evident by these reasons.

   1. Because it is impossible for the angels to know and perfectly
   discern the thoughts, that being the incommunicable property of God; 2
   Chron. vi. 30, Thou only, O Lord, know est the hearts of the children
   of men; and in Jeremy xvii. 10, I the Lord search the heart. But now
   many prayers are wholly transacted within the mind and the heart, and
   pass not into any outward expression. And even in those prayers that
   are orally delivered, that which is the chief part, and indeed the soul
   of prayer, is the inward disposition of the heart; which falls under
   the cognizance of no created understanding, it being the peculiar
   royalty and prerogative of omniscience.

   2. The second reason is, that it also exceeds the measure of angelical
   knowledge, for any angel by himself and his own natural power of
   knowing, to know at once all the prayers that are even uttered in words
   here and there throughout the world; and that because it is impossible
   for him to be actually present in all places. For though the knowledge
   of angels is not limited just to the things of that place where they
   are present, yet it is certain that it cannot extend much further;
   since a limited nature must needs also have a limited way of knowing.
   Upon which account God's omniscience is not ill founded by some upon
   his essential omnipresence, as the ground and reason of it. For he that
   is intimately present to all things, must needs have a knowledge of
   those things, which persons that are not thus present to them, for the
   same cause, are not capable of.

   But for all this, some concern themselves to hold a contrary opinion
   about the knowledge of angels, and they pretend to ground it, 1. partly
   upon scripture; 2. partly upon reason.

   And first as to what they produce from scripture, passing by most of
   their frivolous and impertinent quotations, I shall more especially
   single out and insist upon two, as being the most likely to speak to
   their purpose.

   1. The first of them is that in Luke xv. 10, There is joy in the
   presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. From
   whence they argue, that repentance being a thing chiefly situate in the
   heart, if the angels can know this, they must needs know the heart
   also.

   But to this I answer, that repentance is not only immediately knowable
   in itself, but also mediately, by the outward effects of it shewing
   themselves in the life of the penitent; such as in Matthew iii. are
   called fruits meet for repentance; which whether they be sincere and
   genuine or no, though we perhaps cannot always discern, yet the angels,
   whose discernment is much greater, may well be thought able to
   understand and distinguish.

   But it will be urged, in the second place, that though it follows not
   from hence that the angels can discern the heart, or the repentance of
   a sinner as it lies included there, yet by granting that they know and
   observe the outward effects of repentance, it will follow, that by the
   same reason they must also know all those prayers that men utter and
   express outwardly by word of mouth. And therefore that as to these at
   least we may presume, that they will be our mediators, to present them
   for us to God.

   For reply to this I answer,

   1. That it was sufficiently proved by the former argument, that the
   angelical knowledge cannot at the same time naturally reach itself to
   all things that actually happen in the world; and that for the reason
   then given, that an angel, being of a limited nature, cannot be
   actually present every where. But you will ask then, how come the
   angels to know the repentance of every converted sinner? Why; it must
   be supposed that they know it by report of those angels that God has
   employed as ministering spirits about that repenting person; and
   consequently it is not necessary that we affirm it to be universally
   known to all the angels in heaven, but to those only, who by converse
   with these come to have such a report conveyed to them; for the text
   speaks only of the angels indefinitely, but not of all universally.

   But upon this it may be replied further, that upon the same ground we
   may infer also, that the angels may know all the prayers orally put up
   by men throughout the whole world; forasmuch as they may be signified
   to them, by the like reports from those angels that have the respective
   care and governance of each person.

   To this I answer, that it is indeed possible that they may; but that
   they also do, we have no ground to conclude. For although God has told
   us, that so eminent and remarkable a passage as the conversion of a
   sinner is known to the angels in heaven, whether by particular
   revelation from himself, or by report from other angels, it matters
   not; yet that therefore every action done by, or occurrence relating to
   such an one, must also be reported and made known to the angels too, no
   reason or argument can demonstrate. And unless we know that these
   things certainly are so, as well as that possibly they may, they can
   administer no sure ground to our confidence, as shall be made appear in
   its due place.

   But after all this discourse, what if we should now affirm, that there
   is no necessity of our holding, that the angels know the repentance of
   every sinner here on earth, either by themselves or by the reports of
   others. For when it is said, that there is joy amongst the angels in
   heaven over one sinner that repenteth, is it said, that this joy
   happens just about the time of that repentance, or at any time of the
   sinner's abode in this world? No; we find no mention of the time; and
   therefore what hinders but that it may be understood of the time when
   the penitent enters into heaven: that then there is joy amongst the
   angels who rejoice that he repented and is recovered, which repentance
   they then come clearly to see and know, in the visible consequent of
   it, his salvation. This I am sure may be the sense of the text without
   any force done to it at all; and if it may, there is no necessity of
   the former interpretation, upon a removal of which, there cannot be so
   much as any colour or shew of argument from hence to evince the angels'
   knowledge of every particular man's actions and affairs here upon
   earth. And thus much in answer to their first scripture.

   2. The other is that place in Revelation viii. 3, And another angel
   came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was
   given unto him much incense., that he should offer it with the prayers
   of all saints, upon the golden altar that was before the throne. From
   whence they say it is evident, that the angels are employed in
   presenting our prayers to God, nay, so invincibly evident in the
   judgment of some, that they wonder that any should be able to stand out
   against the prevailing force of it.

   But to this I answer, that angel is a name not only of nature, but also
   of office; and signifies one peculiarly sent and employed by God about
   any work: upon which account Christ is several times in scripture
   called the angel of the Lord, the angel of the covenant; and simply
   without any addition the angel, as in Zechariah i. Accordingly in this
   sense is the word angel to be taken here, namely for Christ; to whom
   also the other words most appositely agree; the incense here mentioned
   very fitly representing the merits of his death and sufferings, by
   which he offered himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world, by
   virtue of which sacrifice he is continually giving an efficacy to our
   prayers before the throne of grace. If therefore the angel here spoke
   of be Christ, and Christ be God as well as man, nothing for the
   mediation of any created angel can be concluded from this text.

   And thus having answered what they allege from scripture for the
   angels' knowledge of and concernment about men's particular actions
   here upon earth, and especially their prayers, I shall now come to
   examine what they allege for the same from reason.

   2. They argue therefore that the angels see and know our prayers, and
   every thing else belonging to us, because they behold the face of God,
   the divine essence; which essence containing in itself the exact ideas
   and representations of all things, by beholding that, they must by
   consequence behold and view all things else.

   This is frequently urged and insisted upon; and yet there cannot be a
   more false and absurd reasoning. For if this were true, then it would
   follow that whosoever saw God would be also omniscient, and know as
   much as God himself knows, since he knows all things by the survey of
   his own essence. It would follow also that there could be no
   possibility of God's revealing any thing to the angels: for how can any
   thing be said to be revealed that was known before? But yet Christ
   tells us, that the angels are ignorant of the day of judgment, Matth.
   xxiv. 36; and St. Peter tells us concerning the mysteries of Christ's
   incarnation and man's redemption, that the angels desire to look into
   them, 1 Pet. i. 12; and the word paraku'psai in the original is most
   emphatical, as signifying a stooping down to look into a thing, which
   is a searching, inquisitive posture: and therefore surely the angels
   are capable of a further knowledge of these things, by a revelation of
   them from God, and consequently cannot see all things in the divine
   essence.

   But that we may answer and remove the very ground of this reasoning, we
   are to consider, that the divine essence discovers itself, and what is
   in it, to those that behold it, not by any natural necessity, as a
   sensible object lays itself open to the eye, but voluntarily and
   freely, as the mind of one man discovers itself to another, and as we
   may presume one angel declares his thoughts to another. Add to this
   also, that the other supposition of the ideas and images of all things
   existing in the essence of God, seems but a mere fiction, framed only
   according to our gross way of apprehending things, and so by no means
   strictly and literally agreeable to the most spiritual, simple,
   uncompounded nature of God.

   From both which it follows, that that device of speculum Trinitatis,
   the glass of the Trinity, in which they say that saints and angels
   behold all things, is a most senseless and ridiculous conceit; and I
   wonder that any persons of reason and learning should be ever brought
   to lay any weight upon it. For if this be a good argument, that he that
   sees him who sees all things, must himself also see all things; then by
   unavoidable consequence this will be as good, that he that sees him who
   sees nothing, must also himself see nothing. And then any angel may be
   omniscient and blind in a minute; for let him look upon God who sees
   all things, and then he is omniscient, and sees all things himself; but
   let him immediately after look upon a blind man, and then by a
   wonderful transmutation presently he sees nothing. But the truth is,
   such ways of discoursing are fitter to be drolled upon, than to be
   refuted by any serious answer.

   And thus I have shewn, that we have no ground to repose any confidence
   in the mediation of angels, for the promoting of our petitions before
   God. I come now to see whether we have any greater ground of confidence
   from any thing that the saints are like to do for us in this
   particular.

   Concerning which we must observe, that the foregoing arguments brought
   against the angels interceding for us, by reason of their
   unacquaintance with our spiritual affairs, proceed much more forcibly
   against the intercession of the saints, who are of much more limited
   and restrained faculties than the angels, and know fewer things, and
   even those that they do know in a much lesser degree of clearness than
   the angelical knowledge rises to.

   But yet for the further proof of the saints' unacquaintedness with what
   is done here below, these reasons may be added over and above.

   1. As first, it is clear that God sometimes takes his saints out of the
   world for this very cause, that they may not see and know what happens
   in the world. For so says God to king Josiah, 2 Chron. xxxiv. 28,
   Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered
   to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I
   will bring upon this place, and the inhabitants thereof. Which
   discourse would have been hugely absurd and inconsequent, if so be the
   saints' separation from the body gave them a fuller and a clearer
   prospect into all the particular affairs and occurrences that happen
   here upon earth. But if they are ignorant of these, as this scripture
   sufficiently proves, then can there no reason be assigned, why we
   should not also judge them ignorant of our prayers.

   Some indeed are not ashamed to say, that God reveals the prayers of men
   here below to the saints above, that they may present those prayers to
   him; which assertion as it is utterly groundless, so it is also
   apparently absurd. For to what purpose should God reveal a prayer made
   to him, to any of the saints, that he might pray it over to him again?
   Can he make the matter plainer and more evident to God than it was
   before? Or can he add merit and value to it, when it is impossible for
   any creature to merit from God? Or lastly, can he prevail with God more
   than God's own mercy and Christ's intercession? Thus when men first
   take up an opinion, and then afterwards seek for reasons for it, they
   must be contented with such as the absurdity of it will afford.

   2. But 2dly, we have yet further an express declaration of the saints'
   ignorance of the state of things here below in those words in Isaiah
   lxiii. 16, where the church thus utters itself to God; Doubtless thou
   art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel
   acknowledge us not. Abraham and Jacob surely were saints, and those too
   none of the lowest rank; yet it seems they knew nothing of the
   condition of their posterity, understood none of their wants and
   necessities. And if so, how they should pray and be concerned for those
   of whom they had no knowledge, is hard to comprehend.

   But notwithstanding these places, the sons of the Romish communion are
   taught to believe otherwise; and accordingly allege several things,
   which they are pleased to think, or at least to call arguments to the
   contrary: the foundation of most of which being overthrown by what has
   been disputed about the angels, I shall only mention two more, the
   first from scripture, the second, as they pretend, from reason.

   1. As for scripture, they allege, Luke xvi. where Abraham, a beatified
   saint in heaven, could yet know the estate and hear the words of the
   rich man in hell; as also what befell him and Lazarus in their
   lifetime, as that one received good things, and the other evil things;
   from whence they say it is clear, that the saints in heaven know the
   condition of those that live here, and consequently may be thought
   particularly to intercede for them.

   But to this I answer, 1. That supposing this to be a real history, and
   literally to be understood, yet this proves no more, than that Abraham
   might come to know from Lazarus, after his assumption into heaven, what
   the condition of that rich man was, as also what miseries he himself
   lay under, during his life: but that is no argument that Abraham knew
   any thing of this, while Lazarus and the rich man were yet living upon
   earth. 2. But in the second place we are to know, that this whole
   relation is but a parable, and so cannot be argumentative for the proof
   of any thing.

   2. Their next argument, which is drawn from reason, proceeds thus. That
   if the saints here upon earth pray for one another, then certainly
   those in heaven, whose charity is more perfect and consummate, must be
   thought much more to pray for those here below. But the former is
   evident from several examples, and there is also an express command for
   it in James v. 16.

   To this I answer first, that the charity of the saints who live in this
   world putting them to pray for one another, does not infer, that the
   saints in heaven (whose charity is greater) must do so too, unless it
   were proved that the charity of a glorified person must needs have the
   very same way of acting and exerting itself in heaven, that it had in
   the same person while he was a member of the church militant here on
   earth.

   2. But in the second place, not to deny wholly that the charity of the
   blessed souls prompts them to pray for those that live yet in the body,
   we may distinguish of a twofold intercession of the saints, 1. General,
   2. Particular. The general is that by which the saints pray for the
   good and happiness of the whole body of the church, which they well
   know upon a general account, during its warfare in this world, to be
   surrounded with temptations, and so in need of the continual assistance
   of divine grace; whereupon their charity may well engage them thus to
   pray for it. But as for any particular intercession, by which any saint
   intercedes in the behalf of any particular person here below,
   recommending his personal case to God, this follows not from the
   former; for it has been proved that they know not these
   particularities, and if so, though they be in never so high a degree
   charitable, yet their charity is not to outrun their knowledge.

   Now in order to any man's establishing a rational confidence upon the
   intercession of the saints for us, these three things are required.

   1. That they be able thus to intercede for us.

   2. That they accordingly will.

   3. And lastly, that a man certainly know so much. A failure in any of
   which conditions renders all such hope and reliance upon them most
   absurd and unreasonable. For what foundation of hope can there be,
   where there is no power to help? And what help can he afford me, who
   knows not whether I need help or no? But suppose that he does fully
   know my condition, yet knowledge is not the immediate principle of
   action, but will; and no man goes about the doing of any thing because
   he knows it may be done, but because in his mind he has resolved to do
   it. And then as for the saints' will to pray for us, since the measure
   of their will is the will of God calling and commanding them to
   undertake such or such a work, where there is no such call or command
   to the thing we are speaking of, we are to presume also, that neither
   have they any will to it. But lastly, admitting that there is in them
   really both a knowledge, and an actual will fitting the saints for this
   office of interceding, yet unless we are sure of it by certain
   infallible arguments, we cannot build our practice upon it, which is
   itself to be built upon faith, that is, a firm persuasion of both the
   reasonableness and the fitness of the thing that we are to do. But now
   what arguments have we to ascertain us of the saints' ability and
   proneness to intercede for us? We have weighed what has been brought
   from scripture and from reason, and found it wanting; so that we have
   nothing solid to bottom ourselves upon in this matter. But God requires
   that our boldness should commence upon knowledge; for he neither
   approves the sacrifice nor the confidence of fools.

   And now in the last place, if we view this doctrine in the consequence
   of it, we shall find that it speaks aloud against the folly and impiety
   of a practice so much used by some, namely, the invocation of saints,
   and praying to the souls of holy men departed this life.

   It is possible indeed that men may believe that the saints in heaven
   particularly intercede for men here below, and yet not hold that they
   are to be prayed to: but it is certain, that none hold that the saints
   ought to be prayed to, who deny their particular intercession with God
   for us. All the arguments therefore that have been hitherto produced
   for the disproving of this, do by consequence utterly destroy the
   invocation of the saints.

   But before I examine any of their arguments for it, it will not be
   amiss to consider the original grounds of this practice; of which, I
   think, I may reckon these three for the principal.

   1. The solemn meetings used by the primitive Christians at the places
   of the saints' sepulchres, and there celebrating the memory of their
   martyrdom. In which panegyrical speeches there were used frequent
   apostrophes and figurative addresses to the souls of the saints, as if
   they were actually present, and heard what was spoke: and these
   expressions the vulgar, not being able to distinguish between things
   spoke figuratively and properly, easily drank in, according to the
   literal meaning of the words; though indeed they no more proved that
   the saints heard them, or that those that so spoke thought they did,
   than those exclamations, Hear, O heaven! and hearken, O earth! prove
   that the heaven and earth can hear what is thus spoke to them.

   2. The second thing that induced this belief were those seeds of the
   Platonic philosophy, that so much leavened many of the primitive
   Christians: which philosophy teaches, that the souls of good and
   virtuous men after the decease of the body are turned into angels or
   good demons, and fly about the world helping men, and defending them
   from evils and mishaps: whereupon it was easy with a little change to
   transfer and apply these things to the souls of the saints.

   For the confirmation of which, it is remarkable that Origen, a person
   excessively addicted to the philosophy of Plato, was the first of the
   Christians that brought this opinion into the church: though it was
   long after his time that the invocation of the saints came to be
   practised; the practice beginning first amongst the Greek Eremites, who
   transfused it to Nyssen, Basil, and Nazianzen, their great admirers and
   disciples; who afterwards made a shift to insinuate it into the minds
   of the credulous vulgar.

   3. The third cause of this was the people's being bred in idolatry:
   whereupon what worship they gave to devils, and to their heroes before,
   they very readily applied, upon their conversion to Christianity, to
   good angels, and to the souls of the martyrs; which also the unwariness
   and facility of many of their teachers and bishops was willing enough
   to humour them in, as being desirous upon any terms to gain them from
   heathenism to the profession of Christian religion; and being also in
   those times otherwise took up and busied with disputes against such
   heretics as more directly struck at the foundations of Christianity.

   But nothing can be more evident than that the primitive fathers of the
   church held no such thing as the invocation of the saints, and that
   from this one consideration, that they still used this as an argument
   against the Arians for the proof of the deity of Christ, that he was to
   be invoked and prayed unto. Which worship, might it have been
   communicated to the saints, or any besides God, had been no proof of
   the thing for which they brought it at all.

   And moreover, the weak grounds that the patrons of this opinion have
   found for it in scripture, have been the cause, that even those that
   hold and practise it cannot yet unanimously agree about the terms upon
   which they are to hold it. For some will have invocation of the saints
   necessary, some pious and profitable, and others only lawful or
   allowable. And the council of Trent, that pretended to determine the
   case, has been so wise as to put the world off with an ambiguity that
   might indifferently serve the defenders of either opinion, by
   denouncing an anathema against those qui negant sanctos invocandos
   esse, who deny that the saints were to be prayed to. Which expression
   is very ambiguous: for to deny that the saints are to be prayed to, may
   signify either to deny that it is necessary to pray to them, or that it
   is lawful to pray to them. But the truth is, it is their best course to
   state it upon this, that it is useful and profitable. Profitable, I
   say, not to those that practise, but to those that teach and assert it.

   But since the practice has now prevailed amongst those of the Romish
   communion, let us see what reason they allege for it. Why, they argue,

   From the custom used in the courts of princes, where petitioners
   presume not to petition their prince immediately by themselves, but by
   the intercession of such as attend about him.

   But to this pretence, which, as St. Ambrose affirms in his comment upon
   the 1st of the Romans, and St. Austin in his 8th book De Civitate Dei,
   was the very same that the heathens alleged for their worshipping of
   good demons and their heroes; that is, famous men departed this life,
   and supposed by them to have attained a state or condition of being and
   power next to their gods.

   To this, I say, this is a full answer; that God is not man, nor are we
   in all things to argue the manner of our behaviour to God from what we
   use to men. God will himself determine the way by which he will be
   worshipped; and, consequently, the only rule of the worship we tender
   him must be his own prescription and command.

   But besides, let the comparison be put equally, and so even upon these
   terms their argument will not proceed. For should even an earthly
   prince constitute and appoint one certain person to receive all
   petitions, and bring them to him, surely it would be an arrogance to
   presume to petition him by the mediation of any other. Now God has
   actually constituted Christ our mediator, and our sole mediator, which
   appears from that one text, which the patrons of praying to the saints
   will never solidly answer, 1 Tim. ii. 5, There is one God, and one
   Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. Upon which account,
   for us to put our prayers into any other hands, is to affront God in
   his command, and Christ in his office.

   If it be here further alleged, that our sins render us very unworthy to
   come immediately even to Christ himself; whereupon it is but a due
   humility for us to make our way to him by the mediation of his friends,
   such as the blessed saints are:

   To this also I answer; that Christ, who knew better than we ourselves,
   whether we were fit to come to him or no, has expressly commanded us to
   come: in which case we are to learn, that the best and most refined
   humility is obedience: and when Christ commands us to come to him, and
   with the jealousy almost of a rival forbids us all address to others,
   if we repair to any but himself, it is the sacrifice of fools, seasoned
   with ignorance and wilfulness; and not so much a veneration of his
   majesty, as a despisal of his mercy. For should any noble or great
   person command me personally to represent my wants immediately to
   himself, surely it would be but little modesty or civility in me to
   present my petitions to him by the intercession of his porter.

   As for those that judge or practise otherwise, there is this only to be
   alleged for the reasonableness of what they do; that having so much
   injured Christ the great mediator, it is not to be wondered, (should we
   respect their behaviour, and not his mercy,) if they stand in need of a
   mediator to Christ himself. But as gold upon gold is absurd in
   heraldry; so I am sure, a mediator to a Mediator is a greater absurdity
   in Christianity.

   I conclude therefore, that Christ is the only person through whose
   mediation we may with confidence make our access to God: and that to
   share this work of mediation with any, either saints or angels, is an
   injurious and sacrilegious encroachment upon that office, that neither
   admits of equal nor companion. It is also a senseless invention,
   grounded upon that which is not; namely, their particular knowledge of
   our affairs here below: and if it were not so, yet is the practice
   hugely useless and superfluous; for there cannot be imagined any
   kindness or concernment in the saints for us, that is not infinitely
   greater and more abundant in Christ. And therefore let men please
   themselves as they will in their imaginary fantastic by-ways of
   address, yet Christ is the only true way, the way that has light to
   direct, and life to reward those that walk in it; and consequently
   there is no coming to the Father but by him.

   To whom be rendered and ascribed, as is most due, all praise, might,
   majesty, and dominion, both now and for evermore.

SERMON LXI.

  GENESIS vi. 3.

   And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive with man.

   IN this chapter we have God taking a survey of the state of the sons of
   men before the flood; and withal we have the judgment or verdict that
   he delivers in upon that survey, namely, that they were exceeding
   wicked; as in verse 5, And God saw that the wickedness of man was great
   in the earth. We have him in the first chapter looking over all created
   beings, and thereupon pronouncing his approbation of them, that behold
   they were good, and hear no further of them: in the sixth chapter, we
   have man, that of all those good things should have in reason proved
   the best, totally corrupt and depraved; as appears from the same verse,
   Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was evil, and only evil,
   and that continually. So that we see his sins were as numerous as his
   thoughts, and withal so great, that it even repented the Lord that he
   had made man upon the earth; as we read in verse 6. Sin is of so vile
   and provoking a nature, that it is able to extort a certain kind of
   repentance from God himself, who has elsewhere said, that he cannot
   repent: so that here we see God himself repenting, by reason of the
   sins of men: but of the sinner's repentance we read not a word. Now
   when sins are arrived to their highest pitch, both in respect of number
   and greatness; and withal attended with an absolute impenitence; what
   in reason can remain but a certain sad expectation of judgment against
   the sinner? And such an one we have here. After the overflowing of sin
   upon the whole earth, God in his justice seconds it with a deluge of
   waters; and so proportions his punishment to the rate of the offence; a
   general destruction to a general sin. But before the execution of this
   judgment, and amidst those aboundings of sin and wickedness, yet God
   left not himself without a witness in the hearts of men; but continued
   his Spirit in the ordinary operations thereof, secretly dealing with
   and entreating men to be reconciled to God. Notwithstanding their
   obstinate progress in sin, their continual pursuit of the lusts and
   desires of their evil mind, they had many a gripe of conscience, many
   sad remorses, many checks and calls from the Holy Spirit, which, by
   their resolution to persist in sin, they did at length totally
   extinguish. Upon their rejection of the Spirit, God intends to ruin and
   reject them, and to that intent withdraws the Spirit, and the strivings
   of it. And presently after we read of the flood breaking in upon them,
   to their utter ruin and perdition.

   The words will afford several observations; as first, from the method
   God took in this judgment, first withdrawing his spirit, and then
   introducing the flood, we may observe,

   1. D. That God's taking away his Spirit from any soul, is the certain
   forerunner of the ruin and destruction of that soul.

   This is clearly evinced from the words; for although the flood did
   immediately terminate in the destruction of the body only, yet because
   it snatched these men away in a state of impenitence, it was
   consequentially the destruction of the soul.

   2. From that expression of the Spirit's striving with man, which does
   always imply a resistance from the party with whom we strive, we may
   observe,

   2. D. That there is in the heart of man a natural enmity and opposition
   to the motions of God's holy Spirit: outward contention it is the
   proper issue and product of inward hatred; striving in action it is an
   undoubted sign of enmity in the heart: The flesh lusteth against the
   spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, Gal. v. 17. Here we see there
   is a sharp combat between these two: and the apostle subjoins the
   reason of it; for these two are contrary. Things contrary will vent
   their contrariety in mutual strife.

   3. From the same expression of striving we may observe,

   3. D. That the Spirit in its dealings with the heart is very earnest
   and vehement.

   To strive, it imports a vigorous putting forth of the power; it is such
   a posture as denotes an active desire. There is none that strives with
   another, but conquest it is the thing both in his desire and in his
   endeavour.

   4. The fourth observation is drawn from the definitive sentence that
   God here passes, that his Spirit should not always strive with man, and
   it is this;

   4. D. That there is a set and punctual time, after which the convincing
   operations of God's Spirit upon the heart of man, in order to his
   conversion, being resisted, will cease, and for ever leave him.

   This seeming to take in the chief, if not the only drift and scope of
   the Spirit in these words, waving the consideration of the rest, I
   shall only prosecute this.

   In the prosecution of it, I shall do these things.

   I. I shall endeavour to prove and demonstrate the truth of this
   assertion from scripture.

   II. I shall shew how many ways the Spirit may be resisted.

   III. I shall shew whence and why it is that upon some resistance the
   Spirit finally withdraws.

   IV. Make application.

   I. Concerning the first, I shall present you with the proof of this
   doctrine from several scriptures, that give us pregnant examples, that
   this is the way of God's dealings still to withdraw his Spirit after
   some notorious resistance.

   1. The first is that dreadful place in which is set down God's
   dispensation towards the children of Israel, in Psalm xcv. 10, 11;
   Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a
   people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
   unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
   We have here these things observable.

   1. Their resistance of God's Spirit, specified in these words; I was
   grieved with this generation.

   2. We have the set and limited time of that resistance; it was forty
   years.

   3. God's judicial withdrawing his Spirit thereupon, and delivering them
   up to a state of everlasting spiritual desertion, held forth in these
   words; I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
   From whence we see that the departure of the Spirit was as infallibly
   sure, as the truth of God confirmed with the obligation of an oath
   could make it.

   A second place, that yet further proves that there is such a critical,
   fixed time of the Spirit's working, is in Heb. iv. 7, He limiteth a
   certain day, saying, To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
   heart. This expression seems to hold forth two things.

   1. The fixed determination of the time of the Spirit's speaking to us;
   To-day. Now as in a day, after such a set hour it is unavoidably and
   certainly night; so after such a season of the Spirit's strivings,
   there inevitably follows a final desertion. While it is day the Spirit
   works; but this night cometh, and it will not work.

   2. This expression shews the shortness of this time. The day of grace,
   it is but a day. It is the sun of righteousness shining in our faces
   for some few hours. Which, by the way, speaks severe reproof to the
   unreasonable delays of some, in their closing and complying with God.
   The Spirit calls them to-day, and they promise obedience to-morrow.
   Procrastination in temporals is always dangerous, but in spirituals it
   is often damnable.

   The third place that may be alleged for the proof of this truth is
   that, Luke xix. 42, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this
   thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid
   from thine eyes. In these words also we may observe three things.

   1. Their enjoyment of a season, in which the Spirit dealt with them
   concerning the things of their peace; they had their day.

   2. Their neglect and misimprovement of that season, implied in Christ's
   wish that they had known and improved it.

   3. God's dealing with them upon that misimprovement; the things of
   their peace were hid from their eyes. When the day of grace is past,
   and darkness upon the soul, no wonder if it is unable to discern the
   things of its peace. To these places we may add that in Gen. xv. 16,
   where God says, that the sin of the Amorites was not yet full:
   implying, that there was a certain pitch of sin, under which he would
   not destroy, and after which he would not spare them. Till such time as
   a vessel is filled, we may still pour in more and more; but when it
   comes to its fulness, then it has its ne plus ultra, there is no
   capacity to receive any more. So during the time of God's permission,
   we may go on in a way of opposition to him, to multiply acts of
   resistance against the Spirit; but after this set time is expired,
   there must be no further resistance made: we must either yield, or die
   eternally: God will not let us perpetuate our rebellions against him;
   he will either take away our opposition, or the Spirit which we so
   oppose.

   And thus much for the proof of the point by scriptures, which leave it
   undoubted, that the Spirit has its set time of striving with the heart,
   after which it will cease. And now I could observe also, by way of
   allusion and illustration, how that the creatures also have their set
   and stinted times allotted them, beyond which they can do nothing with
   success. It is notable in the dealings of men, when they make contracts
   and bargains, there is some good hour, some advantageous nick of time,
   which if overslipt and let go, either the price fails or the thing
   fails. And it is further observable, that there are some lucky seasons
   and offers of preferment in every man's life, which if not laid hold
   upon, a man is for ever after degraded in his worldly advancements.
   Nay, even those creatures that are only acted by a principle of sense
   do observe their set times, in which they will do the works of their
   nature, and after which they will not. The bird has its summer to build
   in, and the bee to gather honey in; and if they should chance to be
   hindered from doing these works at that time, they are never seen to do
   them in the winter. In Jeremiah viii. 7, we have this very
   consideration applied to this present purpose; Yea, the stork in the
   heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and
   the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not
   the judgment of the Lord. I do not mention these things as arguments to
   prove any thing, but only as observations to illustrate what has been
   already proved. For since some presume to say, that the visible carnal
   world is an image or adumbration of the invisible and spiritual;
   methinks God, that has tied all the operations of the creature within
   such a strict observance of their respective seasons, he himself should
   be much more regular and exact in the observance of his own. I shall
   conclude this first head with that place in Ecclesiastes iii. 1, To
   every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under
   heaven. And without question we shall find, that not man only, but even
   the Spirit of God also, as he has his time to work, so he has a time
   also to leave off working; a time to solicit and persuade, and a time
   to depart.

   But here, before I enter upon the second thing, to prevent
   misapprehensions, you must here observe, when I say there is a set time
   of the Spirit's working, after which it ceases, it is not to be
   understood of a general set time, which is the same in every man, and
   beyond which these workings never pass; as for example, because forty
   years was the set time of the Spirit's striving with Israel, we are not
   thence to conclude, that it will continue its workings just so long
   with all the world besides: but it is to be meant of a set and stinted
   time in respect of every particular man's life, in which there is some
   limited period, wherein the workings of the Spirit will for ever stop.
   For as it merely depends upon the sovereignty of God's good pleasure,
   whether or no there should be any such workings at all; so it is
   likewise absolutely at his disposal to prolong or shorten their
   continuance. Only this we may rationally collect; where the means of
   grace are more plentiful, there the Spirit, upon resistance, sooner
   departs. Now these being more fully, clearly, and convincingly dealt
   forth under the dispensations of the gospel, than those of the law, we
   may conclude this also, that the Spirit in such times is quicker in his
   despatches, and shorter in his stay. Thus God forbore the fig-tree but
   three years, and the children of Israel forty. And no wonder; that was
   in a fruitful soil, these in the wilderness. And God will bear with
   that unfruitfulness in a wilderness, that he will not in his vineyard.

   II. Having thus proved the point by scripture, and withal given you
   some caution for the understanding of it; I proceed in the next place
   to shew, how the Spirit may be resisted in its workings upon the heart.
   Herein, as for those controversies, whether the workings of the Spirit,
   by which a man is not actually converted, were yet notwithstanding
   sufficient for his conversion; or, when one resists the Spirit, and
   another does not, whether this proceeds from the different operations
   of the Spirit, or the different dispositions of the hearts wrought
   upon; I shall not undertake here to determine. But this I shall presume
   to affirm, that what God never intended should convert a man was never
   able to convert him: and moreover, what never actually does convert him
   was never fully intended for his conversion: otherwise, if it was, we
   must make his intentions frustrate; which, I think, cannot be affirmed,
   without a blasphemous derogation from his power and his wisdom. But to
   the point in hand, namely, to shew how many ways the Spirit may be
   resisted. Where we must first lay down, what it is in general to resist
   the Spirit. And this I conceive is, in brief, to disobey the Spirit
   commanding and persuading the soul to the performance of duty and the
   avoidance of sin.

   Now the Spirit commands and persuades two ways.

   1. Externally, by the letter of the word, either written or preached.

   2. By its immediate internal workings upon the soul, which I shall
   reduce to two.

   (1.) The illumination of the understanding.

   (2.) The conviction of the will.

   Now suitable to all these ways of the Spirit's dealing with us, there
   are so many different acts of resistance, by which these dealings are
   opposed.

   Of all which in their order.

   1. Concerning the resistance of the Spirit in disobeying the letter of
   the word. The reason that disobedience to the word is to be accounted
   an opposing of the Spirit, is because the word was dictated and
   inspired by the Spirit itself. As we have it in 2 Pet. i. ult. Prophecy
   came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as
   they were moved by the Spirit. Therefore to disobey what was writ and
   delivered by them, was, in effect, to disobey the Spirit that did
   inspire them. I may truly say of this word, that it is the voice of
   God, and not of a man: and what God is the author of, that he will
   certainly own, both by his encouragements of those that obey it, and
   his judgments upon those that reject it. It may indeed be delivered by
   a poor, inconsiderable, obscure man, but even so it is stampt with the
   appointment of God, and will do thorough execution: be the cloud never
   so obscure and dark, yet lightning may break from it, to the terror and
   shaking of all beholders. This word, that is so slighted by sinful man,
   is no less than the power of the almighty God to salvation; that
   instrument which the Divine Omnipotence uses to convert souls. Look but
   into the law; and if thou hast a spiritual ear open to hear it, it will
   speak with a voice that will make thee tremble. Read the gospel; and if
   ever God do thee good by it, thou wilt feel it like a twoedged sword,
   dividing between thee and thy dearest lusts. It will be a fiery, a
   searching word; it will pierce into thy very heart, and unbosom all thy
   retired corruptions: it will discover to thee those two great
   mysteries, the mystery of godliness and of iniquity: it will mightily
   convince of sin, righteousness, and judgment: it will display how
   cursed and bitter a thing it is to sin against an almighty God; how
   excellent and amiable it is to follow him in the traces of a pure
   conversation. It will also lay before thee the certainty, the horror,
   and dreadfulness of the day of judgment to all the impenitent. This is
   the power, this is the energy and the force of the word; and if it
   never had this effect upon thy heart, it was because thou hast resisted
   the Spirit speaking in it.

   It may here be demanded how the Spirit may be resisted speaking in the
   word.

   I answer, two ways.

   1. By a negligent hearing and a careless attendance upon it.

   2. By acting in a clear and open contrariety to it.

   1. Concerning the first, the resistance of the Spirit speaking in the
   word by a superficial attendance upon it. As for those that seldom or
   never hear it at all; that keep out of the Spirit's reach; that are
   such fools as not only to put the evil day, but also the good day far
   from them; that do not so much resist, as wholly reject the Spirit;
   their condition, no doubt, is very sad and desperate. Certainly Sodom
   and Gomorrah will be able to commence a plea for themselves at the day
   of judgment that these cannot: for the joyful sound never rung in their
   ears, the gospel was never brought to their doors; but these have had
   the means even offered to them, and refused them. But if the word has
   been a burden, and sabbaths have been a trouble, what a weight will
   there be in damnation! A man shall one day be accountable, not only for
   the sermons that he has heard, but for those also that he might have
   heard. But to pass over those who scarce merit the name of professors,
   there is another sort, that indeed hear the word, yet with that supine
   negligence, that they cannot quit themselves from being ranked amongst
   the contemners of the Spirit. Some indeed hear the sound of the word as
   of the wind, but, for want of attention, scarce know from whence it
   comes, nor whither it goes. Some suffer wandering thoughts, like the
   fowls of the air, to intercept the seed, before it falls upon their
   hearts. Some by reason of their own idle discourses cannot hear the
   voice of the Spirit. Some sleep, and shut their eyes against that light
   that might otherwise shine into their souls. And is not this to despise
   the Spirit? Believe it; as it is the greatest affront that we can offer
   to any considering man, when he is seriously speaking to us, and that
   about the things of our own concernment, to be thinking of something
   else, and not to regard him; so in these addresses of the Spirit to us
   about the things of our own eternal peace, not to attend or observe
   him, is so much greater a contempt, by how much the Spirit of God is
   greater than the greatest of men.

   2. The second way of resisting the Spirit speaking in the word is by
   acting contrary to that word. The most considerable thing in man is his
   actions. Every action it is defined, fluxus virium agentis; it is the
   drawing forth the very spirit and vigour of the agent upon some object:
   thoughts like shadows in the mind quickly vanish; words are transient,
   and pass away; but deeds and actions will abide. Accordingly God lays
   all the stress of religion upon these: the law runs thus; Do this, and
   thou shalt live: the gospel says, Not every one that cries Lord, Lord,
   but he that does the will of my Father, shall enter into heaven. Both
   agree in this, that they put not men upon bare words and wishes, but
   upon doing. Nay, let me further say, if it were possible that we could
   do the will of God without hearing of it, it was no matter whether we
   heard it or no; for hearing is not intended for itself, but in order to
   doing. We read of one in the gospel that was commanded by his father to
   go work in the vineyard, but he denied, and said he would not go; yet
   notwithstanding was excused, because at length he did go: and so
   expiated the evil of his words by the goodness of his deeds. Therefore
   it is the obedience or disobedience of our actions that the Spirit of
   God chiefly regards. You may hear the word, and, what is more, you may
   hear it with attention; yet if by your practice you contradict the
   things that you have heard, this is to resist the Spirit. To hear or
   read the precepts of God, and yet do things contrary to those precepts;
   to hear the thunder of his curses, and yet not to be wrought upon, so
   as to avoid the cursed thing; this is notoriously to resist the Spirit.
   He that shall hear God commanding him not to take his name in vain, and
   yet pollute it with hideous blasphemous oaths; that shall hear Christ
   forbidding wantonness, even in the glance of an eye, and yet roll
   himself in folly and uncleanness; he that shall hear that dreadful
   voice of God, Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord negligently,
   and yet come unprepared to duties, and, being come, slightly perform
   them; surely such a person is to be reckoned amongst the highest
   opposers of the Spirit. If every idle word renders a man obnoxious to
   judgment, shall not a downright breach of the law by action sink a man
   under a much more heavy condemnation? He that will not hear, or,
   hearing, takes no notice of the laws of his prince, is a disobedient
   subject; but he that acts in opposition to them is an open rebel. Now
   the reasons that this kind of resisting the Spirit in our actions is so
   great, may be these two.

   1. Because action is the very perfection and consummation of sin. Sin
   may indeed make a foul progress in our thoughts and desires, and step a
   little further in our words; but when it comes to be acted, then it
   attains its full pitch, and becomes perfect.

   2. Because sin in the actions argues an overflowing and a redundancy of
   sin in the heart. A sinful action it is only the boiling over of sin as
   it lies there: for the heart it is yet in the womb; for as the apostle
   says, there it is conceived: but in the actual commission of it, it is
   then brought forth: so that if (according to our Saviour's word)
   through the abundance of the heart a man speaks, then certainly from
   the exceeding superabundance of it does he proceed to action.

   Having thus shewn how the Spirit is resisted in its external speaking
   in the word, I shall next shew how it is resisted in its immediate
   internal workings upon the soul.

   Here we must reflect upon ourselves, and know that, upon the unhappy
   fall of man, sin, and the wretched effects of sin, immediately entered
   upon, and took full possession of all his faculties: his understanding,
   that before shined clear like the lamp of God, was by sin overspread
   with darkness: his will, that bore a perfect conformity to the divine
   will, was rendered totally averse from and contrary to the things of
   God. When man was first created, there was such an exact symmetry and
   harmony of all the faculties, such an absolute composure of the whole,
   that he was not only the workmanship, but also the image of his Maker.
   But sin shattered all, it took the whole fabric asunder. And thus the
   soul, being broke and ruined, (as God threatened to Babylon, in Isaiah
   xiii. 21,) became desolate, and a place of doleful creatures; that is,
   black and dismal apprehensions of God's wrath, and gross ignorance of
   his will, lodging in the understanding: and a place for satyrs to dance
   in; that is, of brutish lusts, and impure desires, acting, moving, and
   taking their pastime in the will. Now God the Father, through the
   admirable contrivance of his wisdom, and the propensity of his mercy,
   intending man's recovery, and the Son as mediator undertaking it, it
   was requisite that in order to it, he should take away and cure all
   these distempers both of man's understanding and his will. Hereupon, by
   virtue of the power committed to him as mediator, he issues forth the
   Spirit as the purchase of his death, for the accomplishment of these
   gracious ends, in renewing and recruiting the decayed nature of man.
   And this he does by the two forementioned works, to wit, illumination
   and conviction; in both of which the Spirit may be resisted.

   1. Concerning our resistance of it in illumination, or its enlightening
   work. Where note by way of caution, that by the works of the Spirit I
   understand not the extraordinary efficacious works thereof in true
   conversion; for these are not resistible, inasmuch as they take away
   our resistance: they depend not upon the courtesy of our wills as to
   their success, but upon the sole power of God forcing his way through
   the heart in spite of all opposition. But I speak of its common works,
   such as a man may frustrate, such as he may be partaker of, and yet
   perish. And these enlightenings both may be and often are resisted by
   the soul. Illumination in general may be described, the Spirit's
   infusing a certain light into the mind, whereby it is in some measure
   enabled to discern and judge of the things of God. Now this light is
   threefold.

   1. That universal light which we usually term the light of nature, yet
   so as it may also be rightly termed the light of the Spirit; but in a
   different respect. It is called the light of nature, because of its
   general inherence in all men; because it is commensurate and of equal
   extent with nature, so that wheresoever the nature of man is to be
   found, there this light is to be found. It enlightens every man that
   comes into the world. But on the other hand, it is called the light of
   the Spirit, in respect of the Spirit's efficiency, in that it is the
   producing cause of it, as it is of every good and perfect gift. This
   light it is the first breathing of God upon our nature, the very first
   draught and lineaments of the new creature; it is, as it were, the
   first dawning of the Spirit upon the soul, in those connate principles
   born with us into the world, and discovering, though very imperfectly,
   some general truths; as that there is a God, and that this God is to be
   worshipped, and the like. Yet this is but a glimmering, imperfect
   light, and such an one as carries with it a greater mixture of
   darkness; like the break of day, which has in it more of night, it is
   but one remove from darkness. The Spirit of God shining barely in
   nature, it is like the sun shining through a cloud, but with a faint,
   weak brightness, made rather to refresh than satisfy. Yet this was all
   the heathens had, in whom especially the imperfection of it appeared,
   as not being able to rescue them from idolatry, from villainous and
   unnatural lusts, both of which are the blush of nature as well as of
   religion. Yet by this light they shall be judged, and by this
   condemned. Wherefore of all sins that resist the Spirit, loathe and
   detest those that resist it speaking in nature, which are so gross and
   horrid, as not to be named, much less to be committed. Certainly these
   stains are not the stains and spots of God's children: nature itself is
   corrupted, yet it will testify aloud against such hideous corruptions.
   Conscience is corrupted, yet, like the unjust judge, through the
   importunity and cry of such, it will judge righteously. To be unnatural
   is something more than to be irreligious; for a man to offer violence
   to the principles, what is it but a spiritual self-murder? To cease to
   be a man, is something worse than not to be a saint. O reverence
   therefore this light, set up by God himself in our nature. As we are
   not to rely upon it as our only guide, so are we upon no hand to sin
   against it: walking according to its directions is not sufficient to
   save us, but going contrary to them will certainly condemn us.

   2. The second kind of light may be called a notional scripture light;
   that is, a bare knowledge of or assent to scripture truths. This light
   is begot in the mind of all professors by the mere hearing or reading
   the word: it is the bare perception of evangelical truths placed in the
   intellect, resting in the brain, treasured up there by a naked
   apprehension and speculation. So that the resisting this, being almost
   the same with our resistance of the Spirit speaking in the word, only
   with this difference, that in the former we resist the word as
   considered in the letter, in this we resist it as it lies transcribed
   in the conceptions of the understanding: I say, since this almost
   coincides with the former, which I have discussed already, I shall
   proceed no further in it, only leave this to your consideration, that
   if the poor heathens fell under the wrath and curse of God, only for
   resisting the Spirit in the dim light of nature; then how will it be
   possible for us to escape, if we resist it now shining openly (like the
   sun in his might) in the clear discovery of the law and gospel? As the
   light which we resist is greater or less, so is the proportion of our
   sin either diminished or advanced. Therefore if we disobey the Spirit,
   what can follow, but that as our light, so our sin also, must be far
   greater than theirs, and our punishment answerable? For assuredly, the
   just God, who takes the exact and true dimensions of sin, will heat the
   furnace of his wrath seven times hotter for gospel reprobates, than for
   ignorant heathens.

   3. The third kind of light may be called a special convincing light,
   which is an higher degree of the enlightening work of the Spirit, and
   not common to all professors, yet such a one as may be resisted, yea
   and totally extinguished. This is the highest attainment of the soul on
   this side saving grace; it is like the clear shining of the moon and
   stars, which is the greatest light that is consistent with a state of
   darkness. Yea it is such a light as does not only make a discovery of
   the things of God, but also engenders in the soul a certain relish and
   taste of them. It is a light, not only of knowledge, but of joy; and
   this it was that enlightened the stony ground in Matt. xiii. 20, which
   did not only hear and apprehend the word, but also with joy received
   it: yet we see in the next verse, that it was not able to withstand
   tribulations and persecutions, but when the storms arose, and the wind
   beat upon it, it quickly went out; like a torch before a tempest, after
   a very short and weak contest, it was soon extinguished. However, we
   must know, that this light is the ultimus conatus, the last and
   greatest endeavour of the Spirit upon a reprobate soul, which once
   finally resisted for ever departs, and leaves the soul under an
   everlasting night, without any after returns of day. To be thus
   enlightened, is called in scripture to taste of the heavenly gift, to
   be partaker of the Holy Ghost, and of the powers of the world to come,
   as it is expressed in Heb. vi. 4, 5: and of the desperate, deplorable
   condition of those that miscarry under these illuminations, we have an
   account in the next verse; If they fall away, it is impossible to renew
   them again to repentance. The wicked, says God, shall fall, and never
   rise.

   He that shall hear what report the gospel makes of the nature of sin,
   and be so far affected with a lively sense and feeling of it, as to
   resolve against it, to hate it, even to a relinquishment of it, and
   continue for a long time so to do, yet notwithstanding at length
   disentangle himself from those thoughts and apprehensions of sin, so
   far as to relapse into the fearful commission and love of it, that
   man's case is grievous, and his wound not easily curable. For God
   intends these, illuminations as singular special means, both to allure
   the soul to duty by the discovery of the love of Christ, and to awe it
   from sin by the terrors of hell. Now when a man desires to sleep
   securely in the free enjoyment of his sin, and shall therefore seek to
   put out this light, we have no ground to conclude that the Spirit will
   ever restore it. He that frowardly and foolishly puts out his candle,
   is not sure to blow it in again. As for those common shinings of it
   that beam forth in the notion of the word, they indeed may be renewed
   every sermon, they are such beams as we read of, occidere et redire
   possunt. But when this special light is extinct, when this sets in
   darkness, the soul that is thus benighted is left to sleep a perpetual
   sleep of sin and death.

   And thus much concerning the first inward work of the Spirit, to wit,
   illumination of the understanding; we come now to the second, which is
   the conviction of the will, which conviction may be described in
   general,

   A work of the Spirit of God upon the will and affections, producing in
   them some imperfect liking of the ways of God, and dislike to the ways
   of sin.

   There is a clear and open passage between the understanding and the
   will. Light in the one naturally begets heat in the other, and the
   conviction of the affections is never greater than the illumination of
   the judgment. So that when the work of the Spirit miscarries about the
   understanding, it never throughly succeeds in the will; for it strikes
   the will and the affections through the understanding; and if it cannot
   pierce this, it is not to be imagined how the blow can reach the other.

   Now the convincing works of the Spirit upon the will may be reduced to
   these three.

   1. A begetting in it some good desires, wishes, and inclinations.

   2. An enabling it to perform some imperfect obedience.

   3. An enabling it to leave some sins.

   In all these works the Spirit may be resisted and opposed.

   1. And first, it may be resisted in the good desires and inclinations
   that it suggests to the will. That these good desires issue from the
   Spirit, I suppose none will deny, who acknowledges that of ourselves we
   are not so much as able to think a good thought. He that affirms holy
   duties may proceed from an unholy, corrupt heart, may as well expect
   grapes from thorns, and figs from thistles. As there are some desires
   so exceeding black and hellish, that it easily appears they came into
   the mind from their father the Devil; so on the contrary there are some
   so pure and holy, that they may be quickly discerned to be the
   offspring of the Spirit, as bearing his image and likeness. Good
   inclinations, they are the firstborn of holiness in the soul, the very
   first endeavours and throes of the new birth. And as they are the
   first, so in reason they may be thought to be most imperfect, and
   consequently most easy to be rejected: a good desire stepping forth
   amongst raging and unmortified lusts, it is like righteous but weak
   Lot, endeavouring to appease the tumult of the Sodomites. O! how easily
   is it forced to retire! how quickly is it repulsed! It is like a drop
   of water falling into a furnace, that presently exhales, and does not
   at all allay the fury of its heat. How often has the Spirit whispered
   to us, This is the way, walk in it, and our perverse hearts have
   hurried us another way! How often has many a soul thoughts of
   relinquishing its sin, and returning to God, and yet by the allurement
   of new pleasures has been inveigled and recalled back! How often do
   some think of repairing to Christ, and yet are held fast by the fetters
   of prevailing lust! And all this befalls men, because they improve not
   these blessed inclinations. O! were we but true to our own souls, to
   cherish these tender, new-born, infant desires, and to carry them to
   Christ by prayer, certainly he would take them in his arms and bless
   them, and send them away strengthened. Every sincere desire to pray
   might be improved to a blessed communion with God; every secret dislike
   of impurity might be wrought up to sanctity of life and conversation. O
   despise not therefore the day of small things; shut not your ears
   against the secret admonitions of the Spirit; they are none other than
   God himself speaking to thee (as to Elijah) in a still voice. You may
   one day come to know, when with bitterness of soul you shall reflect
   upon and recollect all these dealings of the Spirit: Such a time I had
   an inclination to confess my idleness, my intemperance before God, and
   amend it; but I hearkened to the dissuasions of my corrupt heart, and
   so neglected it. Such a time I had strong motions and intentions to
   restore my ill-gotten goods; but my covetousness restrained me. I say,
   then you will know and confess, (as Jacob did of Bethel,) Of a truth
   God was in all these workings, and I knew it not.

   2. The Spirit may be opposed, as it enables the soul to perform some
   imperfect obedience to God's commands. A man, by the convincing energy
   of the Spirit in the word, may be led, or rather drawn to many duties.
   Thus Herod, in Mark vi. 20, upon the soul-searching ministry of John,
   is said to have done many things. The Israelites also, in Psalm
   lxxviii. 34, were driven by God's judgments to proceed very far in his
   worship; When he slew them, (it is said,) they sought him: and they
   returned and inquired early after God. So that here we have both duty
   and earnestness in duty; but we see in the following verse they quickly
   got loose from those convictions; They flattered him with their mouth,
   and lied unto him with their lips: that is, their ensuing practices
   foully falsified all those fair promises of obedience which they made
   under their convictions. Such men's hearts may be often heated by the
   lively and warm impressions of the Spirit; yet by their innate
   corruptions, as it were, their proper form, like water heated, they are
   quickly recovered to their native coldness. In Job xxvii. 10, Job says,
   Will the hypocrite always call upon God? Implying, I conceive, that
   from the motions of God's Spirit he may engage very fairly in that
   duty, though he fall short of continuance. See the convincing works of
   God's Spirit upon Ephraim, in Hosea vi. 4; they wrought in him some
   superficial beginnings of goodness; but, as it is there expressed, it
   was like a morning cloud, when temptations arose it posted away, and
   like the early dew, presently drunk up by the scorching heat of raging
   lusts. Now this resistance of the Spirit is much more heinous than the
   former, inasmuch as the practice of holiness is greater than a bare
   desire and inclination to it. To injure or offend him that does but
   wish and desire our good, argues little ingenuity; but to grieve and
   oppose him that actually endeavours it, shews a plain want of humanity.
   For him, who has maintained some communion with the Spirit, and has
   took sweet counsel with him, so that they have often walked to the
   house of God in company; I say, for such an one to lift up his heel in
   acts of defiance and resistance of the Spirit, this is very grievous.
   When a man has proceeded very far in the mortification of his pride,
   his drunkenness, his lust, for him to return again to the same excess
   of riot, this is a more than ordinary provocation. When he is upon a
   fair advance to Zoar, to the city of life and deliverance, for such an
   one to look back upon Sodom, and cast an eye of desire upon his
   forsaken filth; it is just with God to make such an one a wonder and a
   sad example of his abused mercy. But this is the upshot of all, this is
   the very dividing point where the Spirit of God and the souls of men
   break and part for ever; they find a cursed pleasure in sin, and none
   in a course of duty: and so, maugre all the entreaties and wooing
   convictions of the Spirit, they relinquish duty, and return to sin.

   3. The Spirit may be opposed in that convincing work, whereby it
   enables the will to forsake some sins. This work bears some affinity
   with the former, but it is not altogether the same. I confess, to yield
   perfect obedience to all God's commands does include in it a forsaking
   of all sin, and is consequentially, yea and really, the same with it.
   But imperfectly to execute some good duties, and imperfectly to leave
   some sins, which is here intended, are two distinct things. Now that
   the Spirit is able to work up a soul even to this also, and that the
   soul is likewise able to frustrate this work, these following
   scriptures will demonstrate. 2 Peter ii. 20, we have some that by the
   convincing help of the Spirit had escaped the pollutions of the world,
   they had washed their hands of all those enormities that raged and
   reigned in the lives of grosser sinners. Yet in the same verse we have
   these also again entangled and overcome by their lusts; and thereupon
   compared to the most filthy creatures, which being washed, with much
   greediness return to their beloved mire and defilements. In Gal. iii.
   3, we find some who had begun in the Spirit, yet in danger to have
   ended in the flesh; so treacherous is sin in its departure, and so
   violent in its returns. Certainly in these cases it seems to retire and
   draw back, only to come on afterwards with a greater assault. For the
   appetite of sin being only restrained, not taken away, it returns after
   a while with more violent fury upon its object: and like a thirsty man,
   the longer it has forebore to drink of the pleasures of sin, it takes
   so much deeper a draught of them at length. Thus sin is only pent up in
   the soul by main force of the Spirit; but when it finds the least vent,
   it lashes out to the purpose: some cannot neglect duties as they used
   to do, because the terrors of God are upon their souls; some dare not
   venture upon their former lewd courses, because the Spirit meets them
   with the drawn sword of God's vengeance, casting the very flashes of
   hell in their faces, if they step a foot into those ways. So that here
   the sinner is indeed held in bonds, but his sinful nature is still
   unchanged; like the devils themselves, who though they are kept in
   chains, yet they are still devils in chains. The soul has lost the
   present exercise of sin, yet still retains the faculty: but at length
   the Spirit having for a long time kept the soul from its lust, as God
   did Balaam from his covetousness, and still hearing it crying and
   craving after its beloved corruption; even as God let Balaam go upon
   the like importunity, so the Spirit slacks his hold, and lets the soul
   loose to its sin. And then it sins at an high rate indeed; better were
   it for a man never to have given the Spirit any room, any place in his
   heart, than at length thus to turn it out. We may truly say of this
   holy guest, turpius ejicitur, quam non admittitur; yea safer had it
   been for such a soul to have still wallowed in his sin, than being once
   rescued from it, again to apostatize to it. For this is to sin from
   choice, and that from choice grounded upon experience; for having tried
   both ways, to wit, those of the Spirit and those of sin, by such
   returns to it he does aloud proclaim his judgment to the world that sin
   is better.

   And thus much concerning the second general head, to shew how many ways
   the Spirit may be resisted: I proceed to the third, to shew the reasons
   why upon such resistance the Spirit finally withdraws.

   1. The first reason is drawn from God's decree. This is that which
   bounds all things, and fixes the freest operations of second causes:
   the event of things in themselves merely contingent, by this degree is
   stampt certain and infallible. It turns a casualty into a certainty; a
   contingency into a necessity. And as the actions of the creature are
   limited and determined by this decree, so the most free actions of God
   himself come also within the restraining compass of the same. God
   purposes before he acts, and his purpose it is the measure of his
   operations: and what God wills, he wills immutably. His wisdom and
   infinite knowledge foresees and debates all inconveniences antecedently
   to every act of volition; and so there can be no new emergent
   inconvenience that may unframe his resolutions and cause a change.
   Accordingly the workings and strivings of God's Spirit are measured out
   and bounded by this decree; by virtue of which its departure is firmly
   and irreversibly intended, and some resistance of it is thereby put
   beyond pardon. Some think the like of the great sin against the Holy
   Ghost, that is not unpardonable from its own nature, but from God's
   special decree; not because it is of so great malignity as to surpass
   the extent of God's mercies, nor yet because it is inconsistent with
   the means of obtaining pardon; but that God by an act of sovereignty
   singled out this sin, and for the glory of his justice, and the terror
   of those that should abuse his grace, passed a decree for ever to
   exclude it from all possibility of remission. But thus much by way of
   digression. Now this decree has not any active influence or efficiency,
   so as actually to produce or put in being the thing decreed. I say the
   decree itself does not effect the thing, but it engages God's veracity
   and immutable truth to see it certainly effected. There is nothing
   therefore but, if we pursue it to its first original, must of necessity
   terminate in this decree, as deriving from hence the first rise and
   reason of its being. I say the reason, though not the cause. In
   Ephesians i. 11, God is said to work all things according to the
   counsel of his own will. He resembles an excellent artificer, who in
   all his works of art has forelaid in his mind a perfect model of his
   intended fabric, before ever he sets the first hand to it. It is
   finished in the contrivance, before it is so much as begun in the
   production. God says, Shall I decree, and shall it not come to pass? So
   by inversion we may say, Shall any thing come to pass, and shall not he
   decree? Would we know why the Spirit of God departed from Judas, even
   to the loss and perdition of his soul? We have an account in John xvii.
   12; it was, that the scriptures might be fulfilled; that is, that the
   will or decree of God delivered in scripture concerning Judas might be
   accomplished.

   Now what terrors should this strike into all resisters of the Spirit,
   all prodigals of the means of grace! Whosoever spends upon mercy,
   spends upon a set allowance. God has allotted and decreed to every man
   his portion in the Spirit's workings, which, by reason of the enforcing
   power of that decree, he will never extend nor contract, diminish nor
   augment. And since it is not known to us in what point of our life God
   has set this fatal bound, as it is a sovereign remedy to prevent
   despair, that none might unadvisedly conclude against himself, that he
   had finally resisted the Spirit: so on the other hand it ought to be a
   strong argument to cut short the outrageous progress of a presuming
   sinner, since he knows not but the very next sin he is closing with,
   may separate between him and the Spirit of God for ever. For shall God
   limit the natural days of our life, beyond which we cannot pass, as it
   is in Job xiv. 5, and shall the days of the Spirit's striving with us
   be undetermined? Certainly what he says of those may be said of the
   Spirit's workings, they are all numbered. And that they are so will
   appear one day, when those exact bills of our accounts, relating all
   our opposings even of the smallest motions of the Spirit, shall be
   preferred and read against us. Can we then (as it is expressed in the
   prophet,) disannul God's covenant with day and night? Can we disappoint
   or change the ordinances of heaven and earth? Then may we stretch the
   fixed time of the Spirit's dealing with our hearts beyond God's decree.
   Then may we, when our day of grace is expiring, cause the sun of mercy
   to go ten degrees backward. Alas! poor inconsiderable, impotent men! We
   must lay our mouths in the dust, and give way to the irresistible
   decree of God for ever. Can all the men in the world, by the united
   force of their power and policy, hinder the sun from setting but for
   the space of one hour? nay, but of one moment? And can we weak sinful
   worms prolong our precious day of grace at our pleasure? True it is,
   the mercy of God is infinite, and his goodness past finding out; but he
   that has set bars and doors to the sea has also set bounds to this
   ocean of his mercy, and said, Thus far shall you come in your strivings
   with such a soul, and no further.

   2. The second reason why the Spirit departs upon resistance, is because
   it is most agreeable to the great intent and design of the gospel. And
   this is twofold, suitable to which the Spirit does accordingly
   appropriate a twofold operation.

   1. The first great gospel design is the converting and saving the
   elect; and this is accomplished by an effectual converting power, which
   in its addresses to the soul is invincible. It does not persuade but
   overpower; and therefore never fails or miscarries, but effectually
   converts, sanctifies, and reduces the soul. The infallible success of
   the work depends upon the irresistible force of the agent: by a happy,
   alluring, yet efficacious violence it draws; Jeremiah xxxi. 3, With
   lovingkindness have I drawn thee. Wheresoever this power draws, the
   soul certainly follows: I rather say certainly than necessarily,
   because necessity may seem to intrench upon the free spontaneity of the
   will, although it is clear that there is a kind of necessity which is
   compatible with its freedom. The drawing work of the Spirit it has the
   strength, but not the violence of coaction, Luke xiv. 23, Compel them
   to come in. There is a compulsion indeed, but not such an one as is
   against the will; but such an one as makes it willing. And this alone
   is sufficient to enervate the objections of those free-willers, that
   exclaim of coaction and compulsion in an irresistible converting work.
   Thus therefore the Spirit effects God's great and primary gospel
   design, in calling home his sheep, his chosen ones, the objects of his
   eternal love: and this is done by an effectual, never-failing power in
   their vocation; by which they are fully instated in their present
   possession of grace, and sufficiently secured in their hopes of glory
   for the future.

   2. The second end and design of the gospel is to render reprobates
   inexcusable; and this is no less effectually done by the common
   enlightening, convincing works of the Spirit, which are sufficient to
   take off all pleas, to silence them in their own defence, and to
   enhance their guilt beyond excuse. It is confessed, the converting,
   renewing work of the Spirit was never vouchsafed to any reprobate; they
   were never admitted to share in the children's bread. Yet God's denial
   of recovering grace cannot warrant them in a state of sin. All indeed
   through Adam were generally immersed into an equal plunge of misery,
   all were forlorn and broke, and as to the stock of their first
   righteousness totally bankrupt, and the law still remains a rigid
   exactor of obedience. The elect and reprobate both fell from their
   righteousness, but God was pleased to renew the store of the former,
   leaving the latter destitute: but may not God even from these require
   perfect obedience, though they have lost the power to perform it? A
   creditor does not lose his right to his money, because the debtor is
   unable to pay. Suppose a creditor have two debtors, and both turn
   bankrupt; now if he of his own free cost and favour supplies one
   wherewithal to discharge the debt, may he not therefore demand it of
   the other without the like supply? Certainly mercy to one does not
   weaken or take off the procedure of the law against the other; neither
   our merits nor our misery can lay any obligation upon God's grace. He
   that shall dare to cavil and expostulate with his Maker at such a rate
   of impiety and impudence, as the corrupt heart of man is apt to do; "Is
   it my fault that I remain unconverted under all my convictions? Had God
   vouchsafed to me converting grace as he did to others, I had been
   converted as well as they?" God will answer the expostulations of such
   men, as he did those, Matt. xx. 13, 15, Friend, I do thee no wrong. Is
   it not lawful to do with my own free grace as I please? Is thine eye
   evil and malicious, because I am good? Out of my mercy I bestowed
   converting grace upon such an unworthy sinner; out of my sovereignty I
   denied it to another, yet still without any impeachment to my justice.
   His justice is not at all injured when he confers grace upon one, nor
   his mercy lessened when he withholds it from another. However a man may
   for a while please himself in such objections against his Creator, and
   seem to himself to unreason the equity of God's proceedings; yet there
   will be a time when the sinner shall stand clearly convinced of the
   righteousness of God's dealings in his final departure from him; so as
   not to be able to plead or reply any thing against him in a rational
   way to all eternity: and this of all other will be the most stinging
   consideration, the most irksome and tormenting thought: for if we
   observe the vilest, the most profligate malefactor, when he stands
   openly convict, and that by the most pregnant evidence, he is apt to
   relieve his mind with such poor, perishing, forlorn persuasions, as,
   that he suffers unjustly, that he has hard measure, and that he smarts
   in the severe censures of men beyond the merit of his fact; then, I
   say, the slender comfort even of these apprehensions will fail the
   sinner. For he shall evidently find and know himself utterly forsaken
   and rejected by the Spirit, and withal see it most just and righteous
   that he should be so forsaken. This is that that will most bitterly
   gnaw and rack the proud heart of a reprobate, when he shall be forced
   to acknowledge that the Spirit's departure is not only his punishment,
   but his desert: he shall then confess, that the Spirit was as real in
   his workings, as he was peremptory in his resistance: that he was as
   pathetical and tender in the offers of grace, as he was obstinate in
   their refusal: that the Spirit with much eagerness would have often
   stepped between him and the commission of his beloved sin, and that he
   with as much vehemence rushed into it: that the Spirit had used many
   forcible arguments to conclude him into duty, and that he still flew
   off; and when he could not answer them, absolutely denied them. All
   these things, in the dismal remembrance of them, will be like so many
   vultures devouring and preying upon a self-condemned soul.

   But it may be here replied, What needs any continuance of the Spirit's
   workings to render a man inexcusable, since the very strivings of the
   Spirit in natural conscience is sufficient to effect this?

   I answer; that it is most true, that even nature itself is able to cut
   off all excuse from the mind of an awakened sinner: as is clear from
   Rom. i. 20, where Paul, speaking of the heathen, which were only acted
   by this principle, says, that they were without excuse. And again, in
   Rom. ii. 15, we read of their natural consciences excusing and accusing
   each other, according as their deeds were good or evil. From whence it
   clearly follows, that the motions of God's Spirit are continued and
   vouchsafed to the impenitent under the gospel, not barely to render
   them inexcusable, but to render them in a greater measure inexcusable,
   and to charge their impenitence with greater aggravations: for God
   intending to the reprobates different degrees of punishments, it is
   requisite that in order to it, he should present their sins under
   different aggravations.

   And thus we see God's two great gospel designs; the first of them to
   convert the elect, which is effected by the extraordinary power of the
   Spirit; the second to bereave the reprobate of excuse, which is
   accomplished by the ordinary strivings of it, in those convictions
   which in their issue prove ineffectual: so that now the Spirit having
   finished the end for which those workings were continued, what in
   reason can follow, but the end being acquired, those workings should
   cease? In human actions designed for the attainment of any end, when it
   is actually attained, the continuation of that action is irrational and
   absurd. And what is unsavoury and unbeseeming in the actions of men,
   shall we ascribe to those of the Spirit? A man may with as much reason
   set his reapers to work when he has finished his harvest, or set his
   labourers to prune and lop his trees, which by his own appointment they
   have already cut down, as the Spirit continue his strivings after he
   has fully accomplished God's end upon any sinner. He is sent only as
   God's agent or ambassador to do his message, and for a while to
   negotiate his business with the hearts of the impenitent, not to take
   up his fixed dwelling or habitation with them. Therefore it is most
   rational, that having done his message, and finished his embassy, he
   should depart.

   3. The third ground or reason why God withdraws his Spirit upon our
   resistance, is because it highly tends to the vindication of his
   honour.

   Now God may vindicate his honour two ways in the Spirit's departure.

   1. As it is a punishment to the sinner, that has dishonoured him. God's
   glory cannot be repaired but by the misery of the party that made a
   breach upon it. God cannot be glorious, till the offender is made
   miserable. Now this is a punishment exactly correspondent to the sin,
   that is totally spiritual. For can there be a greater punishment for a
   sinner, than to be permitted to take a full swing in the free
   satisfaction of his lust? When God bereaves a soul of his Spirit, there
   is, as I may say, a decree passed in the court of heaven, in respect of
   that soul, for liberty and toleration in sin. In this sense there is no
   distinction between the evil of sin and the evil of punishment; for the
   evil of sin is the greatest evil of punishment. If a man possessed with
   phrensy should endeavour to drown or stab himself, and being forcibly
   withheld, should fight and strive to have his will; could there be any
   greater punishment for his fighting and striving, than to be delivered
   over to the free execution of his intended mischief? We find the
   children of Israel grieving, and even fretting God's Spirit, in Ezek.
   xvi. 43, Thou hast fretted me in all these things. Now what course does
   God take to revenge himself? Does he threaten them with the sword, with
   famine and desolation? Does he give them over as a prey to their
   enemies, to be insulted over by a bitter captivity? No; but, what is
   worse, that he may inflict spiritual judgments, he causes temporal
   judgments to cease; in verse 42, I will make my fury toward thee to
   rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and
   will be no more angry: that is, his anger should grow to that height,
   that it should be too great to be outwardly expressed: it should burn
   inwardly: and so it is much more dreadful. The wind when it breaks
   forth, it only shakes the trees; but when it is pent up and restrained
   within the ground, it makes the very earth shake and tremble.
   Questionless, there is not an expression in all God's word, that does
   more fully and terribly hold forth God's anger, than this wherein he
   says he will be angry no more. It is clear therefore that God cannot
   vindicate his honour by inflicting a greater evil upon those that
   despise his Spirit, than by withdrawing it. Then God punishes the
   unjust man in a fearful way, when he inflicts that matchless curse in
   Revel. xxii. 11, and says, He that is unjust, let him be unjust still.
   Then does he take the sorest vengeance of the unclean person, when he
   withdraws the pure motions of his holy Spirit, and says, He that is
   filthy, let him be filthy still. No penalty for sin so dreadful, as a
   liberty to continue in sin.

   2. God may vindicate his honour by clearing his injured attributes from
   those aspersions that human mistakes might charge upon them: for upon
   God's merciful, patient continuance of his Spirit, after long
   opposition made against it, from the facility of God's forbearance, men
   are prone to conceive otherwise of God, than is either consistent with
   their duty or his honour. But now, by thus withdrawing of his Spirit,
   he does eminently vindicate and recover the repute of his injured
   attributes, and of these two especially.

   1. Of his wisdom. 2. Of his mercy.

   1. He vindicates and asserts the honour of his wisdom. I confess it is
   downright atheism to deny God's wisdom in words, and few will do it.
   But corruption is apt to think what atheism only will avouch. And there
   is a language of the heart which speaks clear enough to God's
   dishonour, though not to our hearing. The voice of it in such a case
   is, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most high? Psalm
   lxxiii. 11. Is it for God's wisdom to offer what he knows will be
   rejected; and to multiply his entreaties, that the sinner may only have
   occasion to multiply affronts? Is it prudence to urge and press a man
   with the continual offers of that thing, which we know him to be fully
   resolved for ever to refuse? Amongst men there is none but the covetous
   and the foolish that offer their gifts to those who they are sure will
   not accept them. He that shall give with the same importunity that
   others ask, and shall entreat men to receive his favours, plays the
   beggar in the midst of his liberality. Now as long as the Spirit
   prorogues his workings after an obstinate resistance of them, so long
   he only seeks and sues for a repulse; he courts an affront. It is mercy
   at first for God to send his Spirit; but when it is slighted, it is
   wisdom to revoke it.

   2. He vindicates the honour of his mercy. Such is the vileness of men,
   that even from mercy itself they take occasion to blaspheme mercy. For
   by thus presuming upon it, they do not so much think or speak, as act
   their blasphemies against it. He that goes on to sin against mercy, he
   either thinks that God knows it not, and so cannot punish him; or that
   he is of so impregnable a clemency that he will not. But as the former
   of these strikes at God's omniscience, so the latter at his mercy. For
   this is not properly mercy, but fondness; that is, an irrational mercy;
   which we cannot add to God's nature, but by such additions we should
   diminish and detract from his perfection.

   Now God by the departure of his Spirit vindicates the honour of his
   mercy in a double respect.

   1. By shewing that it is no ways inferior, much less contrary to his
   holiness. God's attributes do not interfere nor clash: the exercise of
   one does not justle out the other: they are at perfect agreement: and
   mercy will not enlarge itself to such a pitch as holiness will not
   warrant. God will let the resisters of his Spirit see, that as he was
   merciful to endure them so long, so he is too holy to bear with them
   any longer. For during the time of his forbearance, the repute of his
   holiness lies at stake. What glory did God gain to his mercy, as it is
   in Psalm l. by bearing with such as consented with thieves, as were
   partakers with adulterers, as gave their mouth to slanders and
   reproaches? I say, what glory did he gain in verse 21, These things
   hast thou done, and I kept silence; and thou thoughtest that I was
   altogether such an one as thyself? Here we see, in recompence of his
   forbearance, they question his righteousness; and from his permission
   conclude also his approbation of their wickedness.

   2. God in this vindicates the honour of his mercy, by making it clear
   that it is not repugnant to his justice: nay, that it is not only not
   repugnant to it, but also makes way for a severer execution of it: and
   from hence God may be said not only to be merciful because he will be
   merciful, but because he will be just. Mercy neither can nor will
   rescue an impenitent sinner from the hand of justice. All the time that
   the infinite mercy of God is striving and dealing with the heart of an
   obstinate sinner, his justice is like a sleeping lion, ready to tear
   him in pieces whensoever God shall awaken it. It is reported of
   Dionysius, that setting to sea after he had pillaged a temple, and
   having a very prosperous voyage, he cried out, O quam diis placet
   sacrilegium! How are the gods pleased with sacrilege! The case of the
   obstinate sinner is not much unlike: when men in the full pursuit of
   their sins find themselves yet followed by the fresh gales of the
   Spirit blowing upon their hearts, they are apt to conclude, that God
   will still wait their leisure, that these motions will be perpetual,
   and that therefore they may take their own time to accept of those
   terms, that they suppose will be always offered: and consequently they
   will venture to swear once more, to wantonize once again, to take
   another sip or two of the cup of intemperance, till the Spirit departs
   of a sudden, and leaves them in a state of irrecoverable hardness and
   perdition. As children, when they play by the seashore, they will in
   sport step a little into the water, and presently a foot further, and
   so on, till the tide unexpectedly comes, and sweeps them away beyond
   all possibility of return. As long as an obdurate sinner goes on
   resisting the Spirit, even the angels of heaven cry to God, How long, O
   Lord, holy and just! Where is the glory of thy holiness, and thy zeal
   for thy justice, that thou dost thus suffer so provoking, and yet so
   contemptible a creature to make a progress in his rebellion, to abuse
   thy grace, and to affront thy Spirit? Now the righteous God is here
   even engaged to withdraw his Spirit, and to vindicate the honour of his
   mercy by the exercise of his justice.

   4. God withdraws his Spirit upon resistance, because this naturally
   raises in the hearts of men an esteem and valuation of the Spirit's
   workings: and the reason of this is, because in so doing, men
   apparently see that God himself puts an esteem and value upon them,
   otherwise why should he so severely bereave men of them upon their
   abuse? Were it not a treasure, God would not be so choice of it. God
   shewed what a value he put upon his vineyard, by taking it from those
   husbandmen who had misemployed it.

   The great God is not jealous for a trifle. God can continue worldly
   riches to men even when they abuse them; but if a spiritual talent be
   misimproved, it must be taken away. Now upon whatsoever God shews his
   esteem, it is natural for men, acting rationally, to place theirs.

   Now the esteem that the departure of the Spirit begets upon their minds
   is twofold.

   1. An esteem of fear. For this, like the rest of God's judgments, is
   poena ad unum, terror ad omnes; a punishment indeed to one, but a
   terror to all. God in every punishment does not intend revenge so much
   as example. We read how the Spirit departed from Saul: and certainly
   God designed it not only for a judgment upon him, but also for a
   document of fear to others; otherwise, why do these things stand upon
   eternal record in scripture? Questionless the thought of this would put
   a stop to any sober sinner; it would give a restriction to his
   appetite: and if there be any thing that keeps the sinner from causing
   the Spirit to depart, it is the fear of his departure. Men are usually
   ruled and instructed by their fears. It is the height of spiritual
   prudence to draw caution from danger, to distil instruction from
   punishments. And from a serious consideration of the Spirit's final
   departure from others, to secure it in its abode with ourselves.

   2. The thought of this begets in the minds of the godly an esteem of
   love. When they shall know that God withdraws his Spirit from the
   unworthy abusers of it, and yet continues it to themselves
   notwithstanding all their unworthiness, if there be any but the least
   grain of pious ingenuity in them, they cannot but reflect upon this
   distinguishing love of God with melting returns of love and affection.
   For who is there, even amongst the most holy of men, but reflecting
   upon his own heart must of necessity confess, Is there not with me also
   an opposition to the Spirit, as well as in others? yet the Spirit has
   for ever departed from them, and still abides working and striving with
   me. Singularity puts a value and endearment upon mercy. Enjoyments that
   are peculiar are usually precious.

   Application. You have heard that there is a set time, after which the
   Spirit, being resisted, will cease to strive, and depart: you have also
   heard how many ways it may be resisted; and withal, the several grounds
   and reasons why it will withdraw upon such resistance. And now, what
   can be more seasonable than to wrap up all in the apostle's own
   exhortation, 1 Thess. v. 19, Quench not the Spirit. It is clear
   therefore that it may be quenched. And if so, it will be our prudence
   to avoid all those courses that may not only quench, but even cool it
   in its workings. Let every one be as careful and tender of grieving the
   Spirit, as he would be of grieving his only and his dearest friend.
   Believe it, it is this Spirit alone that is able to stand by and
   comfort you in all the disconsolate and dark passages of your lives.
   When he is gone, who shall resolve and clear up all the doubts of our
   misgiving and trembling consciences? who shall subdue all our
   corruptions? who shall bear up our desponding souls in the midst of
   afflictions? who shall ward off the force and fire of temptations? Our
   own deceiving hearts, an alluring world, a tempting Devil, and all the
   powers of sin and hell, will be let loose upon us: and, what is the
   greatest misery of all, being deprived of the Spirit, we shall have
   nothing to oppose them; no second to assist us. Be ready therefore to
   entertain it in all its motions; to cherish all its suggestions:
   whensoever it knocks at the door of your hearts, (as it often does,)
   stand prepared to open to it, and receive it with joy. When it speaks
   to you in the word, answer, as Samuel did, Speak, Lord, for thy servant
   hears. When it seems to pull you from sin, and says, Do not that
   abominable thing which my soul hates; draw back your hands from the
   commission of it, and do it not for a world. When it enables you to
   relinquish and forsake some sins, never rest till you have forsaken
   them all. When it raises you to the performance of some good duties,
   still press forward to perfection: let every holy motion and desire be
   improved into an holy action: but if you should at any time chance to
   grieve or oppose him, (as we do all of us too, too frequently,) yet be
   sure that you persist not in it, but recover yourselves by a speedy and
   a serious humiliation. Mourn over your disobedience, pray fervently for
   an obedient heart. Assuredly you will hereafter find, that it is better
   thus to strive with God in prayer, than with the Spirit in his
   workings. Now as arguments to dissuade or deter you from this, and
   withal to persuade and excite you to the former, take these motives.

   1st, Our resisting of the Spirit in his precepts and instructions will
   certainly bereave us of his comforts. Now the office of the Spirit
   consists in these two great works, to instruct and to comfort. The same
   Spirit that in John xvi. 7 is termed a Comforter, in the thirteenth
   verse is said to be a guide to lead into all truth. Where we must note,
   that his comforting work always presupposes and follows his work of
   instruction; yea, and it is dispensed to men as a reward for their
   obedience to that; nay, before this work pass upon the soul, it is not
   capable of the other. For the Spirit to pour in comfort to an impure
   heart, before it is qualified and cleansed, and as it were prepared, by
   its instructing, convincing work; it is as if a physician should
   administer cordials to a corrupt, foul body; they would do much more
   hurt than good, till the ill humours are purged and evacuated. He that
   will not be reformed cannot be comforted. God has inseparably joined
   these two together, and therefore it is presumption for any to hope to
   divide and put them asunder; as it is in Rom. xiv. 17, righteousness
   and joy in the Holy Ghost go linked together. Purity and spiritual joy
   are as closely united as sin and sorrow. It is in vain to catch at one
   and balk the other. He that will not obey the Spirit as his instructor
   shall never enjoy him as his comforter.

   Now the reason that such as resist the Spirit cannot enjoy his comforts
   is, because this resistance is inconsistent with those ways by which
   the Spirit speaks comfort; and these are two.

   1. The Spirit speaks comfortably, by giving a man to understand his
   interest in Christ, and consequently in the love of God. But it is
   impossible for him that resists the Spirit to be sure of any of these,
   inasmuch as he falls under those qualifications that render a man the
   proper object of God's hatred, and totally estranged from Christ; 1
   John iii. 6, Whosoever abideth in Christ sinneth not; and whosoever
   sinneth hath neither seen nor known him. I suppose it will be easily
   granted, that he who acts in a continual repugnancy to God's Spirit, by
   a despisal of all his holy motions and suggestions, sins, and that at a
   very high strain; and upon this concession, this scripture will
   unavoidably conclude him so far unacquainted with Christ, as neither to
   have seen nor known him. And can we rationally imagine, that he who has
   neither seen nor known Christ can have any sure interest in him? He
   that is interested in Christ is his friend; John xv. 15, I call you not
   servants, but friends: but he that is not so much as an acquaintance
   cannot possibly be a friend. And for any interest in God's love, he is
   totally excluded from that; Psalm xi. 5, The wicked his soul hateth.
   And such are all resisters of God's Spirit, wicked in the highest, kat'
   exoche`n, and by way of eminence. Now how can the Spirit convey comfort
   to such persons? To whom if he reports the truth, as the Spirit of
   truth can do no otherwise, he must tell them that they are aliens to
   Christ, strangers to the covenant, enemies to God, haters of him, and
   therefore hated by him. Now if these can be arguments of comfort, then
   he that resists God's Spirit may be comforted.

   2. The second way by which the Spirit comforts a man, is by discovering
   to him that grace that is within him; that is, not only by clearing up
   God's love to him, but also by making him see his love to God. The
   strength of this, as it is an argument of comfort, lies here. Because
   our love to God it is the proper effect, and therefore the infallible
   sign of God's love to us, which is the great basis and foundation of
   all comfort. We therefore love because we were first beloved. But can
   the love of God abide in him who resists and does despite to his
   Spirit? Can any one at the same time fight like an enemy and love like
   a friend? The sinner cannot give any true evidence of his love to God,
   inasmuch as a continual, obstinate resistance of the Spirit is
   inconsistent with grace; and it implies a contradiction for any one to
   love God, and to oppose that Spirit, that is a Spirit of love.

   And thus it is clear, that such as resist the Spirit's strivings cannot
   share in his comforts. And how unconceivably sad and miserable it is to
   want them, none knows so much as those that have wanted them. If God
   should let loose all the sorest afflictions of this life upon you, and
   should awaken your consciences to accuse you, and withal possess your
   guilty, despairing souls with a lively sense of his wrath for sin, and
   fill you with the terrors of hell, so that you should even roar by
   reason of the disquietness of your hearts, as he had done to some, and
   particularly to David, you would then know what it is to have the
   Spirit as a comforter. However, when you come to look death in the
   face, and are upon your passage into eternity, and presently to appear
   before God in judgment, then you will prize the comforts of the Spirit.
   And if you ever hope to enjoy them at that disconsolate hour, beware
   how you resist his strivings now.

   The second motive why we should comply with the Spirit is, because the
   resisting of it brings a man under hardness of heart and a reprobate
   sense. Now a man is then said to be under a reprobate sense, when he
   has lost all spiritual feeling; so that when heaven and the joys
   thereof are displayed before him, he is not at all affected with
   desire; when hell and wrath and eternal misery are held forth to him,
   he is not moved with terror.

   Now resisting of the Spirit brings this hardness upon the heart two
   ways.

   1. By way of natural causation. Hardness of heart is the proper issue
   and effect of this resistance. Every act of opposition to the Spirit
   disposes the soul to resist it further; as the reception of one degree
   of heat disposes the subject to receive the second, and the second the
   third, till it arrives to the highest. And the more frequent the
   Spirit's workings have been, the heart grows more insensible and hard;
   as a path, by often being trod, is daily more and more hardened. Custom
   in sin produces boldness in sin; and we know boldness is for the most
   part grounded upon the insensibility of danger.

   2. This resistance brings hardness of heart, by way of a judicial curse
   from God. It causes God to suspend his convincing and converting grace;
   whereupon the sinner is more and more established and confirmed in his
   sin. It is not to be questioned but the hardness of Pharaoh's heart at
   the time of his destruction had in it something of punishment as well
   as sin; and was penally inflicted upon him as a judgment for his
   irrational hardness under God's former judgments. I shall allege no
   more examples; this is sufficient to demonstrate how dreadful a thing
   it is to be punished with an hard heart. It is this alone, to say no
   more of it, that renders all the means of a man's salvation utterly
   ineffectual.

   The third motive is, because resisting of the Spirit puts a man in the
   very next disposition to the great and unpardonable sin against the
   Holy Ghost. For this dreadful sin is only a greater kind of resistance
   of the Spirit. And all the foregoing acts of resistance are like so
   many degrees and steps leading to this. For since a man cannot
   presently and on the sudden arrive to the highest pitch of sin, there
   are required some previous antecedent dispositions to enlarge, and, as
   it were, make room in the heart for the admission of so great a sin as
   this. All former oppositions of the Spirit empty their malignity into
   this one, which virtually includes them all, as rivers empty themselves
   into the sea. It is confessed a man may frequently oppose the Spirit,
   and yet not commit this great sin; yet none ever committed this sin,
   but such as had before frequently resisted the Spirit. Some indeed make
   the sin against the Holy Ghost to be only a blasphemous rejection of
   the external objective testimony of the Spirit, that is, of his
   miracles, by which he attested the truth of the gospel, so as to
   ascribe them to the Devil. But as for a wilful, malicious opposing of
   the internal, efficient persuasion of the Spirit upon the heart, they
   doubt whether the nature of man is capable of such an act. Here, not to
   exclude the former from being the sin against the Holy Ghost, certain
   it is, that the general judgments of divines do agree in the latter.
   And Hebrews vi. 4, 5, 6, seems not obscurely to evince the same.

   And thus you have seen that way marked out before you that leads to the
   sin against the Holy Ghost. Therefore it nearly concerns all resisters
   of the Spirit to bethink themselves whither they are going, and to
   beware that they do not slide into that that is unpardonable. It is
   wisdom timely to depart from your sins, before the Spirit finally
   departs from you. I hope there is none here that either has or ever
   shall commit this great sin; yet consider, which certainly is terror
   enough to a considering mind, that if you go on, and still proceed to
   resist the Spirit, it is possible that you may. And in things that
   concern the everlasting ruin of an immortal soul, miserum est posse si
   veils. It is a miserable and a dangerous thing to be able eternally to
   undo yourselves if you will. Wherefore I should now entreat and advise
   all, as they desire the comforts of the Spirit, as they tender the good
   of their precious, never-dying souls, as they wish for the unspeakable
   satisfaction of a peaceable conscience, as they hope to enjoy the
   refreshing sense of God's love here, and to behold his face with joy
   hereafter, that they would forbear to resist the strivings of the
   Spirit; for if we still go on further and further, till we come to
   resist him so far, he will then seal and fit us for wrath and judgment
   in this world, and then actually deliver us up to it in the next.

SERMON LXII.

  MATTHEW v. 20.

   For I say unto you, That unless your righteousness exceed the
   righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
   into the kingdom of heaven.

   WE have here the great doctor of souls in his sermon upon the mount
   applying himself to the great business of souls, their eternal
   happiness and salvation; a thing aimed at by all, but attained by few.
   And since there can be no rational direction to the end, but what is
   laid in the prescription of the means, he shews them the most effectual
   course of arriving to this happiness that is imaginable; and that is,
   partly by discovering those ways and means by which men come to miss of
   salvation; and partly by declaring those other ways by which alone it
   is to be attained: first he shews them how it cannot be acquired; and
   secondly how it may. It cannot be attained by the righteousness of the
   scribes and pharisees; it may be attained by such an one as does exceed
   it.

   In order to the understanding of the words, I must premise some short
   explication of these three things.

   I. Who and what these scribes and pharisees were.

   II. What is here meant by righteousness.

   III. And lastly, what by the kingdom of heaven.

   I. And first for the first, who these scribes and pharisees were. It
   would be both tedious, and, as to our present business, superfluous, to
   discourse exactly of the original and ways of the several sects that
   about the time of our Saviour infested the Jewish church; such as were
   the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Herodians. Let it suffice us
   therefore to consider so much of them as may contribute to the clearing
   of the text; which is, that these pharisees were a powerful ruling sect
   amongst the Jews, professing and pretending to a greater sanctity of
   life and purity of doctrine than any others. Upon which account they
   gave denomination to their sect from pharash, a word importing
   separation; as that they were men who had sequestered and set apart
   themselves to the study and pursuit of a more sublime piety and
   strictness of life than the rest of mankind; as also such as gave the
   best interpretations of the Mosaic law, not only expounding, but also
   correcting and perfecting it where it was defective.

   In which respect they struck in with the scribes. For pharisee is the
   name of a sect, scribe of an office; and signifies as much as a doctor,
   one whose employment it was to interpret and expound the law to the
   people in their synagogues. So that in short the scribes and pharisees
   amongst the Jews were such as owned themselves for the strictest livers
   and the best teachers in the world.

   II. The second thing to be explained is, what our Saviour here means by
   righteousness. The word may have a twofold acception.

   1. It may import a righteousness of doctrine; such an one as is to be
   the rule and measure of the righteousness of our actions.

   2. It may import a righteousness in point of practice; that is, such an
   one as denominates a man just or righteous; as the former properly
   denominates a man only sound or orthodox.

   And now, according to these two senses, as righteousness is twice
   mentioned in the text; so it is first mentioned in one sense, and then
   in the other.

   The righteousness called by our Saviour the righteousness of the
   pharisees signifies the righteousness taught by the pharisees, which is
   manifest from the whole drift of the chapter. In all which throughout,
   it is evidently Christ's design to oppose the purity of his doctrine in
   the clear exposition of the law, to the corrupt and pernicious
   expositions that the pharisees gave of the same.

   But then the other righteousness, called by our Saviour your
   righteousness, imports a righteousness of practice, a pious life, or a
   course of evangelical obedience. So that the sense of our Saviour's
   words taken more at large runs thus: Unless you pursue and live up to a
   greater measure of piety than what the scribes and pharisees teach and
   prescribe you in their perverse and superficial glosses upon the law of
   Moses, you will find it infinitely short and insufficient to bring you
   to heaven. Your lives must outdo your lessons. You must step further,
   and bid higher, or you will never reach the price and purchase of a
   glorious immortality.

   III. The third and last thing to be explained is, what our Saviour here
   means by the kingdom of heaven: for there are three several
   significations of it in scripture.

   1. It is taken for the state and economy of the church under
   Christianity, opposed to the Jewish and Mosaic economy; in which sense
   that known speech both of John the Baptist and of our Saviour is to be
   understood, in which they told the world, that the kingdom of heaven
   was at hand; that is, that the Mosaic dispensation was then ready to
   expire and cease, and that of the Messiah to take place.

   2. It is sometimes taken for the kingdom of grace, by which Christ
   rules in the hearts of men. In which sense those words of his to the
   young man are to be understood in Mark xii. 34, Thou art not far from
   the kingdom of God. That is, Thou art not far from such a frame and
   disposition of spirit, as fits a man to be my disciple and subject, and
   so brings him under the spiritual rule of my sceptre.

   3. And lastly, it is taken for the kingdom of glory, which is the prime
   and most eminent acception of it; and which I conceive is intended
   here; though I deny not but some would have it expounded in the first
   of these three senses.

   But besides that the natural aspect of the phrase seems to favour this
   interpretation, the word entering into much more easily denoting a
   passage into another place, than merely into another state or
   condition; the same is yet further evident from hence, that an entrance
   into the kingdom of heaven is here exhibited as the end and reward that
   men propose to themselves as attainable by the righteousness of their
   lives, and consequently to commence upon the expiration of them; which
   therefore can be nothing else but a state of blessedness in another
   world.

   These things premised by way of explication, we may take the entire
   sense of the words in these three propositions.

   1. That a righteousness is absolutely necessary to the attainment of
   salvation. Which is an assertion of such self-evidence, and so
   universally granted by all, in appearance at least, that to cast any
   remark upon it might at most seem ridiculous, did not so many in the
   world contradict their profession by their practice; and while they own
   designs for heaven, yet indeed live and act as if they were candidates
   of hell and probationers for damnation.

   2. As a righteousness is necessary, so every degree of righteousness is
   not sufficient to entitle the soul to eternal happiness. It must be
   such an one as exceeds, such an one as stands upon higher ground than
   that which usually shews itself in the lives and conversation of the
   generality of mankind.

   3dly, and more particularly, that righteousness that saves and lets a
   man into the kingdom of heaven, must far surpass the best and the
   greatest righteousness of the most refined and glistering hypocrite in
   the world.

   Which proposition, as virtually containing in it both the former, shall
   be the subject of the following discourse. And the prosecution of it
   shall lie in these three things.

   I. To shew the defects of the hypocrite's righteousness, here expressed
   by the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, and declared for
   such an one as cannot save.

   II. To shew those perfections and conditions by which the righteousness
   that saves and brings to heaven does transcend and surpass this.

   III. And lastly. To shew the grounds and reason of the necessity of
   such a righteousness in order to a man's salvation.

   And first, for the defects of the hypocritical, pharisaical
   righteousness, we may reckon several.

   1. As first, that it consisted chiefly in the external actions of duty;
   never taking care of the inward deportment of the soul, in the
   regulation of its thoughts, wishes, and affections; in the due
   composure of which consists the very spirit and vital part of religion.
   The pharisees taught the Jews, that he who imbrued not his hand in his
   brother's blood was no murderer, and that he who defiled not his
   neighbour's bed could not be charged with a violation of that command
   that forbade adultery. So that it seems, according to them, a man might
   innocently burn with malice and revenge, lustful and impure thoughts,
   so long as he could keep the furnace stopped, and prevent them from
   breaking forth and raging in gross outward commissions.

   Thus (as our Saviour told them) making clean the outside of the
   platter, and smoothing the surface of their behaviour, while their
   inward parts were full of all noisomeness, filth, and abomination. The
   hypocrite and the pharisee, like some beasts, are only valuable for
   their skin and their fine colours; so that after all their flourishes
   of an outward, dissembled piety, all those shows of abstinence and
   severity, by which they amuse the eyes of the easy, credulous world, we
   cannot say properly of any one of them, that he is a good man, but only
   a good sight; and that too, because we cannot see all of him.

   Such persons are not the temples or habitations, but the sepulchres of
   piety; and we know that when we have seen a sepulchre, we have had the
   best of it: for there is none so ill a friend to his other senses, as
   to search or look into it any further. The pharisees were thought and
   accounted by the deluded vulgar the greatest heroes in piety, the
   highest and most advanced proficients in the school of religion, of all
   others whatsoever; so that at the same time they were both the glory
   and the reproach of the rest of their brethren the Jews, whom they
   seemed to obscure, and even to upbraid, by their vast transcendency in
   the ways of sanctity and devotion: and yet our Saviour gives you the
   very original and spring-head of all those shining performances, in
   Matt. xxiii. 5, where he tells you, that all their works they did to be
   seen of men. It was the eye of the world that they courted, and not the
   eye of heaven that they feared. Otherwise, surely they would have
   thought themselves responsible for all the villainy and hypocrisy of
   their hearts; for all their bosom-cabinet-concealed impurities; since
   all these were as open to the eye of God's searching omniscience, and
   as odious to the pure eye of his holiness, as murders or robberies
   committed in the face of the sun, and revenged upon the actors of them
   by the hand of public justice.

   And where these were cherished by the inward affections and
   approbations of the heart, demure looks, long prayers, and enlarging of
   phylacteries, were but pitiful, thin arts to recommend them to the
   acceptance of that God, who looks through appearances, and pierces into
   the heart, and ransacks the very bowels and entrails of the soul,
   rating all our services according to the frame and temper of that. For
   being a spirit, he judges like a spirit, and cannot be put off with
   dress and dissimulation, paint and varnish; and the fairest outward
   actions of duty, not springing from an inward principle of piety, are
   no better in the sight of him, who abominates nothing more than a foul
   heart couched under a fair behaviour.

   2. A second fault and flaw in this righteousness was, that it was
   partial and imperfect, not extending itself equally to all God's
   commands: some of which the pharisees accounted great ones, and
   accordingly laid some stress upon the observation of them; but some
   again they accounted but little ones, and so styled them in their
   common phrase, and shew as little regard to them in their practice.

   Which defect, as it was eminent in them, so it is also common to every
   hypocrite in the world, who never comes up roundly to the whole compass
   of his duty, even then when he makes the most pompous show; but singles
   out some certain parts, which perhaps suit best with his occasions, and
   least thwart his corruptions, leaving the rest to those who may like
   them better. As the proud or unclean person may be liberal and
   charitable to the poor, frequent in the service of God, abhor a lie, or
   a treacherous action, with many other the like duties, that do not
   directly grate upon the darling sin that he is tender of: but what says
   he all this time to those precepts that charge his pride and his
   uncleanness? God calls upon him to be humble as well as charitable, to
   be pure and chaste, as well as devout; nor will it suffice him to chop
   and change one duty for another: he cannot clear his debts, by paying
   part of the great sum he owes. The obligation of the law is universal
   and uniform, and carries an equal aspect to every instance of religion
   lying within the compass of its command. Upon which account it is said,
   James ii. 10, that he that offends in one is guilty of all. For by so
   doing he breaks the whole chain of duty, which is as really broke and
   divided by the breach of one link, as if every one of them was took
   asunder. Nor is it otherwise in the laws of men. For surely he that is
   convict of murder has no cause to excuse that violation of the law upon
   this account, that he is no thief or traitor: the law is as really,
   though not as broadly violated by one transgression as by a thousand:
   and whosoever lives, and allows himself in the constant neglect of any
   one of Christ's commands, and expects to be saved upon the stock of his
   obedience to the rest of them, (though even the supposition of such an
   obedience is absolutely impossible,) that man has a hope altogether as
   absurd, sottish, and ridiculous, in reference to his future salvation,
   as if in the forementioned case a convict murderer should think to
   escape the sentence and execution of death, by pleading that he never
   broke open an house, nor conspired the death of his prince, or bore his
   share in a public rebellion: how would every one hiss and explode such
   a defence!

   David knew that there was no building any solid confidence upon a
   parcelled, curtailed obedience; and therefore he states his hope upon
   such an one as was entire and universal; Psalm cxix. 6, Then shall I
   not be ashamed, when I have respect to all thy commandments. Every
   disappointment certainly draws after it a shame: and whosoever hopes to
   stand before God's tribunal in the strength of a righteousness maimed
   in any one integral part of it, will have a defeat and a disappointment
   cast upon his greatest expectation and his highest concernment; he will
   be lurched in that that admits of no after-game or reparation.

   God exacts of every soul that looks to enter into the kingdom of heaven
   a perfect righteousness; perfect, I say, with a perfection of
   sincerity, which is a perfection of parts, though not of degrees: that
   is, there is no one grace or virtue but a Christian must have it before
   he can be saved: though such is the present state of human infirmity,
   that he cannot in this life attain to the highest degree of that
   virtue. But as an infant is a man, because he has all the parts of a
   man, though he has them not in that bulk and strength that those have
   who are grown up; so he is righteous and sincere who performs every
   divine precept, omitting no one of them, though his performances have
   not that perfection and exactness that is to be found in the obedience
   of a person glorified and made perfect. However, still we see that
   universality is required, and an equal compliance with all the divine
   precepts. For as it is not an handsome eye, an handsome hand, or an
   handsome leg, but an universal symmetry and just proportion of all the
   members and features of the body, that makes an handsome man; so
   neither is it the practice of this or that virtue, but an entire
   complexion of all, that must render and denominate a man righteous in
   the sight of God. And therefore it was infinite folly in the pharisees
   to be exact in other things, even to the tithing of rue and cummin, and
   in the mean time to lop off the force and design of a grand precept of
   the law, by allowing men in some cases not to pay honour to their
   parents; as we read in Mark vii. 10, 11, 12, 13, making it a damnable
   sin forsooth to deprive the priest of a salad, but a very allowable
   thing to suffer a parent to starve with hunger. But when such a deluded
   wretch shall brave up his accounts to God, that he prayed of ten,
   fasted twice a week, paid tithe of all that he had; what will he
   answer, when God shall reply upon him; Ay, but, friend, what have you
   done for your distressed father and mother? Your bowels have been shut
   up to your nearest kindred, and you have not relieved the poor, though
   recommended with the dearest relation. Then he will find, that the
   performance of one duty can be no recompence for the omission of
   another.

   Men should measure their righteousness by the extent of Christ's
   satisfaction for sin, which was far from being partial or imperfect; it
   grasped and comprehended all the sins that either were or could be
   committed. And if, in the application of this satisfaction to any soul,
   Christ should take all the sins of it upon his own score, one only
   excepted, that one sin would inevitably expose it to the full stroke of
   God's vengeance, and sink it for ever into endless perdition.

   Let a man therefore shew me any one part of the law, for the
   transgression of which Christ did not shed his blood; and for the
   pardon of which the merits of that blood must not be imputed to him, if
   ever it is pardoned; and I will grant, that in the general rules and
   obligations of obedience, that part of the law admits of an exception,
   and consequently obliges not his practice: but Christ knew full well
   how imperfect a Saviour and Redeemer the world would have found him,
   had he not paid a price to divine justice for every even the least and
   most despised deviation from the law. One peccadillo, as some phrase
   it, if not satisfied for, had been enough to crack and confound the
   whole system of the creation, and to have lodged the whole mass of
   mankind eternally in the bottomless pit.

   From all which it appears, that the partial, mangled obedience that the
   hypocrite or the pharisee pays to the divine precepts, can entitle him
   to no right of entrance into the kingdom of heaven: there is no coming
   thither with a piece of a wedding garment, with the ragged robe of an
   half and a curtailed righteousness: and the righteousness of the most
   eminent unregenerate professor amounts to no more, who is never so
   clear and entire in duty, but that he has his reserves, his allowances,
   and exemptions from some severe, troublesome precept or other, that he
   is resolved to dispense with himself in the observance of; as never
   worshipping God but with a proviso, that he may still bow in the house
   of his beloved Rimmon.

   3. The third defect of this pharisaical, unsound righteousness is, that
   it is legal; that is, such an one as expects to win heaven upon the
   strength of itself and its own worth. Which opinion alone were enough
   to embase the very righteousness of angels in the sight of God so far,
   as to render it not only vain, but odious; and to turn the best of
   sacrifices into the worst of sins. It is an affront to mercy for any
   one to pretend merit. It is to pull Christ down from the cross, to
   degrade him from his mediatorship; and, in a word, to nullify and
   evacuate the whole work of man's redemption.

   For, as St. Paul argues most irrefragably, if righteousness is by the
   law, then is Christ dead in vain: since upon this supposition there can
   be no necessity of Christ or Christianity; and the gospel itself were
   but a needless and a superfluous thing: for it is but for a man to set
   up and traffic for heaven upon his own stock; and to say to himself, I
   will do this, and live: my own arm shall bring salvation to me, and my
   righteousness shall uphold me.

   But who art thou, O vain man! that durst reason thus about thy eternal
   state? when, if God should enter into judgment with the best of his
   servants, no flesh living could be justified in his sight: a sight that
   endures not the least unpardoned, unremitted transgression; that
   charges the very angels with folly. So infinitely exact, searching, and
   spiritual, is the eye of divine justice, and so vastly great is the
   prize of glory that we run for, so much higher and more valuable than
   our choicest and most elaborate performances!

   And can we think then, that a few broken prayers, a few deeds of
   charity, a few fastings and abstinences, and restraints of our
   appetites, will carry in them such a commanding, controlling value, as
   to bear us through God's tribunal, and to make the doors of heaven fly
   open before us, that we may even with the confidence of purchasers
   enter and take possession of the mansions of glory? Some perhaps may
   think so, who suppose they can never think too well of themselves.

   But as arrogant as such a thought is, its arrogance is not greater than
   its absurdity. For as Job says, Who can bring a clean thing out of an
   unclean? And as our Saviour, Who can gather figs from thistles? or the
   grapes of a perfect righteousness from the briers and thorns of a
   corrupt and degenerate nature? Since the ruins of our faculties by
   original sin, let the devoutest and the sincerest Christian in the
   world bring me the best and the exactest duty that ever he performed,
   and let him sift, examine, and compare it to the rigid measures of the
   law, and the holiness of the divine nature, and then let him venture
   the whole issue of his eternal happiness upon it if he dares. Did men
   consider how many things go to the making of an action perfectly good,
   and how many such good actions are required to integrate and perfect a
   legal righteousness; it were impossible for them to reflect with any
   fondness upon the very best of their services, which are always allayed
   with such mixtures of weakness and imperfection.

   And therefore let not any pharisee be too confident; for be his
   righteousness what it will, yet if he hopes to justify himself by it,
   he will find that persons justified in this manner are never glorified.
   Men may saint themselves as they please; but if they have nothing to
   read their saintship in but their own rubric, they may chance to find
   themselves condemned in heaven, after they have been canonized on
   earth.

   And thus I have shewn the three great defects cleaving to the
   righteousness of the pharisee, who is here represented as the grand
   exemplar and standard of hypocrisy; all hypocrites more or less
   partaking of both the nature and defects of the pharisaical
   righteousness. And if we now grant, as with great truth and readiness
   we may, that the pharisee or hypocrite may live up to such glorious
   externals and visible shows of religion, as to astonish the world with
   an admiration of his sanctity; so that in the judgment and vogue of
   all, he shall stand heir apparent to a crown of glory and immortality;
   which yet in reality and truth he has no more title to, than he who
   acts the part of a king upon the stage has a claim to a sceptre or a
   kingdom: then what judgment can we pass upon the generality of men that
   wear the name of Christians, and upon that account seem big with
   expectations of a glorious eternity, yet are as much short of a
   pharisaical righteousness, as that is short of sincerity? Alas! they
   are not arrived so far as to approve themselves to the eye of the
   world, so far as to appear godly, or so much as to be mistaken for
   religious. But by an open sensuality and profaneness, their behaviour
   seems a constant defiance of heaven, and a confutation of their
   religion. It were worth the knowing by what reasonings and discourses
   such men support their minds and reconcile their future hopes to their
   present practices: for if he, whom the world judges a saint, may yet be
   in the gall of bitterness and a son of perdition, is it possible that
   such an one, whose actions proclaim him even to the world for a
   reprobate and a castaway, should yet indeed be a pious and a sincere
   person? No, assuredly; for though the piety of a man's outward actions
   may very well consist with the villainy of his heart, yet it is
   impossible, on the other hand, for a life outwardly bad, to be
   consistent with an heart inwardly good; and those that set forth for
   heaven in the contrary persuasion and principle, when they meet with
   hell in their journey's end, will find that they missed of their way.

   And thus much for the first thing, which was, to shew the defects of
   the hypocritical, pharisaical righteousness. I proceed now to the

   Second, which is, to shew those perfections and qualities by which the
   righteousness that saves and brings to heaven does transcend and
   surpass that. Many might be recounted, but I shall insist upon four
   especially.

   1. As first, that it is entirely the same, whether the eye of man see
   it or see it not. It can do its alms where there is no trumpet to sound
   before it, and pray fervently where there is no spectator to applaud
   it. It finds the same enlargements and flowings of affection when it
   pours forth itself before God in private, as when it bends the knee in
   the solemn resorts of the multitude, and the face of the synagogue. It
   is contented, that the eye of Omniscience is upon it, and that it is
   observed by him who sees in secret, as scorning to move upon the
   inferior motives of popular notice and observation.

   For it acts by a principle that holds no intercourse with the world,
   even the pure abstracted love of God, which would be as active and
   operative, if there were no other person in the world but him alone in
   whose breast it is. And therefore there is no external interest that
   can bear any share in the heat and activity of such an one's devotion.
   It needs no company to keep it warm. For he transacts with God, and
   with God alone: so that if he can be heard above, he cares not whether
   or no he is seen here below.

   But it is much otherwise with the hypocrite; his devotion grows cold,
   if not warmed with the crowd and the throng. He designs not to be, but
   to appear religious. He can willingly want the inward part of a
   Christian, so he may be esteemed and commended for the outward. For as
   it is said of some vainglorious pretenders to science, that they desire
   knowledge, not that they may know, but that they may be known; so some
   affect the garb of the pious and the austere, who abhor the rigours of
   a real and a practical piety. They can be infinitely pleased with the
   dress and fashionable part of religion, while they hate and loathe the
   grim duties of self-denial and mortification. In short, they are like
   fire painted upon an altar; they desire not to be hot, but only to
   shine and glister.

   And it is this worthy principle that brings so many to the worship of
   God, only to court the eye of some potent, earthly great one, who
   perhaps commands and lords it over their hopes and their fears; so that
   when he is present, they will be sure to be so too; and when he is
   absent, they can be as ready to turn their back upon heaven, and to
   think it below their occasions, if not also their prudence, to
   sacrifice business to prayer, which is a thing that they never make
   their business.

   But what would or could such a person plead, should God arrest him in
   the church, and summon him to his tribunal in the midst of those his
   solemn mockeries of heaven, and ask him who and what it was that
   brought him thither to that place? Surely he could not answer that it
   was God; for then why should not he be there as well in the absence of
   the grandee his patron, unless he thought that God also was one of his
   retinue, and so was no where to be found out of his company?

   But this very thing makes it but too, too evident, that it is a mortal
   eye that every such hypocrite adores; so that in all his most solemn
   addresses he cannot so properly be said to act the Christian, as to act
   a part. Such pharisees come to church, and frame themselves into
   postures of zeal and devotion, as women dress themselves, only to be
   stared upon and admired. If they were sure of no beholders, they would
   not be fine; for it is the spectator that makes the sight.

   I wish all those would lay this consideration to heart who are
   concerned to do so, and measure the sincerity of that holiness they so
   much value themselves upon, by this one mark and criterion; for can
   they answer from their hearts, that it is purely the love of duty that
   engages them in duty? Is there nothing of pageantry and appearance that
   models and directs and gives laws to all the little designs they bring
   along with them to church? Does not the consideration of what such or
   such an one will say or think of them bring many to sermons, and, which
   I tremble to think of, even to the sacrament, who neither by the
   necessity or excellency of the duty itself would ever be induced to
   vouchsafe their attendance upon it; but could be contented to live
   without sacraments for ever, and to end their days like heathens and
   outlaws from all the graces of the second covenant and the mysteries of
   Christianity?

   If there be any such that hear me, let them lay their hands upon their
   hearts, and assure themselves, that God loathes all their services, and
   detests their righteousnesses the highest affront that can be passed
   upon all his attributes, and consequently has assigned it its reward in
   the lot and portion of hypocrisy.

   But now the sincere and the really holy person apprehends a beauty and
   a worth in the very exercise of duty, and upon that account still
   carries the reason of his devotion about him and within him; so that
   when he has shut to his door, and sequestered himself from the popular
   gaze, then chiefly he sets himself to the work of prayer and piety, and
   accounts his closet a temple, and his conscience an amphitheatre.

   2. A second property of such a righteousness as is saving and sincere,
   is an active watching against and opposing every even the least sin.
   How small and almost indiscernible is a dust falling into the eye, and
   yet how troublesome, how uneasy, and afflicting is it! Why just so is
   the least sin in the eye of a sanctified person; the sense of it is
   quick and tender, and so finds the smallest invasion upon it grating
   and offensive. We know when David cut off the skirt of Saul's garment,
   at which time he was far from any hurtful designs upon his person, yet
   it is said of him, that immediately upon the doing of it his heart
   smote him; so fearful was he, lest he might have transgressed the lines
   of duty, though his conscience did not directly accuse him of any such
   transgression. Now as solicitous as David was after this action, so
   cautious and timorous is every sincere person before he attempts a
   thing. That plea for sin, Is it not a little one? which is the language
   of every rotten heart, is no argument at all with him for its
   commission.

   For he knows that there is no sin so little, but is great enough to
   dishonour an infinite God, and to ruin an immortal soul; none so
   little, but designs and intends to be great, nay the greatest, and
   would certainly so prove, if not cut off and suppressed by a mature
   prevention. Every lustful thought left to its own natural course and
   tendency would be incest, every angry thought murder, and every little
   grudging of discontent and murmuring would at length ripen into
   blasphemy and cursing; did not the sanctifying or restraining grace of
   God interpose between the conception and the birth of most sins, and
   stifle them in the womb of that concupiscence that would otherwise
   assuredly bring them forth, and breed them up to their full growth.

   And this the new creature in every truly righteous person is
   sufficiently aware of, which makes him dread the very beginnings of
   sin, and fly even the occasions of it with horror. For he knows how
   easily it enters, and how hardly it is got out; how potent and
   artificial it is to tempt and insinuate, and how weak his heart is to
   withstand a suitable temptation.

   He considers also how just it is with God to give those over to the
   highest pitch and degree of sin, who make no conscience of resisting
   its beginnings; and withal how frequently he does so, withdrawing the
   supports and influences of his grace, and leaving the soul, after every
   yielding to sin, more and more defenceless against the next encounter
   and assault it shall make upon him. All which considerations of a
   danger so vastly and incredibly great, are certainly very sufficient to
   warrant the nicest caution and fearfulness in this case, upon all
   accounts of prudence whatsoever.

   But now if we examine the righteousness of an unsound, pharisaical
   professor by this property, we shall find it far from being thus
   affected toward sin; it easily connives at and allows the soul in all
   lesser excursions and declinations from the rule, readily complies with
   the more moderate and less impudent proposals of the tempter: so that
   such an one never comes so much as to startle, or think himself at all
   concerned about the security of his eternal estate, till some great and
   clamorous sin begins to cry aloud and ring peals of imminent
   approaching vengeance in his conscience; and then perhaps he looks
   about him a little, prays twice or thrice, dejects his countenance, and
   utters a few melancholy words, and so concludes the danger over, his
   sin atoned, his person safe, and all perfectly well again. But this is
   a righteousness took up upon false measures, a righteousness of a man's
   own inventing, and consequently such an one as can never determine in
   the peace of him that has it.

   But the truly pious is never at rest in his mind, but when he stands
   upon his guard against the most minute and inobservable encroaches of
   sin, as knowing them upon this account perhaps more dangerous than
   greater; that the enemy that is least feared, is usually the soonest
   felt. For as in the robbing of an house, it is the custom for the
   sturdiest thieves to put in some little boy at the window, who being
   once within the house may easily open the doors, and let them in too:
   so the tempter, in rifling of the soul, despairs for the most part to
   attempt his entrance by some gross sin of a dismal, frightful hue and
   appearance, and therefore he employs a lesser, that may creep and slide
   into it insensibly; which yet, as little as it is, will so open and
   unlock the bars of conscience, that the biggest and the most enormous
   abominations shall at length make their entrance, and seize and take
   possession of it.

   Let no man therefore measure the smallness of his danger by the
   smallness of any sin; for the smaller the sin, the greater may be the
   stratagem. We may have heard of those who have been choked with a fly,
   a crum, or a grapestone. Such contemptible things carry in them the
   causes of death; and it is not impossible, though some have had
   swallows large enough for perjuries, blasphemies, and murders, yet that
   others may chance to be choked and destroyed with sinful desires, idle
   words, and officious lies. How many ways a soul may be ruined, few
   consider; those that do, will not count it scrupulosity to beware of
   the least and slenderest instruments of damnation. But if to be so very
   nice and suspicious be called by any scrupulosity, such must know, that
   no scrupulosity about the matters of eternity can be either absurd or
   superfluous, but in these affairs is only another name for care and
   discretion.

   3. The third discriminating property of a sincere, genuine, and saving
   righteousness is, that it is such an one as never stops, or contents
   itself in any certain pitch or degree, but aspires and presses forward
   to still an higher and an higher perfection. As the men of the world,
   when they are once in a thriving way, never think themselves rich
   enough, but are still improving and adding to their stock; just so it
   is with every sanctified person in his Christian course: he will never
   think himself holy and humble and mortified enough, but will still be
   making one degree of holiness a step only to another; when he has
   kindled the fire in his breast, his next business is to make it flame
   and blaze out. If it were possible for him to assign such a precise
   measure of righteousness as would save him, yet he would not acquiesce
   in it; since it is not the mere interest of his own salvation, but of
   God's honour, that principles and moves him in the whole course of his
   actions. And then he knows, that if God cannot be too much honoured, he
   cannot be too righteous; and that if he cannot too intently design the
   end, he can never too solicitously prosecute the means. It was an
   expression of a father, concerning the apostle Paul, that he was
   insatiabilis Dei cultor, an insatiable worshipper of God: so that
   having pitched his mind upon this object, his spiritual appetites were
   boundless and unlimited.

   It is observed of the two nobler senses, the seeing and the hearing,
   that they are never tired with exerting themselves upon such things as
   properly affect them; for surely none ever surfeited upon music, or
   found himself cloyed with the sight of rare pictures. In like manner
   the desires of the righteous are so suited and framed to an
   agreeableness with the ways of God, that they find a continual
   freshness growing upon them in the performance of duty; the more they
   have prayed, the more fit and vigorous they find themselves for prayer:
   like a stream, which the further it has run, the more strength and
   force it has to run further.

   Such persons are earned forth to duty, not upon designs of acquisition,
   but gratitude; not so much to gain something from God, as (if it were
   possible) to do something for him. And we all know, that the nature and
   genius of gratitude is to be infinite and unmeasurable in the
   expressions of itself. It makes a David cry out as if he even laboured
   and travailed to be delivered of some of those thankful apprehensions
   of the divine goodness that his heart was big with; Psalm cxvi. 12,
   What, says he, shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits? All
   that he could do or say for God seemed to him but a short and slender
   declaration of those aboundings of affection, that within he found and
   felt inexpressible.

   But now if we come to try the spurious, unsound righteousness of the
   hypocrite by this test, how pitiful, how false, and how contemptible a
   thing will it appear! For he designs not to excel or to transcend in
   the ways of sanctity. If he can but patch up such a righteousness as
   shall satisfy and still his conscience, and keep it from grumbling and
   being troublesome, down he sits, and there takes up, as being far from
   the ambition of making a proficiency, or commencing any degree in the
   school of Christ. But, believe it, a man may be righteous in this
   manner long enough before he is like to be saved for being so. For the
   truth is, such an one does not really design to be righteous, but only
   to be quiet. And in this one thing you will find a never-failing mark
   of difference between a pharisaical hypocrite and a truly sanctified
   person, that the former measures his righteousness by the peace of his
   conscience, and the latter judges of the peace of his conscience by his
   righteousness.

   4thly, The fourth and last property of a sincere and saving
   righteousness, which most certainly distinguishes it from the
   hypocritical and pharisaical, is humility. For I dare venture the whole
   truth of the gospel itself upon this challenge. Shew me any hypocrite
   in the world that ever was humble. For the very nature and design of
   hypocrisy is, to make a man a proud beggar; that is, by the most
   uncomely mixture of qualities, at the same time poor and vainglorious.
   We have the exact character of him in Rev. iii. 17; Thou sayest, I am
   rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; but knowest
   not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
   naked. It is the business of every hypocrite to make a show, to
   disguise his penury with appearances of plenty and magnificence: and
   upon that account it concerns him to make the utmost improvement of the
   little stock he has; to look upon every duty as meritorious, every
   prayer as not so much asking a mercy as claiming a debt from heaven,
   till at length, as it were, even dazzled with the false lustre of his
   own performances, he breaks forth into the pharisaical doxology, God, I
   thank thee, that I am not as other men. Thus pluming and priding
   himself in all his services, as if in every action of piety he did God
   a courtesy, and passed an obligation upon his Maker.

   But how does the sincere person behave himself both in and after every
   duty performed by him! Surely with a very different spirit.
   Self-abhorrence and confusion of face, like the poor publican, makes
   him cast down his eyes while he is lifting up his heart in prayer: and
   when he has exerted his very utmost zeal in the divine worship, he lays
   his person and his services in the dust before God, and is so far from
   expecting a reward for their value, that he counts it a mercy not to be
   condemned for their imperfection; and though God condemns him not, yet
   he is ready to condemn himself.

   God be merciful to me a sinner, is the constant language of his heart
   in the conclusion of his choicest performances: for when he has done
   his best, he knows that it will scarce amount to so much as well: so
   that if there was not a gospel to qualify and mitigate the rigours of
   the law, he knows the demands of it were too high and exact to be
   answered upon the stock of nature, attainted with guilt, and disabled
   with infirmity. And knowing so much, he never expostulates the
   injustice or unkindness of God's judgments, be his afflicting hand
   never so pressing and severe upon him. He acknowledges that severity
   itself cannot outdo the provocation of his sins; which, though it were
   possible for God to be cruel, yet had rendered it impossible for him to
   be unjust. And therefore he kisses the rod and embraces the scourge,
   and confesses the righteousness, even where he faints under the burden
   of an affliction. In a word, after he has done all to purge, purify,
   and reform himself, he is not yet pleased with himself; but in the very
   exercise of his graces finds those flaws, those failures and blemishes,
   that makes him wonder at the methods and contrivances of divine mercy;
   that God can be infinitely just, and yet he not infinitely miserable.

   Having thus finished the second thing, and shewn those perfections and
   qualities by which the righteousness that saves and brings to heaven
   does transcend and surpass that of the hypocrite and pharisee; I
   descend now to the

   Third and last, which is, to shew the grounds, the reasons, and causes
   of the necessity of such a righteousness, in order to a man's
   salvation, and entrance into the kingdom of heaven.

   1. The first shall be taken from the holiness of God; whose nature will
   never suffer him to hold so strict and intimate a communion with his
   creature, as he does with those whom he admits into heaven, unless the
   divine image and similitude, defaced by sin, be in some degree repaired
   and renewed upon him. For surely there is none who admits his swine
   into his parlour or his bedchamber; and the corruption of man's nature,
   unmortified, and unremoved by the contrary habits of holiness, degrades
   a man to the same vileness, the same distance from, and unfitness for,
   all society with his Maker. It cannot but be the most offensive and
   intolerable thing to nature, for the healthful and the sound, the
   curious and the cleanly, to converse with sores and ulcers, rottenness
   and putrefaction; and yet a soul covered with the leprosy of sin is
   infinitely more loathsome and abominable in the most pure eyes of God.
   For how is it possible for truth to cohabit with hypocrisy, purity with
   filth, and the transcendently holy and spiritual nature of God to
   associate with lust and sensuality? And these are the endowments, and
   ornaments, and commending qualifications of every unsanctified person,
   every hypocrite and pharisee, let him shine with never so fair and
   bright a reputation in the eye of the credulous and deluded world.

   But the matter stops not here. Such an one is unfit for the presence of
   God, not only upon the account of his impurity, but also of his enmity.
   For what should a sinner do in heaven, any more than a traitor or a
   rebel do in court? The exasperated justice of God will prey upon the
   unpardoned sinner wheresoever it meets him, even in the highest heaven,
   if it were possible for him to come thither; and whensoever it does so,
   it is that that makes hell; which is not so properly the name of a
   place as of a condition; a condition consigning the soul over to
   endless misery and desperation. And could we imagine a person locally
   in Abraham's bosom, yet if he brought with him the worm of conscience,
   and the secret lashes of an infinite wrath, that man were properly in
   hell, or hell at least in him, wheresoever the place of his abode or
   residence might fall.

   2dly, The other reason for the necessity of such a transcending
   righteousness, in order to a man's entrance into heaven, shall be taken
   from the work and employment of a glorified person in heaven; which is
   the continual exercise of those graces which here on earth were begun,
   and there at length shall be advanced to their full perfection: as also
   the contemplation of God in all his attributes, together with the whole
   series of his astonishing actions, by which he was pleased to manifest
   and display forth those great attributes to the world: whether in
   creation, by which he exerted his omnipotence in calling forth so
   beautiful a fabric out of the barren womb of nothing and confusion; or
   in the several traces and strange meanders of his providence, in
   governing all those many casualties and contingencies in the world, and
   so steadily directing them to a certain end, by which he shews forth
   the stupendous heights of his wisdom and omniscience; and lastly, in
   the unparalleled work of man's redemption, by which at once he
   glorified and unfolded all his attributes, so far as they could be
   drawn forth into the view of created understandings. Now a perpetual
   meditation and reflection upon these great subjects is the noble
   employment of the blessed souls in heaven.

   But can any, whom the grace of God has not throughly renewed and
   sanctified, be prepared and fitted for such a task? No, assuredly: and
   therefore it is worth our observing, that those who, living dissolutely
   in this world, do yet wish for the rewards of the righteous in the
   other, commence all such wishes upon a vast ignorance and mistake of
   their own minds; not knowing how unsuitable, and consequently how
   irksome, the whole business of heaven would be to their unsanctified
   appetites and desires. For what felicity could it be to a man always
   accustomed to the revels and songs of the drunkards, to bear a part in
   the choir of saints and angels, singing forth hallelujahs to him that
   sits upon the throne? What pleasure could it be to the lustful, the
   sensual, and unclean person, to follow the Lamb, with his virgin
   retinue, wheresoever he goes?

   Such persons deceive themselves when they wish themselves in heaven;
   and, in truth, know not what they desire: for however they may dread
   and abhor hell, yet it is impossible for them to desire heaven, did
   they know what they were to do there: and therefore, instead of making
   Balaam's wish, that they may die the death of the righteous, they
   should do well to live the life of such; and to hearken to Christ
   commanding them to seek the kingdom of heaven, by first seeking the
   righteousness thereof. For it is righteousness alone that must both
   bring men to heaven, and make heaven itself a place of happiness to
   those that are brought thither.

   To which, the God of heaven, and Fountain of all happiness, vouchsafe
   to bring us all: to whom be rendered and ascribed, as is most due, all
   praise, might, majesty, and dominion, both now and for evermore. Amen.

   THE three following discourses were first published in a volume with
   the following title:

   "Posthumous works of the late reverend Robert South, D.D. containing,
   Sermons on several subjects; viz. I. On the Martyrdom of King Charles
   I. II. Ecclesiastical Constitutions to be strictly maintained. III. The
   Certainty of a Judgment after this Life. IV. An Account of his Travels
   into Poland, with the Earl of Rochester, in the year 1674. V. Memoirs
   of his Life and Writings. VI. A true Copy of his last Will and
   Testament. London: printed for E. Curll, at the Dial and Bible against
   St. Dunstan's church in Fleet-street, M.DCC.XVII. Price 5s."

   The preface to this volume, as far as it relates to the contents of the
   present edition, is as follows:

   "It is generally expected that upon publishing the posthumous works of
   any author, some account should be given of them; therefore the editor
   of these remains of the learned Dr. South thinks himself obliged to
   offer the following particulars, both for the reader's information and
   satisfaction.

   "The letter to Dr. Pococke, from Dr. South, when in Poland, was
   communicated to the gentleman who wrote his life, which is all that I
   can say as to that piece.

   "The three sermons were given by Dr. South himself to Dr. Aldrich, late
   dean of Christ Church in Oxford.

   "As to the first of them, that upon the 30th of January, it was
   preached at court, and from some passages in it, I think it is pretty
   plain that it must have been soon after the restoration of his most
   sacred majesty king Charles the Second. This discourse was printed some
   years ago; but besides a large paragraph which is enclosed between
   crotchets in the 8th page, [1] there are many considerable amendments
   and corrections throughout.

   "The second, entitled, Ecclesiastical constitutions to be strictly
   maintained, has been lately published, but from so imperfect a copy,
   that there is not one single paragraph in it truly printed.

   "The third, Upon a future judgment, was preached at St. Mary's church
   in Oxford; and from a passage in it, and by the conclusion, it is
   apparent that it must have been composed for the anniversary of the
   royal martyr."

   The author's life, including the letter to Dr. Pocock, is prefixed to
   the first volume of the present edition.

   The first sermon is in substance the same with that printed in the
   third volume of the present edition, p. 415-449.

   The second sermon may also be compared with p. 162-200 of the fourth
   volume. But the imperfect edition said in the preface to have been
   lately published, seems to be that, a copy of which exists in the
   Bodleian library, (8v^o S. 239. Th.) and bears the following title:

   "Comprehension and Toleration considered; in a sermon preached at the
   close of the last century. London: printed for A. Moore, near St.
   Paul's Church-yard, MDCCXVI. Price four-pence."

On the Martyrdom of King Charles I.

    A

SERMON

  PREACHED AT COURT ON THE 30th OF JANUARY.
     __________________________________________________________________

  JUDGES xix. 30.

   And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such thing done
   or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land
   of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your
   minds.

   THERE is a certain fatal pertinency in the very phrase of the text; for
   when there were judges, there was no king in Israel, though, as to the
   present purpose, they were judges of another nature that removed ours.
   We have an account of this prodigious and horrid action, clothed with
   all the circumstances of wonder and detestation, but yet well timed for
   its commission, it being done when, upon the want of the regal power,
   Judges xxi. 25, every man did what was right in his own eyes; or, in
   another dialect, as the Spirit moved him. And as for the authors of
   this execrable fact, we have them defending themselves with their
   swords, and for some time asserting their villainy, with their success
   and victory against their brethren, twice beaten and massacred before
   them in a righteous cause, as you may see in the next chapter.

   I do not profess myself either delighted or skilled in mystical
   interpretations, and to wiredraw the sense of the place, so as to make
   it speak the death of the king; as some who can interpret scripture, as
   if the whole book of God was only to tell things transacted in England
   and Scotland; so that there cannot be so much as an house fired, or a
   leg broken, but they can find it in Daniel or the Revelations. No, I
   pretend to no such skill; it is enough for me if I bring the present
   business and the text together, not by design, but accommodation: and
   as the phrase runs full and high, so I doubt not but to find such a
   parallel in the things themselves, that it may be a question whether of
   the two may have a better claim to the expression. The cause here,
   which was worded with so high aggravations, was an injury done to one
   single Levite, in the villainous rape of his concubine; the resentment
   of which was so great, that it engaged the rest of the tribes to
   revenge his quarrel with a civil war, in which the preeminence and
   conduct was given by God's appointment to the royal tribe of Judah: the
   sceptre being most concerned to assert the privileges and revenge the
   injuries of the crosier. We have the Benjamites sturdily abetting what
   they had impiously done, and for a while victorious in villainy, by the
   help of God's providence, trampling on those that fought by the warrant
   of his precept.

   Let us now see the counterpart: he that dates the king's murder from
   the fatal blow given on the scaffold, judges like him that thinks it is
   the last stroke that fells the tree; the killing of his person was only
   the consummation of his murder, first begun in his prerogative. We have
   heard the knack of a double capacity, personal and politic, and I
   suppose they distinguish the king into two, that each party might
   murder him under one. And for those whose loyalty does only consist in
   designing that action which was taken out of their hands, and having
   laid the premises, they protest against the conclusion; they cover
   their prevarication with a fig-leaf, and only differ from the other
   party in this, that these endeavour to disguise the author of the fact,
   those only the executioner. Well then; when a long sunshine of mercy
   had ripened the sins of the nation, so that it was now ready for the
   shatterings of divine vengeance: the seed of faction and rebellion
   having been for a long time studiously sown by schismatical doctrines,
   and well watered by seditious lectures, the first assault was made
   against the tribe of Levi, by some implacable enemies of the church,
   the fury of whose lust and ambition nothing could allay, till they had
   full scope to prostitute her honour, and ravish her revenues; till at
   length, cut, divided, torn in pieces, as she was, she lay a ghastly
   spectacle to all beholders, to all the Israel of God.

   And as this was done to our English Levites, so it was acted by
   Benjamites; by so many Benjamites as raven like wolves, till by their
   rapine and sacrilege they had their mess five times bigger than their
   brethren's. The prosecution of which quarrel was armed by the royal
   standard, and the defence of the church managed by the defender of the
   faith; in which it pleased the all-wise God to cause Judah to fall
   before Benjamin, the lion to be a prey to the wolf; by which fatal
   trace of Providence the king being killed long before forty-five, by
   natural and immediate sequel to complete the action, Charles was
   murdered in forty-eight. And this is the black subject of this day's
   solemnity. In my reflections upon which, if detestation, (that is, a
   due apprehension of the blackest fact that ever the sun saw, since he
   withdrew upon the suffering of our Saviour,) chance to give an edge to
   some of my expressions, let those know, (the nature of whose actions
   has made truth look like a sarcasm, and descriptions sharper than
   invectives,) I say, let these censurers know, (whose innocency lies
   only in the Act of Indemnity,) that to drop the blackest ink and the
   bitterest gall upon this fact, is not satire, but propriety.

   Now since the text says, There was no such thing ever done or seen, the
   proper prosecution of the words, all applied to this occasion, must be
   to shew wherein the strangeness of this deed consists; and since the
   nature of every particular action is to be learnt by reflecting upon
   the agent and the object, with all the retinue of circumstances that
   attend it, under a certain determination, I shall accordingly
   distribute my following discourse into these materials: I shall,

   I. Consider the person who suffered.

   II. Shew the preparation or introduction to his suffering.

   III. Shew you the qualities of the agents who acted in it.

   IV. Describe the circumstances and manner of the fact.

   Lastly, Point out the destruction and grim consequences of it.

   Of all which in their order.

   I. He that suffered was a king, and, what is more, such a king as was
   not chosen, but born to it; owing his kingdom, not to the voice of
   popularity, but the suffrage of nature; he was a David, a saint, a
   king, but never a shepherd: all the royal blood in Christendom ran in
   his veins, i. e. many kings went to the making up of him, and his
   improvement and education fell in ways not below his extraction. He was
   accurate in all the commending excellencies of human accomplishments,
   able to deserve, had he not inherited, a kingdom: of so controlling a
   genius, that in every science he did not so much study as reign, he
   appeared not only a proficient, but a prince; and, to go no further for
   a testimony, let his own writings serve for a witness, which speak him
   no less an author than a monarch, composed with such an unfailing
   accuracy, such a commanding, majestic pathos, as if they had been
   written not with a pen, but a sceptre: and as for those whose virulent
   and ridiculous calumnies ascribe that incomparable work to others, it
   is a sufficient argument that those did not, because they could not
   write it. It is hard to counterfeit the spirit of majesty and the
   inimitable peculiarities of an incommunicable genius. At the
   council-table he had ability enough to give himself the best counsel,
   but the unhappy modesty to diffide in it, indeed his only fault; for
   modesty is a paradox in majesty, and humility is a solecism in
   supremacy.

   Look we next on his piety and incomparable virtues, though, without any
   absurdity, I may say, that his very endowments of nature were
   supernatural; so pious was he, that if others had measured their
   obedience to him by his to God, he had been the most absolute monarch
   in the world. As eminent for frequenting the temple, as Solomon for
   building one: no occasions ever interfered with his devotion, nor
   business outdated his time of attendance in the church. [And here I
   should not pay a due tribute to his memory, did I forget that
   remarkable instance of constancy of soul, (not to be shocked by the
   severest strokes of ill fortune,) with which he received the surprising
   news of the sudden loss of a dear friend and faithful servant,
   sacrificed by a vile assassin to the unjustifiable and groundless
   clamours of an ill-informed people, as well as to private spleen. How
   gallantly in this affair did he suppress human nature, and restrain
   that flood of tears due to the memory of his friend, till he had
   finished his duty towards God.] So firm was he in the protestant cause,
   though he lay in the midst of temptation, in the very bosom of Spain,
   and though France lay in his, yet nothing could alter him, but he
   espoused the cause of his religion more than his beloved queen. He ever
   filled the title under which we prayed for him. He could defend
   religion as a king, dispute for it as a divine, and die for it as a
   martyr. I think I shall speak a great truth in saying, that the only
   thing that makes protestantism considerable in Christendom is the
   church of England, and the only thing that does now cement and confirm
   the church of England is the blood of that blessed martyr. He was so
   well skilled in all controversies, that we may well style him in all
   causes ecclesiastical, not only supreme governor, but moderator, nor
   more fit to fill the throne than the chair; and withal, so exact an
   observer and royal rewarder of all such performances, that it was an
   encouragement for a man to be a divine under such a prince. Which piety
   of his was set off with a whole train of moral virtues. His temperance
   was so great and impregnable amidst all those allurements with which
   the courts of kings are apt to melt the most stoical and resolved
   minds, that he did at the same time both teach and upbraid the court;
   so that it was not so much their own vices, as his virtue, that
   rendered their debauchery inexcusable. Look over the whole race of our
   kings, and take in the kings of Israel to boot, and who ever kept the
   bonds of conjugal affection so inviolate? David was chiefly eminent for
   repenting in this matter; Charles for not needing repentance. None ever
   of greater fortitude of mind, which was more resplendent in the
   conquest of himself, and in those miraculous instances of his passive
   valour, than if he had strewn the field with the rebels' arms, and to
   the suffrage of his own cause joined the success of theirs; and yet,
   withal, so meek, so gentle, so merciful, and that even to cruelty to
   himself, that if ever the lion dwelt with the lamb, if ever courage and
   meekness were united, it was in the breast of this royal person; and,
   which makes the rebellion more ugly and intolerable, there was scarce
   any person of note among his enemies who did not wear his colours, and
   carry some particular mark of his favour and obligations; some were his
   own menial servants, and eat bread at his table, before they lifted up
   their heel against him; some received from him honours, some offices
   and employments. I could mention particulars of each kind, did I think
   their names fit to be heard in a church or from a pulpit. In short, he
   so behaved himself toward them, that their rebellion might be malice
   indeed, but could not be revenge.

   And these his personal virtues shed a suitable influence upon his
   government for the space of seventeen years; the peace, plenty, and
   honour of the English nation spread itself even to the envy of all
   neighbouring countries; and when that plenty had pampered them into
   unruliness and rebellion, yet still the justice of his government left
   them at a loss for an occasion to rebel, till at last ship-money was
   pitched upon as fit to be reformed by excise and taxes, and the burden
   of the subjects took off by plunderings and sequestrations. The king
   now, to scatter that cloud which began to gather and look black upon
   the church and state, made those condescensions to their impudent
   petitions, that they had scarce any thing to make war for, but what was
   granted them already; and having thus stript himself of his
   prerogative, he left it clear to the world, that there was nothing left
   for them to fight for, but only his life. Afterward, in the prosecution
   of this unnatural war, what overtures did he make for peace! Nay, when
   he had his sword in his hand, his armies about him, and a cause to
   justify him before God and man, how did he choose to compound himself
   into nothing! to depose and unking himself by their hard and inhuman
   conditions! But all was nothing: he might as well compliment a mastiff,
   or court a tiger, as think to win those who were now hardened in blood,
   and thoroughpaced in rebellion. Yet the truth is, his conscience
   uncrowned him, as having a mind too pure and delicate to admit of those
   maxims and practices of state that usually make princes great and
   successful.

   Having thus, with an unheard of loyalty, fought against him and
   conquered him, they commit him to prison; and the king himself notes,
   that it has always been observed, that there is but little distance
   between the prisons of kings and their graves: to which I subjoin, that
   where the observation is constant, there must be some standing cause of
   the connection of the thing observed; and indeed, it is a direct
   translation from the prison to the grave; the difference between them
   being only this; that he who is buried is imprisoned under ground, and
   he that is imprisoned is buried above ground: and I could wish, that as
   they slew and buried his body, so we had not also buried his funeral.

   But, to finish this poor and imperfect description, though it is of a
   person so renowned, that he neither needs the best, nor can be injured
   by the worst; yet, in short, he was a prince whose virtues were as
   prodigious as his sufferings; a true father of his country, if but for
   this only, that he was father of such a son. And yet the most innocent
   of men, and best of kings, so pious and virtuous, so learned and
   judicious, so merciful and obliging, was rebelled against, drove out of
   his own house, pursued as a partridge on the mountains, like an eagle
   in his own dominions, inhumanly imprisoned, and for a catastrophe of
   all, most barbarously murdered; though in this his murder was the less
   woful, in that his death released him from his prison.

   II. Having thus seen the person suffering, let us in the next place see
   the preparations of this bloody fact; and indeed, it would be but a
   preposterous course, to insist only on the consequent, without taking
   notice of the antecedent. It were too long to dig to the spring of this
   rebellion, and to lead up to the secrecies of its first contrivance;
   but as David's phrase is, upon another occasion, it was framed and
   fashioned in the lowest parts of the earth, and there it was fearfully
   and wonderfully made, a work of darkness and retirement, removed from
   the eye of witnesses, even that of conscience also; for conscience was
   not admitted into their council. But their first aim was to procure a
   Levite to consecrate their design, and a factious ministry to christen
   it the cause of God: they still own their party for God's own Israel,
   and being so, it must needs be their duty to come out of Egypt, though
   they provide themselves a Red sea for their passage.

   For their assistance they repair to the northern steel, and bring in an
   unnatural, mercenary crew, that like a shoal of locusts covered the
   land, such as inherited the description of those, which God brought
   upon his people the Jews; a nation fierce, peeled, and scattered: and
   still we shall read that God punished his people from the north; as
   Jer. 1. 3, Out of the north comes destruction, which shall make the
   land desolate. Jer. iv. 6, I will bring evil from the north, and great
   destruction. Now to endear and unite these into one interest, they
   invented a covenant, much like to that which some are said to make with
   hell, and an agreement with death. It was the most solemn piece of
   perjury, the most fatal engine against the church, and bane of
   monarchy, the greatest snare of souls, and mystery of iniquity, that
   ever was hammered out by the wit and wickedness of man. I shall not, as
   they do, abuse scripture language, and call it the blood of the
   covenant, but give it its proper title, the covenant of blood; such an
   one as the brethren, Simeon and Levi, made, when they were going about
   the like designs; their very posture of taking it was an ominous mark
   of its intent; and their holding up their hands was a sign they were
   going to strike. It was such an olio of treason and tyranny, that one
   of the assembly of their own prophets gives this testimony of it, in
   his narration upon it, (and his testimony is true;) "that it was such a
   covenant, that whether you respect the subject-matter of it, or the
   occasion of it, or the persons engaged in it, or lastly the manner of
   imposing it, the like was never read, seen, or heard of." The truth is,
   it bears no other likeness to other ancient covenants, than as at the
   making of them, they slew beasts and divided them, so this was
   solemnized with blood, slaughter, and division. But that I may not
   accuse in general, without a particular charge; read it over as it
   stands prefixed to their catechisms (as if without it their system of
   divinity was not complete, nor their children like to become
   Christians, unless they were schooled to treason, and catechised to
   rebellion,) I say, in the covenant as it stands here, in the third
   article of it, after they had first promised to defend the privileges
   of parliament, and the liberties of the kingdom; at length they also
   promised to defend the person of the king, viz. in the preservation and
   defence of the true religion, and the liberties of the kingdom; so that
   their promise of loyalty to him was not absolute, but conditional,
   bound hand and foot with this stipulation, so far as he preserveth the
   true religion and liberties of the kingdom. Now those very persons who
   covenanted thus, had already from pulpit and press declared, the
   religion and way of worship established in the church of England, and
   then maintained by the king, to be false, popish, and idolatrous; and
   withal, that the king had invaded their liberties. Now for men to
   suspend their obedience upon certain conditions, which very conditions
   they declared at the same time not performed, was not to profess
   obedience, but remonstrate the reasons of intended disobedience. We
   have seen the doctrine of the covenant; see now the use of this
   doctrine, as it was charged home with a suitable application, in a war
   raised against the king, in the cruel usage and imprisonment, killing,
   sequestering and undoing of all that adhered to him. All which
   home-proceedings, though his majesty now stupendously forgives, yet the
   world will not, cannot yet forget; his indemnity is not an oblivion:
   and for those persons who now clamour and cry out, they are persecuted,
   because they are no longer permitted to persecute, and who choose
   rather to quit the ministry, than disown the obligation of the
   covenant, I leave to all impartial and understanding minds to judge,
   whether they do not by this openly declare to the world, that they hold
   themselves obliged by oath, as they are able, to act over again all
   that hath hitherto been done by virtue of the covenant, and
   consequently that they left not places for being nonconformists to the
   church, but for being virtually rebels to the crown; which makes them
   just as worthy to be indulged as a dropsy or a malignant fever, which
   is exasperated by mitigations, and inflamed by every cooling infusion.

   But to draw the premises closer to the purpose, I argue: that which was
   the proper means to enable the king's enemies to make war against him,
   and upon that war to conquer, and upon that conquest to imprison, and
   inevitably to put the power in the hands of those, who by that power in
   the end did murder him; that, according to the genuine consequence of
   reason, was the natural cause of his murder. This is the proposition
   that I assert, but I shall not trouble myself to make the assumption:
   and indeed those who wipe their mouths, and lick themselves innocent by
   clapping this act upon the army, make just the same plea that Pilate
   did for his innocency in the death of Christ, because he left the
   execution to the soldiers; or what the soldiers may make for clearing
   themselves of all this blood that they have spilt, by charging it upon
   their swords. I conclude therefore, that this was the gradual process
   to this horrid act, this the train laid to blow up monarchy, this the
   step by which the king ascended the scaffold.

   III. Come we now, in the third place, to shew who were the actors in
   this tragic scene. When through the anger of Providence, the thriving
   army of rebels had worsted justice, cleared the field, subdued all
   oppositions and risings, even to the very insurrections of conscience
   itself; so that impunity at length grew into reputation of piety, and
   success gave rebellion the varnish of religion; that they might
   consummate their villainy, the gown was called in to complete the
   execution of the sword; and to make Westminster-hall a place to take
   away lives as well as estates, a new court was set up, and judges
   packed, who had no more to do with justice, than so far forth as they
   deserved to be the objects of it: in which they first begin with a
   confutation of the civilians' notion of justice and jurisdiction, it
   being with them no longer an act of the supreme power. Such an inferior
   crew, such a mechanic rabble were they, having not so much as any arms
   to shew the world, but what they used in rebellion; that when I survey
   the list of the king's judges, and the witnesses against him, I seem to
   have before me a catalogue of all trades, and such as might have better
   filled the shops of Westminster-hall, than sat on the benches; some of
   which came to be possessors of the king's houses, who before had no
   certain dwelling but the king's highway; and some might have continued
   tradesmen still, had not want and inability to trade sent them to the
   war. Now that a king, such a king, should be murdered by such, the
   basest of his subjects, and not like a Nimrod, (as some sanctified
   preachers have called him,) but like Actaeon torn by a pack of
   bloodhounds; that the steam of a dunghill should thus obscure the sun;
   this so much enhanceth the calamity of this royal person, and makes his
   death as different from his, who is conquered and slain by another
   king, as it is between being torn by a lion, and being eaten up by
   vermin; pardon the expression, for it came into my mind by speaking of
   those, many of whom were some time beggars. For the feet to trample
   upon, yea kick at the head, would it not look like a monster? But
   indeed, these of all others were the fittest instruments for such a
   work; for base descent and poor education disposeth the mind to
   impiousness and cruelty; as of beasts those are the most savage, which
   are bred in dens, and have their extraction from under ground: these
   therefore were the worthy judges and condemners of that great king;
   even the refuse of the people, and the very scum of the nation, that
   was at that time both the uppermost and basest part of it.

   IV. Pass we now, in the fourth place, to the circumstances and manner
   of proceeding in this ugly fact. And the circumstances, we know, have
   the greatest cast in determining the nature of all actions, as we judge
   of any one's parts or qualities by the nature of his attendants. First,
   then, it was not done like other works of darkness, in secret, nor (as
   they use to preach) in a corner, but publicly, coloured with the face
   of justice, managed with openness and solemnity, as solemn as the
   league and covenant itself. History indeed affords us many examples of
   princes clandestinely murdered, which though it be villainous, is in
   itself more excusable; for he that doeth such a thing in secret, by the
   manner of doing confesseth himself ashamed of the thing he does: but he
   that acts in the face of the sun, vouches his work for laudable,
   glorious, and heroic. Having brought him to the high court of justice,
   (so called, I conceive, because justice was there arraigned and
   condemned, or perhaps because it never shewed mercy) by a way of trial
   as unheard of as the court, he was not permitted so much as to speak in
   his own defence, but, with the innocence and silence of a lamb,
   condemned to slaughter; and it would have been well for them if they
   could as easily have imposed silence on his blood. Being condemned,
   they spit in his face, and delivered him to the mockery and affronts of
   the soldiers; so that I wonder where the blasphemy lies, which some
   charge upon those who make the king's suffering something to resemble
   our Saviour's: but is it blasphemy to compare the king to Christ in
   that respect, in which Christ himself was made like a servant? For can
   he be like us in all things, and we not like him? Certainly there was
   something in that Providence, that appointed so long ago the chapter to
   be read on the day of our Saviour's passion, to be read likewise on the
   day of our king's; and I am sure that the resemblance is so near, that
   had he lived before him, he had been a type of him. I confess there is
   some disparity in the case, for they shewed themselves worse than the
   Jews. But however, since they object that we make the king like Christ,
   I am willing it should be their commendation to be as unlike Christ as
   they please.

   Let us now follow him from their mock-tribunal to the place of his
   residence till his execution. Nothing remains for a man condemned, and
   presently to leave the world, but these two things; 1st, To take leave
   of his friends, a thing not denied to the vilest malefactor, which is
   sufficiently apparent in that it hath not been denied to themselves:
   yet no entreaties from him or his royal consort could prevail with
   these murderers to let her take the last farewell and commands of her
   dying husband. He was permitted to take no farewell but to the world.
   Thus was he stript of all, even from the prerogative of a prince, to
   the privilege of a malefactor. The next thing desired by all dying
   Christians, is freedom to converse with God, and to prepare themselves
   to meet him at his dreadful tribunal; but with an Italian cruelty to
   the soul as well as the body, they debar him of this freedom also, and
   even solitude, his former punishment, is now too great an enjoyment.
   But that they might shew themselves no less enemies to private, than
   they had been to public prayers, they disturb his retirements, and with
   scoffs and continual calumnies upbraid those devotions which were then
   interceding for them; and I question not but fanatic fury was at that
   height, that they would have laughed at Christ himself, had he used his
   own prayer.

   With these preludiums is he brought to the last scene of mockeries and
   cruelty, to a stage erected before his own palace; and for a greater
   affront to majesty, before that part of it in which he was wont to
   display his royalty, and to give audience to ambassadors, where now he
   could not obtain audience for himself, in his last addresses to his
   abused subjects. There he receives the fatal blow; there he dies,
   conquering and pardoning his enemies; and at length finds that
   faithfully performed on the scaffold, which was at first promised in
   the parliament, and perhaps in the same sense, that he should be a
   glorious king. And even this death was the mercy of the murderers,
   considering what kind of death several proposed, when they sat in
   council about the manner of it, even no less than to execute him in his
   robes, and afterwards to drive a stake through his head and body, to
   stand as a monument on his grave. In short, all kinds of death were
   proposed, that either their malice could suggest, or their own guilt
   deserve. And would these then now find in their hearts, or have the
   face to desire to live? And to plead a pardon from the son, who thus
   murdered the father? I speak not only of those wretches who openly
   embrued their hands in the bloody sentence, but of those more
   considerable traitors who had the villainy to manage the contrivance,
   and yet the cunning to disappear at the execution, and perhaps the good
   luck to be preferred after it. And for those who now survive, by a
   mercy as incredible as their crimes, which has left them to the soft
   expiation of solitude and repentance; though usually all the
   professions that such make of repentance are nothing else but the faint
   resentments of a guilty horror, the convulsions and last breathings of
   a gasping conscience: as the mercy by which they live is made a visible
   defiance to government, and a standing encouragement to these alarms of
   plots and conspiracies: so I beseech God, that even their supposed
   repentance be not such, as both themselves and the kingdom hereafter
   may have bitter cause too late to repent of. And if indeed they should
   prove such as have no conscience but horror, who by the same crimes
   will be made irreconcileable, for which they deserve to be
   unpardonable; who would resume those repentings upon opportunities,
   which they made upon extremity; and being saved from the gallows, make
   the usual requital that is made for that kind of deliverance: I say, if
   such persons should only for a time be chained, and tied up, like so
   many lions in the tower, that they may gain more fierceness, and run
   again at majesty, religion, laws, churches, and the universities;
   whether God intends by this a repetition of our former confusions, or a
   general massacre of our persons, (which is most likely,) the Lord in
   his mercy fit and enable us to endure the smart of a misimproved
   providence, and the infatuated frustration of such a miraculous
   deliverance.

   But to return to this blessed martyr. We have seen him murdered; and is
   there any other scene of cruelty to act? Is not death the end of the
   murderer's malice, as well as of the life of him that is murdered? No,
   there is another and viler instance of their implacable cruelty; in the
   very embalming of his body, and taking out of his bowels, (which, had
   they not relented to his enemies, had not been so handled,) they gave
   order to those to whom that work was committed, diligently to search
   and see, (I speak it with shame and indignation) whether his body was
   not infected with some loathsome disease; I suppose, that which some of
   his judges were so much troubled with. Now any one may see, that
   further to intimate an inquiry was in effect to enjoin the report. And
   here let any one judge, whether the remorseless malice of imbittered
   rebels ever rose to such an height of tyranny; the very embalming his
   body must be made a means of corrupting his name: as if his murder was
   not complete, if, together with his life, they did not assassinate his
   fame, and butcher his reputation. But the body of that prince, innocent
   and virtuous even to a miracle, had none of the ruins and genteel
   rottenness of our modern debauchery; it was firm and clear like his
   conscience: he fell like a cedar, no less fragrant than tall and
   stately. Rottenness of heart and bone belong to his murderers, the
   noisomeness of whose carcasses, caused by the noisomeness of their
   lives, might even retaliate and revenge their sufferings, and while
   they are under the execution, poison the executioner. But the last
   grand comprehensive circumstance, which is as it were the very form and
   spirit that did actuate and run through all the rest, is, that it was
   done with the pretence of conscience, and the protestations of
   religion, with eyes lift up to, heaven, expostulating with God with
   pleas of Providence, and inward instigations, till at last, with much
   labour and many groans, they were delivered of their conceived
   mischief. And certainly we have cause to deplore this murder with
   fasting, if it were but for this reason, that it was contrived and
   committed with fasting; every fast portended some villainy, as still a
   famine ushers in a plague: but as hunger serves only for appetite, so
   they never ordained an humiliation, but for doing something, which,
   being done, might find them matter of a thanksgiving; and such a fury
   did abused piety inspire into the church militant, upon these
   exercises, that we might as safely meet an hungry boar as a preaching
   colonel after a fast, whose murderous humiliations strangely verify
   that prophecy in Isaiah viii. 21. When they shall be hungry, they shall
   curse their king and their God, and look upwards; that is, they should
   rebel and blaspheme devoutly. Though by the way, he that is always
   looking upwards, can little regard how he walks below.

   But was there any thing in the whole book of God to warrant this
   rebellion? Instead of obedience, will they sacrifice him whom they
   ought to obey? Why yes: Daniel dreamed a dream, and there is also
   something in the Revelations concerning a beast, and a little horn, and
   a fifth vial, and therefore the king ought undoubtedly to die: but if
   neither you nor I can gather so much from these places, they will tell
   us, it is because we are not inwardly enlightened. But others, more
   knowing, but not less wicked, insist not so much on the warrant of it
   from scripture, but plead providential dispensations; God's works, it
   seems, must be regarded before his words; and their Latin advocate, Mr.
   Milton, who, like a blind adder, has spit so much poison on the king's
   person and cause, speaks to this roundly: Deum secuti ducem, et
   impressa passim divina vestigia venerantes, viam haud obscurant, sed
   illustrem, et illius auspiciis commonstratam et patefactam ingressi
   sumus.

   But must we read God's mind in his footsteps, or in his words? This is
   as if, when we have a man's handwriting, we should endeavour to take
   his meaning by the measure of his foot. But still, is pleading
   conscience a covering for all enormities, and an answer to all
   questions and accusations also? What made them fight against, imprison,
   and murder their lawful sovereign? Why, conscience. What made them
   extirpate the government, and pocket up the revenues of the church?
   Conscience. What made them perjure themselves with contrary oaths? what
   made swearing a sin, and forswearing none? what made them lay hold on
   God's promises, and break their own? Conscience. What made them
   sequester, persecute, and undo their brethren, ravin their estates, and
   ruin their families, get into their places, and then say they only rob
   the Egyptians? Why still this large capacious thing is conscience. The
   poet says, Vis fieri dives, Bithynice? conscius esto; which I think may
   be properly construed thus: If you would be rich, be (in their sense)
   conscientious. We have lived under that model of religion, in which
   nothing has been counted impious but loyalty, nor absurd but
   restitution. But, O blessed God, to what an height can prosperous,
   audacious impiety rise! Was it not enough that men once crucified
   Christ, but that there must be a generation of men who would crucify
   Christianity? Must he who taught no defence but patience, allowed no
   armour but submission, and never warranted the shedding any blood but
   his own, be now again mocked with soldiers, and vouched the author and
   patron of all those hideous and rebellious acts, which an ordinary
   impiety would stand amazed at, and which in this world he has so
   plainly condemned in his word, and will hereafter severely sentence in
   his own person? Certainly, these monsters are not only spots in
   Christianity, but so many standing exceptions from humanity and nature.

   V. In the fifth and last place, let us view the horridness of the fact
   in the fatal consequences that did attend it. Every villainy is like a
   great absurdity, drawing after it a numerous train of homogeneous
   consequences; and none ever spread itself into more than this. But I
   shall endeavour to reduce them all into two sorts; such as were of a
   civil, and such as were of a religious concern.

   And first for the civil, political consequences of it; there
   immediately followed a change of that government, whose praise had been
   proclaimed even by its enemies. It was now shred into democracy; and
   the stream of government being cut into many channels, ran thin and
   shallow: whereupon the subjects had many masters, and every servant so
   many distinct services. But the wheel of Providence, which they only
   looked at, and that even to giddiness, did not stop here; but by a
   fatal vicissitude, the power and wickedness of those many were again
   compacted into one, and from that one returning again into many, with
   several attending variations, till at length we pitched upon one again,
   one beyond whom they could not go, the ne plus ultra of all regal
   excellencies, as all change tends to, and at last ceases upon its
   acquired perfection. Nor was the government only, but the glory of our
   nation also changed; distinctions of orders confounded, the gentry and
   nobility, who voted the bishops out of their dignities in parliament,
   by the just judgment of God were thrust out themselves, and brought
   under the lash of an imperious beggar on horseback. Learning was
   discountenanced, and the universities threatened; the law to be
   reformed; the model of the nation to be burnt: such an inundation and
   deluge of ruin, reformation, and confusion, had spread itself upon the
   whole nation, that it seemed a kind of resemblance of Noah's flood, in
   which a few men survived among beasts.

   The second sort of consequences were of religious concern. I speak not
   of the contempts and rebukes lying upon the preachers of those days;
   for they brought their miseries upon themselves, and had a great deal
   more cause to curse their own seditious sermons, than to curse Meroz.
   They sounded the first trumpet to rebellion, and like the saints, had
   grace to persevere in what they first began; courting an usurper, and
   calling themselves his loyal and obedient subjects, never endeavouring
   [enduring] so much as to think of their lawful sovereign. I speak not
   therefore of these; but the great destructive consequence of this fact
   was, that it left a lasting slur upon the protestant religion: Tell it
   not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon, lest the
   daughters of the Philistines triumph, lest the papacy laugh us to
   scorn. I confess the seditious writings of some who call themselves
   protestants have sufficiently bespattered their religion. See Calvin
   warranting the three estates to oppose their prince, 4 Instit. ch. 20.
   sect. 81. See Mr. Knox's Appeal, and in that, arguments for resisting
   the civil magistrate. Read Mr. Buchanan's discourse de jure regni apud
   Scotos. Read Vindiciae contra Tyrannos, under the name of Junius
   Brutus, writ by Ottoman the civilian. See Pareus on the 13th to the
   Romans, where he states a large term, atrocem aliquam injuriam, and a
   very easy application, to be sufficient reason for the taking up arms
   against the king. But this is rather a comment on the covenant, than on
   the 13th to the Romans. Both of which, as they teach the same doctrine,
   so they deserved and had justly the same confutation. But these
   principles, like sleeping lions, lay still a great while, and never
   were completely awaked, nor appeared in the field, till the French holy
   league and the English rebellion. Let the powder-plot be as bad as it
   will, yet still there is as much difference between that and the king's
   murder, as between an action and an attempt: what bulls and anathemas
   could not do, seditious sermons have brought about. What was then
   contrived against the parliament, has since been done by it: what the
   papists' powder intended, the soldiers' matches have effected. I say,
   let the powder-plot be looked upon, as indeed it is, the product of
   hell, as black as the souls and principles that hatched it; yet still
   this reformation-murder will preponderate, and January always have the
   precedency of November.

   And thus I have traced this accursed fact through all the parts and
   ingredients of it: and now, if we reflect upon the quality of the
   person upon whom it was done, the condition of the persons that did it,
   the means, manner, and circumstances of its transaction; I suppose it
   will fill up the measure and reach the heights of the words in the
   text, that there was never such a thing done or seen since the day that
   the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt until this day.
   For my part, my apprehensions of it overcharge my expressions; and how
   to set it off, I know not; for black receives no other colour: but when
   I call to mind all the ideas of horror, and all the records of the
   Grecian and barbarian murders, together with new-fancied instances, and
   unheard of possibilities, yet I find none parallel, and therefore have
   this only to say of the king's murder; that it is a thing, than which
   nothing can be imagined more strange, and amazing, and astonishing,
   except its pardon.

   And now, having done with the first part of my text, does it not
   naturally engage me in the second? Must such a deed, as was never seen
   nor heard of, never be spoken of? or must it be stroked with smooth,
   mollifying expressions? Is this the way to cure the wound, by pouring
   oil upon those that made it? And must Absalom be therefore dealt gently
   with, because he was a sturdy rebel? If, as the text bids us, we
   consider the fact, and take advice with reason and conscience, we
   cannot but obey it in the following words, and speak our minds. For
   could Croesus's dumb son speak upon the very attempting a murder upon
   his prince and father, and shall a preacher be dumb, when such an
   action is committed? Therefore having not yet finished my text, nor,
   according to the command of it, spoken all my mind, I have one thing
   more to propose, and with that to conclude.

   Would you be willing to see this scene acted over again? To see that
   restless plotting humour, that now boils and ferments in many traitors'
   breasts, once more display itself in the dismal effects of war and
   desolation? Would you see the rascality of the nation in troops and
   tumults beleaguer the royal palace? Would you hear the ministers
   absolving their congregations from their sacred oath of allegiance, and
   sending them into the field to lose their lives and souls, in a
   professed rebellion against their sovereign? Would you see an insolent,
   overturning army, in the heart and bowels of the nation, moving to and
   fro, to the terror of every thing that is noble, generous, and
   religious? Would you see the loyal gentry harassed, starved, and
   undone, by the oppression of base, insulting committees? Would you see
   the clergy torn in pieces, and sacrificed by the inquisition of synods,
   triers, and commissioners? And to mention the greatest last; would you
   have the king, with his father's kingdoms, inherit also his fortunes?
   Would you see the crown trampled upon, majesty haled from prison to
   prison, and at length, with the vilest circumstances of spite and
   cruelty, bleeding and dying at the feet of bloody, inhuman miscreants?
   Would you, now Providence has cast the destructive interest from the
   parliament, and the house is pretty well swept and cleansed, have the
   old unclean spirit return, and take to itself seven other spirits,
   seven other interests, worse than itself, and dwell there, and so make
   our latter end worse than our beginning? We hear of plots and
   combinations, parties joining and agreeing; let us not trust too much
   in their oppositions among themselves. The elements can fight with each
   other, and yet unite into one body; Ephraim against Manasses, and
   Manasses against Ephraim, and both equally against the royal tribe of
   Judah. Now if we fear the letting loose these furies again upon us, let
   us fear the returns of our former provocations: if we would keep off
   the axe from our princes and nobles, let us lay it to our sins; if we
   would preserve their lives, let us mend our own. We have complained of
   armies, committees, sequestrations; but our sins are those that have
   sucked the blood of this nation. These have purpled the scaffold with
   royal blood; these have blown up so many noble families, have made so
   many widows, have snatched the bread out of the mouths of so many poor
   orphans. It is our not fearing God, hath made others not honour the
   king; our not benefiting by the ordinances of the church, that hath
   enriched others with her spoils. And how is our church (the only church
   in Christendom we read of, whose avowed principles and practices disown
   all resistance of the civil power) struck and laid at, at this time!
   But when I hear of conspiracies, seditions, designs, covenants, or
   plots, they do not much move or affright me: but when I see the same
   covetousness, the same drunkenness and profaneness, that was first
   punished in ourselves, and then in our sanctified enemies; when I see
   joy turned into revelling, and debauchery proclaimed louder than it can
   be proclaimed against: these, I confess, stagger and astonish me; nor
   can I persuade myself we were delivered to do all these abominations.
   But if we have not the grace of Christians, yet have we not the hearts
   of men? have we no bowels nor relentings? If the blood and banishment
   of our kings, if the miseries of our common mother the church, ready to
   fall back into the jaws of purchasers and reformers, cannot move us,
   yet shall we not at least pity our posterity? Shall we commit sins, and
   breed up our children to inherit the curse? Shall the infants now
   unborn have cause to say hereafter in the bitterness of their souls,
   Our fathers have eaten sour grapes of disobedience, and our teeth are
   set on edge with rebellions and confusions? How doth any one know, but
   the oath that he is now swearing, the very lewdness he is now
   committing, may be scored up by God as an item for a new rebellion? We
   may be rebels, and yet not vote in parliament, nor sit in committees,
   nor fight in armies: every sin is virtually treason; and we may be
   guilty of murder in breaking other commandments besides the sixth. But
   at present we are made whole: God hath by a miracle healed our
   breaches, cured the maladies, and bound up the wounds of a bleeding
   nation. What remains now, but that we take the counsel that seconded
   the like miraculous cure, go our ways, sin no more, lest a worse thing
   come upon us. But since our calamities have reached that height, that
   they give us rather cause to fear a repetition, than a possibility of
   gradation; I shall dismiss you with the same advice upon a different
   motive, Go, sin no more, lest the same evil befall you. Which God of
   his infinite mercy prevent; even that God, by whom kings reign and
   princes decree justice, by whom their thrones are established, and by
   whom their blood will be revenged. To whom, &c. Amen.

  GALATIANS ii. 5.

   To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the
   truth of the gospel might continue with you.

   CHRISTIANITY having been now in the world above sixteen hundred years,
   there is hardly any condition that can befall the church, but may be
   paralleled, or at least resembled by the condition it has been in, in
   some place or age before. That which our church labours under at
   present, is the bold and restless encroachments of many amongst
   ourselves, upon the bishops and pastors of it.

   1st, By an endeavour to cast out of our public worship some ceremonies
   and usages hitherto received in it; and instead of submitting to their
   spiritual governors in such matters, they insolently require of their
   governors to comply with them, though contrary to their own judgment,
   and that also backed with truth and reason, as well as law and
   authority. And then (upon their refusal to yield to such innovators) by
   traducing them as persons of another religion, of a different
   Christianity; and, in a word, as papists and idolaters, for persisting
   in the use of those ceremonies, which, upon the most serious
   deliberation had about these things, by such as laid down their lives
   against popery, have by full authority, both ecclesiastical and civil,
   been established in our church.

   Not much unlike this case of ours, we have one mentioned here, in the
   church of Galatia, and that as early as the times of the apostles
   themselves; in which many, both Jews and Gentiles, being converted to
   Christianity, a great dispute arose, whether the Jewish customs were to
   be joined with the Christian profession, and consequently, whether the
   converted Gentiles ought not to have been circumcised according to the
   law of Moses, as well as baptized according to the religion of Christ.
   The Jewish converts, who were most infinitely fond of the Mosaical
   rites, even after their enrolment under Christ's banner, fiercely
   contended not only for the continuance of circumcision amongst
   themselves, but for obliging the proselyte Gentiles to the same custom
   also. And in this their error they were the more confirmed by the
   example and practice of St. Peter, the great apostle of the
   circumcision, (it being the fate of the church then, as well as since,
   to have some of its chief leaders betray the truth and interest of it,
   by unworthy and base compliances with its enemies.) St. Peter, I say,
   thus judaizing in some things, and that even contrary to his own
   conscience, as well as to the truth of the gospel, (for the text tells
   us in the 12th and 13th verses, that it was neither better nor worse
   than downright dissimulation; and such an one is like a contagious
   pest, which spreads the infection on many more besides himself,) did by
   his example mightily encourage those Jewish Christians, not only to
   have confidence in their errors, but also to an expostulation with St.
   Paul himself, who, being an apostle of the Gentiles, both taught and
   practised quite otherwise; and so far did it carry them, that they
   questioned the very truth of his doctrine, calling it another gospel,
   and by no means the same that Christ and the rest of the apostles had
   taught before, as is intimated in the first chapter and the 9th verse.
   They reflected also very slightingly on his person and apostleship,
   extolling St. Peter and others as pillars, but despising St. Paul, as
   nothing in comparison. Upon which, St. Paul coming to visit these
   Galatian converts, with Titus his companion, they press him very
   earnestly, and with an importunity next to compulsion, to have Titus
   circumcised, according to their false notion of the necessity of
   circumcision. And yet, as false as this opinion was, it wanted not some
   colour of arguments; for might not these Galatians plead, in behalf of
   the continuance of circumcision, that Christ himself declared, he came
   not to destroy the law of Moses, but to confirm and fulfil it? And was
   not this circumcision one of the most considerable parts of the law? So
   considerable indeed, as to be the grand obligation to bind men to all
   the rest. Did not also Christ command his own disciples to hear and do
   what the pharisees taught them out of Moses's chair, and did they teach
   or own any thing equally necessary, or more necessary than
   circumcision? As a confirmation of all this, did not St. Peter, who was
   the proper apostle of the circumcision, agree and concur with them in
   the practice of it, or at least not dissuade them from it; nay, and did
   not St. Paul himself cause Timothy to be circumcised? And if in this
   matter there should be any difference between these two apostles, was
   not the advantage clearly on St. Peter's side, who, having conversed
   personally with Christ in the flesh, might rationally be presumed to
   know the true sense and design of the gospel more than St. Paul, who
   had not that benefit; and consequently, that it must be much safer for
   them in that controversy to adhere to the former than to the latter?
   Lastly, over and above all, might they not plead themselves extremely
   scandalized, grieved, and offended at the disusage of circumcision,
   which they were sure was at first instituted by God, and never since
   (for what they could find) forbidden by Christ, but rather, on the
   contrary, countenanced by his own practice? These things certainly
   carry some show of reason in them, and were much more forcible
   allegations for circumcision, than any that our sectaries bring against
   our ceremonies; and yet, as forcible as they seemed, they had no other
   effect on St. Paul, than that with great stiffness he rejects both them
   and those that urged them; and upon a full hearing of the merits of the
   whole cause, resolves not to give place to them, no, not for an hour.

   This was the occasion of these words; in which are five particulars
   worth our observation.

   1st, A fierce opposition made by some erroneous private Christians in
   the church of Galatia against St. Paul, a great apostle, and
   consequently of prime authority in the church of Christ.

   2dly, The cause of this opposition, the violent and unreasonable
   demands made to him, to confirm the practice of a thing as necessary,
   which in itself was not so.

   3dly, The methods taken in this opposition, viz. slandering his
   doctrine, and detracting from the credit and authority of his person,
   for withstanding these their encroaching demands.

   4thly, The wholesome method made use of by the apostle in dealing with
   these violent encroachers; that was, not to give place to them in the
   least, no, not for an hour.

   5thly and lastly, The end and design intended by the apostle in this
   his method of dealing with them, viz. the preservation of the gospel in
   the truth and purity of it, that those sacred truths might have their
   due regard among them.

   The sum of all which particulars I shall connect into this one
   proposition, which shall be the subject of this following discourse;
   namely, That the best and most apostolical way to establish a church,
   and to secure it in a lasting continuance of the truth and purity of
   the gospel, is, for the governors and ministers of it not to give place
   at all, or yield up the least received constitution of it, to the
   demands or pretences of such as dissent or separate from it; all which
   is a plain, natural, undeniable inference from the practice of St. Paul
   in a case so like ours, that a liker can hardly be imagined. The
   prosecution of this proposition I shall endeavour to manage under the
   following heads.

   First, I shall consider and examine the pretences alleged by dissenters
   for our remitting or yielding up any of our ecclesiastical
   constitutions.

   Secondly, I shall shew you the natural consequences of such a tame
   resignation.

   Thirdly, I shall shew what influence and efficacy a strict adherence to
   the constitutions of the church, and an absolute refusal to part with
   any of them, is likely to have upon the settlement of the church, and
   purity of the gospel amongst us.

   But before I enter upon the discussion of any of these, I must premise
   this observation, and rule of all I shall say upon this subject, viz.
   that the case is altogether the same, of requiring upon the account of
   conscience forbearance of practices in themselves lawful, through a
   pretence of their unlawfulness, and an imposing upon the conscience
   practices in themselves not necessary, upon allegation and pretence of
   their necessity; which latter was the case between St. Paul and these
   Galatians, as the former is between our church and the sectarists. Now
   both of these courses are superstitious, and equally so. For though
   lewdness and ignorance have still carried the cry of superstition
   against our church ceremonies, yet (as a learned prelate [2] hath fully
   proved in his Visitation sermon) that charge truly recoils upon our
   dissenters, in the very point and matter before us. For as to urge the
   practice of a thing indifferent as a part of God's worship, and for
   itself necessary to be practised, (which our church never did nor does
   in the injunction of any of her ceremonies,) is superstitious; so to
   make it necessary to abstain from practices in themselves lawful, or at
   least indifferent, alleging that they are sinful, and consequently that
   an abstinence from them is part of our obedience to God, this is
   altogether as superstitious, and diametrically opposite to and
   destructive of the Christian liberty that Christ has invested his
   church with.

   This premised, I shall now enter upon the first thing proposed; which
   was, to consider and examine the pretences alleged by dissenters, for
   the quitting or yielding up any of the constitutions of the church. And
   here in a noted discourse so acceptable to such as hate the church, and
   hope shortly to ruin it, we have their chief pretences already gathered
   to our hands under very few heads, viz. the infirmity, the importunity,
   and plausible exceptions of our sectarists: concerning the first of
   which, the plea of infirmity or weakness, if it be meant of such a
   weakness (as it must be, if it argues any thing) as in the 14th chapter
   of the Epistle to the Romans, or the 8th chapter of the 1st Epistle to
   the Corinthians, St. Paul speaks of in those weak brethren, who in his
   time, being newly converted from Judaism or Gentilism, were for a while
   to be borne with in some things; it is most evident that the case of
   these converts then, and of our dissenters now, are so widely
   different, that where people have from their infancy been brought up in
   a Christian church, and by Christian parents and teachers, such
   infirmity or weakness the apostle there mentions, in persons newly
   converted from other religions, neither is nor can be pleaded; since,
   after so many opportunities of instruction, there can be no doubting or
   dissatisfaction in things necessary to be known, practised, or
   forborne, but what in all persons enjoying those means is very
   culpable, and in most inexcusable; so that the plea is impertinent.

   2dly, And for that other, of importunity, it is so senseless, and
   withal so shameless a pretence, that it may be referred even to the
   judgment of those that make it; whether, in case this was admitted
   against things legally established, any laws in the world could
   possibly subsist or continue, where people were bold and violent enough
   to oppose and exclaim against them. And since the civil state has found
   it necessary to arm itself with laws against sturdy beggars, it is,
   methinks, somewhat hard, that in the ecclesiastical state sturdy
   beggars should control the laws. In the last place therefore, let us
   see what is to be ascribed to their phrase of plausible exceptions;
   where it will concern us, first of all, to inquire into the force and
   meaning of this word plausible, this high and mighty word, to which the
   long received constitution of a whole church ought to give place. Now
   plausible, I conceive, may have one of these two significations.

   1st, It may be taken for that which carries with it more appearance and
   show of reason than its opposite, in the judgment or opinion of the
   multitude: or,

   2dly, For that which carries a greater appearance and show of reason in
   the judgment of the more sensible part of mankind. In either of these
   senses, I shall shew that it makes nothing for them, and that from the
   following considerations.

   1st, Because there is actually a church, a greater number of persons in
   the nation, that practise and conform to the use of those things now in
   debate between us, than there is of those who stand off, and abstain
   from them. This being so, unless we will judge those men gross
   hypocrites, we are bound in reason and Christian charity to believe,
   that there appears to them a greater ground of reason why they should
   so conform, than why they should not; and consequently the first
   signification of plausibility fails our dissenters, since the number of
   those to whom conformity appears more rational is much larger than the
   number of those to whom the exceptions against it appear to be so. In
   this sense therefore the exceptions cannot be allowed to be so much as
   plausible; but then,

   2dly, Admitting (which as they cannot prove, so neither do we grant)
   that there were this kind of plausibility in their exceptions brought
   against conformity, yet I deny that which is plausible in this sense,
   that it appears reasonable to the opinion and vogue of the multitude,
   ought to take place of that which is deemed to have greater reason for
   it in the sense and judgment of the more knowing, though much inferior
   to the other in number: which is the other sense in which I shewed the
   word plausible may be taken.

   3dly, The third consideration is, that since the governing part of the
   church and state have declared for conformity, by making laws to enjoin
   it; and since in all governments the advantage of wisdom and knowledge,
   in making or changing, must in reason be presumed to be rather on the
   side of those that govern, than of those that are to be governed; it
   follows that, according to the other sense of plausibility, conformity
   and the reasons for it are more plausible, than the exceptions and
   arguments alleged against it.

   4thly, The fourth and last consideration, which eradicates the
   foregoing pretence, is, that the ground of passing a thing into a law,
   and of retaining that law when once made, is not the plausibility of
   the thing or law to the sense of the vulgar, but the real conducibility
   of it to the good of the multitude; and that accords to the sense and
   judgment of those who are to govern and make laws for it. To which I
   add further, that a thing may be really and practicably conducing to
   the good of the multitude, though neither suitable to the opinion or
   humour of it, and consequently no ways plausible to it.

   Now from these four consequences it being manifest how insignificant
   that pretence, taken from the plausibility of the nonconformists'
   exceptions against the constitutions of our church, proves to be, since
   they are neither plausible, as proceeding from the wise and governing
   part of the nation, nor yet as from the greater or more numerous part
   of it; nor lastly, ought to have any control upon the laws, though they
   were never so plausible upon this last account: I shall pass from the
   plausibility to the force of the exceptions, and see whether we can
   meet with any strength of reason, where we have not yet found the show.
   And here I shall not pretend to recount them all in particular, but
   only take them as reducible to, and derivable from, the following three
   heads.

   First, The unlawfulness, or,

   Secondly, The inexpediency, or,

   Thirdly and lastly, The smallness of the things excepted against. I
   shall only touch briefly upon each of them, for the compass of this
   discourse will allow no more.

   1st, For their leading plea of the unlawfulness of our ceremonies,
   grounded upon the old, baffled argument drawn from the illegality of
   will-worship, and the prohibition of adding to and detracting from the
   word and worship of God: no other answer can or need be given to it,
   but that which has been given over and over; that our ceremonies are
   not esteemed by our church either as divine worship, or as any
   necessary essential part of it, but only as circumstances and external
   appurtenances for the more decent performance of the worship. For that
   man should of his own will impose on us any thing as the necessary
   worship of God, or add any thing to the worship as a necessary
   essential part of it, this questionless, as the aforementioned
   allegations sufficiently prove, must needs be sinful. But if from hence
   it be affirmed also, that no circumstance is to be allowed in divine
   worship, but what is declared and enjoined by express scripture, the
   consequence of this is so insufferably ridiculous, that it will extend
   to the making it unlawful for the church to appoint any place or house
   for God's worship; nay, it will lead also to the very taking down of
   pulpits, reading-desks, fonts, and every thing else circumstantially
   ministering to the discharge of divine service, if not expressly
   mentioned and commanded in the word of God. And let them, upon the
   foregoing principle, avow the absurdity of the consequence if they can.
   But it has been well remarked, that these men do not indeed believe
   themselves, when they plead our rites unlawful. For when an act of
   parliament enjoined all persons in office to take the sacrament
   according to the use of the church of England, (and that, we know, is
   to take it kneeling,) we find none of them refusing, how idolatrous
   soever at other times they esteemed it, rather than turn out of the
   least office of gain they were possessed of; which, had it been
   unlawful, surely men of such tender consciences, as they own themselves
   to be, would never have been brought to do, since not the least
   unlawful thing ought to be committed for the greatest temporal
   advantage whatsoever. But since these men have, by so many other
   instances, manifested to the world that they look upon their own will
   as their law, they would do well hereafter to allege no other argument
   for the unlawfulness of our ceremonies; and therefore to pass to their
   second plea of inexpedience, or inconveniency of them; to which I shall
   give the two following answers.

   1st, That inexpedience being a word of a general, indefinite sense, and
   so determinable by the several fancies, humours, apprehensions, and
   interests of men about the same thing, so that what is judged expedient
   by one man is thought inexpedient by another; the judgment of the
   expediency or inexpediency of matters formed into laws ought in all
   reason to rest wholly in the legislators and governors, and
   consequently no private persons ought to be looked upon as competent
   judges of the inexpediency of that which the legislative power has once
   enacted and established as expedient.

   2dly, I affirm also, that that which is not only in itself lawful, but
   highly conducible to so great a concern of religion, as decency and
   order in divine worship; and this to that degree, that without it such
   order and decency could not subsist or continue; this cannot otherwise
   be inexpedient upon any considerable account whatsoever. But then all
   these considerations of inexpediency will be abundantly overbalanced by
   this one great expediency: for since the outward acts of divine worship
   cannot be performed but with some circumstances and posture of body,
   either every man must be left to his own arbitration, or use what
   circumstances and postures he pleases, or a rule must be laid down to
   direct these things after one and the same manner. The former of
   necessity infers diversity and variety in the discharge of the same
   worship, and that by the same necessity infers disorder and indecency;
   which by nothing but an uniformity in the behaviour and circumstances
   of persons joining in one and the same worship can be prevented. This
   argument, I confess, concurs directly for the necessity of ceremonies
   in general about divine service; but so far as ours are argued against
   upon a general account, and till they are proved particularly unfit for
   the general end, the same may be also a defence of ours in particular.
   Come we now to the

   3d and last exception, grounded upon the smallness of the things
   excepted against; to which also my answer is twofold: (1st,) That these
   things being in themselves lawful, and not only so, but also determined
   by sufficient authority, the smallness is so far from being a reason
   why men should refuse and stand out against the use of them, that it is
   an unanswerable argument why they should, without any demur, submit and
   comply with authority in matters which they themselves confess to be of
   no very great moment. For it ought to be a very great and weighty
   matter indeed that can warrant a man in his disobedience to the
   injunctions of any lawful authority; and that which is a reason why men
   should comply with their governors, I am sure can be no reason why
   their governors should give place to them. But (2dly,) I add further,
   that nothing actually enjoined by law is (or ought to be looked upon
   as) small or little, as to the use or forbearance of it, during the
   continuance of that law, nor yet as sufficient reason for the
   abrogation of that law, since, be the thing never so small in itself,
   yet, being by great deliberation first established, and for a long time
   since received in the church, and contended for with real and great
   reason on its side, be the reasons never so plausible (which yet
   hitherto does not appear) on the other, yet the consequence of a change
   cannot be accounted small, since it is certainly very hazardous at
   best, and doubtful what mischief it may occasion, how far it may
   proceed, and where it may end; especially since the experience of all
   governments has made it evident, that there was hardly any thing
   altered in a settled state, that was not followed by more alterations,
   and several inconveniences attending these alterations; not indeed at
   first foreseen, but such as in the event made too great impressions on
   the public to be accounted either small or inconsiderable. These
   exceptions being therefore stripped of their plausibility and force
   too, and retorted upon the patrons of them, it follows, that
   notwithstanding all our harangues concerning our difference in smaller
   things, as the phrase now is, and our contending about shadows and the
   like, made by some amongst us, who would fain be personally popular at
   the public cost, and build themselves a reputation with the rabble upon
   the ruins of the church, that by all the obligations of oaths and
   gratitude they are bound to support, as I am sure that supports them.
   It follows, I say, that for the governors of our church, after all
   this, to be ready to yield up the received constitutions of it, either
   to the infirmity, or importunity, or plausible exceptions, (as their
   advocates are pleased to term them,) of our clamorous dissenters, is so
   far from being a part either of the piety or prudence of those
   governors, that it is the fear of many both pious and prudent too, that
   in the end it will be like to prove no other than the permitting of a
   thief to come into the house, only to avoid the noise and trouble of
   his knocking at the door. And thus much for the first thing proposed;
   which was to consider and examine the pretences alleged by dissenters
   for our quitting or yielding up any of our ecclesiastical
   constitutions. I come to shew now the second thing, which is, what are
   naturally like to be the consequences of such a tame resignation. In
   order to which, I shall consider these two things.

   1st, What the temper and dispositions of those men who press so much
   for compliances have usually been.

   2dly, What the effects and consequences of such compliances or
   relaxations have been formerly.

   And first for the temper of these men. This certainly should be
   considered; and if it ought to give any force to their demands, it
   ought to be extremely peaceable and impartial. But are there any
   qualities incident to the nature of man, that these persons are further
   from? For did they treat the governors of the church with any other
   appellation but that of priests of Baal, idolaters, persecuting
   Nimrods, formalists, dumb dogs, proud popish prelates, haters of God
   and good men, &c.? I say, is not this their usual dialect? And can we
   imagine that the spirit of Christianity can suggest such language and
   expressions? Is it possible, that where true religion governs in the
   heart, it should thus utter itself by the mouth? And to shew yet
   further that this temper can manifest itself by actions as well as
   words, did not these who now plead conscience against law, persecute,
   plunder, kill, and murder those who pleaded and followed conscience
   according to law? And can any one assure the government that they will
   not, under the same circumstances, do again the same things? And for
   their impartiality, did they ever grant allowance or toleration to any
   that were dissenters from them? The presbyter would grant none; and so
   much has he given the world under his own hand, in those many clamorous
   libels, and that spawn of pamphlets composed on that subject. And when
   his younger brother, the more able and more successful sectarist of the
   two, had undermined him, and introduced toleration, yet still
   episcopacy as well as popery stood expressly excepted from any benefit
   by it, or part in it. This is the way and temper of the persons we have
   to deal with; and what pity is it that the whole government, both
   ecclesiastical and civil, should not lean to and bear with them! A
   faction that will be sure to requite such a favour once done them, by
   using it to the reproach and ruin of them that did it. And thus having
   given some short account of the temper and disposition of these men,
   the next thing is to consider,

   2dly, What the effect and consequences of such compliances or
   relaxations have been heretofore. And for this I appeal to the
   judgment, reading, and experience of all, who have in any measure
   applied themselves to the observation of men and things, whether they
   ever yet found, that any who ever pressed for indulgencies and
   forbearances rested in them once granted, without proceeding any
   further? None ever yet did, but used them only as an act and instrument
   to get into power, and make every concession a step to a further
   demand; since every grant renders the person to whom it is made so much
   the more considerable, when he thinks fit to ask more. To grant, is to
   give ground; and such persons ask some things only in order to their
   getting others without asking; for no other encroachers upon or enemies
   to any public constitution ask all at first: sedition itself is modest
   in the dawn, and only toleration may be petitioned, where nothing less
   than empire is designed. The nature of man acts the same way, whether
   in matters civil or ecclesiastical; and can we easily forget the
   methods by which that violent faction grew upon the throne? Did not the
   facility and too fatal mercy of a late prince embolden their impudence,
   instead of satisfying their desires? Was not every concession, every
   remission of his own right, so far from allaying the fury of their
   greedy appetites, that, like a breakfast, it rather called up their
   stomachs, and fitted them for a dinner? Did not craving still grow upon
   granting, till nothing remained to be asked on one side, or given on
   the other, but the life of the owner? Thus it was with the state; and I
   would fain hear any solid reason to prove that it will not happen alike
   to the church: for how has the papacy grown to that surprising height,
   and assumed such an extravagant power over sovereign princes, but by
   taking advantages from their own grants and favours to that see? Which
   still took occasion from them to raise herself gradually to further
   pretences, till courtesy quickly passed into claim, and what was gotten
   by petition was held by prerogative; so that at length insolence, grown
   big and bold with success, knew no bounds, but trampled upon the necks
   of emperors, controlled the sceptre with the crosier, and in the face
   of the world openly avowed a superiority and preeminence over crowned
   heads. Thus grew the papacy; and by the same way will also grow other
   sects; for there is a papacy in every sect or faction; for they all
   design the same height and grandeur, though the pope alone has had the
   fortune to compass it. And thus having shewn what have been the effects
   of such concessions heretofore, as well as described the temper of the
   persons who now press for them, I suppose it will not be very difficult
   for us to judge what are like to be the future effects and consequences
   of the same amongst ourselves: concerning which, I shall lay down this
   assertion; that what effects and consequences any thing had formerly,
   and what in its own nature it tends to, and is apt to produce, it is
   infinitely sottish and irrational to imagine or suppose that it will
   not produce and cause in the world for the future; and, I believe,
   hardly any nation but ours would suffer the same cheat to be trumped
   upon it twice immediately together. Every society in the world subsists
   in the strength of certain laws, customs, and received usages uniting
   the several parts of it into one body. And accordingly the parting with
   any of these laws or customs is a real dissolution of the continuity,
   and consequently a partial destruction of the whole. It certainly
   shakes and weakens all the fabric; and weakness is but destruction
   begun; it tends to it, and naturally ends in it; as every disease of
   the body will be death, and no mischief cures itself. But to pass by
   arguments deduced from the general nature of things, to the same made
   evident to sense in particular instances, let us first of all suppose
   our dissenters to be dealt with upon terms of comprehension, (as they
   call it,) and took into the communion of the church, without submitting
   to the present conditions of its communion, or any necessary obligation
   to obey the established rules of it, then these things must follow.

   First, That men shall come into the national ministry full of their
   covenanting rebellious principles, even keen upon their spirits, and
   such as raised and carried on the late fatal war. Then it will also
   follow, that in the same diocese, sometimes in the very same town, some
   shall use the surplice, and others not; each shall have their parties
   prosecuting one another with the bitterest hatred and animosities; some
   in the same church, and at the same time, shall receive the sacrament
   kneeling, some standing, and others probably sitting; some shall make
   use of the cross in baptism, and others shall not only not use it
   themselves, but also inveigh and preach against those who do; some
   shall preach this part, others that, and some none at all. And where,
   as in cathedrals, they cannot avoid the hearing of it read by others,
   they shall come into the church when it is done, and stepping into the
   pulpit, conceive a long, crude, extemporary prayer, in reproach of all
   those excellent ones just offered up before. Nay, in the same cathedral
   you shall see one prebend in a surplice, another in a long coat or
   tunic, and in performance of the service, some standing up at the
   creed, the doxology, or the reading of the gospel, others sitting, and
   perhaps laughing and winking upon their fellow schismatics in contempt
   of those who practise the decent order of the church: and from hence
   the mischief shall pass to the people, dividing them into parties and
   factions, so that some shall come to the assembly of the saints only to
   hear a favourite preacher, and for ever after be sure to be absent. I
   will "give no countenance, says one, to the formalist; nor will I, says
   another, with much better reason, give ear to the schismatic: all this
   while the church is rent in pieces, and the common enemy gratified. And
   these are some of the effects of comprehension; nor indeed could any
   other be expected from a project so nearly allied to fatal forty-one;
   so that I dare avow, that to bring in comprehension is, in plain terms,
   nothing less than to establish a schism in the church by law, and
   settle a plague in the bowels of it, that shall eat out the very heart
   and soul; so far consume the vitals and spirits of it, that in the
   compass of a very few years, it shall scarce have any visible being or
   subsistence, or so much as the face of a national church to shew.

   But from comprehension let us pass to toleration, that is, from a
   plague within the church to a plague round about it. And is it possible
   for the church to continue sound, or indeed so much as to breathe, in
   either of these cases? Toleration is the very pulling up the
   floodgates, and breaking open the fountains of the great deep, to pour
   in a deluge of wickedness, heresy, and blasphemy upon the church. The
   law of God commands men to profess and practise the Christian religion;
   the law of man, in this case, will bear you out, though of none, or of
   one of your own choice. Therefore, an hundred different religions at
   least shall, with a bare face and a high hand, bid defiance to the
   Christian; some of which, perhaps, shall deny the Godhead of Christ,
   some the reality of his manhood, some the resurrection, and others the
   torments of hell. Some shall assert the eternity of the world, and the
   like, and all this by authentic allowance of law. Upon this footing, it
   shall be safe for every broacher of new heresy to gain as many
   proselytes to it as he can; and there is none of them all, though never
   so absurd, impious, and blasphemous, but shall have proselytes and
   professors more or less; and what a large part of the nation must this
   necessarily draw in! So that as number and novelty easily run down
   truth and paucity for a while, the orthodox part of the nation, the
   church, will quickly be borne down, and swallowed up. And since it is
   impossible for government or society to subsist where there is no bond
   or cement of religion to hold it together, confusion must needs follow.
   And since it is equally impossible for confusion to last long, but that
   it must at last settle into something, that will and must be popery,
   infallibly, irresistibly; for the church of England being once extinct,
   no other sect or church has any bottom or foundation, or indeed any
   tolerable pretence to set up upon, but that. And that this deduction of
   things is neither inconsequent nor precarious, we may be assured from
   the papists themselves; for did not their late agent, who lost his life
   in their service, and whose letters are so well known, tell us in one
   of them, "that the way by which he intended to have popery brought in
   was by toleration; and that if an act for a general liberty of
   conscience could be obtained, it would give the greatest blow to the
   protestant religion here that ever it received since its birth? Did he
   not also complain, that all their disappointments, miseries, and
   hazards were owing to the fatal revocation, (as he calls it,) of the
   king's declaration for liberty of conscience?" And lastly, does he not
   affirm, "that all the advantage they expected to make was by the help
   of the nonconformists, presbyterians, independents, and other sects?" I
   purposely use his own words; and shall we not think that the papists
   themselves knew what were the properest and most effectual means for
   the prosecution of their own interests? So that let all our separatists
   and dissenters know that they themselves are the pope's artificers, to
   carry on his work, and do that for him, which he cannot do for himself.
   They are his harbingers and forerunners, to prepare and make plain a
   way for him to come amongst us. Thus they, even they, who are the most
   clamorous declaimers against popery, are the surest and most
   industrious factors for it. It is the weakening the church of England
   by their separation from it, and their invectives against it, which
   gives Rome a handle to attack it, thus weakened to her hands, with
   victory and success. The thief first breaks the hedge of the vineyard,
   to filch away, perhaps, but a few clusters, but the wild boar enters
   the same breach, and makes havock of all.

   As for the church of England, whatsoever fate may attend it, this may
   and must be said of it, that it is a church which claims no independent
   secular power, but, like a poor orphan, exposed naked and friendless to
   the world, pretends to no other help but the goodness of God, the piety
   of its principles, and the justice of its own cause to maintain it. A
   church not born into the world with teeth and talons, like popery and
   presbytery, but like a lamb, innocent and defenceless and silent, not
   only under the shearer, but under the butcher too; a church which, as
   it is obedient to the civil powers, without any treacherous
   distinctions or reserves, so would be glad to have the countenance and
   protection of that power; and though it cannot be protected by it, is
   yet resolved to be peaceable and quiet under it; and while it parts
   with all, to hold fast its integrity. And if God should, for the
   nation's unworthy and ungrateful usage of so excellent a church, so
   pure, so peaceable a religion, bereave us of it, by letting in the
   tyranny and superstition of another, it is pity but it should come in
   its full force and power. And then I hope that such as have betrayed
   and enslaved their country, will consider, that there is a temporal as
   well as ecclesiastical interest concerned in the case; that there are
   lands to be converted as well as heretics; and those who pretend they
   can with a word's speaking change the substance of some things, can
   with as much ease alter the properties of others. God's will be done in
   all things; but if popery ever comes in by English hands, we need not
   doubt but it will fully pay the score of those who bring it in.

   3dly. I come now to the third and last thing proposed, which was to
   shew what influence and efficacy a strict adherence to the
   constitutions of the church, and an absolute refusal to part with any
   of them, is like to have upon the settlement of the church, and the
   purity of the gospel amongst us; and for this I shall point out three
   ways, by which it tends effectually to procure such a settlement.

   First, By being the grand and most sovereign means to cause and
   preserve unity in the church. The Psalmist mentions this as one of the
   noblest and greatest excellencies of the Jewish church, Psalm cxxii. 3,
   that it was built as a city that is at unity in itself. Unity gives
   strength, and strength continuance. The catholics abroad frequently
   tell us, that if we could be united amongst ourselves, we should be a
   formidable church indeed; and for this reason there was none they so
   mortally hated, as the late renowned archbishop and martyr, whose whole
   endeavour was to establish a settled uniformity in all the British
   churches. For his zeal and activity in which glorious attempt, the
   presbyterians cut him off, according to the papists' hearts' desire.
   Now a resolution to keep all the constitutions of the church, the parts
   of its society, and conditions of its communion, entire, without
   lopping any of them, must needs unite all the ministers and members of
   it, while it engages them (as the apostle so passionately exhorts his
   Corinthians, 1 Cor. i. 10) to speak all the same thing: but if any one
   is indulged in the omission of the least thing enjoined, they cannot be
   said to speak all the same thing. In which case, besides the deformity
   of the thing itself, that where the worship is the same, the manner of
   performing it should be so different; this difference of practice will
   also certainly produce an irreconcileable division of minds, since such
   diversity cannot be imagined to proceed from any other thing than an
   opinion that one man understands and does his duty after a better and
   more spiritual manner than another, and consequently has the start of
   his neighbour or fellow-minister, either in point of judgment or
   devotion, in neither of which are men to allow precedency, especially
   when it comes once to be contested. Unity without uniformity, is like
   essence without existence, a mere word and a notion, and no where to be
   found in nature.

   2dly, A strict adherence to the constitutions of the church is a direct
   way to settle it, by begetting in her enemies themselves an opinion of
   the goodness and requisiteness of those ways, for which they see the
   government and ministry of the church so concerned, that they can by no
   means be brought to recede from them. Let factious persons pretend what
   they will outwardly, yet they cannot but reason with themselves
   inwardly, that certainly there must be something more than ordinary in
   those things, that men of parts, reason, and good lives so strenuously
   contend for, and so tenaciously adhere to. For it is not natural to
   suppose that serious men will or can be resolute for trifles, fight for
   straws, and encounter the fiercest opposition for such things, as all
   the interests of piety and religion may be equally provided for,
   whether the church retains or parts with them. This is unnatural and
   impious: and on the other side, let none think the people will have any
   reverence for that, for which the pastors of the church themselves shew
   an indifference. And here let me mention a great, but sad truth, not so
   fit to be spoke, as to be sighed out by every true son and lover of the
   church, that the wounds the church of England now bleeds by, she has
   received in the house of her friends, her false, undermining friends;
   and that nonconformity, and a separation from it, and a contempt of the
   excellent constitution of it, have proceeded from nothing more than
   from the partial, treacherous, half-conformity of many of its own
   ministers; the surplice sometimes worn, and oftener laid aside; the
   liturgy so read, as if they were ashamed of it; the service so
   curtailed, as if the people were to have but the tenths of that for
   which they paid their own tenths; the ecclesiastical habit neglected,
   the sacrament indecently administered, the furniture of the altar
   abused, and the table of the Lord profaned. These and the like vile
   passages have made many nonconformists to the church, by their
   conformity to their minister. It was an observation of a judicious
   prelate, that of all the sorts of enemies that the church had, there
   were none so devilish and pernicious, and likely to prove so fatal to
   it, as the conforming puritan. It was a great truth, and not long after
   ratified by dreadful experience; for if you would know what the
   conforming puritan is, he is one that lives by the altar, and turns his
   back upon it; one that catches at the preferments of the church, but
   hates the discipline and orders of it. One that practices conformity as
   popery, takes oaths and tests with an inward abhorrence of what he does
   for the present, and a resolution to act quite contrary when occasion
   serves. One who during his conformity will be sure to be known by such
   a distinguishing badge as shall point him out to and secure his credit
   with the fanatical brotherhood. One that still declines reading the
   church-service himself, leaving the work to curates and readers,
   thereby to keep up an advantageous interest with thriving, seditious
   tradesmen, and groaning, ignorant, but rich widows; one that in the
   midst of conformity thinks of a turn, and is careful to behave himself
   as not to outshoot his home, but to stand right and fair, in case a
   revolution should bring fanaticism again into fashion, which it is more
   than possible he secretly wishes for.

   These and the like are the principles that act and govern the
   conforming puritan; who, in a word, is nothing else but ambition,
   avarice, and hypocrisy, serving all the real interests of schism and
   faction in the church's livery.

   Now if there be any such here, (as I hope there are none,) however he
   may sooth up and flatter himself, yet when he hears of such and such of
   his neighbours, parishioners, or acquaintance running to conventicles,
   such and such turned quakers, others fallen off to popery; and lastly,
   when the noise of the dreadful national disturbances and dangers shall
   ring about his ears, let him lay his hand upon his heart and say, "It
   is I, that by conforming by halves, and by treacherously prevaricating
   with my duty, so solemnly sworn to; I, that by bringing a contempt upon
   the service and order of the purest and best constituted church in the
   world, slabbering over the one, and slighting the other, have
   scandalized and tossed a stumblingblock before the neighbourhood, and
   have been the cause of this man's faction, that man's quakerism, the
   other's popery, and thereby have in my proportion contributed to those
   convulsions that now so terribly shake and threaten both church and
   state." I say, let him take his share of this horrid guilt, for God and
   man must lay it at his door; it is the genuine result of his actions;
   it is his own; and will stick faster and closer to him, than to be
   thrown off by him like his surplice.

   Thirdly and lastly, a strict adherence to the rules of the church,
   without yielding to any abatement in favour of the dissenters, is the
   way to settle and establish it, by possessing its enemies with an awful
   esteem of the conscience and courage of the governors and ministers of
   it. For if the things under debate be given up to the adversary, it
   must be upon one of these two accounts; either,

   1st, That the persons who thus yield them up judge them unfit to be
   retained; or,

   2dly, That they find themselves not able to retain them. One or both of
   these of necessity must be implied in such a yieldance. In the first
   case then our dissenters will cry out, Where has been the conscience of
   our church-governors for so many years in imposing and insisting on
   those things, which they themselves now acknowledge and confess not fit
   to be insisted upon? And is not this at once to own all the libellous
   charges and invectives which the nonconformists have been so long
   pursuing our church with? Is not this to fling dirt upon the government
   of it, ever since the reformation? Nay, does not the same dirt fall
   upon the very reformers themselves, who first put our church into that
   order it is in at present, and died for it when they had done? Such
   therefore as are disposed to humour these dissenters, by giving up any
   of the constitutions of our church, should do well to consider what and
   how much is imported by such an act; and this they shall find to be no
   less than a tacit acknowledgment of the truth and justice of all those
   pleas by which our adversaries have been contending for such a cession
   all along. The truth is, it will do a great deal towards the removal of
   the charge of schism from their doors to ours, by representing the
   grounds of their separation from us hitherto lawful at the least. For
   the whole state of the matter between us lies in a very little compass;
   that either the church of England enjoins something unlawful as the
   condition of her communion, and then she is schismatical; or there is
   nothing unlawful enjoined by her, and then those that separate from her
   are schismatics: and till they prove that the church of England
   requires of such as communicate with her, either the belief of
   something false, or the practice of something impious, it is impossible
   to prove the unlawfulness of those things that she makes the condition
   of her communion, and consequently to free those that separate from the
   charge of schism.

   Now while this is the persuasion of the governors of our church
   concerning these things, the world cannot but look upon them in their
   unmoveable adherence to them, as acting like men of conscience, and,
   which is next to it, like men of courage. The reputation of which two
   qualities in our bishops will do more to the daunting the church's
   enemies, than all their concessions can do to the reconciling of them.
   Courage awes an enemy, and backed with conscience, confounds him. He
   that has law on his side, and resolves not to yield, takes the
   directest way to be yielded to. For where an enemy sees resolution, he
   supposes strength; but to yield is to confess weakness, and
   consequently to embolden opposition. And I believe it will be one day
   found, that nothing has contributed more to make the dissenting
   nonconforming party considerable, than their being thought so. It has
   been our courting and treating with them, that has made them stand upon
   their own terms, instead of coming over to ours. And here I shall shut
   up this consideration with one remark, and it is about the council of
   Trent. The design of which council, in all the princes that were so
   earnest for the calling it, was to humble and reduce the power of the
   papacy; and great and fierce opposition was made against it all along
   by the prelates and ambassadors of those princes; but so far were they
   from prevailing, that the papacy weathered out the storm, and fixed
   itself deeper and stronger than ever it was before. But what method did
   it take thus to settle itself? Why, in a word, no other than a positive
   resolution not to yield or part with any thing; not to give way either
   to the importunity or plausible exceptions, nor, which is more, to the
   power of those princes. So that (as the writer of the history of the
   council observes) notwithstanding all those violent blusters and
   assaults made on every side against the papal power, yet in the end the
   patience and resolution of the legates overcame all.; -:

   Now what may we gather from hence? Why surely this very naturally; that
   if courage and resolution should be of such force to support a bad
   cause, it cannot be of less to maintain and carry on a good one; and if
   this could long prop up a rotten building, that had no foundation, why
   may it not only strengthen, but even perpetuate that which has so firm
   an one as the church of England stands upon? And now, to sum up all,
   could St. Paul find it necessary to take such a peremptory course with
   those erroneous dissenters in the church of Galatia, as not to give
   place to them, no, not for an hour; and is it not more necessary for
   us, where the pretences for schism are less plausible, and the persons
   perverted by it more numerous? Let us briefly lay together the reasons
   and arguments why we should deal with our dissenters as St. Paul did
   with those, not to give them place at all, because,

   1st, By our yielding, or giving place to them, we have no rational
   ground to conclude we shall gain them, but rather encourage them to
   encroach upon us by further demands; since the experience of all
   governments have found concessions so far from quieting dissenters,
   that they have only animated them to greater and fiercer contentions.

   2dly, By our yielding or giving place to them, we make the established
   laws (in which these men can neither prove injustice nor inexpedience)
   submit to them, who in duty, reason, and conscience, are bound to obey
   those laws.

   3dly, By our yielding or giving place to them, we grant to those, who
   being themselves in power, never thought it reasonable to grant the
   same to others in the same case.

   4thly, By our yielding or giving place to them, we bring a pernicious,
   incurable evil into the church, if it be by a comprehension; or spread
   a fatal contagion round about it, if it be by toleration.

   5thly, By our yielding to these men in a way of comprehension, we bring
   those into the church who once destroyed and pulled it down as unlawful
   and unchristian, and never yet renounced the principles by which they
   did so; nor (is it to be feared) ever will.

   6thly, By such a comprehension we endeavour to satisfy those persons
   who could never yet agree among themselves about any one thing or
   constitution in which they would all rest satisfied.

   7thly, By indulging them this way we act partially, in gratifying one
   sect, who can pretend to no favour, but what others may as justly claim
   who are not comprehended; and withal imprudently, in indulging one
   party who will do us no good, to the exasperation of many more who have
   a greater power to do us hurt.

   8thly, By such a concession we sacrifice the constitutions of our
   church to the will and humour of those whom the church has no need of,
   neither their abilities, parts, piety, or interest, nor any thing else
   belonging to them considered.

   9thly and lastly, By such a course we open the mouths of the Romish
   party against us; who will still be reproaching us for going from their
   church to a constitution that we ourselves now think fit to relinquish,
   by altering her discipline and the terms of her communion; and may
   justly ask us where, and in what kind of church or constitution we
   intend finally to fix.

   These, among many more, are the reasons why we contend, that our
   dissenters are not to be given place to.

   But after all this, may it not be asked, whether it were not better to
   submit to the aforementioned inconveniences, rather than the church
   should be utterly ruined? To this I answer, that the case is
   fallaciously put, and supposes that if these things were submitted to,
   the church will not be ruined, which I deny; and upon the foregoing
   grounds affirm it to be much more probable that it will. To which I
   add, that of the two, it is much better that the church should be run
   down by a rude violence overpowering it, than be given up by our own
   act and consent. For the first can only take away its revenues, and
   discourage or suppress the public exercise of its discipline, but
   cannot destroy its constitutions; the latter does. The former will be
   our calamity; but the latter, being the effect of our own consent, will
   render us inexcusable to all, both our friends and enemies, and
   ourselves too; and in the midst of our desolation, leave us not so much
   as the conscience of a good cause to comfort us.

   To explain which by instance: Suppose the land overrun by a foreign
   invasion, yet still the body of the laws of England may be said to
   remain entire, though the execution of them be superseded: but if they
   be cancelled by act of parliament, they cease to be, or to be called
   any longer, the laws of England. In like manner, if our
   church-governors and the clergy concur not to the disannulling of the
   canons, rules, and orders of the church, the constitution of it will
   still remain, though the condition of it be obscured by persecution,
   and perhaps disabled from shewing itself in a national body; just as it
   fared with it in the late rebellion: and who knows, but if force and
   rapine should again bring it into the same condition, the goodness of
   God may again give it the like resurrection: but if we surrender it up
   ourselves, to us it is dead, and past all recovery.

   And therefore what remains now, but that we implore the continued
   protection of the Almighty upon a church, by such a miracle restored to
   us, and (all things considered) by as great a miracle preserved
   hitherto amongst us, that he would defeat its enemies, and increase its
   friends; and settle it upon such foundations of purity, peace, and
   order, that the gates of hell may not prevail against it.

The certainty of a judgment after this life.

A SERMON

  PREACHED AT ST. MARY'S, OXON.
     __________________________________________________________________

  2 COR. v. 10.

   We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one
   may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done,
   whether it be good or bad.

   BESIDES instruction and exhortation, which have never been wanting (at
   least in this last age) to those of this church, there are but two ways
   or means more, in the ordinary course of divine Providence, by which
   the reasonable creature is to be wrought upon; I mean, by which man is
   either to be taken off from the forbidden evil he is inclined to, or
   drawn to the commanded good he is averse from; and those two are, the
   hope of a reward for one, and the fear of punishment for the other;
   that those who have neither ingenuity nor gratitude, nor will be
   allured to piety and obedience by the fruition of God's mercies, may
   yet, out of a self-love at least, and impatience of suffering, be
   frighted from disobedience and profaneness by feeling of God's
   judgments. And truly, if we of this nation had been so ingenuous and
   well-natured a people as that the former of these (I mean God's
   mercies) would have prevailed with us, we had long since been inwardly
   the best, as we were outwardly the happiest, of all nations. For never
   was there any people, since the creation of mankind, that enjoyed, for
   so long time together, so many of God's mercies of all kinds and
   degrees, and that with so many aggravating circumstances to improve and
   endear them to us, as we did, whilst, for almost a century together,
   God courted us and wooed us, as it were, without interruption or inter
   mission, by word and deed, by peace and plenty, and by all sorts both
   of temporal and spiritual expressions of his love, which were possible
   for a Creator to make to a creature: so that what God said once to the
   church and nation of the Jews, he might have said unto us not long
   since, Isaiah v. 4, viz. What could I have done more unto my vineyard?
   What could I have done more, in love and kindness to the church of
   England, than I have done? Why should you be used kindly any more? You
   will revolt more, you will but abuse my goodness, and weary my
   patience, and turn my grace into wantonness, as much or more hereafter
   than you have done already. And therefore God having, according to his
   usual method, first, and so long, tried all fair means to win us and
   keep us to him, and all in vain, (most of us still growing the worse
   the better we were used by him,) he was compelled at last, (after many
   warnings and threatenings to no purpose,) he was compelled, I say, (for
   he delights not in the affliction of any creature,) to make use of his
   other, and that which is usually his most effectual, way of working
   upon man, I mean, the way of his judgments; and that, first, by taking
   away all his blessings, which we had so long and so unthankfully
   abused; and secondly, by making us feel, what we would not fear, the
   power and effects of his wrath, which we had before so often and so
   long provoked and despised; so that the measure of the afflictions we
   lately suffered, though it will still fall short of the measure of our
   sins, yet is it correspondent, in many respects, to the measure of that
   happiness we formerly enjoyed; our peace being turned into war, our
   plenty into scarcity, our health into sickness, our strength into
   weakness, our religion into hypocrisy on the one side, and profaneness
   on the other; and we ourselves, who before had nothing almost to wish
   for, had, in those times, nothing almost that we could hope for, being
   then the object of scorn or pity, who were before the object of envy
   and admiration to all our neighbouring kingdoms. And now one would
   believe the dismal account of those times, which our own sins brought
   upon us, should have some good effect on our lives and conversations;
   one would think, I say, that, if our foreheads were not of brass, our
   necks iron, and our hearts adamant, we should either have been bended
   or broken with these sufferings; and that the bitterness of our
   punishment would by this time have so far exceeded the sweetness of our
   sins, that we should willingly have quitted the one, upon condition we
   might have been (as certainly we should have been) delivered from the
   other. But alas! such is commonly either the blindness of our minds,
   the hardness of our hearts, or the searedness of our consciences, or
   rather the spiritual lethargy (as I may so term it) of our souls, that
   most of us sleep in as great security in the midst of all manner of
   judgments, as Jonas did in the midst of that storm which his own
   disobedience had raised. Or if perhaps we are awake with our eyes, yet
   our hearts, as Nabal's was, are dead within us. So that to all our
   other miseries this plague, which is the greatest any man can have in
   this world, is added also; I mean, that seeing, we should not see; and
   hearing, we should not hear; and understanding, we should not perceive;
   nay, that even feeling, we should not feel, or at least not feel what
   most hurts us, or what indeed was, is, and will be, the true and only
   cause of our sufferings. Whence it comes to pass, that very few of us
   are, like David, the better, but many thousands of us, like Ahaz, the
   worse, since we were afflicted; having, like the ground, often drank up
   both the former and latter rain; the former of God's mercies, and the
   latter of his judgments; and yet bring forth nothing but briers and
   thorns, nothing but hypocrisy and profaneness; and consequently must
   needs be (as the ground was) nigh unto cursing, and I pray God our end
   be not burning: For to men so heavily plagued, and yet for all that so
   incorrigibly wicked, as many of us are, what remains but (as St. Paul
   tells us) a fearful expectation of judgment? And by judgment he means
   not any temporal or worldly judgment, but the conclusion, or rather
   consummation, of all our miseries here, with hell and damnation itself
   hereafter. And indeed it is the fearful expectation of that future
   judgment, or nothing, that must work upon obstinate offenders. The
   truth is, our spiritual lethargy is not curable but by a spiritual
   fever, and it must be the horror of an awakened and affrighted
   conscience that must melt and mollify the hardness of our hearts. And
   therefore have I made choice of this argument to discourse on at this
   time, as being persuaded that, if any thing at all will humble us, it
   must be the apprehension of and meditation on the last judgment; and
   this, I hope, by God's blessing, may be effectual in some measure to
   this purpose; for surely no man can be so fast asleep in his sins, but
   the sounding of the last trumpet in his ears may startle him; neither
   can any man be running so fast or so furiously in the broad way that
   leadeth to destruction, but the flashing of hell-fire in his face may
   put him to a stand. And therefore let all profane persons or
   hypocrites, that live in any known sin or evil course of life, attend
   with fear and trembling to this most terrible and yet most infallible
   oracle of the great God. For we must all appear before the
   judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in
   his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

   These words I shall not now consider (as they may be) as matter of
   consolation to the righteous; but only, upon this occasion, handle them
   in the severer sense, or that of terror only: and from these words thus
   considered I shall endeavour, (waving all needless criticisms,)

   1st, To convince every man's conscience that there shall be indeed such
   an appearance, or such a general trial or doom of all mankind after
   this life, as is here spoken of.

   2dly, I shall try to make clear to every one of our understandings what
   manner of appearance, or trial, this shall be; as also before whom, and
   in what form of proceeding, together with the issue, effects, and
   consequences of it.

   3dly and lastly, I will, by way of application, do my best endeavour to
   work upon every man's affections, by shewing you how much all men, (of
   what quality and condition soever they are,) especially the wicked and
   ungodly, are concerned in it; and consequently how much it imports all
   men, especially such men, to think upon it and prepare for it, that, by
   a timely repentance, they may prevent the woful effects of it. To begin
   then with the

   First of these general heads, in which I am to convince every man's
   conscience that there shall be indeed such an appearance, or such a
   general trial or doom of all mankind, after this life, as is here
   spoken of; neither let any man think this purpose unnecessary or
   superfluous, as if it supposed a doubt, where none was, by making a
   question of a principle; for though the affirmative of this proposition
   (viz. that there shall be certainly such a doom or judgment after this
   life) be, or ought to be, a principle undeniable, indisputable, and
   consequently unquestionable, amongst such as are truly Christians, yet
   because, as St. Paul says of the Jews, all are not Jews that are Jews
   outwardly, so may I say too, that all are not Christians neither that
   are so outwardly; and because many pretend to be of the church that
   hardly believe all the articles of her Creed; lastly, because there are
   some amongst us that do not only live, but talk, as if they thought
   there were no account to be given of their sayings or doings after this
   life, or at least as if they either doubted or had forgotten this
   truth: for the satisfaction of all it is therefore expedient to rescue
   from disbelief and contempt this fundamental article of our Creed, viz.
   that Christ shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead. For
   proof of this proposition against such as deny it, I desire only this
   fair postulatum, the acknowledgment of that truth, which is ordinarily
   acquirable by the light of nature herself, viz. that there is a God, or
   such a power as made us, and observes our actions; and granting this
   conclusion, I question not but to make it appear even to the most
   profane persons, and that from the dictates of their own reason,
   together with such notions as they have or may have of the Deity by the
   light of nature itself, that there shall be a trial or judgment of all
   men after this life, for the things that all and every one of them have
   done here. in the flesh, and that,

   1st, Because it is very agreeable to the nature of God.

   2dly, Because it is also very consonant to the nature of the soul of
   man.

   3dly, Because it is necessary for the manifestation of the divine
   justice.

   4thly, Because the inequality and disproportion between actions and
   events; merits and rewards, men's parts and their fortunes here in this
   life, doth seem to require and exact such a judgment.

   5thly, Because there is an inbred notion, or natural instinct and
   apprehension in all men, that there will be such a judgment.

   And 1st, The truth of this doctrine is very applicable to the nature of
   God; for what can be more agreeable to the nature of the most pure and
   powerful agent, than to draw and unite unto itself whatsoever is like
   itself, as likewise to separate and remove from itself whatsoever is
   unlike itself? Now what is like God, but that which is good? and what
   unliker him than evil? And what is it to unite the one to himself, but
   to reward? or to separate and remove the other, but to punish? And yet
   we see God neither rewards all the good, nor punishes all the wicked in
   this world: there must be therefore a time hereafter, when both the one
   and the other shall be performed, and that time is what I call the last
   judgment.

   2dly, The truth of this doctrine is very agreeable to the nature of the
   soul of man, because otherwise the chief agent both in good and evil
   should have little or no reward for the one, and little or no
   punishment for the other. For the principal or chief agent in all our
   actions (whether they be good or bad) is the soul; the body is but an
   organized instrument, or at most but an accessary in either. And yet
   all rewards and punishments appointed for good and evil by laws in this
   life, are bodily and sensual, at least I am sure they are finite, and
   mortal, and consequently no way suitable or proportionable to the
   spiritual, immaterial, and immortal nature of the soul. That therefore
   the chief agent or principal in all actions may have its reward or
   punishment proportionable and adequate to its own nature, it is
   necessary that at one time or other there should be an inquisition and
   judgment, whose effects, whether good or bad, may be spiritual and
   everlasting. Now if a judgment producing such effects cannot be here in
   this life, it must therefore necessarily be in another hereafter.

   3dly, It is not only requisite, but necessary, that there should be a
   judgment after this life for the manifestation of the divine justice:
   for though whatsoever God doth is just, and that because God does it,
   yet does it not always appear to be so. Now God is not only just in
   himself, but will appear to be so to others, and will have his justice
   confessed and acknowledged, at one time or other, by the hearts and
   consciences of all men. And though the Creator is not obliged to
   account to the creature for the manner how, or the reason why, he doth
   any thing; yet if he will have the creature convinced of a thing, that
   it is so or so, he must needs some way or other, or at some time or
   other, make it appear to the creature that it is so; and therefore I
   say for this reason it is necessary, that at some time or other there
   should be a general, a public, and a formal trial, wherein the actions
   of every particular man should be discovered to all in general, both
   angels and men; that so the actions being compared with the issue, and
   the merit balanced with the reward, God might (as the apostle says,
   Rom. iii. 4.) be justified when he judgeth, whether he absolves or
   condemns, and that not only by those that stand by, and are but the
   hearers of it, but even by those themselves that are judged. One of the
   main ends therefore, (as I humbly conceive,) why God hath appointed a
   day to judge all the world, (as the apostle speaks, Acts xvii. 31,) is,
   to give the whole world satisfaction, or to convince men and angels,
   whether they be good or bad, of the exact and precise integrity and
   impartiality of the divine justice in all and every one of the acts and
   effects of it. And hence it is, that this general doom is called in
   scripture, the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
   or the day wherein God will reveal and make it appear, that all his
   ways and all his judgments are righteous: though the very being of a
   God implies holiness and power, and consequently justice, yet the ways
   and means God makes use of to shew that infinite justice are not always
   obvious; though we know by his nature it is impossible for him to be
   unjust, yet are there some things, in which, though we search ever so
   diligently for the manner how they come to pass; yet I am apt to
   believe them beyond the capacity of human nature, and the measure even
   of divine revelation on this side the grave; for example, that for the
   offence of one, condemnation came upon all men, or that all men became
   liable to eternal wrath, because one man had eaten the forbidden fruit,
   is what we ought to deem exact truth, as consonant to express
   scripture; that the misery of all for the sin of one would be a most
   just punishment, if God should inflict it; but then we may believe
   likewise, that the reasons of God's justice in both these particulars
   are superior to the comprehension of mortality, and not now fathomable.
   The like may be said in regard of the punishment of finite and temporal
   sin with infinite and eternal torment; which though it be true, that it
   shall be so, and consequently just that it should be so; yet I believe
   it would perplex the wisest man living to give a satisfactory answer
   (according to our notions of equity and justice) how in equity or
   justice it can be so. And therefore in regard of these, and such other
   dusno'eta, or hard truths as these are, it is, that St. Paul, (though
   bred at the feet of Gamaliel, and wrapt up into the third heaven, and
   consequently knowing as much or more of God than ever man did,) cries
   out, as one overwhelmed in admiration and astonishment, Rom. xi. 33, O
   the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how
   unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! But at
   the day of judgment, the reason and equity even of these, and of all
   other now seeming hard sayings, shall be disclosed to us, that the
   righteousness of all God's ways, and the impartiality of his dealings
   with the sons of men, may be so clearly manifested to all, that the
   very reprobates themselves shall be forced to see and acknowledge their
   own damnation to be most just, both in regard to the duration and
   intenseness of it, having not so much as the comfort of an excuse, nor
   any thing to accuse or complain of, but their own folly and fault for
   their destruction. And thus you see, in the third place, the necessity
   of a judgment after this life, for the satisfaction of the world, for
   the conviction of the wicked, and consequently for the full and perfect
   manifestation of the divine justice.

   4thly, The strange disproportion and unsuitableness betwixt actions and
   events, merits and rewards, men's parts and their fortune here in this
   life, doth seem to exact, as it were, at the hands of a righteous God,
   that there should be a day of an after-reckoning, to rectify this,
   which is in appearance so great a disorder and confusion: and to put a
   real and a visible difference betwixt the evil and the good, the holy
   and the profane; for now there seems to be none at all, it being long
   since the observation of one of the wisest of men, Ecclesiastes ix. 2,
   That all things happen alike unto all: there is one event to the
   righteous, and to the wicked; to the clean, and to the unclean; to him
   that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so
   is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. Nay it
   were well, if it were no worse; but the same wise man tells us, Eccles.
   viii. 14, that there he just men, to whom it happens according to the
   work of the wicked; and there he wicked men, to whom it happens
   according to the work of the righteous: for a just man, says he,
   Eccles. vii. 15, many times perisheth in his righteousness, and a
   wicked man many times prolongs his life in his wickedness. The
   self-evident truth of these propositions cannot be questioned by any
   man (though they were not in holy writ) that sees and observes the
   dispensation of good and bad things in this life. To conclude; we see
   that riches, honour, pleasure, and whatsoever the foolish world calls
   good, they are for the most part and in the greatest measure the
   portion of the worst of men; whereas poverty, pain, and shame, and
   whatever else we usually term evil, are for the most part and in the
   highest degree the lot of the righteous; Dives being a type, as it
   were, of the one, and Lazarus of the other. There must therefore, in
   all reason and equity, be another audit, or time of account after this
   life, to the end that, as Abraham said unto Dives, those that have
   received good things in this life, and been evil, may be tormented; and
   those that have received evil things in this life, and been good, may
   be comforted; for if in this life only good men had hope in Christ,
   they were (as the apostle tells us, 1 Cor. xv. 19) of all men most
   miserable. This argument, drawn from the seeming unequal distribution
   of things here below, I mean the calamity of good men, and the
   prosperity of bad men in this life, is urged by the elder Pliny, and
   some few others of the heathen moralists, to prove the nonexistence of
   a God: for if, say they, there be a God, he must needs be just and
   good; and if he be just and good, he would not, he could not suffer
   good men to be unrewarded, and evil men unpunished; much less could he
   or would he endure, that evil men should thrive in and by their wicked
   courses, and good men fare the worse for their goodness, as in common
   experience we see they do. And truly if my conclusion concerning the
   certainty of a judgment to come after this life were not true, this
   argument of theirs would shrewdly shake the first article and
   foundation of all our creed, viz. the being of a God. But supposing
   such a judgment to come, wherein all good men shall finally and fully
   be rewarded, and all wicked men finally and fully punished, we do at
   once vindicate the power, the wisdom, the providence, the justice, and
   consequently the very being and essence of God, from all blasphemy and
   contradiction, notwithstanding any disproportion or incongruity
   whatever, that is or seems to be between actions and events, merits and
   rewards, men's parts and their fortunes, here in this life. And this is
   the fourth reason, why, granting there is a God, we must necessarily
   grant likewise, that there shall be a day of judgment.

   5thly, The last reason I shall make use of, to necessitate the evidence
   and enforce the truth of the doctrine of a future judgment, is that
   inborn and inbred notion and apprehension, which all men have by
   nature, that there is such a thing, together with the general
   expectation of all men, that there will be such a thing: and this
   reason, how slight soever it may appear to others, to me it seems (what
   I hope I shall make it seem to you also) most effectual and convincing;
   for whatsoever it is that all men think will be, without doubt it shall
   be, because whatsoever all men agree in, is the voice of nature itself,
   and consequently must be true: for the dictates of nature are stronger
   than the probats of reason, I mean of reason not abstracted, but as it
   is in us mortals; and therefore of all other arguments, that which is
   drawn from natural impression and instinct is most forcible and
   concluding, and the knowledge arising from such impression or instinct,
   though it be not so full and perfect, yet it is more certain and
   infallible than any other knowledge whatsoever, arising from a man's
   own fallible discourse and reasoning. I confess indeed that knowledge,
   the produce of instinct and natural impression only, is not so full, so
   perfect, nor perhaps so properly termed knowledge, (because the word
   scire properly denotes per causas scire,) as that which is concluded by
   demonstration, or drawn from an evident connection of one thing with
   another, or a consequence of one thing from another; because when a man
   knows any thing by natural impression or instinct only, he knows not
   the reasons of what he knows; he knows o'ti e'sti, that there is such a
   thing, but not dio'ti e'sti, why it is; no, nor perhaps ti` e'sti, what
   it is; I mean not what it is in the exact or distinct nature of it
   neither; and yet for all that, this knowledge is (as far as it reaches)
   more certain and infallible than any conclusion drawn from our own
   reasoning and discourse can be. 1st, Because this inbred notion, or
   this knowledge which we have of any thing by natural impression or
   instinct, is not (as all other human or acquired knowledge is) a
   conclusion made by us from our own discourse and judgment, which is
   always fallible, or subject unto error; but it is a conclusion made in
   us by nature, or rather by the God of nature himself, who can neither
   deceive nor be deceived; and therefore whatsoever we know in this
   manner, must needs be certain.

   2dly, Because if the knowledge we have by our instinct were not certain
   or infallible, this received, and as yet undoubted maxim both in
   natural philosophy and divinity, viz. That God and nature do nothing in
   vain, would not be true: for if that were not so indeed, which all men
   in general, and every man in particular is naturally inclined to
   believe to be so; then that natural impression or instinct, whereby
   they are inclined to think so, should be planted in them to no purpose;
   the affirmation of which is not only a reproach in nature, but a
   blasphemy against God himself; because indeed that which we call nature
   is but God's ordinary method of working in and by the creature.

   3dly, That the knowledge which is an effect of natural impression or
   instinct is indeed certain and infallible, will easily and clearly
   appear, if we but consider those creatures who have not the use of
   reason, or of instruction, of revelation, of tradition, or of any other
   means of knowledge, (excepting that of sense) but this of instinct or
   natural impression only; and yet we see, that those irrational
   creatures have their knowledge more immediately, more certainly, and
   more infallibly, than any man's deductions from his own discourse and
   reason. For instance, who amongst us is there that doth or can know his
   enemy (after the clearest discovery he can make of him) so certainly,
   or avoid him so suddenly, as the lark doth the hobby at the first
   sight? What sick man, nay, what physician, knows his own disease, and
   the remedy for it so exactly, as the dog knows his vomit, and that
   which will procure it? What husbandman knows his seasons more exactly,
   or observes them more duly or punctually, than the stork, the crane,
   and the swallow? Lastly, (pardon the lowness of the similitude,) what
   landlord or what tenant foresees the ruin of his own house so
   certainly, or avoids it so seasonably, as the vermin his inmates? And
   yet the lark never studied Machiavel, nor the dog Hippocrates, neither
   were the stork, the crane, or the swallow ever taught by natural
   philosophy to distinguish seasons; nor the vermin by judicial astrology
   to foresee casual and contingent events: but it has pleased the
   all-wise and gracious Creator to supply the defects of reason in these
   poor helpless animals, with a knowledge which, though it be not so
   large and perfect, yet it is more certain and infallible, especially in
   those things that are necessary for the preservation of their existence
   and species, than any knowledge attainable by men, by disquisition or
   speculation, because (as I said before) it is a knowledge not gotten
   by, but infused in them by God and nature, who cannot err; and such a
   knowledge as this (I mean for the kind of it) is that which all men
   have of a judgment to come, or of something to be suffered by evil
   doers after this life; a knowledge, I say, which is planted in them,
   and not learned by them, but originally in every man, and universally
   in all men; and whatsoever is so, must needs be taught them by God and
   nature, and consequently cannot be erroneous or uncertain. It is true
   indeed, that some particular men, or some particular sort or sect of
   men, may believe and maintain false and foolish opinions, such as have
   neither solidity of truth in them, nor reality of object without them:
   but then such opinions as these had their creation and production at
   first from some one man's fancy, and from thence derived by education
   and tradition, may afterwards infect many; and thus the opinion and
   practice of idolatry, or the worship of more gods than one, came into
   the world, and spread itself over most part of mankind, for it was not
   so from the beginning. But the dictates and impressions of nature do
   very much differ from conceits or imaginations of fancy, and from
   traditional errors of custom and education; in the first place, because
   the dictates and impressions of nature are not only general in most
   men, but universal in all men; whereas conceits of fancy, and
   traditional errors of custom or education, flowing from thence, though
   they may be, and often are consented to, and believed by many, yet none
   of them ever were or ever will be consented to and believed by all.
   Thus were the philosophers of old, and thus are the Christians at this
   day divided into their several sects and heresies.

   2dly, The dictates and impressions of nature, as they are universally
   in all men, so are they originally in every man without teaching. And
   hence it is that St. Paul tells us, Rom. ii. 14, that the Gentiles that
   had not the law, (he means that were never taught the law as the Jews
   were,) had yet notwithstanding that very law in regard to the
   fundamental notions of piety, justice, and sobriety, written in all and
   every one of their hearts by nature itself, and together with the law,
   by necessary consequence, a belief and expectation of a reward for good
   and punishment for evil after this life; as appears by their
   consciences accusing and excusing them, even for those things which
   were not punishable or rewardable, nor perhaps discernible by any but
   themselves here in this world. Whence it follows, that those notions of
   law and suggestions of conscience (which St. Paul tells us were in all
   the Gentiles without teaching) must needs be dictates and impressions
   of a simple and uncorrupted nature.

   3dly, The dictates and impressions of nature, (in quantum et quatenus,)
   or as far as they are merely from nature, receive neither addition nor
   diminution (as they may do either) from other principles: as they are
   universally in all men without exception, and originally in every man
   without instruction, so are they equally and alike in all men without
   distinction, in the Gentile as well as in the Jew, in the Barbarian as
   well as in the Greek, in the Pagan as well as in the Christian, and in
   those that have no learning, as well as in those that have; whereas
   opinion, arising from conceit of fancy, and knowledge, which is the
   product of human reason, and faith itself, which is an effect of and
   assent to divine revelation, are all of them stronger or weaker, more
   or less in their several subjects, according to the strength, measure,
   and working of the several principles from whence they flow. And
   consequently they are none of them equal in all men, nor any one of
   them equally at all times in those that have them: but the other
   natural, impressive knowledge is quite contrary; such a knowledge as
   this is that apprehension which all men have or would have (if their
   natural impressions were not defaced in them) of a judgment to come, or
   of a reward for the good, and a punishment for the wicked after this
   life; for never was there any good man but hoped for it, or any wicked
   man but at some time or other was afraid of it. In a word, there was
   never in any age in the world, either nation in general, or any one man
   in particular, that owned the being of a God, but he acknowledged a
   judgment to come also; although the notion they perhaps had of it was
   but in a confused and imperfect manner; as appears by those Elysian
   fields, or places of rest and happiness for the good, and Phlegethon
   and Cocytus, those black and burning lakes of fire and brimstone, the
   places of torment for the wicked, after this life; which the poets or
   heathen divines speak of, as the general and received opinion of all
   mankind, together with Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Æacus, which were to be
   the judges; Alecto, Megara, and Tisiphone, the fiends or furies which
   were to be the tormentors of the damned. This, I say, was the general
   and the constant doctrine and opinion of the heathen, which was
   registered, but not invented by the poets; being indeed in substance
   the same which we Christians are now taught more perfectly by divine
   revelation, but was always instilled by nature itself, though more
   obscurely and imperfectly, into all mankind. Nay, those very men
   themselves, who both by their words and actions would make others
   believe that they believed no God, do many times shake and tremble upon
   the apprehension and expectation of some terrible thing or other that
   is to come; so that whilst they deny a judge with their mouths, they
   acknowledge a judgment in their hearts. And indeed bad men are not
   always so bold as they would seem to be, nor so little afraid of God as
   they would have the world think they are. For of all men, these
   atheists, that would be, whenever they are in any great extremity or
   danger, have the poorest, the basest, and the most dejected spirits.
   Give me a man of the coldest and softest constitution, and let him be
   but innocent, and he shall look death (I mean a present, an evident, a
   deliberate, and an unavoidable death) with more courage and bravery in
   the face, than a man of the most fiery temper and most exalted spirit,
   if he be a villain, or guilty of any horrid or heinous crime. And what
   is or can be the reason of this, but that one is secure, and the other
   is afraid of some terrible thing after death, which can be no other but
   that general doom or judgment we now speak of, the harbinger or
   forerunner whereof hath taken up his lodging in the breasts and bosoms
   of all men; and that is conscience, which hath always (unless it be
   asleep, or seared, as St. Paul calls it, with an hot iron) one of its
   eyes upon sin here, and the other upon punishment hereafter; which
   whosoever tells me he does not believe, he must pardon me, if I tell
   him again, that I do not believe him; for it is impossible that those
   inborn characters, that handwriting of God and nature, I mean that
   innate impression or instinct which all men have of a future reward or
   punishment, should be utterly blotted out of any man; forgotten
   perhaps, or not thought upon, or defaced, it may be, but absolutely
   lost and annihilated it cannot be: and therefore if there be any man
   afraid or loath to own this truth, he betrays a secret belief of it by
   his fears; or if he do not now, he will do so at some time or other
   hereafter. But against this which has been said it may be objected,
   that if the belief of a judgment to come were, as I affirm it to be, an
   effect of natural impression or instinct, then it would be universally
   equal in all, and consequently equal in every one of the same kind; for
   we see, say they, that all larks are equally afraid of the hobby, and
   every particular lark as much at one time as at another. Besides, it is
   apparent, that all men do not equally believe this truth; nay, it is to
   be feared, that some men do not believe it at all; and of those who do,
   some believe it at one time more, and less at another. And therefore
   that this belief of a judgment to come (in whomsoever it is) is the
   effect of some other cause, and not of natural impression or instinct.
   To this objection I answer, that it is true indeed, that all inbred and
   inborn impressions or instincts are universally and constantly equal in
   all particulars of the same kind; and always continue to be so in those
   creatures which are not capable of either infection from without or
   corruption from within. And such are all living creatures, besides man;
   which neither sway the rule of nature, nor are swerved from it, but are
   always constantly and equally guided by it, as having no other
   principle from without to corrupt or control it. But with men it is far
   otherwise; for in them those notions of nature that are born with them
   may and do receive augmentation or diminution, alteration or corruption
   from some other principles either without us or within us. For
   instance, those inborn notions, that there is a God, that there will be
   a reward for those that live well, and a punishment for those that live
   ill, and that we should do unto others as we would have others do unto
   us, and the like, may and do receive augmentation from divine
   revelation, and from right reason, and from a good, either religious or
   moral education and conversation; so that what was imprinted in us by
   nature may be and is improved and confirmed in us by other principles;
   and therefore I will not deny, but a Christian may have a more constant
   and more confirmed and more perfect knowledge both of a God and of a
   judgment to come, and of that fundamental equity which ought to be
   betwixt one man and another, than he that hath no knowledge of these
   and the like things, but by the light of nature only. And by the same
   reason one Christian may have a more constant, distinct, and perfect
   knowledge of the same truths than another Christian, according as the
   one may be more or less enlightened by those higher principles than the
   other, or may make a better or a worse use of them. Again: as the
   knowledge we have by instinct may be augmented and improved, confirmed
   and perfected; so it may be lessened and weakened, defaced and
   corrupted; nay, and for a time so obscured, as it may seem both to
   ourselves and others to be quite extinguished, and that either by our
   own depraved reason, together with our perverse will and affections
   from within us, or by an evil education, or a worse conversation from
   without us, which many times infuse such opinions (both concerning God
   and ourselves) into us, as are quite contrary to and destructive of our
   first notions; and yet because they are more suitable to our perverse
   will and affections, they are frequently received and defended by our
   depraved reason against the light of nature itself. As a man may easily
   perceive, that will but read attentively the first and second chapters
   of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, where the apostle having laid it
   down for an undoubted conclusion, that the law, (he means the moral
   law,) or the fundamental notions of our duty towards God and man, was
   written by nature in the heart of all the Gentiles, and has proved it
   to be so, because their consciences did justify them when they did
   well, and accuse them when they did ill; yet he affirms likewise, that
   this very law (though written in their hearts by nature) was so
   obscured, and almost quite erased from their judgment, by their more
   perverse wills and affections, that as they worshipped beasts for God,
   so they made beasts of themselves, and behaved themselves worse than
   beasts to one another. This behaviour does no way invalidate the
   forcibleness of this argument, but rather intimates a deep stupefaction
   by a long, inveterate habit of ill, fallen on their minds. So that, to
   conclude this point, there may be and is a natural knowledge in all men
   of a future judgment, as well as the existence of a God; though in some
   perhaps the impression of either of these truths is not always active
   or operative; for we see that some men are grown to such a habit of
   sensuality, or brutality, that they do nothing almost according to
   reason; and yet I hope that no man will from thence conclude, that such
   men are not reasonable creatures, or that they have no such natural
   principle or faculty as reason at all in them. And let this suffice for
   our conviction in point of judgment or conscience, that there shall be
   a day of judgment after this life; which was my first general. I am
   therefore now, in the

   Second place, to inquire (as far as the light of divine revelation will
   enable me) what manner of thing this judgment or last doom will be.
   Know then, that the great appearance, trial, or judgment which my text
   speaks of, is the general or grand assize of the whole world, held in a
   heavenly high court of justice by our Saviour, to hear, examine, and
   finally determine, of all thoughts, words, and actions, that ever were
   thought, spoken, or committed, together with the causes, occasions,
   circumstances, and consequences of all and every one of them, and
   accordingly to pronounce an irrevocable sentence either of absolution
   or condemnation upon all men. In which solemn description you have,

   1st, The Judge.

   2dly, The parties to be judged.

   3dly, The things controverted, or for what they shall be judged.

   4thly, The form of this trial, or the manner of proceeding that shall
   be held in it.

   5thly and lastly, The sentence itself, with the issue and execution of
   it.

   First, then, for the judge at this general and grand assize; he must,
   as my text tells you, be Christ: For we must all appear before the
   judgment seat of Christ; God and man, in his two capacities of Godhead
   and manhood connected; for as he was our redeemer, so he is to be our
   judge in both his natures: he must in the first place be our judge, as
   he is God; because none but God has jurisdiction over all the parties
   that are to be tried at that judgment, which are angels as well as men,
   princes as well as subjects, and the greatest peers as well as the
   meanest peasants. Now though one creature may have jurisdiction over
   another, nay over many other creatures, yet no one has or can have
   authority over all his fellows, this being a royalty or prerogative of
   the Creator himself only. Again: Christ must be judge, as he is God,
   because none but Omniscience can discern the main and principal things
   that shall be there called in question, which are not words and actions
   only, but the hearts, consciences, thoughts, purposes, and intentions
   of all men. Lastly: Christ must be judge, as he is God, because none
   but God can give life and execution to the sentence as pronounced then,
   whether of absolution or condemnation; for none else can render the
   creature infinitely and eternally happy, which is the execution of one
   of the sentences; or on the other side, render the other part of the
   sentence of infinite and everlasting misery effectual, but God only:
   and therefore the judge at that trial must necessarily be God, and
   consequently this very act or office of Christ, the execution of
   justice in this judgment, is an irrefragable argument of his godhead.
   But though God only is or can be our judge at that great tribunal, yet
   nevertheless he must not be God only, but man likewise; and that first
   in regard of the judgment itself, to manifest the equity, the
   indiscriminateness, and the impartiality of it; which might be perhaps
   doubted of, if the judge were either God or man only. For if he were
   only God, he would be the party offended; and if only man, the person
   offending: and a judgment, though really never so just, may be, or seem
   to be, suspected to be otherwise, when either of the parties concerned
   is judge; whereas Christ, being God as well as man, and man as well as
   God, must needs be acknowledged to be an equal, an indifferent and
   impartial judge betwixt God and man, as being equally allied unto them
   both. Again: Christ must be judge as he is man, in regard to the
   parties triable at that day, whether they be sheep or goats; I mean,
   whether they be the just that are to be absolved, or the wicked that
   are to be condemned. For among the just there is none so good but he
   might fairly be afraid to appear at that judgment, if the same person
   were not our Saviour who is to be our judge, who if he brought not to
   the bench with him the pity and compassion of a man, as well as the
   power and justice of a God; nay, if God at that trial did not look upon
   us through himself as man, and beholding the merits in his own person,
   impute them to us, not one of all mankind could be saved. He is to be
   judge as man therefore, that the just to be absolved may not fear to
   appear before him: and he must be judge as man too, that the condemned
   wicked may have no cause of complaint, how severe usage soever they
   find from him. For how can even the damned themselves murmur, repine,
   or except against the judgment, where the trial (as I shall shew you
   presently) is by the evidence of their own conscience, and their
   condemnation pronounced by that judge, who laid down his life to save
   sinners, and consequently cannot possibly be imagined to condemn any
   but such as would not be saved by him. Lastly: Christ must be judge, as
   he is man, in regard of all mankind, or in regard of humanity itself; I
   mean for the dignifying and exalting of human nature: that as the
   nature of man was debased, and brought down to the lowest degree of
   meanness in the person of our Saviour, in his birth, life, and at his
   death; so the same nature, in the same person, might be exalted and
   raised up to so high a degree of power, majesty, and honour, that not
   only men that had despised him, and devils that had tempted him, but
   even the blessed and glorious angels themselves, whose comfort and
   assistance he once stood in need of, should fall down, and tremble at
   his presence. And thus much for the judge at this awful trial.

   The second thing considerable in the description I gave you of this
   judgment are the parties to be judged; and those, briefly, (to speak
   nothing of the evil angels, who are then also to receive their full and
   final doom,) are all persons, of all sorts, qualities, conditions, and
   professions, young and old, rich and poor, high and low, one with
   another. For at this bar, princes have no prerogatives, the nobles have
   no privileges, nor the clergy exemptions and immunities, nor the lawyer
   any more favour than his client; the rich shall neither be regarded for
   their bags, nor the poor pitied for his poverty; but all indifferently
   shall have the same judge and the same trial, the same evidence and the
   same witness; and if their cases be alike, (how different soever their
   persons or estates may be here,) their fate shall there be the same:
   and thus much for the parties to be judged.

   The next thing is, thirdly, the matters that shall be questioned at
   that trial; and those are not our actions only, but our words also, and
   not only our words, but our thoughts too, and not only our thoughts,
   but our very inclinations or dispositions themselves likewise; together
   with the place, time, occasion, intention, and end, for which every
   thing was done, thought, or spoken, and that from the first birth or
   instant of time, to the very last periodical minute of it.

   And then, fourthly, for the manner of proceeding, there will be no
   occasion for examination of witnesses or reading depositions; there
   will be no allegata or probata; for every man shall be indicted and
   arraigned, cast or acquitted, condemned or absolved, by the testimony
   of his own conscience, which shall readily, though never so
   unwillingly, assent to whatever the Judge shall charge it with, whether
   it be good or evil; whether it be for him or against him. The book of
   life shall be opened, wherein is registered and recorded whatever good
   or evil, at any time, from the beginning of the world till the end of
   it, has been done, spoken, consented to, or imagined by any or all
   mankind: and what is more wonderful, this is written in such a
   character, that all men (of what nation or language soever) must needs
   understand and acknowledge the truth of it; this book being nothing
   else but the counterpart (as it were) of every man's conscience, which
   God keeps by him as an undeniable evidence to convince all men with at
   the last judgment.

   In which I shall now consider the fifth and last thing proposed to this
   description, viz. the sentence itself, (whether of absolution or
   condemnation,) the form of both which is judicially set down by Christ
   himself, (Matth. xxv. 34.) That of absolution in these terms; Come, ye
   blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
   foundation of the world: but of this sentence the present occasion of
   our humiliation will not permit me to speak, as too triumphant a topic
   for this day. That other sentence, therefore, (the sad but seasonable
   object of our present meditation,) you may find in the 41st verse of
   the same chapter, in these words; Depart ye cursed into everlasting
   fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels. A dismal and woful
   sentence, my beloved, a sentence carrying hell and horror in the very
   sound of it; whilst every syllable does, as it were, stab the soul, and
   every word bring with it a new death (if I may so say without a
   paradox) to those that can never die. Have we any of us ever been
   present, when the sentence but of a bodily death has been pronounced
   upon a prisoner at the bar? and may not we observe what horror and
   amazement does instantly seize the poor wretch, what a deadly paleness
   covers his face, what a ghastly distraction rises in his countenance,
   what a faltering in his speech, what a trembling in his joints, what a
   cold sweat over his whole body? and yet all these were but weak and
   faint expressions of what his soul suffered. If any of us, who have
   seen and observed all this, had but once felt in ourselves what we have
   seen in others; then perhaps we might guess, and yet but guess, at the
   fear and trembling, the horror and amazement, which will not only seize
   and lay hold upon, but devour and swallow up the soul of man, upon the
   hearing of that dreadful knell, that direful and fatal sentence, which
   will at once both pronounce, and make him unspeakably, unconceivably,
   irrecoverably, and everlastingly miserable. But why do I compare things
   together so infinitely disproportionate, as temporal with eternal,
   corporeal with spiritual, the death of the body alone, with the death
   of soul and body too, or the benches of men with the tribunal of God?
   No, my beloved, if the sentence of that Judge were like those of ours
   here, it would be well for the greatest part of mankind; for then
   perhaps it might either be appealed from, or reversed; or if neither,
   yet at worst it might be endured, without their being utterly and for
   ever undone by it. Here on earth, perhaps, appeals may be lodged, and
   carried from one place to another, from an inferior to a superior
   authority. But at the last day, to whom shall we appeal from God our
   sovereign and supreme judge? Or what higher court of judicature is
   there than that of heaven?

   Lastly: when our Advocate himself condemns us, who will be so
   compassionate, or dare be so impudent as to plead for us? When,
   therefore, this sentence is once pronounced, there is no more hope left
   either of reprieve or pardon; of ease or intermission, of alteration or
   ending; but (which is the misery of miseries) that torment which is
   intolerable for a moment, must last for ever: a word that must vex and
   rack the understanding, puzzle and weary the imagination, distract and
   confound all the powers and faculties of the soul. What pain is there,
   or can there be so little, as man could be content on any consideration
   to endure for ever? What man amongst us is there so poor or so
   covetous, as that he would be hired, or so stout or so patient, (if he
   were hired,) that he could endure but the aching of one tooth in
   extremity, if he hoped for no end of his pain? And yet the toothache,
   the gout, the stone, and the strangury, the rack, and the wheel, with
   the rest of our natural diseases or inventions of cruel ingenuity, are
   but as so many fleabitings, or inconsiderable trifles, compared with
   the torments of the damned. All pains here are either tolerable, or not
   durable; either we may suffer them, or at least shall sink under them.
   But there, there I say, in hell, is acuteness of sense with acuteness
   of torment, extremity of pain and extremity of feeling, insupportable
   anguish, and yet ability to bear it, where the fire always burns, and
   yet consumes not, where fuel is still devoured, and yet it wastes not;
   where, if a man had a world of earth, he would give it all for one drop
   of water, and yet the whole ocean would not cool him; where there is
   perpetual darkness, without rest, continual night, void of sleep: and
   (to conclude what never shall be concluded indeed) where there is
   always distraction without madness, dying without death, misery without
   pity, and wishing without hope. Such things as these can hardly be
   thought of, much less dwelt on without the greatest horror. If St.
   Paul, a prisoner at the bar, discoursing on this argument, could make
   an insulting Felix tremble; how much greater fear ought they to have,
   who living in any known breach of God's commands, or open sin
   unrepented of, are therefore much more concerned in that future
   judgment than Felix could be! He, you know, was a heathen, but we are
   Christians; and you may be assured the least Christian sinner is
   greater than the greatest among the heathens: because they can sin but
   against the light of nature, and their own reason only; whereas wicked
   Christians sin not only against the light of nature and reason, but
   against divine revelation in the known precepts of the law, and those
   plainer ones of the gospel also; at once most desperately slighting the
   terrible threats of the one, and most profanely despising the gracious
   offers of the other. So that if the honour either of God's mercy or of
   his justice be dear unto him, it must necessarily be easier, not only
   for Felix, that never heard of Christ, but even for Pontius Pilate
   himself, who condemned him, than it will be for any wicked, impenitent
   Christian at the day of judgment. And therefore for application of all
   unto ourselves, let us now, (according to my third and last general,)
   endeavour to be informed how far we ourselves are like to be concerned
   in the future judgment, taken (as I have taken it all this while) in
   the worst sense, and consequently how we ought to think of and prepare
   for it. Well then, if there be indeed such a judgment to come, as I
   hope I have fairly proved, we may from thence conclude, 1st, That the
   greatest pretenders to wisdom in this world are not the wisest men; I
   mean those great Ahithophels, those subtle steersmen of states and
   kingdoms, those deep politicians, and civil oracles, (as it were,) of
   courts and councils, who think this doctrine of a future judgment, as
   well as most of the other mysteries of the Christian religion, to be
   indeed nothing else but reasons of state, or the politic devices and
   inventions of the wiser sort of men, (they mean such as they themselves
   are,) to keep the weaker judgments and stronger passions in the
   greatest awe, and so to make them the more pliable and conformable to
   the laws and commands of men. So that the end of all religion is (as
   these political Christians suppose) terminated in this life; and that
   whatsoever foolish bookworms may talk of after this life, whether it be
   the resurrection of the body, or the appearance of both body and soul
   in another place, with the eternal existence of them both in extremity
   either of pain or pleasure, with whatsoever else our Christian faith
   obliges us to believe, in order to another life, they are but so many
   bugbears to fright children withal. Or at best, (in those men's
   opinion,) they are but the vain speculations of idle and curious wits,
   or the issue and product of melancholy brains, and fitter for the
   exercise of men's disputative faculties in the schools, than for the
   object of a wise man's hopes or fears in any of his actions, as having
   indeed nothing of solid truth or reality in them. But how miserably
   mistaken and shamefully deceived will these giant-wits, these mighty
   Solomons, (as they are now thought,) then find themselves to be, when
   awakened by the sudden, the general, and fearful alarm of the last
   trumpet out of that sleep, which they well hoped would have been
   endless, they shall see themselves (to their inexpressible horror and
   amazement) first summoned and haled to judgment, and afterwards hurried
   and dragged away by stranger and subtler spirits than themselves, to
   torment and execution; where their senses will quickly convince their
   intellects, that what they formerly supposed but a chimera, an idle
   speculation, or at best but a politic invention, is indeed a sad, a
   serious, and severe truth. Neither will it be the least part of these
   men's hell, that they shall eternally reproach themselves with folly,
   after so exalted an opinion of their own wisdom. To proceed, again, in
   the second place: all other hypocrites, as well as atheistical
   statesmen, are fools also; I say all other hypocrites, because indeed
   these Christian politicians, or politic Christians I just now
   mentioned, are a sort of hypocrites, viz. moral or civil hypocrites,
   (as I may so call them,) because they seem to believe what they do not,
   and enjoin others what they care not for themselves; I mean the belief
   of Christian doctrines and duties, and that for a moral and civil
   respect or end only; to wit, in order to the preservation of public
   peace and welfare in the state; which certainly were a very good end,
   if it were not their only end in so doing. But the other hypocrites I
   now speak of are religious hypocrites, and not so called because they
   are more religious than the other, but because they are such hypocrites
   as to pretend religion for their main end, though indeed they intend
   and use it only as a means to advance and compass, not the public, but
   their own particular designs by it, (whether they be honest or
   dishonest,) and that often to the prejudice of the public interest both
   of church and state; nay sometimes, (as in our late intestine broils,)
   to the apparent ruin or hazard of them both. And therefore this kind of
   hypocrites, as they are much more wicked and mischievous here in this
   world, so (supposing a future reckoning) they will be far more
   miserable in another state, than those hypocrites or atheists lately
   mentioned. Indeed, if God was as easily to be deceived as men are, with
   false, specious shews and pretences; or if these hypocrites could hope
   to work upon God, as they once did upon the populace, by false words
   and flattering insinuations; or, lastly, if they could make God (as
   they would fain have made the king) believe, that the demolishing of
   his palaces, the robbing him of his revenues, the persecuting of his
   ministers by their false interpreting and misapplying of his word, nay,
   and by driving himself (as much as in them lies) out of his own
   kingdom, the church; if they can, I say, when they come to appear
   before the judgment seat of Christ, make him believe that these and all
   other things they have done of the like kind, were all of them done in
   order to his service, and with an intention to make him a much more
   glorious God than he was before; then let them be thought as wise as
   they would seem religious: nay, let them name their own places and
   preferments in heaven, as they did here on earth in the time of their
   usurpation; for certainly no preferment can hardly be adequate to such
   transcendent spirits and undertakings. And yet all this would be no
   difficult matter for them to bring to pass; if either, in the first
   place, they might always be owned as the highest and supreme
   judicatory; that is, if they might be hereafter, as they will needs be
   here, their own judges: or, secondly, if they may not be their own
   judges, or absolved by their own votes, yet if they might at least be
   but tried (as they think it very equitable they should be) by their own
   ordinances, that is, by laws and rules of their own composure, without
   and contrary to the consent of the supreme legislator: or, lastly, if
   at that great assize they can neither be their own judges, nor be tried
   by their own ordinances, yet at least if they may but have their own
   preachers or advocates, (who pleaded so powerfully for them to the
   people,) to plead for them likewise before God; and withal, if those
   advocates of theirs may but be allowed to interpret that sentence which
   shall then be pronounced, with the same assurance and falsity as they
   have interpreted others of holy writ; neither they themselves, nor any
   of their party, will run any great hazard. For then (I mean if their
   scribes and pharisees, if their doctors of the law and interpreters of
   the gospel, may be believed) the meaning of Go ye cursed shall be the
   contrary, Come ye blessed; and on the contrary the blessing shall
   tacitly imply only a curse; as if that which was spoken to those on the
   left hand was meant to those on the right; and the words directed to
   those on the right intended for those on the left hand: it being the
   usual interpretation of those doctors to make the sense of God's word
   (how opposite soever to the letter of it) to be always in favour of
   themselves, and to condemn their foes; who because they are enemies to
   the good old cause, must needs be esteemed God's also. But whether this
   supposition be true or false, (with all other controversies betwixt us
   and them,) they will be fully, finally, and impartially determined,
   when they and we shall appear before the judgment seat of Christ; For
   we shall all appear, says my text; that is, we shall not only be there,
   but be present every one of us in his proper shape and likeness: no
   disguising of persons, no palliating of actions, no concealing of
   purposes, no dissembling of intentions at all there: For we must all
   appear, says my text, gumnoi` kai` tetrachelisme'noi, (as the same
   apostle says in another place,) naked and barefaced, and laid, as it
   were, flat upon our backs, not before a close or a grand committee of
   ignorant and partial men, who may deceive and be deceived, but before
   Christ, the most exact searcher and infallible discerner of all hearts;
   and before Christ attended on by all the holy angels and blessed
   saints, amongst whom, to their greater confusion, hypocrites shall
   perhaps see some sitting at Christ's right hand, whom they have
   formerly condemned and executed as malignants and delinquents. And
   amongst these, I doubt not but they will see him whom they have
   pierced, (I mean not Christ God, but God's Christ, or God's anointed,)
   that blessed saint and martyr their own sovereign, whom they so
   inhumanly and barbarously murdered; and whom though they would not look
   upon as an object either of reverence or pity here, they shall, though
   unwillingly, behold him as an object of horror and confusion there: an
   object which, next unto hell itself, shall be most dreadful and
   terrible unto them, whilst his wounds, bleeding afresh at the sight of
   his murderers, shall at once upbraid, accuse, and condemn them.
   Howsoever, I am sure they must appear before the judgment seat of
   Christ; that Christ who is truth itself, and in whose mouth there was
   no guile, and therefore he cannot choose but abhor an hypocrite beyond
   all sinners: that Christ, who would not have his own life defended
   against the unjust violence of the lawful magistrate, and therefore
   cannot endure a rebellious hypocrite, of all hypocrites, nor a rebel
   upon a false pretence of religion, of all rebels. Lastly, before that
   Christ that knows well enough that his name and his worship, his word
   and his sacraments, prayer, fasting, and the rest of his sacred
   ordinances were only made a stale by the hypocrites of those times, to
   conceal, to make way for, and to compass their own covetous, malicious,
   or ambitious ends: and consequently whilst they bragged of setting him
   upon his throne, they placed a reed in his hand instead of a sceptre,
   and crowned him in jest, whilst they crucified him in earnest, and what
   is this, but to mock Christ himself as well as the world here? And
   therefore they themselves shall be mocked by Christ before all the
   world hereafter: for as they have most unjustly made many innocent and
   upright men spectacles to men and angels here in this life, so shall
   they, unless a repentance followed, be made a spectacle to men and
   angels in the life to come, being first put to open shame by having
   their mask of piety plucked off, and consequently all the rottenness of
   their hearts and villainy of their designs made evident and apparent,
   and afterwards a double portion of the most exquisite torments that
   hell can afford shall be given to them; one moiety for their sins, and
   another for their hypocrisy; one for their great presumption in their
   daring to mock God, and another for their far greater impudence in
   pretending to honour and serve, whilst they did but mock him. This, I
   say, shall be the portion of the hypocrite at the day of judgment,
   which appears to be a very bitter one by that of our Saviour, Matth.
   xxiv. 51, where it seems, a greater punishment cannot be threatened or
   given than a portion with the hypocrite; and yet even from thence we
   may collect, that some sinners who are not hypocrites, yet are equally
   bad, otherwise they would not have their portion assigned with them;
   and those are such, who are so far from hypocrisy, that they do not nor
   will not so much as pretend to be religious; I mean those that call
   themselves Christians, and yet are worse than the worst of pagans, such
   as sin with a high hand, those impudently presumptuous and profane
   persons, that are so far from concealing or disguising any of their
   lewd courses or practices, though never so sinful and shameful, that
   they not only own and avow them, but value themselves for them, as if
   to be a witty scoffer, a bold blasphemer, a strong drinker, a notorious
   fornicator or adulterer, and a desperate contemner of all divine and
   human laws, were the necessary ingredients towards the composition of a
   gallant man, and consequently, as if it were impossible to be a gallant
   man and a good Christian; nay, as if it were not possible to be a
   gallant man, and to be a man, that is, a rational creature, without
   being metamorphosed and transformed into a swine, a goat, or some such
   brutish creature, by giving up a man's self to all manner of beastly
   lusts, with as much liberty, and as little shame or remorse, as beasts
   themselves do: as if God had given men reason, not to govern and
   restrain, but to stir up and be subservient to their sensual appetite;
   and what is all this, but to do what is in a man's own power to unman
   himself, and turn a rebel, not against divinity and religion, but
   against humanity and nature itself also? And now though this, one would
   think, were as bad as could be, yet it were to be wished that some were
   not worse; by not worse, I mean, that they would be content and
   satisfied to walk alone by themselves in the ways and works of
   darkness, without making it their business (as we see they do) to draw
   as many others as they can down into hell with them, like the
   companions of Ulysses, who having drunk of Circe's enchanted cup
   themselves, and thereby become beasts, afterwards made use of all the
   beastly inducements they could to prove the preference of that to man's
   life, and so persuade their other fellows to drink of the same cup, and
   partake of a like fate with them. And what is this but to play the
   Devil's part, or to be the prince of darkness's agents or factors here
   in this world? For as the Devil himself is called Dia'bolos, or the
   tempter, because it is his business, delight, and study to tempt
   others; so all that are tempters of others into sin may, by the same
   reason, be called devils; I am sure they do the Devil's work, and shall
   have (unless they repent) the Devil's wages for it. For if those that
   turn other men unto righteousness (as the prophet says) shine like
   stars, or have a much greater degree of glory in heaven than other good
   men, who have not been so zealous or industrious to convert others; by
   the same reason, those who tempt other men into sin shall have a much
   greater degree of torment in hell than other wicked men, who have not
   been so malicious or contagious in corrupting and infecting those who
   have conversed with them; which is an effect of the most diabolical
   spirit that any man whilst on this side the grave can possibly be
   possessed or endued withal. But whence, I wonder, is this courage
   against God? Or what is it makes some men so bold and confident, not
   only by being as wicked as they can themselves, but by endeavouring to
   make others their proselytes? Is it because they never think of any
   thing at all beyond the present? If so, they are no wiser than the
   brute beasts. Or is it because they think of nothing beyond death? And,
   of death too, perhaps, in the most gentle and comfortable notion; I
   mean, as death is a rest from all labours, a cure of all diseases, an
   asylum from all enemies, and generally, as it is an end of all worldly
   troubles, and a deliverance from all earthly calamities and vexations?
   Truly, I must confess, to have such a notion of death as this is, is no
   pleasant meditation, especially when we are ready to sink under any
   severe difficulties or troubles. But, alas! my beloved brethren, death
   is to be thought upon by Christians, not only as it is the end of one
   life, but as the commencement of another, which for better or worse
   must last for ever. Nay, death is to be thought upon by wicked
   Christians, not as the beginning of another life, but as the entrance
   or passage unto another death; where men shall be dead to all pleasure,
   to all joy, to all comfort, to all hope; this shall be their deathless
   life, or a lifeless death; they shall be however alive to pain, alive
   to shame and horror of conscience, and (which is worst of all) living
   to despair of ever attaining any end or ease of those torments. And now
   I would fain know, whether any the most profligate person has courage
   enough to think of such a death as this without fear, or the confidence
   to expect it without trembling? Let us therefore consider it, and you
   especially, whoever you are, must consider it seriously that forget
   God, or at least forget him as he is a judge. Consider it, you that by
   your drunkenness or uncleanness, or by any other profane course of
   life, do seem, as it were, to have made a covenant with death and hell,
   and think perhaps to have the more favourable usage from the prince of
   darkness hereafter, the more boldly you have avowed yourselves to be
   his servants in advancing of his kingdom here; you that have done what
   you can to prevent your Judge by pronouncing sentence upon yourselves,
   and damning yourselves as often as you swear, which is almost as often
   as you speak, (for such is the custom of common swearers,) think with
   yourselves, I beseech you, whether your courage, how great soever it
   be, will serve you, and your strength, how much soever it be, will
   support you, and for ever too, in such a place and such a condition as
   I have imperfectly described unto you; Can any of you dwell., and dwell
   for ever, in everlasting burnings? And yet this shall be the dwelling,
   this shall be the portion of the hypocrite, says the prophet, (Isai.
   xxxiii. 14.) And the like portion with the hypocrite shall the profane
   person participate. For though the way of the profane and the hypocrite
   seem contrary, yet they shall meet, and their -end shall be the same;
   and though they deride and laugh at one another here, yet they shall
   both of them weep and gnash their teeth together hereafter. For the
   hypocrite shall be as tow, and the profane person as flax, and they
   shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. God of his
   infinite goodness give them both grace to foresee in time, and by
   repentance to prevent this their so great danger; for certainly for any
   man to despise the divine justice, with the endless and intolerable
   effects of it, is not courage, but madness. And therefore to conclude
   all in a word, the best method we can take is to judge ourselves, that
   we may not be judged of the Lord; and because that day (as the Lord
   himself tells us) shall come as a thief in the night, suddenly and
   unexpectedly, let us always be sure to have oil in our lamps, that is,
   faith and repentance in our hearts, justice and charity in our actions;
   and whatever else we have to do, let it be one part of our daily
   business seriously to meditate,

   1st, Upon the vanity and shortness of our lives; and,

   2dly, Upon the certainty and uncertainty of our deaths.

   3dly, Upon the great exactness and severity of the judgment to come
   after death; and,

   4thly, and lastly, Upon the eternity and immutability of every man's
   condition in the other world, whether it be good or evil. And then, I
   hope, by God's grace sanctifying these our endeavours, our condition
   there will be such, as we shall have no cause to desire either an end
   or an alteration of it.

   Which God of his mercy grant us all, through the merits of his Son, and
   the happy conduct of his holy Spirit. Amen.
