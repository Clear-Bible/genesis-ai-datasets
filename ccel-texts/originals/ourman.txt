                                    FOREWORD

   "OUR MAN IN HEAVEN" sums up very aptly the central emphasis of the
   Letter to the Hebrews. The human family has in the presence of God an
   acceptable Representative -- acceptable because He is most
   authentically one with ourselves, partaker of our flesh and blood, and
   acceptable too because He is persona gratissima with God, being the Son
   through whom God has spoken His final and perfect word to mankind.

   Our Lord's present ministry on His people's behalf "in matters for
   which they are responsible to God" guarantees for them an inexhaustible
   supply of grace and power to cope with all the troubles and temptations
   that are inseparable from present Iife on earth. Provision to match the
   need of the moment comes the more opportunely from One who, when on
   earth, was spared none of these troubles and temptations, but endured
   them all and triumphed over them.

   Next, our Lord's presence before God on our behalf guarantees for us
   also free access before God. Since God welcomes Him as our
   Representative, He welcomes by the same token those whom our Lord
   represents. Both now and hereafter the way into the heavenly sanctuary
   stands open through Him for those who are united with Him by faith. He
   who is the source of our present help is also the ground of our eternal
   hope.

   Again, our Lord now ministers as our Representative in the presence of
   God because He has blazed a trail thither along which He now calls us
   to follow Him.

   The first readers of this Letter were reluctant to leave the familiar
   securities of their ancestral pattern of religious life for the
   hazardous adventure of following One who set such little store by His
   own personal security. But if men and women in the first century A. D.
   had not been willing to do this very thing - to obey the injunction
   "Let us go forth" -- there would have been no future for the Christian
   cause on earth. It is equally necessary for us 1900 years later to be
   ready to leave our familiar securities and follow Him who is still
   calling His people along the unpredictable trail of faith. To know this
   by experience is also involved in understanding what is meant by having
   "our Man in heaven."

   It is a pleasure to commend Mr. Fudge's exposition of the Letter to the
   Hebrews. A superficial perusal of the Letter may suggest that it has
   little relevance to readers today. A more careful study reveals that
   its message is astonishingly up-to-date, speaking directly to the
   conditions of Christian existence in this uncertain world. I hope that,
   with the help of Mr. Fudge's study, many readers will grasp the message
   of the Letter and learn to live by it.

                                  INTRODUCTION

   Authorship

   At the end of the second century, opinion was divided regarding the
   authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Clement of Alexandria
   believed that Paul wrote the epistle in Hebrew and that Luke translated
   it into Greek. Origen thought that someone familiar with Paul's
   teachings wrote Hebrews, but he added his now-famous remark that "who
   really wrote the letter is known to God alone." At Carthage, Tertullian
   suggested the name of Barnabas. Christians in Rome and in the West
   generally confessed that they did not know who wrote Hebrews. Archer
   points out that "none of the ancient authorities... entertained any
   doubt as to the canonicity (i.e. the divine inspiration) of the
   Epistle," however, and that "in any event the primary author... is God
   Himself, no matter which human instrument He used." In the days of the
   Reformation, Luther favored Apollos as the author and Calvin looked to
   Clement of Rome or possibly Luke.

   Date of writing

   The date of this epistle is also uncertain. References to the Jewish
   order and the priestly functions seem clearly to involve the Levitical
   service of the Old Testament, not the distorted institutions of the
   first century after Christ. Nor can it be ascertained whether the
   calamity of A.D. 70 had befallen Jerusalem and Herod's Temple when our
   author wrote. Internal evidence is claimed for both positions. We must
   set a latest possible date before A.D. 96, for Clement of Rome wrote
   then and he quotes from the epistle quite freely. We can not have too
   early a date, for a few remarks in the epistle indicate that its first
   recipients were second-generation Christians (2:3-4; 13:7) and
   apparently not new converts themselves (5:12; 10:32-35).

   Recipients

   Beyond what has been stated we can know little of the recipients or
   their precise historical situation. So far as a general statement of
   affairs, most scholars would probably agree with Bernard that the
   epistle

   ... evidently belongs to the last hour of translation and decision,
   when a large number of men, who were at once Jews and Christians, stood
   perplexed, agitated, and almost distracted, as they seemed to feel the
   ground parting beneath their feet, and hardly knew whether to throw
   themselves back on that which was receding, or forward on that to which
   they were called to cling. ]In an intense sympathy with this
   perplexity, and even anguish, prevailing m the Hebrew-Christian mind,
   and in an intense anxiety as to its issue, the Epistle was written; a
   living voice of power in a time of change and fear, yet a comprehensive
   exposition of the advancing course of revelation, and of the relation
   between its two great stages (pages 161-162).

   Just what was involved in this crisis-time is not so clear, and
   regarding that there is a wide divergence of views.In an article in The
   Expository Times, Bruce sums up recent views regarding the epistle's
   recipients. Candidates include the Christians of the Lycus Valley
   (Colossae, Laodicea), Jewish Christians in Ephesus, Hebrew converts in
   Rome who hesitated to declare themselves a part of the "illicit
   religion" of Christ rather than the "licit religion" (in the eyes of
   official Rome) of the Jews, Jewish Christians of Corinth, Jewish
   convert hotheads who had fled to Alexandria after the fall of
   Jerusalem, Hebrew Christians on Cyprus, and Palestinian Jewish
   Christians either before or after the destruction of A.D. 70. The Dead
   Sea Scrolls evidence certain parallel interests between their authors
   and the recipients of Hebrews. Both are concerned with the position and
   role of angels, with Old Testament passages, with the priesthood and
   even with Melchizedek. This has led some scholars to posit a connection
   between the readers of our epistle and the Qumran community of the
   Scrolls, or, at least, between this epistle and converted Jewish
   priests.

   In the midst of all this uncertainty, and with no real prospects of
   additional light on the subject, Filson believes "it is unfortunate
   that so much attention has been paid to questions of authorship,
   destination, place of writing and date, " and that "the frustratingly
   inconclusive study of Hebrews should make it clear that we cannot find
   certain answers to the questions: Who? To whom? From where? When?"
   (page 12). But we are not left with nothing. For, as Filson also points
   out, the author of Hebrews is to us what he has written. And that is a
   great deal to know and to have. It can spur modern Christians to
   renewed and increased awareness of what their faith can mean to them
   and what their faithfulness can mean to others (page
   84).StructureNumerous outlines of the epistle have been set forward.
   One fascinating suggestion is made by Kistemaker who regards the
   epistle as a kind of sermon. He mm a four-point outline in the text
   itself at 2:17, and he suggests that the author develops each point on
   the basis of a quotation from the Psalms. His four points and their
   "texts" are:
    1. Christ's humanity and unity with His brethren (Psalm 8:4-6; quoted
       in 2:6-8).
    2. Christ's faith and faithfulness (Psalm 95:7-11; quoted in 3:7-11).
    3. Christ's priesthood (Psalm 110:4; quoted first for discussion at
       5:6).
    4. Christ's offering of Himself (Psalm 40:6-8; quoted in 10:5-7).

   Whether or not one should follow Kistemaker all the way, it is apparent
   -that the Epistle to the Hebrews is thoroughly grounded in the Old
   Testament Scriptures in general and in the Psalms in particular.

   Acknowledgements

   A special acknowledgement of debt is due Dr. F. F. Bruce, the late Dr.
   Franz Delitzsch and the late Professor Robert Milligan, from whose
   commentaries I have drawn heavily and on which I have leaned with great
   profit. (All quotations from Bruce in the comments which follow are
   from his commentary unless otherwise stated.) Other commentaries and
   books have been used to advantage, but these have been my favorites.
   Delitzsch represents conservative scholarship of the past century;
   Bruce is unsurpassed in that role today. Milligan was of my own
   Restoration Movement background and, in my opinion, is not given the
   esteem as a scholar today which he certainly is due.

   A note of thanks is also due Professor Homer Hailey, whose college
   lectures on the Scriptures led me in due course through the Epistle to
   the Hebrews, and whose biblical insight I will always remember with
   appreciation and respect. I should also like to thank Drs. Paul
   Southern, J. W. Roberts and Thomas H. Olbricht, who gave me valuable
   experience in the exegetical method of study.

   To these all and many others my sincere appreciation for insights into
   this marvelous epistle. Any mistakes and misunderstandings in this
   commentary are my own. They only are original

  CHAPTER ONE

   In chapter one our author seems to have two points in mind. First, by
   showing Christ's superior position to angels, he sets forth also the
   superiority of the new covenant which Christ mediates and certifies
   over the old covenant which was mediated by angels. Second, he prepares
   the way for chapter two, in which he explains how and why the Son
   became lower than the angels for a brief period of time. A third
   consideration not specified by the writer of Hebrews but in accord with
   his epistle and perhaps also in his mind is that any revelation which
   claims angelic origin or authority must be measured in terms of that
   revelation which God has given through the Son - the Son who is better
   and higher than all angels.

   1:1. The basic sentence in this verse and the next is "God hath
   spoken." At sundry times is from a single adverb in the original which
   meant "in many portions." Because God revealed His will in segments,
   revelation came from time to time as needed. It was the nature of the
   prophet that he spoke what God gave him to speak, and that was always
   "in part." In divers manners is also from a single adverb meaning "in
   many varied ways."

   The adverbs modify the verb. God spoke (by prophets) to the fathers in
   many portions and in various ways. Amos gave God's message by oracles
   and direct statements from God; Hosea by "typical" experiences in his
   own life; Habakkuk by arguments and discussion. Malachi spoke God's
   word by questions and answers; Ezekiel by strange and symbolic acts;
   Haggai by sermons and Zechariah by mystical signs.

   God addressed His people in parables and in illustrations; by warnings
   and exhortations; by encouragements and promises. By every possible
   method He spoke through the prophets to the fathers. Yet the word was
   always fragmentary and usually soon forgotten. When the Old Testament
   closed, revelation was still incomplete. God was to speak again, more
   fully and more effectively than He ever had spoken in the prophets.

   In time past is literally "of old," and refers to previous ages of the
   world. The fathers were the Jewish forefathers of the Hebrew
   Christians. The prophets included both the writing prophets (such as
   those whose work Scripture preserves) and the non-writing prophets
   (such as Nathan, Elijah, Elisha and others). The prophets were "mouths"
   for God (Exodus 4:16; 7:1). They spoke His word, though at times even
   they did not understand it (I Peter 1:10-12; see Daniel 7:28; 12:8-10).

   1:2. The phrase these last days refers to the Messianic era, the age of
   fulfillment, and is literally "the last of these days." The Jews
   divided time into the Present Age, of anticipation, and the Coming Age,
   of the Messiah. They expected the Messiah to come at the end of their
   Present Age. When Christ came, however, the Coming Age crashed into
   history and the Messianic era of fulfillment became a reality (
   [1]Hebrews 9:26-28). Peter's sermon on Pentecost formally announced the
   beginning of these "last days" (Acts 2:14-36).

   Here was one of the more puzzling elements of the apostolic preaching
   for the Jews (and for people in general, then and now). The Messianic
   era of fulfillment has now begun with the resurrection of Christ and
   His ascension into heaven, yet the temporal world continues even as it
   decays. Men might expect the Present Age and the Coming Age to meet at
   a given point, but certainly they do not expect them to overlap! Yet
   this is exactly what the New Testament declares, and it is this
   overlapping of Ages which creates the spiritual war for the Christian.

   But while the "last days" have begun - one Man is already in heaven! -
   the consummation remains in the future and the old order continues to
   exist (II Peter 3:3-10). it is God's plan that the church use this
   interim to announce to the world that history has been given
   significance in Jesus of Nazareth, and that man can now ask God for
   reconciliation and have the assurance that He will give it through
   Christ. (On this age of the world in God's plan see also the
   Introduction to chapters 9-11 in my Helps on Romans.)

   God has spoken unto us, that is, to those living in this age, "to whom
   has come the very anticipated goal of the ages" (I Corinthians 10:11,
   my translation; see Mark 1:15; Luke 1:68-79; Luke 4:19/II Corinthians
   6:2; Acts 3:24). By His son is literally "in a son" or "in one who is a
   son." Here is no mere prophet, but one who is Himself a Son and by
   nature the same as the Father.

   Christ's very life and person expressed God (John 1:18). God has now
   revealed Himself fully, not partially. He has spoken grace and truth, a
   revelation superior to any given before (John 1:17). In Christ, God has
   spoken salvation, not only spoken it but accomplished it - in the
   unique life and sacrifice of the Son. The rest of chapter one exalts
   the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, by showing His many-faceted
   ministry and position or "name."

   God the Father has appointed or set or ordained Christ as heir of all
   things. Heir speaks of an inheritance and brings to mind the words of
   Psalm two, where the Son is given the nations for an inheritance. The
   same imagery occurs In Psalm 110, and our author will discuss that
   psalm several times, though usually with emphasis on Christ's priestly
   ministry.

   By Christ God made the worlds. Christ is both originator and heir of
   all things. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the author and finisher of
   creation as well as of faith. The worlds might mean the created
   universe (as in [2]11:3; see also John 1:3; Colossians 1:16-17) or
   literally "the ages" of time in which God's saving purpose is worked
   out. Both interpretations state what Scripture elsewhere affirms.

   1:3. Christ is the brightness of the Father's glory. Literally
   "effulgence," this word means either that which radiates out from a
   light or the reflection which comes back. The former meaning is
   probably intended here. If we speak of God's glory, Christ is its very
   emanation and radiance. He is to the Father what rays are to a light,
   or flames to a fire, or beams to the sun. Without this Son, man is in
   the dark concerning God and salvation. God's magnificence as deity is
   fully seen in Jesus Christ who was God in human flesh (see John 14:9).

   Christ is the express image of the Father's person. The word here
   translated image originally meant a stamp or seal, then the impression
   left by it. In the early centuries, the church engaged in great debates
   over the precise philosophical meanings of some of these terms. It is
   enough for us to know that Christ is an exact and complete
   representation of God because He is the Son, and that in that capacity
   He is perfectly sufficient to reveal God and to save man.

   Christ is upholding all things; by Him all things consist or hold
   together (Colossians 1:17). All things may be translated "the
   universe." Christ's protectorate is all-inclusive. The word of His
   power is specifically a "spoken word," and the phrase might be
   translated "by His powerful spoken word." This is an active and
   powerful word which upholds the universe.

   Christ accomplished man's redemption by Himself, through His own work
   of obedience. Our author elaborates on this statement in chapters eight
   through ten (see also Romans 5:12, 15-21). That Jesus purged our sins
   means that He "made a cleansing" or "accomplished a purification." The
   form of the verb indicates the words by Himself, and suggests a
   one-time action (see Hebrews [3]9:12-14, [4]26-28).

   Because His work of redemption had been completed ( [5]2:9; [6]6:20;
   [7]7:26-27; [8]9:24-28; [9]10:12-14; [10]12:2), Christ sat down. Unlike
   the Levitical priests who stood daily in an imperfect and temporary
   service, Christ made atonement for all men and then took His seat
   forever ( [11]10:11-12). The right hand signifies authority; see
   [12]notes on verse 13. The Majesty refers to God the Father. Our author
   follows a Jewish custom of referring to Jehovah by a euphemism, out of
   respect for the sacred name.

   1:4. Christ has been made so much better than the angels, which ft will
   be our writer's business to explain in the remainder of chapter one.
   This verse contains two Greek words which express comparison (see also
   [13]7:20-22; [14]8:6 and [15]10:25). Christ is as much better than
   angels as His name is more excellent than theirs. The author will show
   how much more excellent name Christ possesses than they, and to that
   same extent he will show Christ to be higher in rank than the angels
   themselves.

   The writer has introduced his first point: Christ is a spokesman
   superior to prophets or angels - because He is the Son. He was active
   in creation. He is God's very substance and image. He has accomplished
   a perfect work of complete redemption, and He has now taken His
   inherited seat as universal heir and Lord at God's right hand in
   heaven. He is Prophet (verse two), Priest (verse three) and King (verse
   three).

   Christ's name is far higher than those of the heavenly emissaries, but
   why would our author need to make this point? It has already been
   mentioned that many in the ancient world thought of angels as lords
   over the present world system. Others worshipped angels. Still others
   regarded Christ as simply one in an ascending order of angels. The
   former overrated angels by giving them what belongs to the Son; the
   latter underrated the Son by considering Him an angel (an error
   propagated today by the so-called Jehovah's Witness cult). The
   following verses put angels and the Son in proper perspective.

   1:5a. To no angel did God ever say, Thou are my son, this day have I
   begotten thee; but He said it to the Son in Psalm 2:7. This Messianic
   psalm describes man's rejection of Christ and God (verses 1-3; see Acts
   4:25-28). It also foretells God's triumph through His Christ
   ("Anointed," verses 4-9; see Revelation 12:5; 19:15). And it gives a
   double pronouncement in view of the Messianic judgment to come (verses
   10-12). The same psalm is quoted also at Acts 13:33 of the resurrection
   of Christ, and at [16]Hebrews 5:5 of Christ's divine installment as
   high priest. It seems to underlie the heavenly voice at Christ's
   baptism (along with Isaiah 42:1) and at His transfiguration (with
   Isaiah 42:1 and possibly Deuteronomy 18:15ff ).

   Emphasis here is on Son, stressing Christ's nature and position, and on
   the first person pronoun "I," emphasizing the divine origin of His
   appointment. Christ is God's own Son in essence by eternal nature. He
   was God in the flesh through a miraculous conception. He is ranking Son
   and Man in glory through His resurrection and a divine decree.

   Of course the psalmist did not understand all of this, and his words
   may have been partially appreciated through a lesser fulfillment in his
   own day. But their full meaning is seen only in the light of the
   resurrection and ascension of Christ. The same Holy Spirit which guided
   the prophets (H Peter 1:21) also led the apostles into the meaning of
   their writings (I Peter 1:10-12), as well as the significance of the
   gospel events involving Jesus the Christ (John 14:26; 15:26; 16:12-14;
   see also John 2:19-22; 12:12-16; 13:6-7; Luke 24:31-32, 44-45).

   1:5b. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. These
   words are quoted from H Samuel 7:14, an oracle of Nathan concerning
   David's royal son. The promise referred partially to Solomon (I Kings
   2:23-24; I Chronicles 28:5-7) but, as many other Old Testament
   statements, found perfect fulfillment only in Christ. Both "I" and "He"
   are emphatic, stressing the personal relationship between the speaker
   and the one of whom He speaks. To him and to me reflect Hebrew style;
   the statement means simply "I shall be his father; he shall be my son."
   The Son of God was the prophetic son of David (Matthew's gospel
   emphasizes this: see 1:1, 20; 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9;
   21:15; also 12:3; 22:41ff). The statements quoted in verse five
   describe a Son, not mere angels.

   1:6. Again could be placed at the beginning this verse, as In the King
   James and Revised Standard versions, introducing another Old Testament
   citation; or with the verb, as in the American Standard and New
   American Standard versions. The phrase has been regarded as referring
   to the incarnation, the resurrection and the second advent. Angels are
   associated with all three events in Scripture. The point is that they
   worship Him . All the angels of God, of every rank and order, are
   commanded to worship him, a fact which points to His superiority over
   them. The quotation might be from a Greek version of Deuteronomy 32:43
   or of Psalm 97:7. No doubt the first readers of the epistle recognized
   it.

   1:7. In this verse and the next, two words are used which together mean
   "on the one hand" and "on the other hand." A contrast is intended here
   between angels, who are ministers or servants, and the Son who is so
   much more. The quotation is from Psalm 104:4.

   1:8. Psalm 45:6-7 is applied to Christ, identifying Him as eternal God
   whose throne is for ever and ever, and as righteous King. His kingdom
   is one of righteousness ( [17]Hebrews 7:2-3; Isaiah 9:7; 11:4-5).

   1:9. In the flesh, Christ loved righteousness and hated iniquity (see
   [18]10:5-10; Isaiah 53:11-12). Because of His perfect obedience, Jesus
   was anointed ("Christ-ed") by God and exalted above every creature (see
   Philippians 2:8-11). The oil of gladness probably represents an
   occasion of festivity as well as that of coronation. Psalm 45 seems to
   have originally celebrated the marriage of the king, though again its
   deepest meaning is understood only in the light of the Son. Along this
   line, compare [19]Hebrews 12:22-24 (see notes on "general assembly")
   with Revelation 19:1-10. The chief point of the verse ought not to be
   overlooked in the midst of details.

   1:10-12. These three verses are quoted from Psalm 102:25-27. In the
   passage the psalmist calls on Jehovah to come to his rescue, and
   appeals to God's eternal nature in pleading for the deliverance of his
   own life. This is only one of many passages addressed to or regarding
   Jehovah in the Old Testament which are applied to Christ in the New
   Testament.

   Because Christ is creator, He is also eternal - though all His creation
   will change with age and finally pass away. He laid the foundation of
   the earth and His hands arranged the heavens, but when these things
   perish (see [20]12:26-28) His years will not fail ( [21]7:24-25). When
   they are all changed He will remain the same ( [22]13:8).

   Again the contrast is between the Son and the angels (verse seven), who
   have no such traits or legitimate claims. They are rather part of that
   creation which He has made and have life only through His will.

   1:13. This is a quotation of Psalm 110:1, the Old Testament passage
   most quoted or referred to in the New Testament Scriptures. It is
   quoted in Acts 2:34-35; Mark 12:36; Hebrews 1:13, and seems to be in
   mind in Mark 14:62; Acts 7:55; Romans 8:34; Ephesians 1:20; Colossians
   3:1; Hebrews 1:3; [23]8:1; [24]10:12; [25]12:2 and I Peter 3:22. As
   noted already at verse five, many psalms which had partial fulfillment
   or significance in their original historical settings are fully
   understood in the New Testament writings through the life, death,
   resurrection and coronation of Christ.

   The figure of the right hand is common in the Psalms, sometimes
   referring to a place of honor as here (see Psalm 16:11; 45:9; 80:17).
   Most of the time the term refers to strength or security from God given
   to the one of whom it is used. The resurrected Jesus, now made Christ,
   was given a position equaled only by that of God Himself (I Corinthians
   15:27). He is God's Right-Hand Man.

   In the Old Testament we see the custom of the conquered king
   prostrating himself to kiss the conqueror's feet (Psalm 2:12), or the
   victor putting his feet on his captive's neck (Joshua 10:24) so that
   the captive is made his footstool. One day every knee will bow before
   Christ and every tongue will confess His lordship (Philippians 2:10-11;
   I Corinthians 15:24-25). The angels will be in that number; the Son is
   made so much better than them all ( [26]verse four).

   1:14. This question is worded in the Greek to indicate that the author
   expects an affirinative answer. Angels all, regardless of rank, are
   ministering spirits. But Christ is so much more. They are sent forth by
   a higher authority, perhaps even by the Son at God's right hand. Their
   work is to serve, to minister for Christians, who shall be heirs of
   salvation. Our writer says literally that they are "sent for service on
   behalf of those who are about to receive salvation as an inheritance."
   If angels serve the saints, how much more do they serve the Son! And
   how greatly superior is His position and name to theirs.

   Christ is Prophet of prophets - God has spoken in Him for these last
   days. He is Priest of priests - by Himself He made atonement for sins.
   He is King of kings - seated at God's right hand, reigning over a
   kingdom of righteousness. Old Testament Scripture shows Him to be God's
   divine Son, David's prophetic descendant, and worthy of worship.
   Whereas angels are messengers, Christ is eternally Lord and divine
   King. As everlasting Creator of all things, He is also now victorious
   Vicegerent at God's right hand. The voice from heaven at Christ's
   transfiguration aptly sums up our author's argument in this first
   chapter: "Hear ye Him!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER TWO

   Having demonstrated in chapter one the superiority of Christ the Son
   over the serving angels, our writer concludes in [27]2:1-4 (which would
   have been placed more appropriately as the ending of the first chapter)
   with an exhortation and a warning.

   His arguments is of a type commonly employed by the Jewish teachers of
   the time, and was called by them an argument qal wahomer - "from the
   light to the weighty." A statement is made concerning a "lighter"
   matter, which then is inferred to be even more certainly true of a
   matter of greater or "heavier" importance.

   Jesus' statements concerning the Father's benevolence follow this kind
   of reasoning (Matthew 6:25-31; 7:9-11), as do His remarks about working
   on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:10-12). Paul uses the same type of reasoning
   to show the security of the true believer (Romans 5:8-10) and the
   abundant provisions of divine grace (Romans 5:15-21). The author of
   Hebrews later reasons the same way regarding Christ's unique priesthood
   (chapter seven) and all-sufficient sacrifice for sin ( [28]9:13-14),
   Christian discipline ( [29]12:9-10), and the reverence which should
   accompany those who are heirs of the unshakeable kingdom (
   [30]12:25-29).

   In these verses he speaks of two agents by whom God's word has come,
   and of the consequences of failing to heed that word -- especially as
   spoken by the Son. If Christ's position is far greater than that given
   the angels (as has been shown in chapter one), punishment for ignoring
   or rejecting His message must be far greater than that given for
   irreverence of the angelic word.

   [31]2:1. Therefore is literally "on account of this"; that is, because
   of the greatness of the Son and in view of the point to follow. Ought
   is not the simple word for an obligation but the stronger word which
   means "it is imperative" or "it is necessary." To give the more,
   earnest heed translates a verb meaning "to pay careful attention" and
   an adverb (based on an adjective in the comparative degree) meaning
   "even more extremely." The result is an exceptionally strong
   exhortation. "Because of these things," he is saying, "it is absolutely
   necessary for us to be extremely careful to pay attention."

   His readers are to hold to the things which they have heard from the
   Son by means of His apostles. Lest we let them slip is better
   translated "lest we drift away (from them)," as in the later versions.
   The word translated slip was used by Greek writers of an arrow slipping
   out of the quiver, of snow sliding, of foul language slipping into a
   conversation or, in medical contexts, of food slipping down the
   windpipe instead of the esophagus. The writer urges extreme care lest
   his readers slip from steadfast obedience and trust in the Son.

   Their danger, and that of many other New Testament readers then and
   now, was that of slipping from trust in the Son's finished work of
   salvation by His own perfect-life obedience and sacrifice to a reliance
   on their own performance based on a meritorious view of salvation. The
   same caution applies equally well to slipping from active obedience to
   careless disobedience or disregard.

   [32]2:2. For indicates the basis of the warning. The word spoken by
   angels would include every divine message delivered by angels, but has
   special reference to the Law of Moses which was delivered by means of
   angels and was highly esteemed by the Jews for that reason (Psalm
   68:17; Deuteronomy 33:2; Acts 7:53; Galatians 3:19). Steadfast here
   means reliable, dependable or strong. God's word by angels was always a
   sure word which came to pass.

   Transgression refers to a violation of an express command and
   disobedience refers to a refusal or neglect to obey. The former
   stresses the act of disobedience; the latter stresses the careless or
   rebellious attitude which prompts it. punishment was certain in either
   case under the Law.

   God's punishment of sin was always the just or fair reward of sin. It
   was never arbitrary, but always in keeping with divine justice and
   holiness. Recompense indicates a payment of wages earned. The wages of
   sin is death -- that is the fair payment earned by sin. The man who
   gets "what he has coming to him" will never be saved.

   [33]2:3. We are those to whom the Son has spoken in these last days,
   and the pronoun is here emphasized. To neglect salvation is to fail to
   show concern and care for it. Neglect is a positive wrong consisting of
   a lack of action. By doing nothing one does wrong. The tense of the
   verb here views life as a whole -- this is more an attitude governing
   all of life than it is a single or specific act (see [34]6:7-12;
   [35]10:28-29). Generalities, of course, are always manifested in
   specifics. A single act of neglect suggests an attitude of the same and
   should be cause for repentance and diligence.

   We have a salvation which is so great for a number of reasons. It comes
   from a great spokesman (chapter one). It involves a great work of
   redemption ( [36]1:3; [37]2:9, [38]14). This great work brought great
   results (2:10, 15, 17). So great a salvation carries a judgment equally
   great for those who reject it (see [39]6:4-8; [40]10:28-31; also Mark
   16:16; Romans 1:17-18; II Corinthians 2:15-16). This salvation was
   spoken first by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. It was repeated and
   confirmed to the recipients of this epistle by chosen apostles who had
   heard him speak. The verb translated "confirm" is a form of the same
   word "steadfast" in verse two. Christ's word is a sure word.

   [41]2:4. Freely translated, our author says that God added witness upon
   witness, piling testimony together. He did this by signs (stressing the
   spiritual meaning of the acts) and wonders (stressing the effect on
   those who saw), various kinds of miracles (stressing the might involved
   in accomplishing these signs and wonders; literally the word is
   "powers"), and spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit which He gives to
   the church (see I Corinthians 12; Romans 12).

   All this was according to God's own will. He confirmed the supernatural
   message of a resurrected and ascended Savior by supernatural
   demonstrations of power -- because He willed to do so. The absence of
   such signs in certain places today speaks not of God's power but of His
   will. He can if He wishes. God's working is in God's sovereign hands.
   He gives spiritual gifts and works miracles and signs as it pleases
   Him.

   The answer to the original question must be that there is no escape. If
   the lesser word of angels was sure and violations of it were strictly
   punished, there is absolutely no escape for one who carelessly regards
   the great salvation spoken by the superior Son. Let each true believer
   hold fast to the Son of God in constant diligence, trusting His work of
   salvation for total deliverance from sin and yielding to His voice in
   all things.

   [42]2:5. At the beginning of the remarks on chapter one the comment was
   made that those verses prepared the way for chapter two, in which the
   author would tell how the Son became lower than angels for a brief
   period of time, and explain why. By the end of the first chapter the
   original Jewish readers might very well have asked, "If the Son is so
   much greater than the angels, why did He become a man and die?"

   Beginning with verse five the author answers this question. In the
   process he shows the intended creation glory and dignity of man, a
   position never realized fully after the Fall by any man except Jesus
   Christ. He demonstrates how Jesus now occupies this place of
   prominence, and how, by virtue of His accomplishments, all men may
   enjoy their intended state of glory.

   There are Biblical indications that the angels have a hand in God's
   administration of the present world-order (Daniel 10:20-21; 12:1;
   Ephesians 6:12). We know that various Jewish sects before and after
   Christ assigned such a role to angels, and the epistle to the
   Colossians indicates that certain gentile teachers did the same. Be
   that as it may, God did not plan the glorified world to come for the
   benefit of the angels, but for man. The intended glory of man is
   expressed in terms of all things being put in subjection to him (see
   Romans 8:19-25; 11 Peter 3:7, 10, 13-14; Revelation 21:lff).

   [43]2:6. David is quoted from Psalm 8:5-7 to establish this point. God
   is interested in and mindful of man. He visits him in blessing and
   judgment. The son of man in this psalm is simply a poetic expression
   for man.

   [44]2:7. Man was made but a little lower than the angels. He was
   crowned by the Creator with glory and honor. He was set over the works
   of God's hands (see Genesis 1:26-28). This was man's intended exalted
   position as first created by God for paradise glory.

   [45]2:8. God put all things in subjection under man's feet, according
   to the psalmist. Our writer reasons as follows. If God really put all
   things in subjection under him, nothing is excluded from man's dominion
   and oversight. Yet if we look about us we do not see all things under
   man's control -- yet. Man is not master of his environment and world,
   though he is frequently its corrupter and polluter. Man does not enjoy
   paradise glory and dominion. To say this is to state the obvious. But
   does this mean that God's purpose has been thwarted? Is there anywhere
   a man who is over all things -- in complete control?

   [46]2:9. We do not see ourselves in that position -- at least not at
   the present time. But we do see Jesus, and He is crowned with glory and
   honor! Is the mighty Son of chapter one -- that Son so much better than
   the angels -- a man? Yes! For He was made a little lower than the
   angels, even to the suffering of death, that by the grace of God He
   could die for every man -- then give all who would follow Him their
   intended glory and dominion.

   Jesus became a representative man. In Him, God found a man who gave
   what He had always wanted from man but which no man had ever given -- a
   human life fully and always dedicated to pleasing God. In Christ, man's
   glorified potential was fully realized. This glory was not even planned
   for angels. It was not intended for other heavenly beings, earthly
   creatures or occupants of the subterranean depths. It was the Creator's
   original intention for man. And now one man is in that position. One
   man has a foothold in glory! And because He is a representative man,
   acting on behalf of all mankind, His people will one day enjoy the same
   position of glory.

   The expression a little lower than the angels is used in two senses in
   this passage. When it is said that man was put a little lower than the
   angels, the expression indicated his exalted position - it is but a
   little lower than the angels (and the original psalm had the general
   word for "God" instead of "angels"). But when it is said of Jesus that
   He became a little lower than the angels, the direction is reversed.
   For Jesus is the Son, far greater than the angels. To say that He
   became lower than angels is to say that He was humiliated, that He
   emptied Himself, that He condescended (Philippians 2:5ff). It is also
   to say that He became a man -- like ourselves and for our benefit.

   [47]2:10. It was becoming, fitting and proper for him for whom are all
   things and by whom are all things (Revelation 4:11; Romans 11:36; I
   Corinthians 8:6; II Corinthians 5:18) to bring many sons to glory by
   making Jesus their perfect forerunner or captain, even through
   suffering.

   In becoming a representative man, Jesus willingly became of the same
   stuff as mankind in general. He became a brother to man, of the seed of
   David according to the flesh. In becoming a man, Jesus also took on
   suffering and death, both inevitable characteristics of mankind. Yet
   because of His sinless life, His death was able to count as our death.
   And by suffering death, Christ was able to bring many sons to glory -
   going ahead of them Himself as Captain, experiencing first the
   suffering of death but then the glory of resurrection and installment
   at God's right hand the same kind of glory they, too, will one day
   enjoy because of Him.

   [48]2:11. He that sanctifieth is Christ and they who sanctified are
   saints or Christians. Both they and Christ are all of one Father --
   God. For this reason Christ is not ashamed or embarrassed to call them
   brethren. Christ did not call us His brethren because He approved of
   our live or agreed with all our ideas. Brotherhood is not dependent on
   such things, though endorsement involves them. Christ did not endorse
   the thoughts and behavior of all his brethren; He simply called them
   brothers. The basis of brotherhood is a common fatherhood. Those who
   have the same father should not be embarrassed to call one another
   brethren.

   [49]2:12. The words of Psalm 22:22 are quoted in the mouth of Jesus.
   The psalmist calls on God for deliverance from enemies. He hopefully
   affirms that he will yet declare God's name among his brethren in the
   congregation of God's people. The word usually translated church refers
   numerous times in the Greek Old Testament to the Jews in solemn
   assembly. Psalm 22 is quite descriptive of Jesus, and the entire psalm
   was generally understood by Christ and His apostles as predictive of
   the suffering of the Messiah and the glory which would follow. Jesus
   suffered personally, was delivered by God, and now lives to declare
   God's salvation among His brethren.

   [50]2:13. Words similar to I will put my trust in him are found in the
   Greek Old Testament at II Samuel 22:3; Psalm 18:2 and Isaiah 8:17. The
   point of the quotation here is that Jesus, like His human brothers, had
   to depend on God and trust in Him (see Mark 14:32-36). Luke only of the
   Evangelists records the dying words of Christ: "Father, into thy hands
   I commend my spirit" (23:46) -- and Luke's Gospel highlights the
   humanity of Jesus and His identification with mankind throughout. The
   particular verb form given in Jesus' statement in the verse just
   mentioned stresses the extreme personal trust Jesus felt in committing
   His life to the Father's care (see also I Peter 2:23; 4:19).The next
   quotation is certainly from Isaiah 8:18 (which argues for Isaiah 8:17
   in the previous citation). The meaning here is that Jesus is one with
   His human brethren in obedience to God as Father. The words of this
   quotation should not be pressed too far. Jesus is brother to the
   saints, not their father.

   [51]2:14. Since God's other children are necessarily partakers of flesh
   and blood, with all that is implied in that statement, Christ also took
   part of the same. He died, as they do, but through His death he
   destroyed or nullified the strength of the devil who had the power of
   death over man because of sin. Since Jesus had no sin of His own, the
   devil had no power over Him. When Christ entered the grave, therefore,
   He was not bound. Rather He walked in free-handed, picked up the keys
   and came out again in triumph! (See Revelation 1:17-18.)

   [52]2:15. Because Jesus rose from the dead, death can no longer hold
   its former terror for the man who trusts in Jesus. By His resurrection,
   Christ was able to deliver mankind from the bondage in which he is
   bound all his lifetime; that is, the bondage of the fear of death.
   Because one man has conquered death, Satan is immobilized and all men
   are potentially free of death's rule.

   The same power which brought Jesus out of Hades will also bring out His
   saints (see Romans 8:11; II Corinthians 4:14; I Thessalonians 4:14). It
   is interesting that the ancient Greeks called their burial-ground a
   "necropolis" city of the dead, but that since Christ we call it a
   "cemetery" -- sleeping place. One man has been to the city of the dead
   and returned! Because He did, we will.

   [53]2:16. The word translated took on may mean either "to take hold of
   for oneself" -- the idea represented in the King James Version, or "to
   take hold of someone to help him" -- as probably is the case here. From
   this second meaning the word may mean simply "to have an interest in,
   show concern for, or help" someone. It is true that Jesus took on
   Himself the nature of man and not angel, and verses 5-15 have been
   given to that theme. This verse seems to speak, however, of Jesus
   taking hold of man to help him. Angels did not need redemption and
   apparently fallen angels can not be redeemed -- but man both needed it
   and would receive it. Jesus became a man to accomplish man's needed
   redemption ( [54]1:3; [55]2:9; [56]notes on 10:1-14).

   Jesus was born to save His Jewish people from their sins (Matthew 1:21)
   and to fulfill the promises made to the fathers (Acts 13:32-33; Romans
   15:8). To that end He became one of the seed of Abraham. But by the
   grace of God He also tasted death for every man ( [57]Hebrews 2:9), so
   that gentiles as well as Jews may praise God for His mercy (Romans
   15:9).

   [58]2:17. Wherefore, because Jesus took on the responsibility of saving
   man, in all things it was necessary for Him to be made like unto his
   brethren. God's design for man's salvation consisted of sending a
   representative man who could do for man what man had been unable to do
   for himself -- live an acceptable life before God. Because Jesus was
   this chosen and well-beloved Servant of the Father, and in order to
   carry out this divine mission, He became in every respect like His
   human brethren, though without sin.

   He was divine, God in the flesh, and we must never forget that. But we
   should not forget either that He was fully human. Jesus was a man, with
   every human temptation, desire and sorrow. If His deity had precluded
   any of these He could not have been a truly representative man and
   could have become neither Savior not even a fair example.Because He did
   fully identify with His human brethren, yet remained faithful to God in
   all His life, He became a perfect high priest, both merciful to man and
   faithful or reliable in His relationship to God. As high priest He
   first made reconciliation for the sins of all His people, then became
   Mediator on their behalf before God.

   [59]2:18. Because he himself hath suffered, being tempted through every
   possible allurement and enticement of Satan including an undeserved
   death, he has the power and is able to succor or render aid and comfort
   to His people when they are tempted. He became a son of man that we
   might become sons of God. He took our place, died our death -- that we
   might enjoy His life and the blessings it made possible.

   But He not only died for us -- He first lived for us. While this point
   is frequently overlooked, it is this which made the first possible and
   meaningful. It is only by His perfect life -- lived on our behalf and
   in our stead, then offered to the Father and accepted by Him -- that we
   can be made accepted, for our own imperfect lives are never perfectly
   acceptable to the Father. Salvation is by the grace of God from
   beginning to end, and it was by the grace of God that Jesus tasted
   death for every man.

   Moses could give a law but only Jesus could live that law. Unless we
   see Him in this light He will mean little more to us than Moses did to
   the Jew. And great as Moses was, he was not in the same category with
   the Son who became man. This point our author develops in the next
   chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER THREE

   The writer has shown Jesus to be superior to the prophets as a
   spokesman for God. As the Son, Christ's name or position is far greater
   than that of any angel. Yet He became one of us, to bring us to our
   intended glory. Through His own suffering and temptations He was
   qualified to serve perfectly as priest and comforter to His suffering
   and tempted brethren on earth.

   Now the author turns to other matters (led, of course, by the Spirit of
   God). Moses was the chief character of the Old Covenant, and was
   respected by the Hebrews as the foremost leader of their religion and
   life. Jesus is prophet and priest of the New Covenant, and Christians
   are to be faithful to Him in all things. The Hebrew Christians were
   being tempted to leave Christ and return to Moses. To prevent this,
   chapter three shows Christ's superiority over Moses. It shows the
   possibility of apostasy and destruction, based on the former example of
   God's Old Testament people under )loses. The chapter then urges extreme
   caution in maintaining a faithful heart lest the Christian, too, fall
   by disbelief.

   3:1. Wherefore, or because of what has gone before specifically because
   of the divine appointment of Christ as perfect prophet and because of
   His absolute perfection as sympathetic and faithful priest -- the
   admonition follows. The holy brethren are Christians. The phrase
   literally means "brothers who are set apart (from the world and sin)
   and are dedicated (to the service of God through Christ)." Christians
   are saints or holy ones, not because of their own achievements in
   attaining purity of life (see I Corinthians 1:2; 6:11), though that is
   a necessity, but because God has called them holy, in Jesus Christ.
   Christ is made unto us "sanctification" or holiness (I Corinthians
   1:30). We are holy in Him.

   Yet we are commanded to become holy, just as God is holy (I Peter
   1:15-16). We are to perfect holiness in the fear of God (II Corinthians
   7:1). Without holiness no man can see God ( [60]Hebrews 12:14). In the
   economy of the New Testament, however, God first pronounces men to be
   what He desires (on the basis of the finished work of Christ and their
   union with Him) and then causes them to become what He has already
   called them.

   The term "saints" is one of the most frequently used descriptions of
   God's people in the New Testament. The word is always in the plural;
   one does not read of "Saint So-and-so." All God's people are saints, as
   described above. It is possible that the tendency of modern Christians
   to neglect this term in their common vocabulary has contributed to the
   lack of sanctification in the church today. We will do no harm, and
   perhaps a great deal of good, to revive the usage of Scriptural terms
   and phrases.

   The saints are partakers or partners in the heavenly calling. Their
   heavenly invitation to be God's people leads them, in response to the
   gospel, to become partners and sharers in a heavenly way of life. Now
   the writer urges them to consider Christ Jesus. The word translated
   consider means to look at something or someone with great care. It
   involves not only looking at, but thinking about. One must spend time
   to fulfill this word. The object of such contemplation is here Christ
   Jesus.

   Many times in Scripture the writer makes a point of emphasis by the
   order of words. Frequently the term Christ Jesus points to Jesus, not
   in His earthly ministry, but as the Christ at God's right hand -- the
   resurrected and glorified Jesus of Nazareth. On the other hand, the
   expression Jesus Christ sometimes (but not always) stresses the work,
   or ministry, or person of Jesus as a man and as one of us. Here we are
   to consider our heavenly Lord: in all His offices, His splendor, His
   rank and His glory.

   We are specifically to consider Christ as the Apostle and High Priest
   of our profession. The term apostle means one sent or a messenger.
   Jesus was sent by the Father to be Savior of the world (I John 4:14 and
   other passages). Moses also was sent by God to accomplish a typical
   "salvation" of God's people from bondage (Exodus 3:10), though Moses is
   never called an apostle.

   Jesus is also our High Priest, and the writer has spoken briefly of
   this office in the previous chapter. Later he will develop the thought
   in detail. Here he entreats us to reflect on Christ Jesus: as Apostle
   -- sent by God's authority to man; as High Priest -- going before God
   on man's behalf; in all things -- superior to every previous agent of
   God.

   Our profession or confession is first our oral acknowledgement of faith
   in Jesus as Christ and Lord (see Matthew 16:16; Romans 10:9-10; II
   Corinthians 9:13; I Timothy 6: 12-13; Hebrews [61]4:14; [62]10:23).
   Then it is our state of life based on that confession, a profession or
   declaration of the faith which has been confessed.

   3:2. Christ was faithful or reliable or trustworthy with reference to
   God the Father, who appointed him apostle and priest. Moses also was
   faithful to God in all his house. The writer does not minimize the
   faithfulness or the function of Moses. He praises and commends Moses
   for faithful service. But he then shows, on the basis of the heavenly
   realities, that Christ is far superior to Moses by virtue of His
   greater person and function.

   3:3. Christ is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, not because
   Moses was unfaithful, for he was not, but be. cause of the inherent
   function of both men in God's plan. The man who builds a house hath
   more honor than the house. We admire a beautiful building, but we
   regard more highly the architect who designed it and the superintendent
   who saw it rise.

   3:4. So far as the work of salvation is concerned, the one who builds
   all things is God. He is the grand architect and superintendent of the
   entire scheme of redemption. He is its originator and its goal. The
   Word which became flesh was one with God the Father. Therefore Christ,
   who was that Word, is the builder of the house, while Moses -- though
   faithful -- was a part in the divine house.

   3:5. Christ is superior to Moses in other points as well. Moses verily
   was faithful, but in God's household, as a servant and as a member of
   the household. His faithfulness to God served as a testimony to the
   reliability and trustworthiness of the message which he spoke from God.
   The point here is based on Numbers 12:6-8, which is quoted in part.
   There God testified to the faithfulness of Moses and rewarded that
   faithfulness by speaking directly with Moses in revealing His will.
   Moses' personal faithfulness as a worker in God's house served as a
   witness to the word which he revealed from God.

   3:6. But Christ is a son (not a servant) over (not in and part of) his
   own house (not that of someone else). Now we learn what is meant by the
   house so far as Christ is concerned. We, the church, God's people under
   Christ are the house of God (I Timothy 3:15). Christ promised to
   "build" it (Matthew 16:18), and He began that work on Pentecost. The
   church is composed of "living stones" (I Peter 2:5; Ephesians 2:20) --
   those individuals who by faith and baptism have come into union with
   Christ, have become members of His spiritual body and, collectively,
   are His church. Moses was a faithful servant in the Old Testament
   "house" of God (and of Christ), but Christ is the faithful Son over His
   own house. He is far superior to Moses, though Moses was a great and
   faithful man of God.

   But there is a divine if, so far as we are concerned. We are His house,
   if we hold fast the confidence, the boldness based on inner assurance,
   and the rejoicing or boasting of the hope firm unto the end. This is
   the message of the tire Bible and is particularly the theme of the book
   of Hebrews. The reward is of grace, but it depends on faith And a
   saving faith is one which trusts and obeys until the very end. It is
   not enough to begin, only to fall along the way. Saving faith, true
   grounds of rejoicing, a genuine hope -- all these depend on
   steadfastness and continue trust throughout life. The Hebrew Christians
   urgently needed that lesson. We are no less in need of it today.

   [63]3:7-8. As an incentive to steadfastness, our author points to the
   example of God's people under Moses (see also I Corinthians 10:1-13).
   If they fell from God's favor through disbelief, the same fate could
   befall God's people today. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith in Psalm
   95:7-11), To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

   Psalm 95 is a call to worship God. The psalmist bases his call on God's
   deity (verse three), His might as creator and sustainer (verses four
   through six) and His election of and covenant relationship with Israel
   (verse seven). He then warns against a hard or disobedient heart, which
   he says will lead only to destruction. This happened to the fathers in
   the wilderness, the psalmist points out, and it can happen to God's
   people in his day. Now the psalmist's point is made (using his own
   words) by the writer to the Hebrews, who applies it to the believers of
   his day. God's people have fallen before through unbelief and an evil
   heart. They can do the same again.

   Today those who hear his voice are not to harden their hearts. This
   happened with the Jews in the provocation (Hebrew: Massah) in the day
   of temptation (Hebrew: Meribah) in the wilderness. The event mentioned
   here is recorded in Exodus 17:1-7. The unbelief of the Jews then was
   essentially a lack of trust. They doubted that God, who had called them
   from Egypt, would provide for them in the wilderness and see them
   safely to the promised land. This lack of faith led to murmuring. That
   murmuring was a provocation of God and was sin. Christians are exhorted
   not to distrust God, murmur and sin, but to have full confidence in
   Him. In that confident trust they are to do His will as fully and
   exactly as possible.

   The Hebrew Christians were in danger of leaving Christ for Moses. The
   analogy here suggests that back of their threatened apostasy was a
   basic lack of trust in the work of Christ as perfect sacrifice, priest
   and Savior. They were not confident of their standing before God.
   Because their basis of salvation was the finished redemptive work of
   the Son, such lack of confidence reflected a fundamental lack of faith
   in Christ. This unbelief was sinful -- and ft was the same kind of sin
   which led to the Jews' destruction centuries before in the wilderness.

   [64]3:9-11. Our author is still quoting from Psalm 95. The fathers in
   the wilderness tempted God, proved Him in the evil sense of putting Him
   to the test and saw His works for forty years so that they should have
   no excuse. They grieved God by distrusting Him. Because of this
   unbelief God swore in His wrath that they would not enter into His
   rest. Chapter four will discuss the meaning of God's rest. Here the
   reference is made without elaboration.

   3:12. Rather than take heed, we would say (almost literally) "look
   out!" An evil heart of unbelief is a heart, or disposition, or spirit,
   which does not so trust God that it accepts what He says with
   confidence and then walks with trust in Him and in His word. Departing
   is from a word closely related to that which gives "apostasy." The
   child of God can become so corrupted by a distrustful and unfaithful
   heart that he finally forsakes God completely.

   Such distrust of Christ can lead to apostasy in two directions. Some
   who begin to doubt their acceptance on the basis of Christ's perfect
   life and blood will despair of all hope and go back into sin and the
   world. Others will seek to help or add to their spiritual stature by
   their own strict observance of rules and regulations -- which they
   themselves will choose as important or receive as such from someone
   else. When motivated by a lack of trust in the standing Christ makes
   possible, this too is sinful.

   It was this error in part which led to the writing of Galatians
   (against Judaizing tendencies), Colossians (against an apparently
   gentile heresy which had adopted rituals and philosophies from many
   sources), I John (against a budding philosophical heresy later known as
   gnosticism) and even Hebrews. Christ is sufficient as Savior, and the
   man who truly has Him has enough. Steadfast faithfulness to Christ is
   an evidence of this inward faith, and is a necessity if one is to be
   saved in the end. That is the point of this chapter.

   3:13. So that Christians will not fall through unbelief, they are
   admonished to exhort or encourage or comfort one another. This is to be
   done daily, while it is called today. Such refreshing of the spirit,
   such rededication to God and to Christ, will prevent one's being
   hardened or calloused through the deceitfulness or error of sin.

   This exhorting is the duty of every Christian. Barnes asks:

     How often do church-members see a fellow-member go astray without
     any exhortation or admonition. ...Belonging to the same family;
     having the same interests in religion; and all suffering when one
     suffers, why should they not be allowed tenderly and kindly to
     exhort one another to a holy life?

   In a special sense, this exhorting is to be done by the elders or
   shepherds of the flock, whose chief duty before God is to watch for
   souls ( [65]Hebrews 13:17; see Ezekiel 33: 7-9). Milligan's comments
   are still appropriate:

     Do not procrastinate, or put off till tomorrow what should be done
     today.... If the members of every congregation of disciples would
     all watch over one another, not as censors, but as members of the
     body of Christ, how many errors might be corrected in their
     incipiency. But... how many delinquent Christians are allowed to
     become hardened in sin, before even the Elders of the Church call on
     them and admonish them! How very unlike these Elders are to the Good
     Shepherd that careth for the sheep.

   While such exhorting is to be done daily, it is one purpose of the
   lard's Day assembly as well. Those who are absent from the gatherings
   of the saints fail both to receive needful exhortation and to
   contribute their encouragement to others ( [66]Hebrews 10:24-25).

   The neglect of Christian exhortation is surely among the greatest
   failings of God's people today. The mad rush for the world's goods, the
   excessive drive for material prosperity, the disproportionate love of
   pleasure, the self-centered living of a modern age -- these all have
   practically extinguished the selfless and obedient concern of saints in
   too many places for one another, and the careful exhortation which
   should grow out of that concern has died before it was born. Any
   congregation that ignores this divine obligation has no right to parade
   itself as a faithful church of Christ Jesus, regardless of its other
   qualities or so-called distinctive marks.

   3:14. We are made partakers or partners of Christ only if we hold fast
   the beginning of our confidence or grounds of hope steadfast unto the
   end or conclusion or goal. Our author addresses his readers in verse
   one as partakers of the heavenly calling. But while the call has been
   issued and the journey begun, the trip is not completed until its
   destination is reached. As the Israelites under Moses fell after they
   had begun, so Christians will be Christ's partners in glory only if
   they are faithful until the conclusion of life and the attaining of the
   goal.

   3:15. He repeats the admonition from the psalm, this time with emphasis
   on the word provocation.

   3:16. Some, after they had heard, did provoke God. This is probably
   best translated as a question. Who did provoke? The answer is: all that
   came out of Egypt by Moses.

   3:17. With whom was he grieved forty years? A few reprobates? No, it
   was with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness,
   and that number included the entire company of adults who left Egypt,
   with the exceptions of Joshua and Caleb. The danger of leaving faith in
   Christ is grave because the possibility is both real and widespread.

   3:18. To whom did God swear that they should not enter into his rest?
   It was to them that believed not. In this case they had stopped
   believing although they had begun their journey in faith.

   3:19. So we see, he concludes, that they could not enter in because of
   disbelief. Their death in the wilderness was not due to Moses'
   unfaithfulness -- he was faithful in all God's house. It was not
   because God was unable to save them -- He showed His works forty years
   in the wilderness. The reason they fell was simple and single: they
   stopped believing and trusting God. The next verse of exhortation
   should be included in chapter three: Let us therefore fear, lest, a
   promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem
   to come short of it. It happened once before. It can happen again.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER FOUR

   The author continues his line of reasoning begun in chapter three.
   There is no break of thought at this chapter division.

   4:1. Let God's people today fear and not fall. This is a real
   possibility now and was then for the Hebrew Christians or there would
   be no warning. In the midst of the various and passing issues of each
   generation, God's people would do well to remember that the fundamental
   and eternal issue has always been belief versus unbelief and that God
   (and God alone) will test each individual (as an individual) on that
   issue. This point should never be forgotten.

   The exhortations in Hebrews are rich in edification, and the "let us"
   admonitions are translated from a verb form called the "hortatory
   subjunctive" (see [67]4:11, [68]14, [69]16; 6:1; [70]10:22-24;
   [71]12:1, [72]28; [73]13:13, [74]15).

   A promise has been left for us, although the Old Testament saints and
   apostates have died. That promise concerns entering into God's rest.
   The same offer was made the Jews, as our writer explains, but because
   of disbelief they did not receive the promised blessing. The same offer
   is now given to believers in Christ. Christians are to fear, however,
   lest any of them should seem to come short of it.

   To come short might mean to fall short of attaining the promised rest,
   and that point is well taken in this context. But it may also mean to
   come short of being offered the promise of God in the first place, and
   the next verses, as well as the verb should seem, appear to support
   this interpretation.

   Some of the Hebrew saints appear to have been disappointed in their
   immediate expectations as Christians. They had given up their ancient
   religion, they had suffered persecution for their faith, they had
   endured afflictions for Christ's sake. It seemed to some that all their
   sacrifices had been in vain. They had not entered into rest but into
   distress. It seemed to some that the promise of a rest surely did not
   apply in their case, for they had not found it. The writer shows that
   the promise not only does apply to the Christian, but that since it was
   not fulfilled in the past it must apply to God's people in Christ.

   4:2. God preached a gospel (good news) to the Jews concerning a
   promised land. Unto us Christians is given good news of present
   deliverance in Christ and a part in the world to come. The believer is
   therefore to fear, for the mere fact that he has heard good news does
   not mean that he will enter into the promise. The Jews also heard good
   news, yet they died in the wilderness.

   The word preached by Moses did not profit them, because it was not
   mixed with faith in them that heard it. The figure here is taken from
   the physical body and the digestive system. The Greek word translated
   mixed was used both of the digestion of food in the stomach and the
   assimilation of nutrients throughout the body. Regardless of the
   beauty, taste or value of food, it is of no use to the body unless it
   is properly digested and assimilated.

   The same is true spiritually. Israel heard the word of God but failed
   to "digest" it through faith and assimilate it to their profit. Food
   improperly digested will actually do harm. So also the word of God,
   which is given to save, will be a testimony and assurance of
   destruction unless it is mixed with faith (II Corinthians 2:15-16). It
   is not enough to hear God's word. It must be received in faith and held
   to in patience.

   4:3. We who have believed are the ones who enter into rest. Faith is a
   necessity, as demonstrated by the experience both of those who fell and
   those who attained. The rest into which believers enter (in promise now
   and in actuality if they persevere) is the same rest of which God spoke
   in Psalm 95:11, as mentioned already in [75]Hebrews 3:11.

   Because God swore in His wrath that Israel would not enter into His
   rest, it is evident that (1) He had a rest Himself, and (2) He had
   planned from the beginning for man to share in it. The quotation is
   translated correctly in [76]3:11, and should be so worded here. God's
   works were finished from the foundation of the world. Since then He has
   been in His own rest, and has sought faithful men who would enjoy it
   with Him.

   [77]4:4-5. This is proved by two quotations from Scripture. God did
   rest the seventh day from all his works, according to Genesis 2:2. And
   then He swore in Psalm 95:11 concerning His rest, saying if they shall
   enter (correctly translated, "they shall surely not enter") into my
   (the pronoun is emphatic) rest.

   [78]4:6-7. Since it has always been God's intention that some must
   enter into His rest, and since the Jews to whom it was first preached
   did not enter because of unbelief, God offered the rest again to those
   living in the time of David. They were admonished like the Jews in the
   wilderness to hear his voice and harden not their hearts (Psalm
   95:7-8). God's saving time is today, whenever that may be. Any day is a
   day of salvation in which God's word comes to man and is received in
   faith.

   4:8. The fact that the rest was offered to men in the time of David
   proves that the rest involved was not that found in the land of Canaan.
   If Joshua (Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua) had given
   them rest in the land, God would not afterward have spoken of another
   day. Yet He did as we have just seen.

   4:9. The conclusion must be that a rest remains, even today, for the
   people of God who will trust in Christ.

   4:10. He has not been speaking concerning an ordinary human rest, which
   is brief and is followed by more labor. The man who is entered into
   God's rest has ceased from his works forever, just as God did from his
   at the end of creation week. This is a rest of accomplished purpose, of
   fulfilled action, of completed labor. It is another way of describing
   the salvation of [79]1:14 and [80]2:3, or the world to come of [81]2:5.
   Because this is the nature of the promised rest, it is also apparent
   that the Sabbath rest of the Jews is not meant, for that was followed
   by six days of more labor and had to be repeated every week. In
   addition, the Sabbath rest was commanded but this rest of God was
   always promised (see also Matthew 11:28-30; Revelation 14:13).

   4:11. This being the case, all effort is in order to enter into that
   rest. Diligence is necessary, because Christians can fall after the
   same example of unbelief seen in the Jews under Moses.

   4:12. Diligence is necessary also because of the nature of the word of
   God. It is living or quick and energetic or powerful. It is sharper
   than any two-edged sword. The figure continues in saying that the
   word's fine edge can cut between soul and spirit, or to the dividing of
   joints and marrow. The author is not intending to give a scientific or
   spiritual analysis of the nature and composition of man. He is
   stressing the power and piercing energy of the word of God. God's word
   is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Therefore all
   unbelief will be apparent to God. It is of the utmost importance that
   His word be received in faith -- it is an instrument too dangerous for
   trifling (see verse two).

   4:13. He who knows the heart will not be misled by duplicity or
   hypocrisy. Nor will He overlook the good and honest heart, though
   sometimes men do (see John 2:24-25). All things are naked and opened
   before God's eyes. These words may come from either of two sources.

   The priest would inspect a sacrifice with care, lest it be blemished;
   God's scrutiny of the heart is no less meticulous. It is said also that
   criminals of the first century would sometimes have their head pulled
   backward on public display, exposing the face to the contempt of
   general gaze. Nothing in man's heart or life can escape the certain
   gaze of God -- a gaze of disapproval and severity if what He sees is
   not holy and faithful. But for some there is also a gaze of sympathy
   and tenderness, as the next verse will show.

   4:14. The writer changes his tone from severe warning to gentle appeal.
   Our high priest carefully searches the heart in total justice, but He
   is sympathetic to the human condition of His faithful ones when they
   stumble. We have a great high priest, not on earth, but passed into the
   heavens. He is Jesus the Son of God -- that same Son exalted in chapter
   one. Because He is our high priest, we are to hold fast our profession
   (see [82]notes at 3:1).

   4:15. Christ can be touched or, literally, can sympathize, with our
   weaknesses or the feeling of our infirmities. He ho been tempted or put
   to the test, in all points like as we are yet without sin. Because He
   was without sin, Christ both saves and judges man. He judges man in
   presenting Mg perfect life when man's is so sinful. At the same time He
   saves man by that perfect life, because He gave R for man's Am,
   presenting ft to the Father in the place of man's. Christ appeared once
   before God and presented His perfect life as atonement for our sins and
   as justification for our forgiveness. He will appear a second time to
   men, without sin, bringing salvation to those who look for Him (
   [83]9:26, 28; [84]10:4-18).

   4:16. Because we have a sympathetic high priest, one who measures His
   feelings on the basis of Ms own experiences as a man, we are exhorted
   and tenderly encouraged to come boldly unto His throne of grace. There
   we may obtain mercy, and there we may find grace to help in the time of
   our need.

   Mercy in this verse stands for a Greek word which in the Greek Old
   Testament represented the Hebrew word for Jehovah's "covenant mercy" or
   "lovingkindness." Throughout the Old Testament, God demonstrated this
   lovingkindness in acts of deliverance and grace. The same word
   described the mercy the people of the covenant were to show each other
   as joint recipients of Jehovah's covenant-mercy.

   Psalm 136 is a psalm of praise for God's covenant-mercy, and it
   illustrates the many forms it might take. A complete concordance or
   book of word studies will give many wonderful insights into this
   concept from the Old Testament. Christians receive the same kind of
   covenant kindness, mercy, and steadfast love through their union with
   Jesus Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER FIVE

   The author has spoken several times already in this epistle concerning
   Christ as a priest. Christ is our priest because He has purged our sins
   -- that is part of His more excellent name ( [85]1:3). In this He was
   the sin-offering as well as the administrating officer ( [86]2:9). His
   identification with His people is seen not only in His tasting death
   for all men but also in His being made like them in all respects.
   Because Christ has suffered and been tempted, He is a merciful and
   faithful high priest, able to help those who are tempted (
   [87]2:17-18).

   As high priest, Christ is faithful to God as well as sympathetic to
   man. In this He is like Moses, though by position He is far superior to
   that man of God ( [88]3:1-6). His sacrificial death has been
   accomplished and Christ is now in heaven. As our great high priest, He
   sympathizes with our plight and supplies mercy and grace to meet our
   needs ( [89]4:14-16). Chapter five presents Christ once more as priest,
   this time in terms of His divine appointment, and with a word of
   introduction to the particular kind of priesthood into which He has
   entered.

   5:1. For indicates that what follows is based on the final remarks of
   chapter four. Every high priest in the Jewish order is taken from among
   men and is a man himself. The high priest's ministry involves both God
   and man. He is ordained or appointed or divinely named for the sake of
   men. That is, he works on their behalf and, we might even say, in their
   stead. He also serves in things pertaining to God. The high priest's
   central function is making offerings to God for sins.

   Gifts and sacrifices stand for the total offerings of the high priest
   to God on behalf of the people (see also [90]8:3; [91]9:9). Some have
   explained gifts as non-blood offerings and sacrifices as blood
   offerings. This is not consistent, however, with other passages
   (Genesis 4:3-4 in the Greek Old Testament, for example) where these
   words appear with the meanings exactly reversed. A better distinction
   is made in terms of purpose. Gifts are thank-offerings (eucharistic);
   sacrifices are sin-offerings (expiatory). If this is in the author's
   mind, for sins modifies only sacrifices in the sentence and not both
   terms.

   5:2. The high priest must be able to have compassion. Literally he
   "measures his feelings" with the people. He is not excessively swayed
   by harsh justice, nor moved overmuch by indulgent pity. He must measure
   his feelings in view of the people's responsibilities on the one hand,
   but in view of their circumstances and weaknesses on the other. Himself
   a man, he is aware of human weakness. Appointed by God for divine
   service, he is aware of God's just and holy demands. The Levitical high
   priest served in a very exalted and holy position. His was a
   representative role: representing God among the people, and
   representing the people before God (Exodus 28:29-30, 36-43; see
   Leviticus 16).

   Priestly offerings were for the benefit of the ignorant, that is, those
   whose sin was unknown to them at the time they committed it, and for
   those who were out of the way, which is the literal meaning of erring.
   The original construction of this verse suggests that both terms refer
   to the same people, those who err through ignorance. The point is that
   priestly service and offerings were for sins of weakness or ignorance.
   There was no sacrifice for presumptuous sins (Numbers 15:30-31; see
   verses 22ff in the same chapter). The Hebrews author later gives a
   similar warning to those under the new covenant ( [92]10:26-29).

   It was necessary for the priest to be compassionate, for he also was
   compassed or surrounded with infirmity or weakness. A play on the word
   may be intended here, for the same word which means "surrounded" at
   other times means "clothed." The priest was separated from his fellow
   Jews and was distinguished from them by the holy robes of his office.
   Yet he was one of them in weakness and sin. Here was an imperfection of
   the Old Testament priesthood -the priest, like every other man, was
   clothed in weakness. The fact that he also wore priestly robes did not
   change that! It remained for Christ to serve as perfect priest through
   His own sinlessness and to offer a perfect sacrifice which could remove
   sins forever.

   5:3. The Levitical priest was obligated to offer a sacrifice for
   himself as well as one for the people. Though he was called by God and
   was appointed to a sacred office, he was still a sinner himself.

   5:4. No man among the Jews took the priesthood to himself. The priests
   were appointed of God, as signified in the divine appointment of Aaron
   their head (Exodus 28:1).

   5:5. Nor did Christ glorify himself by taking the office of high priest
   presumptuously, but He was so honored or glorified by God the Father.
   Two Messianic psalms are quoted here and applied to Jesus Christ as Son
   and priest. The first is Psalm 2:7, which was used to prove Christ's
   Sonship in 1:5 (see the [93]notes there on this quotation).

   5:6. The second quotation is from Psalm 110:4, and will figure
   prominently in the discussion of the next two chapters of Hebrews. As
   Psalm two joined the position of Son to that of King, so Psalm 110
   related the functions of King and Priest. By using both these passages,
   the writer shows Christ to be Son (which in chapter one had the
   significance of Prophet), Priest (which he is about to discuss) and
   King. Our author used the first verse of Psalm 110 in 1:13 and in the
   verses now following he will discuss verse four of that psalm.

   God said to Christ in His resurrection, "Thou art my Son, this day have
   I begotten thee" (Acts 13:33). At the same time, according to the
   present passage, He constituted Hhn high priest. Here the emphasis will
   be on the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood ("thou art a priest
   forever"); Acts 13 also stresses Christ's unending life (verses 34-37).
   Here the eternal priesthood of Christ means continual salvation for His
   people ( [94]7:23-25); the "therefore" of Acts 13:38 shows the same
   consequential blessing.

   Aaron was not only called of God (Exodus 28:1), he was also confirmed
   as God's chosen one by a miracle of new life. When Korah, Dathan and
   Abiram questioned Aaron's authority and office (Numbers 16:1-3), the
   ground opened beneath them and their families, swallowing them alive,
   and a fire from God consumed their followers (verses 31-35). God then
   confirmed Aaron's appointment by making his rod (a piece of dead wood)
   come to life again, bear buds, bloom blossoms and yield almonds
   (Numbers 17).

   Christ was called by God to be high priest. He, too, was confirmed by a
   miracle of new life. His dead body, wrapped in burial clothes and
   entombed for three days, was given life by the power of God. He now
   lives to make priestly intercession for His people, through the merits
   of His own sacrificial blood.

   Woe to any person who questions Christ's divine appointment or loses
   confidence in His sacred work of redemption! The "gainsaying of Korah"
   is still a present danger (Jude 11). The first readers of Hebrews were
   urged to put their confidence in Christ as God's appointed high priest
   divinely-appointed, all-sufficient and everlasting. That exhortation is
   no less needful today among those claiming to follow Him.

   5:7. Who refers to Christ, not Melchizedek. In the days of his flesh
   refers to the earthly life of Christ in a human body. It is the time of
   His flesh and blood (2:14) when He partook of the seed of Abraham
   (2:16). This was the time in which He was in all points tempted (
   [95]4:15).

   [96]Chapter ten will detail the significance of Christ's fleshly body.
   Here the intent is to demonstrate what was stated in [97]verse five:
   Christ did not take the office of high priest to Himself but was given
   the position by God. It was not attained by arrogant assumption but by
   obedient suffering. Suffering and obedience are joined in the verses
   which follow and together are related to salvation, first in the life
   of Christ and then in the lives of those He saves.

   Four terms express the intensity of Christ's suffering in the face of
   death. Prayers signify pleadings or beggings, with reference to a need.
   Supplications stress the act of imploring or asking. Strong crying
   shows the depth of these calls for help. Tears are not mentioned in the
   Gospel accounts of Gethsemane, but were certainly visible on that
   occasion as an external indication of the utter agony of soul within
   the Lord (Matthew 26:36-44; Mark 14:3241; Luke 22:39-45).

   These prayers were offered to him that was able to save him from death,
   that is, the Father (see [98]notes at 2:12-13). Some commentators see
   two prayers here: that God would save Christ from death on the cross,
   or that He would save Him from death by resurrection if the first
   prayer was not answered. Lenski correctly notes that Jesus is nowhere
   pictured as praying for the resurrection. On that basis he argues
   strongly for the first sense only. God was able to save the Son from
   the cross - by twelve legions of angels, if necessary (Matthew 26:53).
   But it was not the Father's win to do that, nor was it in accord with
   the Scriptures, as Jesus Himself had pointed out to His disciples
   (Matthew 26:54).

   The statement that Christ was heard in these prayers is confusing to
   some, but need not be when thought is given to the actual prayer of the
   Lord. Christ did not pray simply that the cup of suffering might pass
   Him by, though that was included in His request (see references above).
   His primary prayer -- and this is the writer's chief point in this
   verse -- was for the will of God to be done! That prayer was answered
   -- by the death, yes, and by the resurrection of the Son who willingly
   submitted to the Father's sovereign will! See the references given
   above, also John 12:23-33. Again there may be an allusion to Psalm 22,
   where the speaker cries to God (verse two) and is heard (verse 24). See
   the [99]comments at 2:12 on that psalm.

   Christ was heard in that he feared. Literally the text says, "because
   of (His) reverent fear" or "fearful reverence." "If it be possible, let
   this cup pass from me," prayed the Savior, with strong crying and
   tears. But with the same intensity He respectfully and fearfully
   climaxed that prayer, "nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done!"

   We are dealing here with the perfect obedience of the Son of God. This
   is an obedience unto death, an obedience perfected only in suffering.
   In. the face of such absolute dedication to God's will -- and that at
   the cost of all personal claims and human ambitions or even life -- in
   the face of this divine obedience angels weep, demons shudder and
   sinful man must cry out in abject remorse, "God, be merciful to me, a
   sinner!"

   How inadequate all our obedience is in this light! How meager our
   dedication to the Father's will! How far short of God's glory and the
   Savior's example we see our own self-willed lives! Our Lord did not
   presume anything of His own accord. He did not hold back anything in
   His obedience and submission to the Father's perfect will. With every
   ounce of His deepest feeling He threw Himself in His Father's arms,
   there to depend on the Father's strength as He exclaimed simply, "Thy
   will be done!"

   5:8. Yet being the Son -- that more excellent Son of chapter one --
   Christ learned obedience. The Greek here says "the" obedience, as if to
   underscore the thought. Christ learned obedience in experiencing
   absolute submission to God's will. This does not mean that His life
   ever contained any element of rebellion or disobedience, for it did
   not. He came for the purpose of doing God's will ( [100]Hebrews 10:7)
   and He finished what He came to do (John 17:4).

   Learned here translates rather a word kin to that from which we have
   "disciple" and "discipline." Christ was the disciple, par excellence.
   He experienced the full discipline of obedience -- even in suffering.
   By His suffering He learned experientially what full obedience means.
   In this He learned and qualified to sanctify those who should put their
   trust in Him. He is now perfectly able to help them when they are
   tempted (see [101]2:17-18).

   5:9. Christ was made perfect, not in a moral sense, but for the
   business of saving. He then became the author or source of eternal
   salvation unto all them that obey him. By the obedience learned only in
   suffering, Christ was made complete as Captain of salvation (2:10). By
   the same suffering and obedience He was perfected as Source of eternal
   salvation. "Captain" signifies "pioneer," and Christ has already gone
   ahead to enter the eternal glory which will be shared one day by the
   "many sons" ( [102]2:10; see [103]6:20).

   Author here means "source," as it is only from Christ, and through Him,
   and by His work of obedience that those "sons" will share in the glory
   He now has as Son. Author may also be translated "cause," suggesting
   that Christ's perfect obedience is the cause of our salvation, not our
   own imperfect obedience, though this very verse affirms the fact of
   obedience on our part if we are recipients of the salvation He has made
   a reality. The English connection between "author" and "authority" is
   not in our word here, though Christ certainly has all authority as Son
   and Lord (Matthew 28:18; Philippians 2:9-11).

   Christ is author or cause or source of salvation to them that obey him.
   It is always the case that blessing follows obedience, though sometimes
   the obedience of one man secures blessing for another. Abraham's
   obedience was the basis on which God blessed his descendants (Genesis
   22:15-18; Deuteronomy 4:37; 9:4-6). How much more does Christ's
   obedience -- a perfect obedience -- result in the perfect salvation of
   all who share sonship with Him (see Romans 5:19). Yet those who share
   Christ's sonship and His righteousness (Isaiah 61:9-11; Jeremiah
   23:5-6; 33:15-16; I Corinthians 1:30; II Corinthians 5:21; Philippians
   3:9) must and will share also with Him in faithful obedience to God an
   obedience in which He led the way, set the example and obtained
   salvation for those who follow.

   5:10. Because Christ did not glorify Himself to be made a high priest
   (verse five), choosing instead the submissiveness of suffering, He was
   called or greeted by God as high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
   Melchizedek held the double office of priest-king, a privilege denied
   the priestly offspring of Levi or the royal heirs of Judah that is,
   until Christ came. Now He, the prophet-Son, serves also as high priest
   and as king.

   5:11. Having introduced Melchizedek, our author immediately leaves him
   for the moment. He attributes this digression in thought to the
   dullness of his hearers. After a warning and exhortation in chapter
   six, he will return to a detailed analysis of Melchizedek's priesthood
   in chapter seven. There he will show Melchizedek's office to be unlike
   that of Aaron's sons, but of the same sort as the Son's which ft
   prefigures.

   We have many things to say is literally "the discourse or conversation
   is much or long." Hard to be uttered does not mean that the writer had
   difficulty expressing himself, but that his discourse concerning
   Melchizedek would be interpreted or explained only with elaboration,
   for which his readers were not prepared. The transmitter was working
   well but the receivers needed repairs!

   Dull of hearing is literally "sluggish or numb in ears (hearing)."
   Lenski remarks: "Unbelief closes the ears; incipient unbelief dulls
   them." These readers had not fallen into apostate unbelief but were
   apparently drifting in that direction. Our author pauses long enough to
   point this out to them and to sharpen their dull ears.

   5:12. For indicates the cause of his statement. With reference to the
   time which has passed since they became Christians, his readers should
   have become teachers. The word here indicates clock-time, not merely
   "occasion" (as in Romans 13:11 and other places).

   Rather than this, however, they still had need for someone to teach
   them again. It is not in difficult matters alone that they are
   ignorant. They need instruction in first principles, the rudimentary
   matters, the spiritual ABC's.

   How well this indictment fits so many in the church today. How many
   there are now who should have been teaching others long ago yet who
   continually need teaching in elementary principles. Some people are
   simply dull of hearing; others are "ever learning and never able to
   come to the knowledge of the truth" (II Timothy 3:7). The first need to
   be sharpened; the second are to be rejected (II Timothy 3:5). The
   recipients of Hebrews were at the first point but not yet to the
   second.

   They were in need of milk, not strong meat or solid food. Milk is a
   predigested food, suited for one who lacks ability to receive and
   digest his own nourishment. The spiritual milk-baby is not able to
   learn and digest his own spiritual food. He depends on someone else to
   do most of his learning and thinking for him. This is a beginning
   point, to be sure, but it should not characterize those who for the
   time ought to be able to teach others.

   A certain measure of the blame for this condition must be put on some
   among the teachers and preachers who have not led the babes to stronger
   food. When the bottle is administered at every feeding time, and often
   the same formula warmed over, the hungry souls can not be expected to
   develop into maturity. Let each teacher and preacher learn from this
   context as well, to follow our author's example as he himself leaves
   the first principles to carry his readers on to maturity and
   perfection.

   5:13. The spiritual infant who still partakes mil is unskillful or
   inexperienced in the word of righteousness. As an infant is without
   experience in eating strong food so long as he remains with milk alone,
   so the believer who never has experience in teaching others will remain
   in need of simple nourishment himself. This is not condoned but
   condemned

   5:14. Strong meat is for the one who is of full age, the perfect or
   mature person. The mature Christian by reason of use or exercise has
   his senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

   Senses translates a word which give us our "aesthetics," though here it
   has a figurative meaning. Exercised is from a word family which gives
   "gymnasium," and suggest perhaps that maturity in spiritual discernment
   comes only through regular workouts.

   To discern good and evil represents the ability and/or the authority to
   make independent moral choices (see Genesis 3:5, 22; Deuteronomy 1:39;
   II Samuel 14:17; 19:35; I Kings 3:9; Isaiah 7:16). The Christian is to
   mature to the point of making his own moral judgements; he is to learn
   to discern the Lord's will in each circumstance of his own life (see
   Romans 12:2; Ephesians 5:10, 17; I Thessalonians 4:1-4).
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER SIX

   6:1. The principles of the doctrine of Christ are the elementary
   matters which had been previously taught to the Hebrew Christians. They
   are encouraged to be leaving these things -- not in the sense of
   rejecting their truthfulness, or attempting to unlearn them, but as a
   child leaves the first reader in school for one more advanced, or as he
   leaves milk for solid nourishment. And they are called to go on to
   perfection or maturity or completion. The idea of perfection will
   reappear in the coming chapters.

   It is necessary to lay a foundation in the construction of a firm
   building, but once the foundation has been laid, it is not put down
   again and again. This point is the basis for verses four through six.
   Those who fall away, having once been instructed in the fundamentals,
   will not be reclaimed by beginning from the first as if they had never
   heard the gospel. if they experienced these initial responses and
   understood these fundamentals -- but then fell away -- they have
   rejected what they know and have no room in their hearts for a
   conversion as at the first. Again is an important word in understanding
   these verses.

   Six matters are listed as elementary principles, and they have been
   variously interpreted. Some take these as elements of Old Testament
   teaching in contrast to the more perfect lessons of the gospel. It is
   true that the terms which follow are all used at times of elements of
   preChristian truth. On the other hand, it seems more nearly correct to
   think of these fundamentals as basics in Christian instruction, both in
   view of the larger context and the specific terms as well.

   The six points are given in three pairs of two each. We might speak of
   these pairs under the headings of preparation, initiation and
   motivation or direction. First mentioned is repentance from dead works
   and faith toward God. Repentance and faith are joined also in Mark 1:15
   and Acts 20:21. In repentance, one feels the guilt of his own sin and
   rebellion against God, is sorry for it, and purposes to change his
   direction of life. He abandons dead works (see [104]9:14), "works of
   righteousness" or "works of law," which are dead because they lead to
   death, can not bring spiritual life and are futile so far as pleasing
   God. Someone has pictured works springing from obligation as dead in
   the sense that they do not spring from life. They are as sheep's wool
   draped over a wolf's back; there is no vital connection between the
   animal and the wool.

   In faith toward God one not only accepts intellectually that God is,
   but places his confidence in God for salvation. He does this by
   trusting the reconciliation God has already brought about through the
   life and death of Jesus Christ, and by throwing himself on the mercy
   and grace of God by identification with that sinless Son through living
   faith.

   By repentance, man denies himself; by faith, he takes up his cross to
   follow Jesus. By repentance, he is crucified to the old way of life and
   all human merit or personal boasting; by faith, he takes hold of life
   in Christ and gratefully claims the merit and reward of Christ's
   perfect life. Repentance and faith here stand for the initial hearing
   of the gospel and the response of the heart to it.

   6:2. The next pair consists of the doctrine or teaching of baptisms and
   of the laying on of hands. The word here translated baptisms is that
   commonly applied to the various washings of the Old Testament (see
   [105]9:10; Mark 7:4). The doctrine of baptisms would therefore seem to
   involve explanations regarding the difference between Jewish washings
   on the one hand and gospel baptism in the name of Jesus the Messiah on
   the other. This would certainly involve some teaching on the
   significance of Christ's blood and sacrifice, a point to be developed
   in detail later in the epistle.

   Laying on of hands was done in healing, blessing, or simply giving
   approval and endorsement. Many scholars feel that the laying on of
   hands also accompanied believer's baptism and signified the giving of
   the Holy Spirit, if so, these two teachings go together in a special
   way and have to do with Christian initiation, or entering upon the
   Christian life.

   Resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment form the third pair of
   fundamental principles, and have to do with Christian motivation or
   direction. These are not the only proper motives, to be sure, but in
   the elementary teaching of the gospel one is taught to look to the
   resurrection and judgment as the completion of what God has already
   begun, and therefore as motives for faithfulness.

   6:3. The writer acknowledges his dependance on the will of God. If God
   is willing, he will lead the reader to more advanced teaching and so to
   personal maturity.

   6:4. Those who were once enlightened are Christians who have been
   instructed in the first principles of verses one and two (see also
   [106]10:32). The following terms refer to these same individuals. In
   the post-apostolic writings, "enlightenment" came to be a technical
   term for baptism. In the New Testament the knowledge of God through
   Christ in the gospel is put in terms of light (John 1:9; Acts 26:18;
   Colossians 1:12-13). Once is an important word, and means once for all
   time. This enlightenment can take place only once; it can not be
   repeated.

   Taste signifies experience (see [107]2:9). The heavenly gift may mean
   the Holy Spirit, the remission of sins, or (probably) the entire new
   life as a child of God. As partaker of the Holy Ghost, Christians are
   partners of the Spirit. He is God's gift, the seal and earnest of
   future blessing and the originator of fruit well-pleasing to God (Acts
   2:38; 5:32; II Corinthians 1:22; Ephesians 1:1314; Galatians 5:22-25).

   6:5. Those who have tasted the good word of God are those who have
   experienced fulfillment of the precious promises God offers by claiming
   and receiving them in faith. The expression used here occurs also in
   the Greek Old Testament at Zechariah 1:13 and Joshua 21:45 . The powers
   of the world to come probably refer to the miraculous manifestations
   given the infant church (see [108]notes at 2:3-4), but to a Jewish
   Christian this phrase would speak of the present reality of the
   Messianic era in which such things would take place. The world to come
   is literally the Coming Age, which is how the Jews spoke of the era of
   fulfillment and blessing under Messiah in the Kingdom of God (see
   [109]notes at 1:2; see also 1:14; [110]2:5; [111]13:14).

   6:6. If is not in the original Greek, and the verb fall away is of the
   same tense as those preceding it in verses four and five. It is
   impossible to renew again unto repentance those who experienced the
   benefits of verses four and five, then fell away (our almost-literal
   English idiom would be "dropped out"). Not that all hope is gone, for
   God may once again give them repentance in acknowledging the truth (II
   Timothy 2:25). But it is impossible for those individuals to experience
   again the renewal through enlightenment which was theirs in the first
   hearing of the gospel (see Acts 11:18). They can not again go through
   the fundamental process of repentance and faith, or of initiation into
   the body of Christ, as they did before (read this verse in the context
   of those preceding it). They have done that once, but have now rejected
   all that God offers. For such a person the gospel holds no appeal.

   These individuals (considered hypothetically as among the readers)
   crucify for themselves the Son of God. By their apostasy they judge
   Christ to be an imposter and guilty of death. In such a person
   repentance cannot take place, for it is based on godly sorrow and a
   conviction of sin growing out of faith in Christ as the Son of God.

   Such apostates put Christ to an open shame (see [112]10:29). This same
   verb is used in the Greek Old Testament at Numbers 25:4 ("hang them
   up," KJV), where its point is clearly seen in a context of apostasy
   from God. Christians who fall away do just this to the Son of God. They
   hang Him on the cross again, whether they forsake Christ for the world,
   for antichrist religion, or simply for carelessness and indifference.

   [113]6:7-8. The earth or ground which drinketh in the rain and then
   bears produce meet or fitting and appropriate for those who have
   worked, receiveth blessing from God. On the other hand ground which
   produces thorns and briers or thistles proves itself unworthy of
   blessing and is rejected (the same word translated "reprobate" in II
   Corinthians 13:57) for cultivation. Instead it is burned over, perhaps
   to prevent the further spread of briers to the adjoining land. A double
   meaning is certainly intended here, for such unproductive and evil men
   will meet their end in the burning of hell (see a similar thought in
   Matthew 3:10,12; 13:30; John 15:6).

   6:9. What is true in the physical realm is true also in the spiritual,
   and the author's intention is to prevent this fate among his readers.
   Having given such a stern warning, he now quickly softens his tone to
   encouragement. He is persuaded or convinced that better things than
   this will come from his readers. He looks for the fruitful lives and
   works which accompany salvation, things closely aligned with it and
   holding fast to it (see Ephesians 2:10; other passages in [114]notes on
   13:21). His words are meant as a warning, not as a present judgment.
   His readers have shown fruits worthy of God in the past, and he urges
   them to remain steadfast in such a life in the future.

   6:10. God is not unrighteous and will not forget any work or labor
   growing out of love and done because of his name or because of the
   relationship sustained to Him. The Hebrew Christians had ministered to
   or served the saints, their brethren -- both in the past and in the
   writer's present (see [115]10:32-34).

   6:11. He wants every one of them to demonstrate the same diligence, not
   only now but to the full assurance of hope unto the end. Their danger
   was in stopping short of completion, of falling back before the goal
   had been attained. Against this he warns repeatedly ( [116]3:6,
   [117]14; [118]10:23).

   6:12. They are not to be slothful (the same word translated "dull" in
   [119]5:11; see [120]notes there), but rather are to be (literally
   "become") followers or imitators of those godly men of old who did
   inherit the blessings contained in God's promises. Success always comes
   through faith (which in the Bible means trust, reliance and commitment
   as well as intellectual acceptance) and patience or longsuffering
   perseverance.

   6:13. For example, when God promised Abraham in Genesis 22:16-18
   concerning his numerous descendants and other blessings, God could
   swear by no greater person than Himself, and so he sware by His own
   name or personal character.

   6:14. In the Hebrew text of this passage, an idiom is used which simply
   means "I will surely bless you and multiply you." The Greek Old
   Testament translated the phrase word for word and gave the rather
   awkward reading which our author quotes here and which is carried over
   into the English.

   6:15. So, thus, in this manner and under these circumstances, Abraham
   first patiently endured; only then he obtained the fulfillment of the
   promise. He saw the beginning of the fulfillment in the spared life of
   Isaac. The rest he saw only by faith according to [121]11:13, [122]39.
   As Abraham had to wait, so do we. This is the writer's exhortation, and
   this is why he mentions Abraham.

   6:16. It is the case with men to swear by the greater than themselves.
   Among men, an oath serves two purposes. Negatively, it is an end of all
   strife. When a man takes an oath there is no more point in disputing
   his word or questioning him. Positively, it is for confirmation. It
   gives all the assurance that is possible by the spoken word.

   6:17. Because of this, God condescended to man's own level of
   understanding and confirmed His promise to Abraham by an oath. This was
   to show or demonstrate to the heirs of promise (see [123]1:14;
   [124]9:15) the unchangeableness or immutability of God's counsel or
   purpose and design.

   6:18. God's promise was made twice sure by two immutable things: His
   word (it is impossible for God to lie), and His oath (taken in His own
   name). As man views the situation, he may have full confidence in the
   promise of God.

   Strong is emphatic here and is read by weak men who need the
   encouragement. Consolation would be better translated "encouragement."
   Christians are those who have fled for refuge (the Greek Old Testament
   uses the same word of fleeing to the cities of refuge). The hope set
   before us is to be laid hold of or seized. God's twice-sure word of
   promise is a strong encouragement for all Christians, by patient
   waiting, to do just that.

   6:19. This hope is an anchor of the soul. The anchor was a symbol of
   hope in the ancient world as well as now. Our anchor is both sure or
   unfailing and steadfast or firmly fixed. We can have strong confidence
   in our hope. Within the veil indicates the most holy place of the
   tabernacle, into which only the high priest entered one day each year.
   The phrase here symbolizes the presence of God, and refers to the fact
   that Jesus has passed into heaven as the next verse will state.

   6:20. Into the very presence of God in heaven our forerunner has
   already entered (see [125]2:9-10; [126]4:14). Forerunner in secular
   Greek was used of a scout, one who went before and led the way (see
   [127]notes on "author" at 5:9). Jesus has not only entered into God's
   presence for us (though as high priest He did that); He has also
   entered into heaven in front of us -- leading the way and guaranteeing
   by His own entrance that the path is clear for us to follow.

   The Christian's hope is certain and confident. It is grounded in the
   person of Jesus Christ and is based on His sinless life and His atoning
   death. If our hope were in our own obedience or knowledge or power, we
   could have no strong confidence at all. But it rests in the Son of God,
   and for that reason it is sinful not to have strong confidence.

   The Christian's sin is no cause for loss of hope, but rather for
   genuine repentance and prayer -- for throwing himself on the mercies of
   God through his mediator Jesus Christ. Because of the life Jesus lived
   and the death He died -- and because the Christian is one with Him --
   God's people ought to cherish a living hope. They have fled for refuge
   to the merciful and all-powerful Son of God. Nor do they wait for the
   death of a high priest, for Jesus is their high priest, and He lives
   forever -- after the order of Melchizedek.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER SEVEN

   Having introduced Melchizedek in 5:10-11, our author temporarily put
   him aside to give in chapter six an exhortation to diligence and
   steadfastness and a warning regarding the end of slothfulness. He then
   returned in 6:20 to Melchizedek. Now he discusses him at length in
   chapter seven, which follows.

   7:1. This Melchizedek was the subject of much speculation in Jewish
   circles, including the Essene community of the Qumran Dead Sea Scrolls.
   He is mentioned in Scripture, however, only in Hebrews, Psalm 110 and
   Genesis 14. Melchizedek was a king-priest, contemporary of Abraham, and
   a servant of God. Salem is probably an ancient name for Jerusalem (see
   Psalm 76:2). Adoni-zedek, another Old Testament king of Jerusalem
   (Joshua 10:1), had the same element in his name as Melchizedek, which
   also indicates an identification of Salem with Jerusalem. Some have
   suggested that Salem here is the Salim of John 3:23; a few take the
   term figuratively as a title (see verse two) devoid of any geographical
   intent. It is in line with known facts to suppose that Melchizedek was
   an actual priest-king of the city-state captured by David from the
   Jebusites and known to us as Jerusalem (see [128]comments at 12:22).

   Melchizedek is priest of the most high God, and this point interests
   our author. Although the Hebrew term parallels the name of a Canaanite
   god, there is no reason to think that Melchizedek served any deity
   other than Jehovah. The Most High God is identified in Genesis as the
   God of Abraham; the Greek Old Testament lies behind the phrase in our
   present passage; Old and New Testament writers alike present
   Melchizedek as a servant of Jehovah.

   Genesis 14:17-20 reports that Melchizedek met Abraham as he was
   returning from the slaughter of the kings of the East who had taken Lot
   captive in the course of a plundering campaign. That text also says
   that Melchizedek blessed Abraham, a point our author will consider
   later.

   7:2. Abraham gave a tenth part or tithe of all that he had to
   Melchizedek. Melchizedek's name is now analyzed in its separate Hebrew
   components. This practice, though strange by Western logic, was not an
   uncommon method of reasoning when Hebrews was written -- and here it
   has the approval of the Holy Spirit. The name Melchizedek is composed
   of two Hebrew words; melek means "king" and tsedek means
   "righteousness." Together they mean king of righteousness, which, by
   interpretation, Melchizedek was. He is also called King of Salem, and
   since Salem stands for the Hebrew shalom or "peace," Melchizedek is
   here called king of peace.

   Righteousness and peace appear together frequently in the Old Testament
   Scriptures (see for example Psalm 72:7; Isaiah 9:6-7; Zechariah
   9:9-10). To the Hebrew, "righteousness" meant the faithful performing
   of all duties proper to a relationship. In a spiritual sense that meant
   faithfulness to God first of all, because of His covenant mercies to
   Israel, then faithfulness to fellow-Jews who were recipients of the
   same covenant blessings.

   In Isaiah 5:7, God looks among His people for righteousness but finds
   instead a cry. The cry speaks of perverted justice, cruelty and a
   general absence of the life described by righteousness. There is also a
   play on words in the Hebrew text of this verse, but that does not
   concern us here.

   When the people maintained righteousness, "peace" was the result. Again
   the term has first a spiritual significance of peace with God, and then
   of peace with one's fellows under God's covenant care and rule. There
   could be no peace apart from righteousness, and righteousness was
   expected to result in peace (Isaiah 32:17). Melchizedek of Salem
   incorporated both these concepts in his name and office, and even in
   this foreshadowed the Lord who is our Righteousness and our Peace (I
   Corinthians 1:30; Ephesians 2:14).

   7:3. Melchizedek had no ancestor in the priesthood. Unlike the Jewish
   priests who had to establish their genealogy to qualify for service
   (Nehemiah 7:63-64; Leviticus 21:17; Ezekiel 44:22), this man neither
   received his office by hereditary right nor passed it on to a physical
   descendant. So far as we are told in Scripture, he was without father
   or mother; not that he was other than human, but that he did not belong
   to any line of priests

   Without descent is better translated "without genealogy." See the point
   just above. Neither beginning of days nor end of life means that
   Melchizedek's priesthood is not recorded as to origin or end. He is a
   lone figure who suddenly appears on the stage of history for a brief
   moment, then as suddenly and mysteriously removes from the scene. No
   one can say of this strange man, "here is the beginning of his priestly
   service" or "here is the end of his priesthood."

   Because God opened the curtain in the middle of Melchizedek's priestly
   service and closed it in the same place, Melchizedek is made like unto
   the Son of God, who is also alone in a unique priesthood. Continually
   is not the phrase usually translated "forever," but may be translated
   "for the duration," "perpetually," or "without interruption " This term
   will appear later in the chapter.

   7:4. In the following verses we will consider how great Melchizedek
   was. In the first place, Abraham -- not another by the same name, but
   the patriarch himself -- paid tithes to Melchizedek. Nor was this a
   poor tithe, but of the spoils, literally "off the top of the heap" --
   the choicest tenth.

   7:5. The sons of Levi or the Levitical priests, who receive the office
   they hold, take tithes because of a commandment and a law. They also
   take tithes from their own brethren, who are descendants of Abraham.

   7:6. Melchizedek is one whose descent is not from them, who had no
   commandments or law requiring Abraham to pay him tithes, and who had
   not received his priesthood by virtue of a lineage. Yet he received
   tithes, and that not from just any passing stranger, but from Abraham!
   To this add the fact that Melchizedek then blessed Abraham -- the
   Abraham who had the promises from God.

   7:7. It is indisputable that the less is blessed in this sense by the
   better. If Abraham was blessed by Melchizedek, it follows that
   Melchizedek was a "better" man in terms of rank and office than the
   patriarch. Both men acknowledged this relative position: Abraham, by
   paying tithes to Melchizedek; Melchizedek, by blessing Abraham.

   7:8. By comparison, note also that here in the Levitical priesthood men
   that die receive tithes (see I Chronicles 6:49-53), but there in
   Melchizedek's case one received them who had no successor.

   7:9. To cap it all, and to be perfectly truthful about it, Levi also,
   who receiveth tithes under the law from his Jewish brethren, there paid
   tithes instead, in Abraham.

   7:10. If one objects that Levi was not present in Genesis 14, the
   writer notes that he was yet in the loins of his father Abraham when
   Melchizedek met him. Just as he can say that Levi received tithes (in
   the person of his descendants), so he can say as well that Levi paid
   tithes (in the person of his ancestor). Levi was forefather of the
   priestly tribe; therefore Melchizedek's priesthood was greater than
   Aaron's.

   Our author has dealt with Melchizedek's characteristics as a person (
   [129]verses one through three) and in relation to the Levitical priests
   ( [130]verses four through ten). Now he turns to his primary point, an
   exaltation of the priesthood of Christ in comparison with the Old
   Testament Jewish priesthood. [131]Verses 11-14 show that the priesthood
   was the basis of the law, and that because Christ's priesthood after
   the order of Melchizedek is permanent, so is the law which rests upon
   it. This is in contrast with the priesthood of Aaron, for it changed,
   necessitating a change in the law related to it.

   7:11. If perfection (a key word in Hebrews, consult a concordance) were
   by the Levitical priesthood, there would have been no further need for
   another priest after another order -- that of Melchizedek and not of
   Aaron. An institution is perfect when it accomplishes the purpose for
   which it was instituted. The Aaronic priesthood did not do that.

   The purpose of a priesthood is to bring men to God, to atone for their
   sins. The author will show clearly in the following chapters that the
   Levitical sacrifices and priesthood could not do this -- either
   perfectly or permanently. In the present passage, then, he refers to
   this imperfection in the Old Testament priestly order. He also shows
   that it had to be replaced by a perfect order which could fulfill these
   purposes.

   We are accustomed to thinking of the priesthood as dependent on the
   law. Our author says the opposite. The law depended on the priesthood.
   This suggests that in God's ordering of affairs the priesthood was
   first in importance, then the law. Law pointed men to the reality of
   sin and to the fact that they were sinners. This recognition called for
   the priesthood as the divine ordinance and institution for the removal
   of sins. But the imperfection of the Old Testament priesthood pointed
   them even further to the future when the Son of God would come as great
   high priest and Lamb of God, completely removing all sins forever by
   one offering of Himself. The priesthood, then, was the basis and
   grounds of the law.

   7:12. When the priesthood was changed, there was of necessity a change
   also of the law. When the foundation is removed the building collapses.
   There can be no legal code unless there is provision for those who
   break it. In the case of Israel, the priesthood is changed (to one
   which is perfect), then a new law is given based on that perfect
   priesthood and relating to it. There is room for thought along this
   line, that the new law (perfectly suited to its priesthood) is as far
   superior in nature as well as content to the old, as the new priesthood
   of Christ is superior to the priesthood of Aaron's sons. The purpose of
   each law is suited to its particular priesthood.

   7:13. He of whom these things are spoken is the Lord Jesus Christ, as
   the next verse will state, and He belongs to another or a different
   tribe from Levi. He is of a tribe from which no man ever served at the
   priestly altar.

   7:14. It is evident on the basis of His genealogies in Matthew chapter
   one and Luke chapter three that our Lord descended from Judah, a tribe
   from which the Law of Moses said absolutely nothing so far as
   priesthood is concerned. The priesthood has therefore been changed, and
   the next verse will adduce still another proof of this.

   7:15. The priesthood has been changed, not only in tribe, but in the
   quality and sort of its priest. This point makes far more evident than
   the former point the change A priest has arisen now who is another in
   quality and kind. He is a different type of priest, not resembling the
   Levitical priests at all, but after the likeness of Melchizedek.

   7:16. Christ has become a priest twice-different in nature from the
   sons of Aaron. His priesthood rests not on the law of a carnal
   commandment but on the power of an endless life. Old Testament priests
   were priests by virtue of a law, outside and apart from themselves or
   their personal fitness. That law did not attempt to select on the basis
   of moral or spiritual qualities, but simply according to physical
   ancestors. It was thus a carnal commandment, having to do only with
   physical restrictions and requirements.

   Christ has been made priest, not on this basis, but because He
   possesses an inherent power that fits Him for the position He is to
   occupy. The term power here does not signify authority, but might, and
   speaks of a characteristic of Christ Himself, inherent in His righteous
   person. This was the power or might of an endless life.

   Because He was not a sinner, though He was fully tempted, the Son of
   God could not be held by Satan in death (see [132]comments at 2:14). He
   possessed the strength or dynamic of a life that, literally, "could not
   break down." A perfect life has no weak spot; sin is the weakness which
   brings down all other men, including the Old Testament priests.
   Christ's priesthood and service are firmly grounded in the inherent
   power of a life that will never end. The writer will return to this
   wonderful thought in [133]verse 25.

   7:17. To this agrees the Scripture introduced much earlier (Psalm
   110:4) which says, "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
   Melchizedek."

   7:18. The familiar Greek construction "on the one hand/on the other
   hand" is used in verses 18 and 19. On the one hand there is a
   disannulling or placing aside or removing of the previous or former
   commandment regulating priests (verses [134]5, [135]15). This setting
   aside was necessary because of the inherent weakness and
   unprofitableness of that system which could not bring perfection (
   [136]verse 11), which was based on a carnal requirement ( [137]verse
   16) and which was manned by imperfect priests ( [138]verses 27-28).

   7:19. The law made nothing perfect (see Romans 8:3; Galatians 2:21;
   3:21), for it rested on a priesthood which could not perfect (
   [139]verse 11). "The law made beginnings, taught rudiments, gave
   initial impulses, hinted, foreshadowed, but brought nothing to
   perfection, did not in itself provide for man's perfect entrance into
   God's fellowship" (Expositor's Greek Testament).

   Perfection did come, however, in Christ's work and in the better hope
   which He introduced and confirmed. Better is a key word in Hebrews, and
   the serious student will profit from a study of its many occurrences in
   this epistle. The hope spoken of here has already been discussed to
   some extent (see [140]notes on 6:18-20).

   The blessed feature of this hope, and the ultimate basis of comparison
   between all that belonged to the inadequate Old system and all that
   pertains to the perfect New, is that by it we draw nigh unto God. The
   verb translated draw nigh is the same one used in the Greek Old
   Testament at Exodus 19:21, when, at the giving of the Law, God
   specifically commanded the people not to draw near to God. They could
   not draw near to God under that system because their lives were unholy
   and their sins were ever-present. Under the covenant of the Son, men in
   themselves are no better, but they can draw near to God by virtue of
   Christ's life which is holy and His blood which atones for their sins.
   Such a blessed thought this is for meditation and such a holy basis for
   living!

   [141]7:20-22. The three verses go together, joined in the Greek and
   English by the connecting phrases translated inasmuch as (verse 20) and
   by so much (verse 22), and including verse 21 which is parenthetical.
   The author presents a ratio. Inasmuch as, or to the extent, that Christ
   supercedes the Old Testament priests by an oath-appointment versus a
   simple appointment, by so much or to that same extent, Jesus is surety
   of a better testament than theirs.

   It was not without an oath that Christ became priest; rather it was
   with an oath. This is proved by a chief passage on the subject, Psalm
   110:4. Jehovah sware to Jesus, "Thou art a priest forever after the
   order of Melchizedek." Earlier the Hebrews author dealt with the
   forever in this psalm; here he is concerned with the sware.

   To say that God will not repent does not speak of repentance of sin,
   for by nature God can not sin. Repent here is not the word normally
   translated that way (which itself has the basic meaning "to change the
   mind," see 12:17), but stands for a word which emphasizes the thought
   of concern or care. God will not change His mind because of
   afterthought or later concern, as He did -- for example -- with the
   house of Eli (see I Samuel 2:27-36). Christ is a priest forever.

   Because God will never change His mind about Christ, Jesus has become
   surety of a better testament. The word translated surety is a noun form
   of the verb translated "draw nigh" in [142]verse 19 (see [143]comments
   there). The same life of Jesus which enables us to draw nigh to God
   remains forever, because Jesus has the "power of an endless life" (
   [144]verse 16). Nor will God change His mind about that life presented
   as an offering, for He has so given His oath ( [145]verse 21). Jesus is
   therefore surety of His covenant. He is a guarantor to man from God
   that God has accepted a perfect sacrifice on man's behalf. And Jesus
   ever lives to make intercession for them that come to God by Him (
   [146]verse 25).

   Testament appears here for the first time in Hebrews, and will be
   discussed in the following chapters. The same word is sometimes
   translated "covenant" though in the Old and New Testament Scriptures it
   frequently has the force of a one-sided disposition or will involving
   two parties, rather than a two-sided agreement or bargain between
   equals. God's testament or covenant is given to man by God, man accepts
   or rejects it, but he may not change it. More on this later.

   7:23. They who served under the Old covenant were many priests, one
   taking the place of the other because no single one could continue in
   the priesthood forever by reason of his own death. Josephus says that
   83 high priests officiated from Aaron to the destruction of the Temple
   in A.D. 70. Our writer gives no specific number but notes simply that
   they all died!

   7:24. In contrast to this, Jesus has an unchangeable priesthood because
   He continueth forever. He will never die. He will never need a
   successor. His priesthood is authenticated by God's oath. In short, His
   is an unerring and immovable priesthood and priestly service. it is
   perfect in every sense of the word.

   7:25. Wherefore, because of all these considerations, Christ is able to
   save to the uttermost. This may be taken either with regard to time (He
   saves forever), or extent (He saves completely), or both. Neither
   should be excluded. Both are true. Christ's complete and eternal
   salvation is for them that come to God by him. They are those who come
   to Him as priest, who lay their sins on Him as God's Lamb, who trust
   His offering of a perfect life as sufficient in God's sight for
   blessing, and who by faithful perseverance rely on His intercession for
   all these things. It is for no one else, though "whosoever will" may
   take advantage of it, and it is offered by God to all men.

   Christ is priest because He has the power of an endless life. Because
   he ever liveth, He needs no successor. He now sits beside the Father to
   make intercession for His people.

   Christ made but one sacrifice, but He ever lives to make intercession
   on the basis of that sacrifice. In teens of His death, He was the
   sin-offering. In terms of His resurrection and present work, He is high
   priest. The priest of the Old Testament did not merely kill the
   sacrifice; he then presented its blood, standing for its life, as an
   appeal to God for forgiveness and blessing (Leviticus 17:11-12). In
   both particulars he had an imperfect priesthood. The sacrifice was
   amoral and could not take away sin (see [147]10:1-4); the priest was
   mortal and had to be replaced (as the present chapter has shown).

   Christ, however, offered a perfect sacrifice (His own sinless life),
   was then raised (as a sign of God's acceptance of that life given in
   death) and will never die again. Unlike the Old Testament priests and
   their sacrifices, Christ died once, but forever makes intercession for
   His people (see I John 1:7b, 9; 2:1-2).

   The one who is in Christ rests his salvation, forgiveness and hope of
   blessing on the vicarious death and perfect obedience of Jesus his high
   priest. Because Jesus died. though sinless, He was able to be
   sin-bearer, "taking away the sins of the world." Because He offered God
   a sinless life, the Father is pleased with one Man (though with no
   other on his own merit) and is justly able to dispense full blessings.
   Yet because the Christian is one with Christ, His death counts for him
   and His life does as well. God can, therefore, forgive the one "in
   Christ" on the basis of Christ's blood and can also give him every
   blessing and favor on the basis of Christ's life so long as he clings
   to Him in faith (see Isaiah 53:4-6, 10-12 Romans 4 25; 5:8-11; II
   Corinthians 5 21; I Peter 2 24; Revelation 1:5; 7:9-17).

   7:26. Such an high priest as Christ is just what man needs. He became
   us, that is, He was fitted to our needs. Man needs a priest who is
   holy, for he himself is not. The word translated holy here also
   includes the idea of compassion and tender mercy. Man's priest must be
   undefiled and separate from sinners, but every Aaronic priest was weak
   and sinful. Our priest needs to be higher than the heavens, living
   forever to intercede on our behalf.

   7:27. Christ does not need daily to make a sacrifice for his own sins
   and then for the people's. He had no sin Himself, and so He offered
   himself as a perfect sacrifice for the people. Because He had a perfect
   sacrifice He did not need to offer it but once.

   7:28. The law of the Old Testament priesthood made men high priests who
   had infirmity or weakness. In contrast to this the word of the oath
   (see [148]verse 21), which was since the law in origin but replaced it,
   made the Son a priest -- and He is consecrated for evermore.

   The beautiful point of these last verses found wonderful expression in
   the following hymn, written in 1742 by Charles Wesley.

     Arise, my soul, arise, shake off thy guilty fears:
     The bleeding Sacrifice in my behalf appears.
     Before the Throne my Surety stands;
     My name is written on His hands.
     He ever lives above, for me to intercede
     His all-redeeming love, His precious blood to plead;
     His blood atoned for every race,
     And sprinkles now the throne of grace.
     Five bleeding wounds He bears, received on Calvary.
     They pour effectual prayers; they strongly plead for me.
     "Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,
     "Nor let that ransomed sinner die!"
     My God is reconciled; His pard'ning voice I hear;
     He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear.
     With confidence I now draw nigh,
     And "Father, Abba, Father!" cry.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER EIGHT

   8:1. Of the things spoken in this treatise, this which the author is
   about to say is the sum or, as better translated in the later versions,
   the chief point. And what is this chief point? That we believers have
   Jesus as high priest, and that He ifs performing priestly service for
   us at the right hand of God in the heavens.

   This figure of Christ at God's right hand comes from Psalm 110 (see
   [149]notes at 1:13) and is frequently joined in the New Testament to
   that of the authoritative "Son of Man" of Daniel, chapter seven. The
   psalm also combines Christ's priestly and His royal offices. While most
   other New Testament references to the psalm point to its royal imagery
   (but see Romans 8:34), the epistle to the Hebrews pays special
   attention to the priestly.

   8:2. Jesus is a minister or, literally, "public servant" of the
   sanctuary or holy things But His service involves the true or
   substantial tabernacle which the Lord pitched, not any structure
   erected by man. His sanctuary is heaven itself, the "most holy place"
   where God dwells.

   While it is true that the physical body of Jesus is referred to as a
   temple (John 2:19-22), that is not meant here, for verse five says that
   Moses used this sanctuary for a pattern. Nor does the text speak of the
   spiritual body of Christ, the church, for the church has the benefit of
   service performed in this sanctuary; it is not itself the sanctuary. In
   addition, the "church in the wilderness" corresponds in the present
   analogy to the New Testament "church" (if we extend the analogy to
   include either), and each "church" has, not is, its own sanctuary and
   priestly service.

   8:3. Because every high priest holds office for the express purpose of
   offering gifts and sacrifices (see [150]note at 5:1), Jesus of
   necessity must also have something to offer, for He is our high priest.
   What is true in general is true in particular. Here the emphasis is on
   the fact of His service; what He offers is told in 7:27.

   8:4. This very fact indicates that His ministry is in heaven, not on
   earth, for His sacrifice would not fit the earthly system. Besides,
   there are no vacancies in the Jewish priesthood for a priest such as He
   (see also [151]7:13-14). Christ is our high priest -- that has already
   been established. Yet if His service were earthly, He could not even be
   a regular priest, much less a high priest (see Numbers 18:1-7). In the
   Greek, this verse contains the first part of a phrase which is
   completed in verse six and means "on the one hand . . . on the other
   hand."

   8:5. The earthly priests of the Jewish system do not serve the
   substantial, true (verse two) heavenly things, but rather the example
   or copy or outline and shadow of those things. A shadow is not itself
   the solid reality, but gives assurance that the substantial object
   exists of which it is an outline or copy.

   That this Old Testament tabernacle was but a copy of the heavenly
   reality and not the original prototype is seen in the command
   concerning its erection. Moses was admonished by God in Exodus 25:40 to
   make all things according to the pattern which he was shown in the
   mountain. It is said by some of the rabbis that Gabriel descended in a
   workman's apron from heaven with models of the tabernacle furniture
   which he showed Moses how to build. The Bible does not give such
   details, but simply states that Moses was shown a pattern (literally
   something struck from a die or stamp) and told to build with it as a
   reference in all things.

   What Moses built, though by God's instruction and according to a divine
   pattern, was not the original and substantial sanctuary but a copy of
   it. No man or group of men can build the true sanctuary, for it is
   pitched by the Lord, not by man (verse two, 3:4).

   The point here was not altogether new to the Jews, though the
   application was. An unispired Jewish writer of the period just before
   Christ had said of Solomon's temple: "Thou gavest command to build a
   sanctuary in thy holy mountain, and an altar in the city of thy
   habitation; a copy of the holy tabernacle which thou preparedst
   aforehand from the beginning." (Wisdom 9:8). That writer had surmised
   that the earthly sanctuaries were copies; it remained for our author to
   tell the real original and for our high priest to enter and serve in
   it!

   To have the benefits of a prefect sacrifice administered by a perfect
   high priest serving in the true sanctuary built by God and not man is a
   grace given for the first time to God's covenant people in Christ. We
   have no mere copy of shadow, but the original holy things of heaven
   themselves -- now fully revealed and fully served by the Son who is
   Priest-King.

   8:6. This verse gives "the other hand" in contrast to the truth stated
   in verse four. Christ has now in this age of fulfillment and reality
   obtained a more excellent ministry or service than that from which He
   is barred by tribe and nature on earth. To the same extent, He is
   mediator or middle-man of a better covenant than that served by the
   Jewish priests, for His is established or legalized on the basis of
   better promises than theirs. The writer enumerates these promises in
   the rest of the chapter.

   The first covenant was also given through a mediator (Galatians 3:19)
   and the people approached God through him (Exodus 20:19). But while
   Moses was mediator and Aaron high priest, Jesus is both! In the century
   before Christ, certain Pharisees looked for a Messiah who would save
   both Jews and gentiles, and they spoke of a mediator who would
   intercede before God for the righteous. (Testament of Dan 5-6). Yet
   even these lofty dreams failed to anticipate the plans of God, for we
   have one who is high priest, mediator and universal Savior combined --
   and not even from Levi's tribe.

   The same may be said with reference to the Qumran Jews described in the
   Dead Sea Scrolls. They seemed to have looked for two or perhaps three
   Messiahs; apparently they could not envision one man doing all that
   needed to be done. But God's Son -- higher than any angel -- did all
   that God saw required, and far surpassed the very thoughts and desires
   of His own people! "How much better," the Hebrews author affirms over
   and over!

   8:7. If the first covenant (this word is added by the translators anal
   is therefore in italics) had been faultless, no place would have been
   sought by God or needed by man for a second arrangement. Yet God did
   propose a new covenant, even in the former period of time, and spoke of
   it then to His people. Therefore, the writer argues, that first was not
   faultless (see [152]7:18-19).

   8:8. The fault lay with the people to whom the first covenant was
   given, because they did not keep their part of the arrangement. Yet the
   first covenant was of such nature that all blessings depended on the
   ability of the people to do just that. This made the covenant itself
   faulty in effect, or from the point of view of the people. Because of
   the fault that lay with them, God promised a new covenant in Jeremiah
   31:31-34, and the author of Hebrews quotes that passage in verses 8-12.

   Jeremiah began to prophesy just five years before the great reform of
   Josiah described in II Kings 23. After centuries of neglect of the Law,
   the nation affirmed again its commitment to God in a great
   covenant-renewal ceremony led by the king himself (verses one through
   three). Only a few years passed, however, until the zeal was dampened
   and the promises forgotten. Many had never been sincere in their pledge
   to God's covenant (Jeremiah 3:10) and most of the rest were victims of
   time and circumstance. The covenant was not in their hearts, and even a
   royal service could not put it there to stay. Because of this inherent
   weakness of the people and derived weakness of the covenant, God
   promised Jeremiah that He would make a new arrangement with His people
   in the future.

   The days come is literally "days are coming." See [153]comments on the
   "last days" at 1:2. The new covenant was promised through Jeremiah 600
   years before Christ, but Jesus used the expression in instituting the
   Lord's Supper (Luke 22:20) and Paul repeated it in the same connection
   (I Corinthians 11:25). Paul also used the phrase in a ministry context
   (II Corinthians 3:6). Outside this chapter of Hebrews, the term appears
   only at 9:15 except for these passages.

   New here signifies "fresh," not simply new in teens of time.
   [154]Hebrews 12:24 uses a different word to call this covenant "new" in
   time as well. The point of the present word is that our covenant is
   fresh and of a different sort from the old arrangement between God and
   His people.

   The Greek Old Testament, which our writer quotes, said "covenant a new
   covenant." He changes that to "perfect a new covenant," with the same
   concern for the perfection or completion of the Christian system as
   stressed already in 2:10; [155]5:9; 6:1; [156]7:11, [157]28 and other
   places

   This fresh new kind of covenant would be made with the house or people
   or family of Israel and that of Judah. In Jeremiah's time the people
   had been long scattered from Israel by Assyria, and Judah was even then
   being carried captive by Babylon Yet God would bring back a remnant
   from both (Jeremiah 31:7-9) and would establish a new order.

   Jesus was God's fulfillment and fulfiller of all spiritual promises to
   the Jews, according to Romans 15:8. Yet the next ten verses of that
   chapter show from the Old Testament that gentiles are also to be
   beneficiaries of gospel grace. The book of Hebrews is addressed to
   Christian Jews, and our author does not concern himself at this point
   with the gentile mission.

   8:9. This new kind of covenant will not be like that one made with the
   Jews at Sinai, though that one came from a God whose gracious and
   powerful acts of deliverance had brought His people together to receive
   it. Jeremiah speaks of God's merciful deliverance in the Exodus in
   saying that He took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of
   Egypt. The figure is that of a tender father gently lea ding a small
   and still-wobbly son before he has learned to care for himself. Such
   imagery is not uncommon in the Old Testament (Hosea 11:1-3; Deuteronomy
   1:31). Similar imagery is employed of Christ and His new-covenant
   people at 2:16 (see the [158]comment there).

   In spite of God's tender care for Israel, they continued not in the
   covenant to fulfill their part of it, and God regarded them not, as a
   lord whose subjects had failed to keep what was required of them. Our
   text of Jeremiah has "although I was a husband to them," which some
   translate "and I was as a lord to them," with the sense stated above.
   It has also been suggested that a certain Hebrew word for "disregard"
   is only one letter different: from the Hebrew word for "husband" or
   "lord," and that this might explain the difference in readings. In
   either case the point is the same and the matter is of Little
   importance for understanding.

   8:10. The first of the better promises is given. God's laws are given
   in a special people -- God relationship under both the old and new
   covenants (Exodus 6:7), but here is a difference Under the former
   covenant the laws were written on stone tablets, external to the
   people. Under the new covenant the laws are put into their mind and
   written in their hearts. Paul makes a similar point in a covenant
   context at II Corinthians 3:3-18 (see also Romans 8:4; 12:2; Ephesians
   3:16-20; 4 23 24; Philippians 2:12-13; Colossians 3:9-10; I
   Thessalonians 2:13; II Thessalonians 1:11-12; [159]Hebrews 4:2; James
   1:21).

   When true regeneration takes place, the Christian finds God's laws to
   be in accord with the spirit within him. Apart from the fleshly nature
   against which he must continually battle, he will delight in the laws
   of God and find them perfectly suited to his own spiritual
   inclinations. They are not external and foreign to his nature; he has
   become partaker of the divine nature and to that new nature they are
   exactly fitted.

   8:11. A second promise is that all who are God's people under the new
   covenant will know Him personally. From the least to the greatest no
   individual covered by the new arrangement is excluded. The covenant at
   Sinai was entered by a nation including many who did not know God
   personally until after they were involved in the covenant. All who were
   later born into the relationship as Jews had to be taught of God and
   learn His former acts of deliverance and provision.

   The new covenant is entered by individuals, one by one, and only on the
   knowledge of God and His saving acts in Christ (see John 6:44-45).
   Those entering the new covenant already know what God has done for them
   in the Son. They will to commit themselves to Him in the confidence
   that His work is sufficient for their pardon and blessing. They signify
   both their knowledge and their intention by the obedience of faith in
   baptism.

   When one has entered this relationship with God as one among His
   covenant people, he already knows God as his own saving Clod. There is
   no need for those who are in the covenant to be teaching each other a
   knowledge of God in this sense. Each brother and each neighbor or
   fellow-citizen in the new commonwealth already has that knowledge.

   8:12. A third promise is given, concerning forgiveness of sins by a
   merciful God. The people of the first covenant were given laws
   externally inscribed and foreign to their nature. When they broke those
   laws, as they always did, no sacrifice could remove the memory of that
   sin. The people of the fresh and new covenant have God's laws in their
   hearts and minds (this does not detract from but increases a hunger and
   thirst for the written Word of God). These laws are compatible with
   their new nature. When they do break them, as they sometimes will,
   forgiveness is already available on the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus
   (see [160]10:1ff).

   8:13. This verse is the author's inspired comment regarding the words
   spoken by Jeremiah so many centuries before. In that Jeremiah saith "A
   new covenant," he (Jeremiah) hath made the first old by contrast -- and
   that was six millennia before Christ! Our writer is saying concerning
   Jeremiah's statement "By saying 'new,' Jeremiah has long since
   antiquated the old."

   If it was old in Jeremiah's day (and Jeremiah by implication says that
   it was), how much older it is when Hebrews is written! It is, in fact,
   ready to vanish away, to pass from view, to completely disappear.
   Lenski speaks picturesquely of the old covenant here as "tottering with
   senility" and "like an old, old man who is sinking into his grave."

  CHAPTER NINE

   Our author has spoken already of the legitimacy of Christ's priesthood
   (chapter five), which he carefully explained as after the order of
   Melchizedek (chapter seven). Because this kind of priest can not serve
   under the old covenant, Christ has also mediated a new covenant
   suitable to His work (chapter eight). Chapter nine contrasts the
   sanctuaries and the rituals of the two covenants, and then, by a play
   on words, demonstrates another blessing Christ's death gives His
   people.

   9:1. The first covenant involved ordinances and arrangements for divine
   service, but the sanctuary in which these were carried out was worldly.
   It was, as verse nine will show, a figure of something more substantial
   in the eternal order.

   9:2. The Mosaic Tabernacle consisted of two tent-compartments. In the
   first or outer one was the candlestick (better, lampstand; Exodus
   25:31-40; Leviticus 24:1-4), and the table (Exodus 25:23-30; Leviticus
   24:6) on which the priests placed the shewbread (literally "loaves of
   presentation" or "bread of the presence"; see Exodus 25:30; Leviticus
   24:5-9). This first tent was called the sanctuary or holy place.

   9:3. A veil or curtain (Exodus 26:31-33) separated the holy place from
   the holiest of all or the most holy place (literally, "holy of
   holies"). It is called the second veil in contrast to the linen curtain
   separating the holy place from the outside court (Exodus 26:36-37).

   9:4. The second compartment had or involved the use of the golden
   censer or altar of incense (Exodus 30:1-9). Although this altar was in
   the outer holy place (Exodus 30:6), the smoke from it filled the most
   holy place on the Day of Atonement so that the high priest never came
   into God's clear presence (Exodus 30:10; Leviticus 16:12-13).

   The ark of the covenant was also in the inner tent (Exodus 25:10-15).
   When first built, this gold-plated wooden chest contained three
   articles which reminded Israel of God's covenant-mercies

   The golden pot that had manna (Exodus 16:32-34) reminded Israel of
   God's miraculous provision of food in the wilderness. The English Bible
   follows the Hebrew in not mentioning the vessel being gold, but our
   author is quoting from the Greek version which included that detail.

   Aaron's rod that budded (Numbers 17:1-11) was a perpetual sign of the
   exclusive right of Aaron and his descendants to the priesthood. This
   rod was involved in the miraculous incident which occurred after the
   rebellion led by Korah (Numbers 16). See also [161]notes on 5:4-6.

   The tables or plaques of the covenant were the two tablets of stone cut
   by Moses after he had angrily shattered the first tablets because of
   Israel's idolatry (Exodus 32:19; 34:1-4, 28-29). On these were engraved
   the ten commandments.

   Archaeology has suggested an interesting possibility regarding the dual
   tablets of stone. In the absence of carbon paper or photocopy machines,
   covenant-treaties in the ancient world between protective lord and a
   vessel people were often written twice -- one copy for his records and
   one for theirs. These tablets would be kept in the respective temples
   as solemn reminders of the covenant. Because Israel's sanctuary was at
   the same time God's only visible "dwelling," both copies of the
   "covenant" were kept in the most holy place. Whether the two tablets
   reflected this practice or not, they gave the ark containing them its
   name.

   When Solomon built the Temple, nothing was in the ark but the two
   tables of stone (I Kings 8:9; II Chronicles 5:10). The other articles
   may have been removed during the seven months the Philistines possessed
   the ark (I Samuel 4: 11; 6:1).

   Scripture does not tell the final destiny of the tabernacle or its
   furniture. An ancient Jewish tradition had Jeremiah taking the
   tabernacle, the ark and the altar of incense to a cave atop Mount
   Pisgah, where he hid them "until God shall gather the people again
   together, and mercy come . . . and the glory of the Lord shall be seen,
   even the Cloud" (II Maccabees 2:1-8).

   9:5. Over the ark was a lid of solid gold called the mercy-seat (Exodus
   25:17). The Greek word here is the same translated "propitiation" in
   Romans 3:25, where Christ is our mercy-seat. These are the only two
   times this word appears in the New Testament Scriptures.

   Connected to the ends of the mercy-seat were the cherubims of glory,
   two golden angels facing each other with upspread wings that covered
   the mercy-seat (Exodus 25:18-20). From here God would give His
   commandments (Exodus 25:22) and here He would "meet" the high priest on
   the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:2, 13-15).

   Our author speaks only generally of these items which were in the
   tabernacle. That he cannot now speak particularly means simply that he
   will not at this point; enter on a detailed discussion of the
   individual pieces. Since he makes only a general typological point
   regarding these items, we will here do the same.

   [162]9:6-7. Having spoken of the equipment of the Aaronic priests, he
   turns now to their ritual These two verses emphasize one theme in three
   ways: the inaccessibility of the most holy place under the former
   covenant. The priests ministered in the holy place; the high priest
   alone could enter the most holy place. Service was. performed always or
   daily in the first tent; it was performed in the second tent only one
   day every year. The outer tabernacle was entered for many purposes; the
   inner tent could not be entered without blood. This blood the high
   priest offered that single day each year, first for himself and then
   for the errors of the people (see [163]5:3; [164]7:27; Leviticus 16:6,
   11, 15).

   When these things were thus ordained refers to the time of Moses. The
   phrase has no bearing on the date of this epistle.

   9:8. In the very limited access to the most holy place, the Holy Ghost
   or Spirit was signifying that the way to God was not yet made manifest
   to sinful man. So long as the first tabernacle was standing, so long as
   there were two tents, just that long man could not approach God
   directly or with a clear conscience. The next chapter will show that
   the work of Jesus has opened the road to God for the people of the new
   covenant ( [165]10:19-20; see Matthew 27:51; John 10:9; 14:6; Romans
   5:2; Ephesians 2:18).

   9:9. All this was a figure or parable for the period of time in which
   the Aaronic priesthood was ministering. It should have indicated to
   them that their gifts and sacrifices (see [166]5:1, [167]8:3) were not
   for the perfecting of the conscience.

   9:10. Such offerings involved ceremonial cleansing from meats or foods
   and drinks through various washings and carnal ordinances. The
   ceremonial laws and the rituals per taining to them were all temporary,
   and were imposed only until the time or period of sacred history in
   which God would effect reformation.

   Reformation translates a word which means a straighten ing, and was
   used in Greek literature of setting a fracture, repairing roads or
   houses, or even paying debts. The general meaning is "putting right" or
   "bringing to a satisfactory state." In this verse, the present period
   of the priestly work of Messiah Jesus is the time when God is putting
   right sinful man and bringing to a satisfactory state the ordinances
   foreshadowed by the incomplete shadows and symbols of the old covenant
   system.

   9:11. Christ having arrived (that is literally what he says), so has
   the time of reformation just mentioned. He is high priest of all the
   good things which belong to the order to come, that is, the Messianic
   order of fulfillment. The phrase "to come" is used several times in
   Hebrews of the still unrealized future (2:5; [168]13:14), but the
   entire epistle agrees that this perfect order has now begun in part,
   and that its power may already be enjoyed ( [169]6:5).

   Christ's service involves a greater and more perfect tabernacle or
   sanctuary. It is not made with hands (see [170]8:2, [171]5); in fact,
   it is not a part of this physical creation or building.

   9:12. Nor is His service dependent on the blood of goats for Himself or
   of calves for the people. Through the merits of the sinless life
   represented in his own blood He has entered into the most holy place
   once for all time, and there He has found or obtained a redemption that
   is eternal.

   Unlike the temporary elements of the first covenant, all that pertains
   to the new covenant belongs to the eternal order. This eternal covenant
   (13:20) brings an eternal redemption ( [172]9:12), inheritance (
   [173]9:15) and salvation ( [174]5:9), because it rests on the offering
   of Christ by His eternal Spirit ( [175]9:14).

   This is not a Platonic distinction between the world of true being and
   that of forms or appearance. It is not simply a lower and an upper
   world. Rather the writer of Hebrews speaks of the eternal things and
   the carnal ordinances with both horizontal and vertical significance.

   On the one hand, there is an eternal realm which exists at the same
   time as but transcendent to the first-covenant types and shadows based
   on it. On the other hand, this eternal realm was manifested in the
   course of human time and history, displacing the former types and
   shadows.

   In combining these concepts the writer is in complete accord with the
   rest of the New Testament Scriptures that the Christian order involves
   both what already has come into human history and what has not yet
   appeared. It is unfair to our author to say that he is voicing Greek
   philosophy, or even that he is speaking in Platonic terms. He is rather
   speaking in language that is common to Jewish expression (the
   "vertical" typology) on the one hand, and to Christian teaching (the
   "horizontal" element) on the other.

   9:13. Here is another of those "how much more" contrasts with which we
   have become familiar in Hebrews. This time it clinches the point made
   so far in chapter nine: Christ as a priest ministers a service which
   excels that of the Aaronic priests, and, in keeping with that, He gives
   far better benefits.

   The blood of bulls and of goats was used in sin-offerings on the Day of
   Atonement or at other times, and the ashes of an unblemished red heifer
   were used in rites of purification (Numbers 19:1-22). These things
   could sanctify so far as purifying the flesh from ceremonial
   uncleanness, or even staying God's wrath against sin momentarily.

   9:14. Yet how much more, we are asked, will the blood of Christ cleanse
   the conscience, not from uncleanness incurred through touching a dead
   body (Numbers 19:11-16), but from "practices and attitudes which belong
   to the way of death, which pollute the soul and erect a barrier between
   it and God" (Bruce) -- that is, from dead works?

   Freed from such practices by the blood of Christ, His people are free
   to serve the living God. Note the contrast between dead works and a
   living God. For a similar point see Romans 6:6, 13; 7:4-6; II
   Corinthians 2:16; 3:6.

   The basis of this superior benefit of Christ's offering is that He
   through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God.
   Christ's sinless life has already been attested to, and will appear
   again in chapter ten. His life was "offered" to God, not to Satan as
   some Medieval theorists surmised. This was a sacrifice of love, but
   also of "bearing sins." A sinless life could justly meet all God's
   requirements for man and at the same time pay the ransom for sin. One
   ought not press these figures beyond scriptural bounds, but simply
   glory in what God has done and be content to understand that by such
   terms as EIe has chosen to use in revealing it.

   Through the eternal spirit. In the face of arguments for "spirit" and
   "Spirit" here, it does no violence to the passage or the larger context
   to allow both meanings. It was through the offering of His own spirit,
   first in complete obedience and then in death, that Christ's blood
   possessed merit. His spirit is eternal because by nature He is the Son
   who belongs to the eternal order; EIe was raised to be priest because
   He possesses an indestructible life ( [176]7:16).

   On the other hand, it was by anointing Jesus with the Holy Spirit
   (Isaiah 42:1) that God announced Him to be the Servant on whom He would
   also lay "the iniquity of us all" (Isaiah 53:6). It was by the Spirit
   that Christ was raised from the dead (I Peter 3:18) and declared to be
   the Son (Romans 1:4), fulfilling the promise that He would "prolong His
   days," "see the travail of His soul and be satisfied" and "justify
   many" (Isaiah 53:10-11).

   9:15. Because of Christ's meritorious blood, by which He became
   mediator of the new testament, one may say that by means of death those
   who are called of either covenant receive the promise of eternal
   inheritance. His death was for the redemption of the transgressions
   under the first testament, as well as for sins of those who should live
   afterward (see also Romans 3:25). Because Christ's blood can cleanse
   from dead works (verse 14), the inheritance contained in God's promise
   is assured to His people.

   Having spoken of the inheritance, the author's thoughts seem to move
   for a brief moment to a double meaning possessed by the word which he
   has been using for "covenant." For the word translated "testament" here
   is the same one translated "covenant" in the preceding chapter.

   Because the English language needs two words to express what the Greek
   language could say in this one, the English reader is at a disadvantage
   in understanding the present argument until he learns of this double
   sense.

   Ordinarily in Scripture this word means "covenant." It is a great
   theological word of the Old Testament, where it stands for the Hebrew
   term signifying the divine disposition or arrangement imposed by God on
   Israel, through which He brought Israel into a special relationship
   with Himself. That covenant was one-sided in that God planned and
   expressed it and Israel could not bargain the terms. But it was
   two-sided in that Israel accepted certain stated conditions involving
   both blessing and punishment.

   In New Testament times, however, this same Greek word was used commonly
   for a last will and testament. Not only so, the word for the man who
   offered a covenant to another was the same word for the man who made a
   will. There are similarities and differences between these two
   concepts.

   A covenant and a will have in common that both (at least in a
   divine-human covenant) involve a death. They are distinct inasmuch as
   such a covenant provides for both benefits and punishments, but a will
   provides only for benefits -- which are assured by the death of the man
   who makes the will.

   In verses 15-20, the word is used both ways. Verses 15, 18-20 use this
   word in the usual biblical sense of a covenant. But verses 16-17 use
   the same word (as the Greeks commonly used it) of a will. By this
   subtle shift in emphasis from one to the other and back again, the
   author points out a special benefit of the new covenant which the old
   could not give.

   9:16. Where a testament or will is, there must be publicly established
   and proved the death of the man who made the will. This is a general
   statement concerning normal human affairs.

   9:17. Such a will is of force only after the man who made it is dead.
   It has no legal power while he is living. The point here is not
   particularly that Jesus was free during His life time to dispense
   blessings in a manner other than that provided for in His "will,"
   though it is true that "the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive
   sins." Rather the author's concern is that a death must take place in
   the establishment of either a divine covenant or a human will, and
   that, in the case of a last will and testament, once the death has
   occurred the benefits provided by the will are guaranteed to the
   beneficiaries.

   Because the death of Jesus can purge the conscience from dead works,
   His beneficiaries will receive the eternal inheritance. His new
   testament is of the nature of a will, as well as that of a covenant
   (which was discussed in chapter eight), but as a will it provides only
   benefits!

   This does not diminish the force of numerous stern warnings against
   apostasy. For the beneficiaries of Christ's will are seen to be the
   people of the new covenant, not in dividuals in isolation. The benefits
   are for the "house" which "we" are ( [177]3:6). The true rest is for
   the "people" of God ( [178]4:9). Both "house" and "people" figure in
   the discussion of the new covenant ( [179]8:8, 10).

   For this reason, individuals are to exhort "one another" lest "any of
   you" be hardened ( [180]3:13). They know that the Lord will judge His
   "people" ( [181]10:30). Some who have entered the covenant may
   certainly be lost, though only through failure to remain in the
   covenant by faith (fulness). All who remain among the covenant people
   will obtain the blessings which Christ's offering secured for them, for
   His death was that of a testator as well as that of a
   covenant-mediator. "He is testator and executor in one, surety and
   mediator alike" (Bruce).

   9:18. Leaving now the idea of a last will and testament, and returning
   to the ordinary meaning of covenant, the writer notes that the first
   covenant or testament was also dedicated with blood.

   9:19. When Moses had spoken the terms of the covenant to all the
   people, he sealed with blood their acceptance of it and God's
   acceptance of them on that basis. The account of this covenant-sealing
   ceremony is given in Exodus 24:1-8. Several details in Hebrews are not
   mentioned in the Old Testament. Exodus makes no mention of goats in the
   ceremony. It does not mention the use of water, scarlet wool or hyssop
   in the sprinkling. It makes no mention of the Book being sprinkled, but
   does say the altar was, which Hebrews omits.

   Delitzsch believes the expression "calves and goats" in Hebrews is a
   general term for sacrifices of all kinds. It is also quite possible
   that our author had information not given in Exodus.

   The mixing of water with blood for sprinkling and sprinkling by means
   of wool wrapped around hyssop may be inferred from the case of the
   Passover lamb (Exodus 12:22), the purification ceremony for one
   cleansed of leprosy (Leviticus 14:4-l, 49-53), or the cleansing of one
   who had touched a dead body (Numbers 19:17-18). The author of Hebrews
   either assumes the sprinkling of the Book because the altar and people
   were sprinkled, or he has information not extant today.

   9:20. Be that as it may, the point he makes is that blood was directly
   involved in the dedication of the first covenant, and he quotes Moses
   to that effect. He does change the wording slightly, giving " this is
   the blood of the testament" for "behold the blood . . ." in Exodus.
   This may reflect a simple paraphrase, or he may be aligning those words
   to the words of institution at the Lord's Supper (Matthew 26:28).

   9:21. When the tabernacle was erected, Moses sprinkled with blood the
   tabernacle itself and all the vessels of the ministry. Again the Old
   Testament does not give all these details, though it does say the
   tabernacle and its furnishings were sprinkled with oil (Exodus 40:9-11;
   Leviticus 8:10-11; Numbers 7:1) and the altar with blood as well
   (Leviticus 8:15).

   Josephus, however, says that the entire tabernacle and furnishings were
   purified "both with oil first incensed, as I said, and with the blood
   of bulls and of rams" (Antiquities 3:8:6). Again we may suppose that
   our author had information beyond that in the books of Moses.

   9:22. Almost all things, according to the Old Testament law, were
   purged with blood. This statement leaves room f or exceptions, as in
   the case of a poor Israelite (Leviticus 5:11-13; see Numbers 16:46-48;
   31:21-24; 31:50-54). The next statement, however, has no exceptions.
   Without shedding of blood there is no remission or forgiveness.

   The three words shedding of blood stand here for a single Greek word,
   which is found only here in all biblical literature. This word
   emphasizes the actual taking of blood, and calls attention to the fact
   that blood offerings represented the presentation of a life (Leviticus
   17:11). Shedding of broad is also linked to the remission of sins in
   the Lord's words at the Last Supper (Matthew 26:28).

   9:23. Because of the general practice of cleansing with blood, and
   because forgiveness of sins may be obtained only through
   blood-shedding, it was necessary that the patterns of things in the
   heavens (see 8:1, [182]5) be purified with the blood ceremonies already
   described. But the same principles require that the heavenly things
   themselves be purified with better sacrifices than these. The heavenly
   realities are purified with the blood of Christ, and this purification
   is necessary because of the general curse of sin on creation and
   because Christ has opened the way for redeemed sinners to enter the
   most holy place not made with hands.

   9:24. Christ has entered into a holy place not made with hands (see
   [183]8:1, 2, [184]5; [185]9:11-12), not the mere figures of the true,
   but into heaven itself. He has gone to appear in the presence of God,
   to be examined as a sacrificial offering, as a Lamb without spot or
   blemish, to be carefully scrutinized by God Himself -- and that with no
   cloud of incense to obscure the view! Not only so, He has presented
   Himself in this manner for us, and it is for His people alone, not for
   Himself, that Christ became the Lamb of God or that He made this
   appearance.

   Philip the Evangelist preached Jesus as a lamb, based on a prophetic
   passage full of the Gospel (Acts 8:32). Peter wrote of the Christian's
   redemption by the blood of Christ "as of a lamb without blemish" (I
   Peter 1:19). John the Baptist introduced Jesus as the "Lamb of God that
   taketh away the sins of the world" (John 1:29, 36). Paul speaks of
   Christ as our "Passover" (Lamb) who has been slain (I Corinthians 5:7).

   The figure of Jesus as a sacrificial lamb appears only in Revelation
   otherwise, though there frequently. He is the Lamb whose sacrifice has
   been received; He is a Lamb worthy of praise; the Lamb who has redeemed
   His people; the Lamb at God's right hand; the Lamb who will come in
   Judgment; and the Lamb who will be forever a light for His people
   (Revelation 5:6, 8, 12, 13; 6:16; 7:9-17; 12:11; 13:8; 14:1, 4, 10;
   15:3; 17:14; 19:7, 9; 21:9, 14, 22, 23, 27; 22:1, 3).

   9:25. Because of the quality of His offering, Christ made but one for
   all time, though as eternal priest He perpetually mediates on the basis
   of that single sacrifice. Here the con trast is with the Aaronic
   priesthood. The regular priests under that covenant entered the holy
   place often, the high priest entered the most holy place one day each
   year. But Christ, the priest of the new covenant, entered the heavenly
   holy place only one time forever. He does not need to offer himself
   often, not even every year, for He did not carry the blood of others
   but His own.

   9:26. If Christ's single sacrifice were not sufficient for all time, He
   must have suffered a bloody death since the foundation of the world,
   for just that long men have been sinners and in need of a sacrifice.
   But instead we see Him now in the end of the world, at the consummation
   of the ages, when the eternal order is breaking in on man's history, at
   the time of perfection -- appearing once on the scene of history to
   make His single offering and put away or disannul the power (same word
   at 7:18) of sin for all time.

   Note the contrasts in this verse. Christ has not suffered death often,
   but once; not from the foundation of the world, but only now in the end
   of the ages, not (as the high priests of verse 25) with the blood of
   others, but by the sacrifice of Himself.

   The exact expression here translated the end of the world (literally,
   "the consummation of the ages") appears only here in the New Testament
   Scriptures. It is parallel, however, to the expression found at Matthew
   13:39, 40, 49; 24:3 and 28:20, and closely related in meaning to
   similar phrases in I Corinthians 10:11 and I Peter 1:20. As Bruce
   points out, "it is not that Christ happened to come at the time of
   fulfillment, but that His coming made that time the time of
   fulfillment." See [186]notes on 9:10-12 and especially [187]on 1:2.

   The singularity of Christ's offering is expressed here in three ways.
   It is once for all; it is in the consummation of the ages; it is to
   abolish sin. If sin is abolished, there is no need for another
   sacrifice If the consummation of the ages has come, there is no time
   £or another. If Christ's offering is once for all, there can be no
   other. Chapter ten will show how this once-for-all character of His
   offering brings both marvelous blessings and a dreadful warning to the
   people of the new covenant.

   9:27. The general rule is stated that it is appointed by God for men to
   die once and only once, inasmuch as they live once in a mortal body,
   and after this comes the judgment. The author does not deal with the
   time lapse between death and judgment; that is not his concern. He
   simply calls attention to the fact that men live one time, die one time
   and (sometime thereafter) are judged by God for the life they lived
   before they died.

   9:28. In keeping with this general rule, Christ (who became one with
   His human brethren by taking on flesh and blood, [188]2:14) also lived
   one time in the flesh, died one time in the flesh and appeared before
   God one time to be judged on the basis of the single life lived before
   He died.

   Christ, however, lived a representative life on behalf of others (as
   chapter ten will explain); He died to bear the sins of many, so was
   offered; and has been judged for others as well (verse 24). Yet the
   point remains the same as with all men: He can only live once, die
   once, and be judged once for that life. But Christ has already lived,
   died. and been judged -- therefore He can not repeat His fleshly life,
   or death, or (this is the point in relation to verses 25-26) offering.

   Not only was Christ's life unique (both because it was sinless and
   because it was lived for others), and His death one of a kind (because
   it was offered as a sacrifice, for others, and by Himself), but His
   "judgment" was the first among men, signifying the beginning of the end
   of the world and guaranteeing the outcome of the judgment of all His
   people

   The second point in this verse uses imagery of the Day of Atonement.
   Christ our high priest has entered the presence of God bearing the
   offering. His people, meanwhile, are waiting outside the sanctuary for
   Him to return and certify that the sacrifice has been received and that
   they are forgiven The Day of Atonement, according to an ancient Jewish
   source, came to a happy end with the high priest going to his own
   house. "All the people accompany him . . . and he holds a festival to
   celebrate his having come successfully out of the sanctuary." See
   [189]Appendix V.

   The writer seems to be saying that our high priest of the new covenant
   has entered the presence of God with a suitable sin offering, and that
   He will certainly appear the second time to His people that look for
   him. Unlike those priests who foreshadowed and symbolized Him, Christ
   does not repeat the performance. Having once been offered to bear sins,
   He will reappear only to bring salvation to those for whom He once
   suffered. One should not stretch the analogy beyond measure, but we
   might observe in the light of the rest of the New Testament Scriptures
   that the Holy Spirit's descent, which authorized the beginning of the
   preaching of the Gospel, was a case of the high priest sending a
   messenger out in advance of Himself to tell the waiting people that His
   sacrifice had been received and that remission of sins was effected.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER TEN

   10:1. The law, standing here for the entire Old Testament economy,
   offered only a shadow of the good things which were to come in the
   Messianic era of fulfillment, an era which, with Christ, has already
   begun (see [190]note at 9:11). It did not minister the very image of
   heavenly realities but mere types and shadows The thought here is the
   same as at [191]8:2, [192]5; 9:1, although the words used are
   different.

   Since perfection belongs to the new order and not to the former, it is
   not surprising that worshippers under the old were not made perfect.
   That they were not is evident in the offering of the same sacrifices
   one year after another, continually.

   10:2. If the worshippers had been purged or cleansed by those
   offerings, they would have had no longer a bad conscience regarding
   sins. By contrast see John 13:10; Acts 15:9; I Corinthians 6:11;
   [193]Hebrews 9:14; I Peter 3:21.

   10:3. The opposite was true, however. The offering of jealousy, for
   example, was "an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to
   remembrance" (Numbers 5:15). Even the sacrifices of the Day of
   Atonement were reminders of past sins (Leviticus 16:21); furthermore,
   yearly repetition testified to their inability to cover future sins.

   A contrast may be noted here between the sacrifices of the old covenant
   and the Lord's Supper of the new. The former memorialized the
   sinfulness of the worshippers and constantly reminded them of their
   shortcomings. The latter memorializes the single sacrifice of Christ,
   by which worshippers now are constantly cleansed of sin. Remembrance
   here is the same word found in I Corinthians 11:24-25 and may be
   translated "memorial."

   10:4. All that has been said in the first three verses leads to one
   conclusion: the blood of animals can not take away the memory of or bad
   conscience resulting from sins.

   10:5. Foreseeing that animal blood could not take away sin, God had
   from eternity planned another offering to which burnt sacrifices always
   pointed. What follows must be seen in the light of this wherefore, as
   the writer begins to explain the significance of sacrificial blood and
   the forgiveness Christ makes possible.

   The purpose of Christ's advent into the world as a man may be expressed
   in words taken from Psalm 40:6-8, which our author here puts in His
   mouth. "Sacrifice and offering of animals or produce is not what You
   really desire," Jesus says to the Father. "You have prepared a human
   body for me instead."

   Our author is quoting the Greek Old Testament which says "a body you
   have prepared." The Hebrew text says, "you have dug out my ears." The
   final meaning is the same, however, and may be explained along either
   of two lines. Ears may stand here for the entire body, the part for the
   whole. If God formed ears for the man, He prepared also the rest of his
   body.

   Approaching the text another way, one may interpret Christ (or David,
   originally) to be saying "You have made ears that I may hear Your will
   and do it" (see Isaiah 50: 4-5). Either way the point is the same God
   does not desire a mere multiplication of Old Testament sacrifices and
   offerings. What He does want from man is indicated by the gift of a
   human body. He wants a human life dived according to His will.

   10:6. God has never desired sacrifices above human obedience. If man
   had obeyed, in fact, he would not have needed sacrifices at all This
   was true from the beginning of Israel's history (Jeremiah 7:21-23; I
   Samuel 15:22; Psalm 51:16-17) to the time of the great writing prophets
   of the eighth century (Isaiah 1:11-17; Amos 5:22-24; Micah 6:6-8).

   Each type of offering under the old covenant served a particular
   purpose, and all are included under the present principles. Sacrifice
   was the regular term for the peace. offering, a conciliation for the
   restoring of fellowship. Offering was the generic term for the meal or
   cereal offering, a donation representing the consecration of the giver.
   Burnt offering indicates the oblation expressing worship. The
   sin-offering was made for expiation or atonement.

   Whatever the purpose and whatever the offering, none was God's first
   choice from man. It is better to maintain fellowship than to restore
   it, to show consecration by a life than by an offering, to worship by
   giving oneself than a burnt animal, to obey than to atone for
   disobedience. God simply wanted human conformity to His will,
   manifested in sincere and loving obedience. Christ came to give this --
   and the Father gave Him a body for that purpose.

   10:7. The psalm quotation continues. " I come," Jesus says, " to do thy
   will, O God." The parenthetical phrase, "in the volume of the book it
   is written of me," is also from the psalm. Again, two meanings are
   possible. Christ may be saying, "what is written in the Law I apply to
   myself to keep." Or He may mean, "what David said in the psalm
   regarding obedience was a prophetic statement of Myself and My work."
   Both are true and both should be included in our understanding.

   Psalm 40:8 adds a phrase not quoted here: "Thy law is within my heart."
   David of old applied what the Law said to his own life, so that God's
   precepts were not written in the book alone but also inscribed in his
   heart. How fitting for the Christ to be foretold in such a context! For
   the new covenant He mediated is characterized by laws inscribed in
   men's hearts (see [194]8:10).

   [195]10:8-9. Our author comments on the sense of the psalm. Christ
   first mentioned sacrifices and offerings, he notes, then He spoke of
   His own coming to do God's will. Christ took away the first -- the
   offering of all those sacrifices, to make the second stand -- human
   obedience to all God's expressed will for man.

   10:10. Because Jesus gave God human obedience in a human body, then
   offered that body in death, we who are His people are sanctified or
   made holy on the basis of God's will which Jesus perfectly demonstrated
   in His body. Will here is the same as in verses seven and nine; it is
   not the same word used for a testament-will.

   Sanctified here is in a participle form meaning something now the case
   because of what happened previously. We are those who have been
   sanctified and still are -- because of the past offering of the body
   (symbolizing the well-pleasing life) of Jesus.

   Once for all is emphatic in the original here because of its location
   in the sentence We have seen this word already at [196]7:27 and
   [197]9:12. A slightly less intensive form appears at [198]6:4;
   [199]9:7, [200]26-28; [201]10:2 and [202]12:26-27.

   10:11. The old testament priest performed imperfect service, and stood
   day after day to repeat often and regularly the same sacrifices;
   sacrifices which, ironically but logically, could never fully remove
   sins.

   [203]10:12. Jesus, on the other hand, presented one sacrifice for sins,
   His body (or, in other places, His blood), standing for His perfect
   human life. This was sufficient for ever. His offering completed, Jesus
   has now sat down. Delitzsch expresses the contrast of these verses
   well. "The priest of the Old Testament stands timid and uneasy in the
   holy place, anxiously performing his awful service there, and hastening
   to depart when the service is done, as from a place where he has no
   free access, and can never feel at home; whereas Christ sits down in
   everlasting rest and blessedness at the right hand of Majesty in the
   holy of holies, His work accomplished, and He awaiting its reward."

   The figure of Christ at God's right hand is taken from Psalm 110, which
   our author has used many times. Here he has come almost full cycle from
   1:3, and is about to tie up his argument.

   [204]10:13-14. Christ as priest has made His offering. Christ as king
   is waiting for the total subjection of all His subjects. God has made
   Him king already; Christ now possesses all authority (Matthew 28:18;
   Ephesians 1:21-22; I Peter 3:22). But not all men have yet acknowledged
   His authority, though some day they must (I Corinthians 15:24-25;
   Philippians 2:8-11).

   Psalm 110 forms a backdrop before which the risen Christ is seen
   throughout the New Testament Scriptures. As noted already, most
   references to the psalm outside Hebrews emphasize Christ's kingship.
   Hebrews usually stresses His priesthood. Here the two are combined. As
   priest, Christ has made His offering and His people are waiting for His
   return. As king, He is at God's right hand, waiting for full
   recognition by men. As throughout the New Testament writings, the end
   has already begun but it is not yet completed. We live in the interim.

   [205]10:15-17. Those trusting in the sacrifice of Jesus are perpetually
   and completely sanctified. This has been argued already, and to this
   the Holy Spirit agrees as witnessed in the Old Testament Scriptures.
   Our author refers again to Jeremiah 31, which he discussed at length in
   [206]chapter eight.

   The Spirit there stated first, "This is the covenant I will make,"
   speaking of Christ's covenant in which laws would be placed in men's
   hearts and minds. But the Spirit added (our author points out), " and
   their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."

   10:18. Remission of sins means that God does not remember them any
   longer. Where there is such remission, no more offering is needed for
   sin. With this, the argument of Hebrews ends. The rest of the epistle
   consists of exhortations or warnings based on the points already
   established.

   We have a high priest who has offered a perfect offering because it
   represented a human life perfectly in accord with God's will for man.
   By that sacrifice, we are perfected. God has promised not to remember
   our sins any more. There will be no further offering; there is no need
   for another.

   Christ now is mediating the blessed benefits of His once-for-all
   sacrifice for all His covenant people. He waits for His kingship to be
   fully recognized. His people wait for His return with the inheritance
   already secured. The writer of Hebrews urges his readers to be among
   the faithful who will receive the blessing.

   [207]10:19. Boldness here represents a word which has the root idea of
   freedom of speech, therefore, freedom from fear or inhibition. The
   phrase, to enter the holiest, may also be translated "boldness for an
   entrance into the holiest." Both the personal act and the general fact
   depend on the blood of Jesus.

   10:20. Our entrance (see Ephesians 3:12) is by means of a way or road
   that is new, a particular Greek word which originally meant
   "freshly-slain." It is also living, therefore effectual to attain its
   desired and intended goal.

   Some commentators and translators think his flesh explains the veil,
   others that it refers to the way. If the former is intended, the human
   body of Jesus is a veil separating His perfect life from God in heaven.
   His spirit passed through that flesh on its way to glory. If the latter
   is meant, the human body of Jesus is itself the way which He
   consecrated through the figurative veil separating man from God. His
   people travel down the road of His human Life into God's presence. In
   fact, Jesus did pass through the flesh to His present position of glory
   and man must pass through His human life (that is, the merits it
   secured) to find salvation.

   In either case, Christ has consecrated or dedicated or officially
   opened a new highway from man to God by His blood. We have confidence
   to venture upon it because Jesus has travelled it ahead of us and is
   now safely in heaven at God's right hand (see [208]comments at
   6:19-20).

   10:21. The Christian has also a high priest over the house of God (see
   [209]notes at 3:1-6). Having both boldness and such a high priest,
   saints are exhorted regarding relationships with God, their own faith
   and one another.

   10:22. Let Christ's people draw near (the same word in [210]4:16;
   [211]7:25 and [212]11:6) to the Father with a true heart, a heart that
   is sincere and without guile (see the same point in John 4:23-24). Such
   an approach is to be in full assurance of faith, that is, in the
   complete confidence and total persuasion which faith can give.

   We have been separated from dead works by the figurative sprinkling of
   the blood of Jesus (see [213]9:13-14); we have been set apart for
   service to God as well. The priests were to wash in water before
   entering the tabernacle to serve (Leviticus 16:4) -- this may be in the
   mind of the author here.

   I believe that the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience represents
   the spiritual cleansing of the conscience by the Holy Spirit, through
   the merit of the life of Jesus as represented spiritually by His blood
   -- in other words, the inner part of regeneration. The bodies washed
   with pure water represents the physical act of baptism in water, the
   divinely-ordained manner by which faith reaches out to take hold of
   sovereign grace. It is the outer element in regeneration.

   It is not uncommon for New Testament writers to speak of the physical
   and spiritual together in this way. Jesus talked of a birth of water
   and the Spirit (John 3:3, 5). Peter told his Pentecost audience to be
   baptized for remission of sins and the reception of the Holy Spirit
   (Acts 2:38). Saul of Tarsus was told to be baptized and wash away his
   sins, calling on the name of the Lord (Acts 22:16); neither he nor
   Ananias had any doubt that his sins were washed away by a spiritual
   cleansing based on the blood of Christ.

   We read of the Corinthians being baptized by the Spirit into one body
   (I Corinthians 12:13); of the washing of water by the word (Ephesians
   5:26); of merciful salvation by the washing of regeneration and
   renewing of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5). Peter makes it clear that
   baptism is related to salvation because it is the appeal to God for a
   good conscience (I Peter 3:21). His careful explanation that baptism is
   not merely the removal of bodily defilement shows that the inner and
   outer go together and that they might be misunderstood. The same verse
   emphasizes that baptism saves "by the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

   The full assurance of faith is possible just because our Standing is
   grounded in the finished work and the single offering of Jesus Christ.
   John Bunyan speaks of od addressing the sinner in these words: "Sinner,
   thou thinkest that because of thy sins and infirmities I cannot save
   thy soul, but behold my Son is by me, and upon Him I look, and not on
   thee, and will deal with thee according as I am pleased with Him." We
   are accepted in the Beloved -- first, last and always (Ephesians 1:6,
   KJV); but, praise God, in the Beloved we are accepted"

   10:23. Again the exhortation to hold fast our own profession or
   commitment of faith. The better manuscripts here have "hope,"' in
   keeping with previous exhortations (see [214]3:6, [215]14; 4:14;
   [216]6:11). God is the one that promised, and God is faithful reliable
   and trustworthy. No one who commits himself to God in hope will ever be
   disappointed or betrayed (see also [217]6:11-12, [218]18).

   10:24. Christ's people must also consider or pay attention to one
   another, with an intention to provoke or stir up to love and good
   works. The word here translated provoke gives the English word
   "paroxysm," and appears in the New Testament Scriptures only here and
   at Acts 15:39. The mutual consideration enjoined is the duty of every
   Christian and is a clear, though frequently neglected obligation.

   10:25. Such holy provocation can not occur with the forsaking the
   assembling of ourselves together, although some had done just that. It
   happens rather by exhorting each other in assemblies called far that
   purpose, as well in the normal course of daily life.

   It has been suggested that these readers were still meeting in Jewish
   synagogue assemblies, but remaining for Christian devotions on the
   Lord's Day. Some were neglecting this additional assemblying, for which
   they are chided. Others have suggested that some were absenting
   themselves from the regular assemblies of the saints through pride or
   party-spirit and were holding private meetings instead.

   It is best to take the passage in its context and simply say that those
   who have access to God's presence and who have a high priest in heaven
   are to draw near to God, hold fast their own hope, and encourage
   Christian loving and living in one another. They will not do this by
   calling an end to Christian assemblies (through fear of persecution or
   simple indifference), but rather by meeting together for exhortation.

   Such encouragement is to intensify as the day is seen approaching.
   Throughout the Old Testament literature "the day" means an occasion
   when God visits a people to punish sin and deliver the righteous. The
   New Testament writers also speak of such a final day of punishment and
   salvation. Before the destruction of Jerusalem, many early Christians
   did not know to separate the end of the Jewish state and religion from
   the close of the present age and end of the world (see Matthew 24:3;
   Acts 1:6-8). Jesus had taught, however, that the two would not come
   together (Matthew 24:33, 36; Mark 13:29, 32).

   The author to the Hebrews may write before or after the climactic days
   of the closing sixties. Whatever the date, he speaks of the final day
   of the Lord -- the denouement of all human history at the consummation
   of the age His readers had not learned to separate that "day" into the
   separate events of resurrection, judgment and so forth, but thought of
   the entire event in terms of the phrase from the Old Testament.

   As Delitzsch puts it, this is "the day of days, the final, the decisive
   day of time, the commencing day of eternity, breaking through and
   breaking up for the church of the redeemed the night of the present."
   It is a poor argument that believers could not see this day
   approaching. James could urge patience in affliction "for the coming of
   the Lord draweth nigh" (5:6-8). Paul could speak of saints "knowing the
   time" that "the day is at hand" (Romans 13:11-12). Peter could write of
   impending judgment and "the end of all things" as "at hand" (I Peter
   4:5, 7). The word in all three passages is the word translated
   approaching here. Furthermore, all three contexts contain ethical
   instruction regarding proper conduct and mutual concern among Christian
   believers in view of the impending end.

   10:26. Warning follows exhortation. To sin willfully is not to commit a
   single sinful act of weakness or ignorance, but, as the Greek verb form
   indicates, to continue in a constant practice of sin. Nor is sin here
   just any kind of sin, but specifically the sin of disbelief which shows
   itself in forsaking Christ altogether. While such apostasy may occur
   gradually (see the warnings of [219]2:1-3; [220]6:11-12), it ultimately
   comes about through an act of the will which rejects Christ and His
   offering for sin. One might observe that even the Old Testament
   sacrifices made provision only for sins committed in ignorance or
   weakness -- not for presumptuous or willful sins (Numbers 15:22-31).

   What is envisioned here is a rejection of the new cove nant, after it
   has been received with faith and joy. Here is a will to sin in spite of
   a full knowledge of the truth, knowledge being a thorough knowledge
   both in mind and by personal relationship.

   Apostasy from Christ is dreadfully severe because there is no more
   sacrifice for sins. His offering, once for all, is man's last chance
   and only hope. The person who rejects that -- especially the man who
   has known it personally and then rejected it -- is hopelessly lost, for
   he has set his will against the only basis of forgiveness and the only
   sacrifice God will accept. Regular assemblying of saints for mutual
   exhortation is so important because it helps prevent the damnation that
   comes through loss of faith.

   10:27. The deserter may look forward only to judgment and fiery
   indignation (see Deuteronomy 9:3; Psalm 79:5, Isaiah 26:11; 30:27;
   64:2; Zephaniah 1:18), which is all the more fearful because it is
   certain. This judgment is designed for God's adversaries or enemies or
   opponents. One places himself in that category when he forsakes Christ
   and rejects His sacrifice.

   10:28. Under the law of Moses the man who forsook God's covenant and
   worshipped idols was stoned to death without mercy upon conviction
   through the testimony of two or three witnesses (see Deuteronomy
   17:2-7).

   10:29. If apostasy under the inferior covenant was hastily and rigidly
   punished, how much sorer punishment must be proper for the man who
   rejects the new covenant instituted by the blood of the Son of God? The
   question is left open for consideration by each reader -- suppose ye?

   Rejection of Christ and His offering involves a turning from the most
   holy elements of divine religion, and that in the cruelest manner. It
   is to renounce and tread under foot (see the same word at Matthew 5:13;
   7:6; Luke 8:5) the Son of God. It is to regard the blood of the
   covenant (see [221]comments at 9:18-20) which makes man holy (wherewith
   he was sanctified) as itself common and unholy. It is to despise the
   very Spirit of grace.

   Do despite translates a word which comes into our language in the noun
   "hubris." This word was used by the ancient Greeks for the most
   presumptuous arrogance and haughtiness, and was regarded as the worst
   possible sin. The idea is seen in various forms of the word translated
   "entreat spitefully" (Luke 18:32; Matthew 22:6), "use despitefully"
   (Acts 14:5), "reproach" (II Corinthians 12:10) or "shamefully entreat"
   (I Thessalonians 2:2). Just as it is cruelly ironic for the covenant
   blood which makes holy to be regarded as itself unholy, so it is for
   the Spirit whose ministry brings divine grace to be rejected with
   arrogance and insolence!

   10:30. We can appreciate the severity of punishment awaiting such a
   one, for we know God who has claimed vengeance as His own prerogative
   and has promised to recompense. These words are probably taken from the
   Song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32:35), and they are quoted by Paul in
   urging Christians not to avenge themselves (Romans 12:19).

   Another quotation from the Song of Moses shows the severity of divine
   judgment: The Lord will judge his people (Deuteronomy 32:36). This
   phrase may be interpreted two ways. In the Old Testament passage (see
   also Psalm 135:14) God judges His people by rescuing them and punishing
   their enemies. The author of Hebrews may be saying that God will
   vindicate those who are faithful to Christ in spite of adversity and
   temptation by punishing those who once knew Him but turned away. Or he
   may use the term in a general sense to mean that God will condemn the
   apostates and so "judge" them.

   10:31. In either event, the point is the same: It is a fearful thing to
   fall into the hands of the living God! It is fearful because He is God,
   and all-powerful; it is more fearful because He is the living God and
   eternal in wrath.

   It is well that we should realize that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is
   not soft, shallow, or flabby. It is a matter of blood and fire, a
   solemn, and, at times, almost a fierce thing (Robinson).

   10:32. Fear of punishment is a powerful incentive; so is the precious
   memory of early faithfulness. Call those former days to your mind, he
   urges. After becoming Christians, or being illuminated (see
   [222]comment at 6:4 where the same word is used), they had endured much
   for their faith.

   Great fight here translates a word for an athletic contest -- the
   figure will reappear in [223]12:1-2. Afflictions are literally
   "pressures" on the Christian. This pressure results from tension,
   created by the opposing pulls of old nature and new, God and Satan, of
   the Present Age and the Coming Age.

   10:33. On the one hand, our author's first readers had been personally
   made a gazingstock. This word means to be brought shamefully before
   public view, as in a theater, and reminds us of the later martyrdom of
   Christians by wild animals in public displays. These saints had not
   faced lions or leopards but the spiritual beasts of reproaches (see
   [224]11:26; [225]13:13) and afflictions from their associates.

   On the other hand, they had become companions or partners or sharers
   with other Christians so mistreated for Christ's sake. Used here
   signifies a way of life characterized by affliction. This is not a
   one-time occurrence. Under such perpetual and constant attack, the man
   of faith shows the genuineness of his commitment. This will be the
   subject of a strong exhortation in the next chapter.

   10:34. The Hebrew Christians had shown compassion or sympathy toward
   those who were imprisoned for their faith. The better manuscripts and
   later versions have "those in bonds" instead of "me in my bonds." They
   had experienced the spoiling or snatching away of their own goods or
   substance, and that with joy. They knew that they had better
   possessions in heaven, possessions that were enduring, and for those
   they could endure the plunder of earthly goods.

   10:35. They had been faithful before, they can now remain true to
   Christ. Do not cast away your confidence (see [226]comment at 10:19;
   see [227]3:6; [228]4:16 "boldly"), he urges. It has great wages or
   recompense of reward (2:2; 11:26).

   10:36. Patience means endurance, and is a key note in the author's song
   of encouragement. What God has promised He will surely give (
   [229]9:15; [230]11:13, [231]39-40), but only after faithful endurance
   according to the will of God.

   10:37. Yet a little while, he urges, taking words from Isaiah 26:20.
   The Greek here literally says, "a little -- how very, very little!" By
   comparison with the ages of eternity, how very' very well this
   describes the short Christian conflict on earth! For the same point
   from the perspective of saints already martyred, see Revelation 6:9-11.

   He that cometh here refers to Christ the high priest. The author takes
   the phrase from Habakkuk 2:3 (Greek version&gt;. Christ was "He that
   Cometh" when He came into the world as Messiah (see Matthew 11:3; Luke
   7:19; John 6:14). He is "He that Cometh" now to the Christian who
   awaits His return (see [232]9:28). Assurance is given that He will come
   and will not tarry.

   10:38. Two categories of men are named. The just or righteous will live
   through their faith -- again words from Habakkuk (2:4; see also Romans
   1:17; Galatians 3:11). Faith here stresses the element of endurance --
   with almost the sense of "hope" in other New Testament epistles. The
   second category consists of those who draw back in disbelief' and in
   them God finds no pleasure.

   10:39. The exhortation closes with a word of optimism We includes the
   author and his first readers. We are not of that class who draw back,
   and end in perdition or destruction, but of those who believe and keep
   on believing to the resultant saving of the soul. The next chapter will
   demonstrate the character and behavior of saving faith through examples
   of saints long dead. Here the readers are urged to be among the
   faithful.

   Some will be rejected, cursed and burned ( [233]6:8), but "we are
   persuaded better things of you" ( [234]6:9)! Let each believer be fully
   informed regarding the destiny of deserters and apostates. Let him
   tremble before the Wrath of a righteous God. But let him then be
   encouraged and consoled and strengthened, lest he become discouraged
   and fall to another of Satan's devices. This is the true style of
   exhortation, and Hebrews is above all a "word of exhortation" (
   [235]13:22).
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER ELEVEN

   11:1. In this chapter our author will illustrate that faith which saves
   the soul by pointing to men and women from Jewish history who possessed
   it. He begins, however, with a statement concerning this saving faith,
   which some have called its definition.

   Faith is, on the one hand, the substance or confidence or courageous
   assurance (see the same word at [236]3:14) of things hoped for. This
   term expresses the sense well of the Hebrew word for faith used
   throughout the Old Testament. It is that confident and assured trust in
   God which enables one to endure with patience while moving toward the
   object of his hope.

   Faith is, on the other hand, the evidence or proof, the absolute
   conviction, of things not seen with the physical eyes. This terminology
   expresses the sense of the Greek word for faith used in the New
   Testament. Saving faith, however, in every age and among all men,
   involves both these elements. It

     is its own proof of the existence and active energy of unseen facts
     and realities, and able by its own immediate intuitions to dispense
     with the evidence of the senses and laborious proofs of reason. It
     carries the imperious conviction of the truth it holds within itself
     (Delitzsch).

   Putting it more simply, such faith "is convinced of future good because
   it knows that the good for which it hopes already exists invisibly in
   God" (Barrett). In that conviction, faith rises to meet great
   occasions, accomplishes mighty works through God's power, and endures
   every kind of suffering for the sake of Him whose voice it has heard
   and whose reward it has seen.

   11:2. By it the elders or honorable men of the past obtained a good
   report or were well-attested by God. This general term will include
   heroes of faith from Abel the son of Adam through the Maccabean martyrs
   of the second century before Christ.

   It was common practice among Greek orators, as among speakers now, to
   illustrate particular traits by calling attention to individuals in
   whom they have been particularly apparent. When Mattathias, the
   priestly father of the Maccabean brothers, encouraged his sons on his
   deathbed he said,

     Now my children, be zealous for the Law, and give your lives for the
     covenant of your fathers. And call to mind the deeds of the fathers
     which they did in their generations, that ye may receive great glory
     and an everlasting name (I Maccabees 2:50-51).

   He then reminded them of the faith and deeds of Abraham, Joseph,
   Phinehas, Joshua, Caleb, David, Elijah, Daniel and his three friends.

   Another Jewish writing began with the following words a seven-chapter
   description of the merits of good men from Enoch to a Maccabean priest
   named Simeon:

     Let me now hymn the praises of men of piety, of our fathers in their
     generations. No little glory did the Most High allot them, and they
     were great from the days of old (Sirach 44:1-2).

   Our author is not unique in naming famous men. He is alone in calling
   attention to the clear quality of saving faith which has exemplified
   all who truly pleased God. This verse may give a capsule illustration
   of the first part of faith's description in verse one. These elders
   were men who maintained a confidence and courage and assurance toward
   God in the face of whatever circumstance they encountered.

   11:3. Through this same kind of faith we understand the origin of the
   universe although we have no physical evidence to support our
   understanding Paul uses understand in a similar statement in Romans
   1:20. Here is just one example of the second part of the definition
   found in verse one.

   The worlds (see [237]1:2) here refer to the space-time universe which
   is known by sensory perception, although the particular word literally
   means "ages." All that is now seen was framed or came into being by the
   spoken word of God. Nothing came originally from what philosophers
   would call the phenomenal, but from God's own invisible word and will.

   The word of God here is not the same as in John 1:1ff. John uses a word
   which includes both rationality or thought and the speech by which that
   is expressed. Our author uses a term which emphasizes the act of
   speaking. The farmer may be included in his remark that what we see did
   not come from what is apparent, and in the implication that it came
   from the mind and thoughts of God -- which are invisible -- by means of
   the spoken word of God.

   If Moses saw a pattern of the true tabernacle in heaven before he built
   the one on earth ( [238]8:5; [239]9:1), it is not surprising that the
   visible creation should have come from the thoughts of God and in the
   absence of any visible "stuff."

   On creation through God's spoken word see also Genesis 1, 2; Psalm
   33:6, 9 The important point is that through faith we understand this,
   and that we may have the same proof or evidence through faith that one
   might seek through physical senses.

   11:4. The first example of faith is Abel, who by it offered a sacrifice
   which God regarded as more excellent than that offered by his brother
   Cain. The story is told in Genesis 4:3-7. A number of suggestions have
   been made as to why Abel's offering pleased God when Cain's did not.

   Cain brought his fruit but Abel brought his firstfruits. Abel's
   blood-offering may have signified a realization of his need for
   forgiveness, while Cain's offering of produce showed no such insight or
   humility. Others have concluded that God prescribed the specific
   offering desired and that we have a simple contrast between obedience
   and disobedience. Our author says only that Abel's acceptance was due
   to his faith There seems to be a simpler explanation of these words
   than any yet mentioned

   Faith which successfully approaches God by nature involves the heart.
   Our writer urges that the heart not be hardened ( [240]3:8), or evil
   and unbelieving (3:12) when judged by God's word (4:12). It is rather
   to be inscribed with God's laws ( [241]8:10; [242]10:16), sincere, with
   full assurance of faith ( [243]10:22) and strengthened by grace (13:9).
   The text here says that Abel's offering was accepted because he
   presented it out of faith, and the Old Testament indicates a
   distinction between the hearts of Abel and his brother Cain (Genesis
   4:7).

   Calvin pointed to this factor in his comment that Abel's sacrifice was
   accepted "because he himself was graciously accepted," and Proverbs
   15:8 affirms the same principle. As all righteous men of all time, Abel
   pleased God through faith. This faith which guided all his life caused
   him to be accepted, and the occasion of his offering gave God
   opportunity to acknowledge the acceptance of his faith. This was in
   contrast to Cain's rejection, because of disbelief.

   It is even here the case that faith comes by hearing the word of God,
   but Abel's faith responded to God's word in general and regularly, not
   simply on this occasion. The key to his accepted offering is not the
   offering itself but his heart. God was pleased to accept the offering
   because of the faith which prompted the man who brought it.

   By the same faith Abel obtained witness from God that he was righteous.
   If one construes the which here as referring to the sacrifice instead
   of the faith, the point remains unchanged. For, if by the sacrifice
   Abel obtained witness from God, it was only in God's testimony that he
   was known to be righteous -- but he was righteous because of his faith.

   That Abel was righteous is stated by our Lord Himself (Matthew 23:35)
   as well as by the apostle John (1 John 3:12). Josephus also states that
   Cain and Abel

     were pleased with different courses of life; for Abel, the younger,
     was a lover of righteousness, and, believing that God was present at
     all his actions, he excelled in virtue. . . . But Cain was not only
     very wicked in other respects, but was wholly intent upon getting.

   God testified that Abel was righteous by receiving his gifts. Whether
   He indicated this reception by a divine word or by sending fire upon
   the altar (see Leviticus 9:23-24; Judges 6:21ff; 13:19-23; I Kings
   18:30-39; II Chronicles 7:1) we are not told.

   Though Abel had been long dead even when Hebrews was written, by his
   faith he yet speaketh. His message is not only a cry to God for
   vengeance (Genesis 4:10; [244]Hebrews 12:24), but is particularly a
   word to all God's people that they may find divine favor through faith.

   11:5. If Abel died as a result of his faith, the next witness found
   life through his. By faith Enoch was translated when God took him
   (Genesis 5:24; see II Kings 2:3, 5, 10), which our author interprets as
   meaning that he did not see death. When Enoch's associates searched for
   him he was not found (see II Kings 2:15-17). But before his translation
   Enoch had received this testimony or witness that he pleased God.

   The Greek Old Testament says that Enoch "was well-pleasing to God,"
   where the Hebrew text says he "walked with God." These terms are
   applied by the Old Testament to Noah as well as to Enoch, but to no
   other man (Genesis 6:9). Jude indicates that Enoch's contemporaries
   were anything but pleasing to God (verses 14-15), and one piece of
   uninspired Jewish literature had him "caught away lest wickedness
   should change his understanding or guile deceive his soul" (Wisdom
   4:11). Again, what is important is that Enoch pleased God through his
   faith.

   11:6. Although the Old Testament does not state that Enoch was a man of
   faith, our writer argues that he must have been. For without faith it
   is impossible to please God, yet Scripture says that Enoch did. What is
   true of Enoch is true in general. Any person who comes to God (the same
   Greek word used in Hebrews 4:16; 7:25 and [245]10:1, [246]22 of
   approaching God) must believe or have a two-fold faith. First, that God
   is or exists; second, that he becomes a rewarder to those who
   diligently seek him by faith.

   Both these are in keeping with the nature of faith as described in
   verse one. Faith believes that God is, although He is not seen, and
   that He will give those seeking Him the reward for which they hope.
   Only with such faith is God pleased, He has no pleasure in those who
   draw back in disbelief (10:38). Those who received this epistle needed
   just such a faith if they were to receive their reward ( [247]10:35).
   Those who read it today need the same.

   11:7. Noah was also a man of faith. Like Abel, he was righteous; like
   Enoch, he walked with God or pleased Him (Genesis 6:9). When warned of
   God Noah prepared an ark, for his faith provided evidence of things not
   seen as yet. He moved with godly fear or piety (see the same word at
   [248]5:7; [249]12:28), itself a companion of faith, which resulted in
   the saving of his house.

   By faith, Noah condemned the world which did not have faith. He became
   an heir of the only righteousness God recognizes, that which is
   according to faith. Noah was saved by faith. His faith showed itself by
   acting in assurance of the unseen, through confidence in the God who
   had promised.

   11:8. The next five verses speak of Abraham's faith, noted by Old
   Testament writers (Genesis 15:6; Nehemiah 9:8) as well as New (Romans
   4, Galatians 3:6-9). Our writer has already discussed Abraham twice (he
   is mentioned in [250]2:16); once in connection with God's faithfulness
   ( [251]6:13-15) and once in giving historical background to Melchizedek
   ( [252]7:1-10). Here Abraham's faith is in the spotlight.

   By faith Abraham obeyed the call of God to go out, not knowing where he
   would go. He knew only that God had commanded. "Faith and obedience are
   inseparable in man's relation to God." Abraham "would not have obeyed
   the divine call had he not taken God at his word; his obedience was the
   outward evidence of his inward faith" (Bruce).

   Abraham was to receive a promise of the land as an inheritance, but
   that promise was not given until after he had initially obeyed (Genesis
   12:1-7). The promise concerning an inheritance was itself a reward for
   his initial faith, not the original motive for his obedience. That
   rested on his faith alone.

   11:9. By faith Abraham sojourned or lived as a stranger who was passing
   through a strange country, although in fact he was in the land which
   according to God's promise would some day belong to his descendants. He
   lived with Isaac, who was born when Abraham was 100 years old (Genesis
   21:5), and Jacob, born when he was 160 (Genesis 25:26), for fifteen
   years (Genesis 25:7) in tabernacles or tents.

   As semi-nomads (Genesis 26:12; 33:17) the patriarchs did not settle for
   the luxuries of any city around them. The metropolitan areas of Sodom
   and Gomorrah were by no means alone in Palestine and Syria of Abraham's
   day. Jericho had been a fortified city already for more than 5,000
   years. Yet the patriarchs remained intentional strangers, looking for a
   special kind of city which only God could prepare.

   [253]11:10. Abraham, and apparently Isaac and Jacob as well (see
   [254]verses 13-16), looked for the city which hath the foundations.
   Both definite articles are present in the original, adding emphasis to
   the uniqueness of the city for which they searched. The following
   verses tell us that they were trusting God for a home in the heavenly
   city. This verse calls it the city with the foundations, whose builder
   or craftsman or architect and maker or constructor is God.

   In addition to other references in Hebrews ( [255]12:22; [256]13:14),
   the new or heavenly Jerusalem is mentioned in Galatians (4:25-26) and
   Revelation (3:12; chapters 21, 22) At times it is a present reality,
   distinguished from earthly Jerusalem as the spiritual is distinguished
   from the physical, and is discernable by faith. At the same time, it is
   to be distinguished in a temporal sense as the inheritance
   not-yet-given which awaits the people of God. In Hebrews, notes Bruce,
   "it is the heavenly Jerusalem, the commonwealth of God in the spiritual
   and eternal order, now effectively made accessible by the completion of
   Christ's high-priestly work, to which all the men and women of faith
   come to be enrolled as free citizens" (see also Philippians 3:20).

   11:11. The text used by the King James translators notes that by faith
   Abraham's wife Sarah was enabled to bear a son although past the normal
   age. A problem arises here, however, because the Greek word translated
   conceive seed is not the word for the mother's part in conception at
   all, but the father's. In addition, Sarah is pictured in the Old
   Testament, not as believing God's promise, but laughing at it in scorn
   and disbelief (Genesis 18:12-15). Finally, the statement that Sarah was
   delivered of a child is not in the better Greek manuscripts or the
   later English versions.

   A solution may not be far away. The original words here represented as
   Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed, may, by remarking the
   vowels, be translated "He also, with Sarah, received strength to begat
   a child, when he was past age." This reading is suggested in the margin
   of the Westcott and Hort Greek text and is noted with approval in the
   lexicons translated by Thayer and by Arndt and Gingrich. It does not do
   violence to the original text, either, for vowels in it were not
   marked. This reading not only accounts for the particular Greek word
   used, it fits the facts of the Old Testament and makes the present
   passage far more readable By faith Abraham went out (verse eight),
   sojourned (verse nine), with Sarah had a son ( [257]verse 11), and
   offered Isaac ( [258]verse 17).

   The fulfillment of this promise, impossible by human calculations,
   became possible by the faith of Abraham. He exemplified that highest
   quality of faith which judges God to be faithful in all that He has
   promised, and acts accordingly.

   11:12. Not only Isaac, but eventually a multitude as numerous as the
   stars in the sky (Genesis 15:5; 22:17) or the grains of sand by the
   shore (Genesis 22:17) came from the one man Abraham (Isaiah 51:1-2;
   Ezekiel 33:24). To this add that he was as good as dead so far as
   producing offspring when Isaac was promised The text literally says
   that he had long been dead in this sense. Paul uses the same form of
   this word in Romans 4:19. There he insists that saving faith is faith
   in a God who is able to raise the dead, and he develops that point with
   reference to Christian faith in the gospel concerning Christ (see also
   verse 19 in this chapter).

   11:13. These sojourning worthies -- Abraham (and Sarah), Isaac and
   Jacob -- all died just as they had lived, in the sphere where faith is
   the motivating principle. Although they did not during their lifetime
   receive the object of the promises given them, by faith they had seen
   them as if from a distance. Their faith saw what was invisible and the
   conviction it produced caused them to react with certain assurance.
   They embraced what they saw (literally "greeted" or "saluted"), and
   happily confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims -- not only in
   that land but on the earth itself (see verse ten).

   Abraham confessed that he was a stranger and pilgrim (Genesis 23:4), as
   did Jacob (Genesis 47:9). David, a later man of faith, made the same
   confession in his day (Psalm 39:12; 119:19; I Chronicles 29:15). Peter
   urges Christians to have the same attitude (I Peter 1:17; 2:11), as
   does our writer in making the present point

   11:14. They that say that they are strangers and pilgrims on this earth
   declare plainly that they are looking for a country or fatherland of
   their own The patriarchs did say such things and we may know that was
   their quest.

   11:15. The country they sought was not one from which they came out,
   whether Haran or Chaldea. When on one occasion a servant suggested that
   Isaac return to Haran to acquire a wife, Abraham was urgent in
   insisting against it (Genesis 24:5-8). God had called him away from
   that country; his mind was not set on it and he did not return even
   when he had opportunity. These men were pilgrims, not leaving a former
   home only, but travelling toward a future one. They were immigrants to
   the heavenly city, as well as emigrants from one on earth.

   11:16. They wanted a heavenly country better than any earth could
   provide. They were not perfect mortals by any standard, but they were
   men who trusted God and took Him at His word. For this reason he is not
   ashamed to be called their God (Genesis 28:13; Exodus 3:6; see Mark
   12:26-27). For the same reason He has prepared that heavenly city for
   which they looked during their lives.

   Just as the true sabbath rest is fulfilled only in the eternal realm of
   realities entered after death by the faithful ( [259]4:1-11; Revelation
   14:13), so the faith-pilgrim finds his city only in the dimension of
   perfected existence.

   An unknown writer from perhaps the third century after Christ had the
   same thought in mind when he described Christians in these words.

   They live in their own homelands, but as foreigners. They share in
   everything as citizens, hut endure everything as aliens. Every foreign
   country is their homeland, but every homeland is a strange country to
   them They spend their time on the earth, but their citizenship is
   really in heaven (Epistle to Diognetus, my translation).

   11:17. It was also by faith that Abraham was offering Isaac, having
   already offered him in his own heart and mind, when an angel of God
   stopped him short of the actual deed. The story is given in Genesis
   22:1-14. Jewish traditions had Isaac 23, 25 or even 37 years old at the
   time, and credited him with the same faith as his father, but the
   Genesis account leaves the impression that Isaac was much younger.

   The tense of the first verb offered up indicates an action completed in
   the past with results carrying into the present. Abraham's faith was so
   real that he regarded Isaac as already having been offered. Apparently,
   God did as well. But Abraham's faith was not limited to his mind, for
   he was in the process of carrying out this act (as the tense of the
   second offered up suggests) when stopped by God. Faith is what
   justifies, not the act it prompts; yet justifying faith will always be
   acting in obedience to God.

   Scripture refers to this incident as a test by which Abraham's faith
   was tried (Genesis 22:1, 12). An ancient Jewish work called The Book of
   Jubilees told of a confrontation behind the scenes between God and a
   demon, details borrowed, no doubt, from the Biblical story of Job.

   11:18. There could be no doubt as to the crisis: it was to be in or
   through Isaac that the race which would be called the seed of Abraham
   would have its origin (Genesis 21:12). The test of Abraham's faith lay
   in the realization that God's promises to him depended on this very
   only begotten son whom God now commanded to be offered as a sacrifice.
   What does one do when God's promises seem to contradict His clear
   commands? Abraham's example would say that faith suspends human
   reasoning and obeys, trusting that God is both able and faithful to
   carry out His promises.

   11:19. If God could raise one up from the dead by a miraculous birth to
   aged parents ( [260]verse 12; Romans 4:17-22), He was certainly able to
   raise Isaac from the death Abraham was now commanded to inflict. This
   much Abraham knew, and he seems to have believed that God would d0 this
   very thing (Genesis 22:5).

   Because Isaac was already dead in Abraham's faithful mind (see
   [261]verse 17), our author says that is what did happen; not literally,
   but in a figure. Abraham's faith was approved. He received his son
   alive as a reward.

   Because figure here is literally "parable," some have taken the phrase
   to mean that what happened to Isaac was a figure or parable of Jesus
   who was to come. Whether or not that was in our author's mind, a number
   of parallels are apparent. Isaac was Abraham's only begotten son (
   [262]verse 17; see John 3:16). He was a child of promise through whom
   God would bless the world. He was born of a miraculous conception.

   Isaac carried the wood for his own death, as Jesus carried His own
   cross. Isaac was received back as from the dead, as our Lord was in
   fact. In Isaac's place, God provided a ram for the sacrifice, caught in
   a thicket by his horns. Jesus Himself was the Lamb of God, but died
   with a crown of thorns on His head. Both events involve a test of
   faith. Man is now asked to place all hope of salvation in the crucified
   and risen Jesus, a proposition as troubling to human reason as the
   dilemma faced by Abraham.

   11:20. By faith this same Isaac, when he was old and blind, blessed his
   sons Jacob (Genesis 27:26-29; 28:1-4) and Esau (Genesis 27:39-40)
   concerning things which were to come in the distant future. These
   blessings involved the fortunes of two nations, Israel and Edom, and
   they came to pass as foretold. That Isaac spoke by faith implies more
   in the blessings than a fatherly prediction. What he said must have
   been based on a word from God.

   The measure of faith required from Isaac is seen in the very
   circumstance of the blessing. Jacob had reversed the ordinary prophecy
   through common deceit, and the blessings were given unwillfully by
   Isaac. Yet Isaac was confident that God would carry out His purposes

   God is all-knowing and all-powerful, and faith trusts Him to accomplish
   His will in spite of all human obstacles. No circumstance may arise
   through human sin which God can not use for His own glory. This is the
   confident conviction of every one who believes that God is and that He
   becomes a rewarder to those who seek Him.

   11:21. Many years later, Jacob acted by faith when he blessed Ephraim
   and Manasseh, the two sons of Joseph (Genesis 48:1-22). See the
   comments regarding the patriarchal blessing above.

   The same faith was evident in Jacob when he made Joseph swear to have
   him buried some day in the land of promise, then leaned in reverence
   upon the top of his pilgrim's staff and worshipped the God of his
   fathers (Genesis 47:29-31).

   God's promise to Abraham had included affliction in a strange country,
   but also a great deliverance after four generations (Genesis 15:13-16).
   In that promise alone Jacob placed all his confidence now. In spite of
   "the exhaustion of approaching death, he summoned all his bodily
   powers, and placed his aged limbs as well as he could in the position
   of profoundest adoration" (Delitzsch).

   It may be noticed that Genesis has "bed" where our author has "staff."
   The same consonants in Hebrew may be either; our author is using a
   Greek translation which had "staff." The faith of Jacob remains the
   same in either ease, and that is the point.

   The writer of Hebrews may reverse the chronological order of the two
   events in this verse for smoother transition from Isaac's blessing (
   [263]verse 20) to Jacob's blessing (verse 21), and from Jacob's
   death-bed ( [264]verse 21) to Joseph's ( [265]verse 22).

   11:22. Dying Joseph acted by faith when he spoke of the divinely
   promised departing of the children of Israel (see notes on verse 21),
   and gave a commandment concerning the future burial of his bones
   (Genesis 50:24-25). His faith in God's promise was vindicated many
   years later when his bones were carried up out of Egypt (Exodus 13:19)
   and laid to rest at Shechem (Joshua 24:32).

   11:23. By faith, Moses, who has been commended already for faithfulness
   in God's house (3:2, [266]5), was hid three months (Exodus 2:2) by his
   parents Amram and Jochebed (Exodus 6:20). Their act was in violation of
   the king's commandment that Hebrew male infants should be destroyed
   (Exodus 1:22). To say that Moses was a proper child is to say he was
   urbane, stately or well-favored (see Acts 7:20). Jewish tradition said
   that Moses' parents were informed of God's plans for Moses, through
   either a dream of Amram or a prophetic utterance by Moses' sister
   Miriam. Scripture states simply that they acted from faith.

   11:24. When Moses was mature or come to years, he acted by faith and
   refused to be called the son of Pharoah's daughter, by whom he had been
   adopted as an infant (Exodus 2:9-10). The refusal may have taken the
   form of a dramatic confrontation or it may have been by identification
   with the enslaved Hebrews through incidents such as that re corded in
   Exodus 2:11-12 (see also Acts 7:23-25).

   The identity of Pharoah's daughter must remain a present mystery. The
   designation "Pharoah" is of no help, since it was not a personal name
   but the ancient royal title meaning "The one who lives in the great
   house." Josephus says the Pharoah's daughter was named Thermuthis, and
   the Jewish Book of Jubilees called her Tharmuth. Both are names of a
   daughter of Rameses II, who lived during the thirteenth century before
   Christ. Another daughter of Rameses II, Meri, has also been suggested
   as the princess of Exodus.

   Conservative scholarship has generally preferred an earlier date for
   Moses, and some writers have suggested that this princess was
   Hatshepsut, a powerful daughter of Thutmose I. Hatshepsut later became
   "king" herself, and even wore the ceremonial beard of the pharoah. She
   ruled during the fifteenth century before Christ.

   Our historical curiosity must wait for further evidence from
   archaeology, but our appreciation of the faith of Moses remains
   unaffected. Whenever he lived, his worldly position warred against his
   faith. To his eternal credit Moses trusted God instead of appearances,
   and of his alternatives our author now speaks.

   11:25. Moses could have known a powerful position in Egypt, perhaps
   even becoming Pharoah. Instead he cast his lot with a race of slaves.
   His faith looked behind the scenes and calculated it better to suffer
   affliction with the people of the eternally existent and rewarding God
   than to enjoy all the conceivable pleasures of sin which were temporary
   (see this same word at II Corinthians 4:18). By faith, Moses "looked
   through the deceptive appearances of worldly good things, to their
   inward and essential nothingness, and to their fearful end"
   (Delitzsch).

   11:26. The treasures of Egypt were fantastic, as demonstrated by a few
   small caches uncovered in certain royal tombs. The treasures of King
   "Tut" (Tutankhaton, fourteenth century before Christ) are well known;
   that much or more might have belonged to Moses. But faith appraised the
   alternatives and pronounced reproaches with God's people to he the
   greater riches!

   Moses chose the reproaches (see [267]10:33) of Christ. Suffering
   accepted for God's sake binds together saints of troth testaments and
   identifies them all with Christ (Philippians 1:29; Colossians 1:24; II
   Timothy 2:10). David so spoke in Psalm 69:7-9, in words later seen to
   refer also to Christ (John 2:17; Romans 15:3). In another psalm, Ethan
   spoke of his sufferings as for the sake of God's anointed one (the
   literal meaning of "Christ," 89:50-51). Moses endured reproaches, as
   Christ was to do, he was a type of Christ (Deuteronomy 18:18; Acts
   3:20-23). His suffering was one link in the great chain of events by
   which God directed history to its focal point in Christ.

   11:27. By faith Moses forsook Egypt for Midian (Exodus 2:15). Lest the
   Exodus account be misunderstood, our author adds that this flight was
   not prompted by the wrath of the king. Like his parents before him (
   [268]verse 23), Moses was well aware of Pharoah's wrath, but also like
   them he acted through positive faith in God and not through fear. Fear
   might have led a slave rebellion -- which would have been crushed at
   once. Faith quietly retreated to the desert to be molded forty years
   for God's great deliverance.

   In this particular crisis and thereafter, Moses endured the
   consequences of his faith by looking toward God who is invisible. Again
   we are reminded that faith believes that God is and that He is a
   rewarder of those who seek Him. The faith of Moses stood against the
   unbelief of Pharoah, who Philo says "did not acknowledge any deity
   apart from those that could be seen." The plagues on Egypt were
   judgments against its many visible gods (Exodus 12:12).

   Some relate this verse to the Exodus rather than to Moses' earlier
   flight to Midian, but at least four objections may be raised to that
   view. First, the order here is reversed. The Passover preceded the
   Exodus but is mentioned in the verse following this one. Second our
   writer does not mention the faith of Israel here, as he does regarding
   the Red Sea ( [269]verse 29) and as one might expect if this refers to
   the Exodus. Third, Pharoah of the Exodus was not the king from whom
   Moses fled, yet our author has to deny that fear prompted the flight
   under consideration (Exodus 2:23). Fourth, Israel did not leave Egypt
   under fear, but at the urging of Pharoah and the Egyptians (Exodus
   12:31-33).

   11:28. By faith (the word here is exactly that translated "try faith"
   elsewhere in the chapter), Moses kept the passover for the first time
   and left it as a perpetual celebration (Exodus 12:1-20). Faith prompted
   the sprinkling of the lamb's blood; it was rewarded in Israel's
   deliverance when the firstborn of Egypt's men and animals were
   destroyed by God (Exodus 12:21-30).

   Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper at a passover meal. His selection of
   bread and fruit of the vine as the elements of His covenant meal also
   demonstrates the continuity between old and new testaments

   John's Gospel presents Jesus' death against a background of the slaying
   of passover lambs in the temple (John 19:31, 36). Paul makes the
   unleavened bread of passover week a type representing moral purity
   among Christians, whose Lamb is Christ (I Corinthians 5:6-8). Our
   author does not use passover typology He stresses the Day of Atonement
   and its perfect fulfillment in the self-offering of Christ. For
   additional references on Christ as God's Lamb, see notes on 9:24.

   11:29. The Israelites were represented by Moses in the previous verse.
   Here they are mentioned as a company. It is striking that examples of
   faith are drawn from individuals, usually persons who were faithful
   when all around them were not. The nation is used to illustrate
   disbelief ( [270]3:9-11; [271]3:16-4:11; I Corinthians 10:1-12). This
   great moment of Israel's faith immediately precedes forty years of
   unbelief in the wilderness.

   By faith Israel passed through the midst of the divided Red Sea (Exodus
   14:21-22), though God divided the sea with a strong east wind which
   came at a signal from Moses (Exodus 14:21). The Egyptians lacked faith,
   (literally) "made a trial of" the sea, and were drowned.

   The Hebrew Old Testament calls this the Sea of Reeds. English versions
   generally agree with the Greek Old Testament in calling it the Red Sea.
   Exodus 14:2 indicates that the crossing took place at a northern
   extension of what is now the Gulf of Suez. This mighty act of divine
   deliverance was immediately celebrated in a song of praise (Exodus
   15:1-21); still later it was used to represent God's great power to
   accomplish His covenant purposes (Isaiah 11:15-16; 51:10-11). Paul used
   this crossing as a type of Christian baptism, and argued from it that
   those once in fellowship with God may forfeit their blessing through
   loss of faith (I Corinthians 10:1ff).

   11:30. The capture of Jericho (Joshua six) involved what we call
   psychological warfare; the inhabitants must have been terrified after
   six days of encirclement by a silent army who marched behind blowing
   trumpets. But the walls fell down on the seventh day -- and that by the
   faith which prompted the past week's strange behavior. On Israel's part
   the six days of marching demonstrated the perseverance of true faith --
   an element close to our writer's mind as he pens this chapter (
   [272]10:35-39; [273]12:1, [274]3).

   An archaeologist named Garstang thought he had uncovered the very walls
   which fell before Joshua, but dating based on later work of Kathleen
   Kenyon made that identification very unlikely. Such matters are of
   interest, but the truthfulness of the biblical story does not depend on
   the excavator's spade. The same God whom Israel's faith touched that
   day thousands of years ago stands now behind our written account of
   that event, and the same kind of faith which trusted His direct word
   then places confidence now in His word that is written.

   11:31. When the walls of Jericho fell and Israel stormed the city,
   Rahab and her family were the only survivors (Joshua 6:22-25). Her
   salvation was the result of her faith, which had been demonstrated
   earlier in hiding the two Israelite spies (Joshua 2). Her act was of
   faith because she had heard of God's past deeds for Israel and she
   behaved from a reverent recognition of His power and purposes (Joshua
   2:10-11).

   Rahab is contrasted here with them that believed not. The word
   translated "believe" here implies obedience that comes from a
   persuasion of faith (the same word is used at [275]3:18). James uses
   Rahab as an illustration of that saying faith which does not merely
   profess but obeys ( [276]2:25). Clement of Rome, an early Christian
   author whose work was not inspired, used Rahab as an example of
   hospitality and faith (I Clement 12:1).

   Some pious Jews of antiquity tried to make Rahab an innkeeper or a
   seller of food, instead of a harlot, but the word used in both Old and
   New Testaments demands that she be just that. Nor is this the word for
   a cultic or pagan temple prostitute, but an ordinary harlot. In spite
   of her former way of life, Rahab was transformed through the power of
   faith. She later was to marry a Hebrew named Boaz to become a chosen
   vessel in the ancestry of our Lord (Matthew 1:5).

   11:32. Using a Greek phrase common to orators, our author notes that
   his time would fail if he detailed every example of faith, and draws
   his list to a close.

   The first four names are selected from the period of the Judges, and
   carry the Old Testament story from the time of Joshua to the time of
   the kings. Gideon delivered Israel from marauding Midianites who used
   the speed of camels to make their plundering attacks (Judges 6-8).
   Gideon is also called Jerubbaal (Judges 6:32).

   As Deborah's war-captain, Barak shared in the deliverance of the
   northwestern tribes from a confederacy of Canaanite kings who used
   chariots long before they were a common vehicle of war. The story in
   Judges 4-5 does not indicate Barak's faith, unless it is to be seen in
   his agreement to assist Deborah with prospects of no personal glory (4:
   8-9). Chronologically Barak comes before Gideon, but in importance the
   order is here reversed.

   The exploits of Samson against Philistine occupation-troops are
   familiar to the Bible student (Judges 13-16). Samson's faith was not
   always strong or active, but it came to the fore on the occasion of his
   death.

   Jephthah was instrumental in delivering the eastern tribes from Ammon
   (Judges 11-12). Though he is now remembered chiefly for a rash vow, his
   general behavior was grounded in a knowledge of God's past acts on
   behalf of Israel and a confidence that He would act once more for His
   own people (11:14-27). Jephthah also illustrates the fact that God may
   use ignoble individuals to accomplish great things (Judges 11:1-3).

   It is possible that these four individuals were grouped together soon
   after their own times. First Samuel 12:11 speaks of Jerubbaal (Gideon)
   and Bedan (the Greek and Syriac versions have Barak) and Jephthah and
   Samuel (the Syriac version has Samson, but that seems to be a change
   that is unwarranted).

   Time would fail, indeed, to give details of the faith of David (I
   Samuel 16-31; II Samuel; I Chronicles 11-29). The man after God's own
   heart (Acts 13:22) who served God's purpose in his own generation (Acts
   13:36) must have been characterized by exceptional faith, for without
   faith it is impossible to please God at all.

   Samuel was the last of the judges and the first of a chain of prophets
   who would instruct Israel through the rest of the Old Testament period
   (I Samuel 19:20). Although be preceded David, he is here placed more
   naturally with the prophets who followed him. Samuel's own birth was in
   answer to a prayer of faith (l Samuel 1:10-20, and his personal
   ministry early included a total trust in the word God revealed to him
   (I Samuel 3).

   The prophets include Elijah, Elisha, Micaiah and other non-writing
   prophets, as well as the sixteen whose books bear their names. One does
   not have to look far to be impressed by their faith. He needs only to
   consider the mighty works of Elijah and Elisha, the patient and trying
   service of Hosea or Jeremiah. the holy boldness of Micaiah or Amos or
   Daniel, the unquestioning obedience of Ezekiel, or the confident
   reliance which Habakkuk expresses so beautifully in his poetic third
   chapter These men all, along with a host of God's holy ones whose faith
   will be celebrated only in the resurrection, eloquently illustrate the
   many-faceted qualities of that faith which is unto the saving of the
   soul.

   11:33. Through faith men have subdued kingdoms. Joshua, the judges and
   David come to mind at once. Others have wrought righteousness by the
   public administration of divine justice. This is noted of Samuel (I
   Samuel 12:4) and David (II Samuel 8:15; Psalm 101). Faith has obtained
   the fulfillment as well as the word of promises: of the Exodus, of
   Canaan's possession, of great territories, of God's care and protection
   of Jerusalem, of a captivity that ended as predicted and a return home

   Faith has stopped the mouths of lions, by death (Judges 14:5-6; I
   Samuel 17: 34-36), but especially when Daniel had been delivered to
   hungry lions by his enemies and God de livered him from their jaws
   (Daniel 6).

   11:34. Faith has sometimes quenched the violence of fire, most notably
   in the case of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego (Daniel 3). Peter's
   mention of "fiery trials" may suggest that such persecution was a
   possibility in the case of those who first read this epistle (I Peter
   4:12).

   Elijah (I Kings 19), Elisha (II Kings 6) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 36) all
   escaped the edge of the sword by faith, but others by faith met the
   steel ( [277]Hebrews 11:37).

   Out of weakness men and women of faith were made strong. Gideon was the
   most insignificant member of his family, but God used him mightily.
   Neither Saul nor David claimed personal merit when God called for
   service. Both responded to that call in faith, and in personal weakness
   found God's strength. Others already discussed in this chapter were
   enabled by faith to accomplish what would otherwise have been
   impossible.

   God has never depended on numbers, nor has He valued man's appraisals
   of strength and weakness (see Deuteronomy 32:30; Leviticus 26:8; Joshua
   23:10; II Corinthians 1:9-10; 12:9-10). To consider the examples in
   this chapter is more frequently than not to see God working in spite of
   the very instruments He chooses to use, overcoming men's own weaknesses
   and mistakes to bring about His eventual glory. This lesson is always
   needed in the church, for men constantly face the temptation to view
   life through human values rather than with the clear and certain lens
   of faith.

   By faith other waxed valiant in fight and turned the armies of the
   aliens to flight. Old Testament characters could be adduced here, but
   these terms also fit the heroic men of faith who lived between the
   testaments. The book of I Maccabees is not inspired, but it tells of
   numerous victories which faith brought the sons of Mattathias in their
   godly struggle against the pagan Syrian ruler Antiochus Epiphanes.

   11:35. Women who had lost loved ones received them to life again
   through the power of faith. We think of the widow of Zarephath (I Kings
   17:17ff) and the Shunemite woman (II Kings 4:17ff); perhaps there were
   others.

   Tortured here translates a word which describes quite literally an
   extremely cruel persecution in which an individual was stretched on a
   rack then beaten to death. Second Maccabees is not quite so reliable as
   the first book, but it tells of a godly scribe named Eleazar who died
   in this very manner for his faith in Jehovah 16:18-31).

   When Eleazar was captured, he was offered deliverance if he would eat
   swine's flesh This he refused, in hope of a better resurrection.
   Whether our author has him in mind or not, Eleazar's dying words are
   characteristic of those who are intended here. "The Lord, who hath holy
   knowledge, understandeth that although I might have been freed from
   death, I endure cruel pains in my body from scourging and suffer this
   gladly in my soul, because I fear Him."

   One Jewish mother of the period was forced to watch the torture and
   murder of her seven sons, but tenderly encouraged each in his turn to
   be faithful to God. Their dying words eloquently illustrate this verse.
   One said, "Thou dost dispatch us from this life, but the King of the
   world shall raise us up, who have died for His laws, and revive us to
   life everlasting " Another extended his limbs for torture with the
   words, "These I had from heaven; for His name's sake I count them
   naught; from Him I hope to get them back again." When all the others
   had died, the youngest son was offered riches and a position of state
   if he would deny God. He answered,

     These brothers, after enduring a brief pain, have now drunk of
     everflowing life, in terms of God's covenant; but thou shalt receive
     by God's judgment the just penalty of thine arrogance. I, like my
     brothers, give up body and soul for our fathers' laws, calling on
     God [these deaths are related in II Maccabees 7).

   11:36. Others faced the test of mockings by many cruel and sportive
   tortures. They endured scourgings or whippings; they suffered bonds and
   imprisonment. The recipients of our epistle had endured some trials of
   faith early in their Christian lives and had shared with others who
   were imprisoned for Christ ( [278]10:32-34). Jeremiah had know
   imprisonment for the word of God (Jeremiah 20:2; 37:15; 38: 6), as had
   Joseph for his faithfulness to God (Genesis 39).

   Others includes individuals not yet mentioned, and perhaps unknown to
   us, but known to the original readers. The tortures endured by the
   seven faithful brothers already mentioned compare in severity and
   depravity with any atrocities of times nearer ourselves. The tormentors
   tore out the tongue of the oldest brother, scalped and mutilated him in
   the presence of his younger brothers and his mother, then fried his
   body, maimed but still alive, in a huge cauldron (II Maccabees 7:15).
   The others suffered similar agonies, but we will follow the advice of
   the final verse in that chapter and "let this suffice" for "the
   excesses of barbarity."

   11:37. Long before Stephen, men of God had been stoned to death for
   their faithfulness. When Joach was king of Judah and the nation turned
   from God, a prophet named Zechariah came to testify against the people.
   "And they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the
   commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord'' (II
   Chronicles 24:17-21).

   Tradition has Jeremiah stoned to death by the Jews who took him into
   Egypt after the captivity of Judah (see Jeremiah 42-44). Nor was he the
   only man of God to meet this fate from those who were called God's
   people (Matthew 23:37; II Corinthians 11:25).

   Others for their faith were sawn asunder. Very ancient Jewish
   traditions say that Isaiah was killed with a wooden saw under the reign
   of Manasseh. Scripture does not confirm this story, but one can well
   imagine such an act from a king who offered his own children in pagan
   sacrifice (II Chronicles 33:6) and who made the people of Judah "do
   worse than the heathen" (verse nine).

   Faithful saints were tempted in many ways, but held fast their
   confidence in the God they could not see. It has been suggested that
   the word here translated tempted might, by the change of one letter, he
   translated "met death by fire." This was the fate of some faithful ones
   during the time of the Maccabees (II Maccabees 6:11), but textual
   evidence does not appear to warrant such a change here.

   Some were slain with the sword for their faith, although others by
   faith escaped this death ( [279]verse 34) Elijah was Spared when others
   died (I Kings 19:10). Jeremiah escaped the sword when Urijah was slain
   (Jeremiah 26:23-24). Herod killed James with the sword but Peter was
   spared (Acts 12:2ff). Only God knows why some died and others did not,
   but the faith of each will have its reward.

   Because they walked by faith, God's people have sometimes lost their
   homes and have been forced to wander about in sheepskins and goatskins.
   While it is true that Elijah (II Kings 1:8), John the Baptist (Mark
   1:6) and perhaps others (Zechariah 13:4) wore hairy garments, our
   author speaks of a condition brought on by force, not choice, and
   apparently intends some others than these.

   11:38. Godless crowds have cried that faithful saints were unfit for
   this world (Acts 22:22). With this our author agrees, though with an
   opposite meaning! Of such the world was not worthy, so they lived in
   deserts, mountains, caves or dens while they waited for their heavenly
   city and eternal homeland

   We see Elijah hiding at Horeb, Elisha at Carmel, or 100 prophets in
   caves. During the period between the testaments, many of the faithful
   were forced to forsake their homes to seek safety in remote areas. E.M.
   Zerr believes the prophecies of Daniel 11:31-36 were fulfilled in the
   persecutions of that period; Keil includes the Maccabeean heroes but
   only in a larger picture.

   11:39. What was said earlier of the patriarchs (verse 13) is said now
   of all these faithful men and women. They obtained a good report or
   were subjects of good testimony regarding their faith -- whether
   directly from God (verse four) or by later men of faith (verse two).
   Yet they received not the particular promise which faith always grasps
   -- that final and complete inheritance from the invisible God who is
   trusted to be a rewarder.

   We must not take this to mean that these ancient saints were outside
   the provisions of divine grace or that they will not be among the
   glorified faithful with Christ eternity (see [280]notes on 12:23).
   Indeed they were justified by faith -- they had this testimony -- and
   the offering of Christ declares that God was righteous in accepting
   them because of their faith ( [281]9:15; Romans 3:25-26).

   11:40. The fact that their faith was unrewarded in life is not a sign
   that faith is ineffective or that God is unfaithful. It is rather a
   pointer to the unity of all men of faith in every dispensation or age.
   They who lived by faith before Christ were not perfect or complete
   without those of us who know God through Christ in the new covenant.
   "Christ himself is the essential bond of union which binds together the
   saints of all ages" (Milligan).

   At the same time, God has provided something for us that is better than
   anything they were given. This is the knowledge of a high priest who
   has offered a perfect sacrifice for sins once far all, who now sits at
   God's right hand making intercession for His people, who has opened the
   way into heaven by His own life and death, and who has promised to
   return to His people to, share the glory with them He has already
   acquired as their representative

   Better is a key word in Hebrews and is characteristic of the new
   covenant with all it offers particularly in contrast to the former
   covenant and institutions. It is used of Christ's name or position (
   [282]1:4), His dedicatory sacrifices of the heavenly sanctuary (
   [283]9:23), the new testament ( [284]7:22) or covenant ( [285]8:6), the
   Christian hope ( [286]7:19), resurrection ( [287]11:35), country (
   [288]11:16), substance ( [289]10:34) and message of Christ's blood (
   [290]12:24). It is also used of the behavior these blessings should
   elicit from Christ's people (6:9).

   The verb make perfect is also a frequent one in this epistle. It is
   used both of Christ ( [291]2:10; [292]5:9; [293]7:28) and of those
   covered by His sacrifice ( [294]7:19; [295]9:9; [296]10:14;
   [297]12:23). Such perfection is given through faith: faith that
   accomplishes great feats but also faith that suffers and endures.
   Perhaps most of all it is the faith that endures. That is our author's
   chief point now as he urges the lesson on his readers.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER TWELVE

   12:1. Wherefore here translates a compound Greek word composed of three
   lesser particles, each meaning "therefore" or "wherefore." This very
   strong combination word occurs only one other time in the New Testament
   (I Thessalonians 4:8). Here the emphasis is in view of the great cloud
   of witnesses to whom our author has called attention in the last
   chapter and whose presence he now puts forward as strong inducement for
   the faithfulness of his readers.

   Cloud frequently stood for a great host in both secular Greek
   literature and in the Old Testament (Ezekiel 38:9, 16). The Greek word
   translated witnesses gives the English word "martyrs." It first meant
   one who saw or experienced something, then, one who gave a testimony or
   bore witness of his experience. Because one's testimony often led to
   his persecution or even death, the term gradually came to designate one
   whose witness cost him his life. So derives our word "martyr." The word
   carried this idea in several biblical passages although it only later
   gained this exclusive significance (Nehemiah 9:26; Acts 22:20;
   Revelation 2:13).

   Some of the witnesses of chapter eleven were martyrs in the narrower
   sense, but they all were witnesses. They had seen Him who is invisible,
   and they had seen the realities of the world of faith. They had given
   their testimony to these realities, usually in a hostile environment
   and to an unbelieving audience They had been the subject of other
   testimony, as God gave them a witness that He was pleased with their
   faith.

   The term compassed about or surrounded, as well as the clear athletic
   imagery which follows, suggests that these individuals are now
   witnesses in still another sense. "Each of them has, in his own age and
   in his own way, run his section of the great 'relay race,' and, having
   handed on the torch to his successor, has joined the multitude of
   interested spectators and skilled judges" (Robinson). Delitzsch speaks
   of "our life here" as "a contest, its theatre the universe, the seats
   of the spectators ranged through heaven!" That these witnesses are
   spectators of our race must be inferred from the context; the word
   itself does not carry that idea.

   Because of these faithful saints who encourage us by their record, and
   perhaps by their own watching, we are admonished negatively to lay
   aside every hindrance or distraction, and positively to run with
   patience or endurance the course which has been laid out for us.

   Weight is used in the literature of the time of any excess poundage,
   frequently of obesity or stoutness, which the athlete must shed before
   he runs The Christian must put off all that does not measure up to his
   calling and is not becoming to his intentions. The term also suggests
   the weights worn by an athlete in training which are then laid aside
   for the actual contest.

   Sin surrounds the believer to distract him from the goal. Like the
   flowing garment worn in the first century, it also clings to him and
   impedes his progress. Sin itself, of every sort and all kinds, must be
   renounced by the man running the race of faith This present context
   suggests the particular sin of disbelief which results in apostasy.

   It is not enough to begin the race only to fall during its course. This
   was the point of Israel's example in chapters [298]three and [299]four,
   and the thought which triggered the present discussion in [300]10:36.
   The Christian must run with patience the race set before him. The
   object is not speed but endurance. The prize is not for the first
   runner through but for every runner who finishes.

   Paul uses the imagery of the runner in several epistles (see I
   Corinthians 9:24-27; Galatians 2:2; Philippians 216; II Timothy 4:7).
   The terms "fight," "strive," and "conflict" often represent a single
   Greek word also taken from the vocabulary of the athlete or soldier.

   Similar language is used in the so-called Fourth Book Of Maccabees, a
   Jewish writing of uncertain date and authorship, which credits the
   victories of Jewish heroes to the use of proper reason. I quote the
   following passage because many readers will not have opportunity to see
   it elsewhere. Speaking of his intertestamental heroes the writer says:

     For truly it was a holy war which was fought by them. For an that
     day virtue, proving them through endurance, set before them the
     prize of victory in incorruption in everlasting life. . . . The
     tyrant was their adversary and the world and the life of man were
     the spectators. And righteousness won the victory, and gave the
     crown to her athletes. Who but wondered at the athletes of the true
     Law? (17:11-17).

   12:2. Patience for the course may be found by looking intently and
   constantly unto Jesus, who is not only a witness of faith but is its
   author or pioneer (the same word used at [301]2:10) and its finisher or
   perfecter. Barnes applies these two expressions to the race official
   who enrolls entrants and awards the final prizes, but he gives no
   support for this interpretation. More likely the thought is that Jesus
   (our author here uses His human name, perhaps to stress His unity with
   His people) is author of faith because He was the first to run faith's
   course all the way to its goal in heaven. He is finisher or perfecter
   because He leads all who follow Him to the same finish or end or goal
   (see I Peter 1:9).

   Jesus has experienced faith's trials and its reward. The joy set before
   him may refer to His delight in doing the will of God (Psalm 40:8;
   [302]Hebrews 10:5-10), but it has special reference to the promised
   position of Savior and Lord which He would be given on behalf of His
   people (see [303]2:9; [304]5:4-10; Isaiah 53:10-12). Jesus received
   God's promise in faith. He placed Himself within the Father's purpose
   in simple and wholehearted trust. He then endured all that came in the
   course of the Father's will with forward-looking faith and joy and
   hope.

   The cross was a symbol of great shame in the first century world. It
   represented a death reserved for political in surrectionists or the
   basest of criminals. Roman citizens were not only guaranteed immunity
   from crucifixion (Peter was crucified but Paul was beheaded, according
   to reliable tradition) but Cicero urged Romans not to talk about, look
   at or think on this death. Yet Christ despised or considered as
   insignificant this ignoble suffering when measured against the joy to
   be had through patient submission to the will of God.

   Nor was His faith in vain, for when this epistle was written Christ was
   already set dawn at the right hand of the throne of God. The verb tense
   here indicates not only that He had taken this seat but that He still
   occupies it! For a discussion of the use of Psalm 110 in the New
   Testament see comments at 1:13; [305]8:1 and 10:12. Christ led the way
   in the procession of faith. He has now arrived at faith's goal. He now
   guarantees the safe passage of all who follow Him in trusting
   endurance.

   12:3. Consider this Jesus, our author urges. Do not merely glance at
   Him, but literally "draw an analogy" between His situation and your
   own. He endured verbal and active contradition or opposition from
   sinners. Compare your own sufferings to His so that you do not become
   wearied and faint or fall out in your minds. The words point again to
   the race track and the runner who tires to the point of exhaustion.

   12:4. In contrast to Jesus, the readers have not yet resisted unto
   blood. Some think this expression alludes to the barehanded boxers of
   the day who fought until their hands were bleeding and bruised. Your
   striving or fight against sin has not reached this point of total
   dedication, our author would be saying. It is possible, however, to
   regard the words in the most natural sense and say the original readers
   of Hebrews had not yet faced the threat of martyrdom, though some of
   their predecessors might have (13:7). Jesus followed the way of faith
   to the cross. His followers must also be willing to die for their
   faith, if necessary.

   [306]12:5-6. In verses five through eleven our writer presents another
   figure with different imagery. You have forgotten the exhortation of
   Proverbs 3:11-12, he says, in which the believer views his
   circumstances as discipline from a father who loves his children. Much
   of the wisdom contained in Proverbs (particularly chapters 1-7) is
   addressed by the king to his son. The words which follow are taken from
   that setting and are applied to God's children of the new covenant

   Chastening in this entire context translates a more general word
   meaning discipline in all its forms. It involves the training of a son
   by the father. It is the discipline or training which makes disciples.
   Such discipline is a sure proof of the father's love (see Revelation
   3:19). For this reason its recipients ought not to despise or belittle
   its value and purpose. God first disciplines, then receives, His child
   who has been so molded.

   12:7. If is only one letter different in the original language from a
   preposition meaning "for" or "unto," and the better manuscripts and
   later versions here have the latter. It is for the very kind of
   discipline or chastening described just now that ye presently endure,
   the author points out. God is simply treating you as sons, and sons are
   disciplined by their fathers. Your suffering is neither without God's
   knowledge or His purpose. The verb may also be translated as an
   imperative ("endure for the purpose of discipline"), but it is probably
   a simple indicative stating what is the case.

   12:8. If you were without any chastisement or discipline there would be
   cause for alarm, for it is the illegitimate son who is unrestrained,
   untrained, unpunished and sometimes unknown by his father. The son who
   will bear the father's name with pride in the next generation must bear
   up under the father's rod now if he is to be fitted for the task. Again
   our author joins warning to reassurance. "But you are all partakers of
   this discipline and may therefore know you are beloved children" (see
   [307]6:9; [308]10:39).

   12:9. Ordinary human experience demonstrates these truths. We have all
   had human, fleshly fathers. They corrected us. We later understood and
   appreciated that discipline -- and even then we gave them reverence or
   respect. How much rather should we be in subjection to our spiritual
   father, whose discipline is part of His grand design to lead us to
   abiding and true life in communion with Him!

   "Fathers of our flesh" is a Hebraic manner of saying "our fleshly
   fathers." "Father of spirits" is in simple contrast to the other
   expression, and ought not to be strained to fit either side of the
   metaphysical argument concerning the origin of individual spirits.
   Milligan sees a special contrast.

     Our earthly fathers are like ourselves, carnal , frail, sinful
     mortals . . . liable to err in their discipline. . . . God . . . has
     none of the weaknesses and infirmities of the flesh . . . [and] can
     not like our earthly fathers err in His chastisements.

   That contrast is clearly made in the next verse.

   12:10. During the few days of our childhood, our earthly fathers
   chastened or trained us after their own pleasure. Sometimes they might
   have acted hastily or in anger; they always acted under human
   limitations of knowledge and design. Our heavenly Father, on the other
   hand, knows exactly what is needful for our profit as He prepares us to
   be partakers or sharers of his holiness. This holiness involves not
   only the judicial pronouncement of a new state because of union with
   Christ (10:10, [309]14, [310]29), but also a daily life of godly
   thinking and behavior (see [311]verse 14).

   12:11. One writer remarked of this verse that "the only proper
   commentary is our own personal experience." All discipline, however
   instructive, is painful at the time it is administered, but later its
   benefits are seen in those who appropriate the intended training. The
   peaceable fruit of such training is righteousness. Peace and
   righteousness are related in both the Old (Isaiah 32:17) and the New
   Testaments (James 3:18). Here the fruit is peaceable in contrast to the
   discipline which produced it.

   12:12. In this verse and the next our author quotes from Isaiah 35:3
   and the Greek version of Proverbs 4:26. He changes imagery to that of a
   group of wayfarers on a journey, and builds on this figure through
   verse 17.

   Lift up the weary travellers' hands which hang down slack and loose
   from exhaustion; lend strength to the feeble knees which have lost
   their power to hold up and have become as paralyzed. These were
   appropriate exhortations as addressed to Jews who would return to their
   homeland from faraway Persia. (The journey theme is also seen in Isaiah
   40:3-4, 29-31; 43:2, 5-7, 19-21; 48:20-21; 49:8-13; 52:10-11;
   58:11-12). The same exhortations are appropriately given to
   faith-pilgrims of the new covenant who have become weary in well doing
   and are about to faint with fatigue. It should also be noticed that
   this encouragement is given to believers as a company, and that their
   pilgrimage involves mutual concern and careful attention to one another
   (see [312]comments at 3:12-13; [313]9:17; 10:24).

   12:13. As believers travel together toward the heavenly city, they are
   to make straight paths so that the feet of those who are lame will not
   be turned out of the way. The latter phrase has been translated two
   ways The reading of the King James Version agrees with the thought of
   the Greek text of Proverbs 4:26-27, which urges making straight paths,
   then says not to turn to the right hand or to the left. Many other
   versions translate our author equally well with a slightly different
   thought as "lest the lame limb be dislocated altogether," or words to
   that effect. This translation more obviously contrasts with the next
   statement of this verse, but let it rather be healed.

   Either phrasing is possible from the Greek and both thoughts are
   appropriate. Let the Christian pilgrim remove from the path anything
   that would impede the progress of his weak brethren or cause them to
   stumble. Let nothing be left before them which would cause one to miss
   the trail or would trip a lame traveller and put his limbs completely
   out of joint. Rather let each sojourner hear with his fellows, lend
   them strength when needed, help with the burdens of the weak, encourage
   the faint-hearted and clear the path for those who are tired and weak.

   The verb form of the word here translated lame is used in I Kings 18:21
   (Greek translation) of those Israelites who were "halting between two
   opinions" and could not decide whether to serve Jehovah or Baal. This
   passage suggests at least one form of lameness which afflicted the weak
   Hebrew saints who first received this epistle. They were weak in the
   faith. They were wobbling between allegiance to Jesus Christ and to
   their former Jewish religion The term should not be limited to this
   application though it seems to include it.

   12:14. In their journey together it is essential that the travellers
   follow or actively seek peace with all their companions. The phrase is
   from Psalm 34:14. Peter quotes it also in his letter which, interesting
   enough, is addressed "to those who reside as aliens" (I Peter 3:11;
   1:1, New American Standard Bible).

   Such scriptural injunctions to peace or love need not be followed by
   immediate explanations which practically annul the biblical point. It
   is a pitiable generation in which the church is so strife-infested that
   peace and love are held as unholy words in some quarters. Many church
   quarrels have been blamed on error or attributed to truth which
   actually resulted from carnal and fleshly minds. The fault has often
   been with some who refused to put others ahead of self, to bear
   patiently with the weak, to seek peace at the expense of personal pride
   or opinions. In short, through the sinful attitudes and conduct of some
   who refused to obey the clear teaching of the Word of God. It is one
   thing to stand for clear truth against clear error. It is quite another
   to call all one's own thoughts and inferences "truth," then immediately
   draw the circle of peace closely about those personal conclusions.

   Those following Jesus in the highway of faith must seek holiness as
   well as peace, for without holiness no man shall see the Lord. Only the
   pure in heart will see God (Matthew 5:8). Holiness has always been
   required of God's people, and the command has always been grounded in
   the character of God who gave it (Leviticus 11:45; I Peter 1:15-16). If
   peace makes association possible with [brethren, holiness makes it
   possible with God.

   12:15. Looking diligently translates a Greek word from which comes our
   "overseer" or "bishop." It is "as if they were travelling together on
   some long journey, in a large company, and he says, 'Take heed that no
   man be left behind' I do not seek this only, that ye may arrive
   yourselves, but also that ye should look diligently after the others"
   (Chrysostom). It is the duty of the experienced (elder) Christian
   shepherds (pastors) to look carefully to the spiritual needs of their
   flock as overseers (bishops), and this responsibility is laid directly
   upon them by the Holy Spirit. As the same time, every pilgrim of faith
   has a similar duty to his fellow-wayfarers, and that is the point of
   this verse.

   A congregation of saints will never enjoy the blessings of brotherhood
   and Christian love that God provides and intends so long as it
   conceives of itself primarily in institutional or external terms. The
   Christian religion is a religion of togetherness: saints together
   constitute the family of God in each place. They are to love as
   brethren. It is so difficult for men today to pass beyond the carnal
   view of the church, as a sort of religious club or organization' to its
   true nature as revealed in the Bible. This view must be seen if saints
   are ever to comprehend the real beauty of their actual state together
   in Christ.

   Look diligently so that no one fail or come short of (see also 4:1) the
   grace of God that is given freely in Christ and enjoyed by faith. The
   figure here is that of the traveller who lags behind and never reaches
   the end of the journey. It is a sin of too many churches that saints
   may wander in one day and out the next with very little notice given
   either to their presence or absence. God's words concerning His Old
   Testament church often describe His New Testament people as well: "My
   sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill;
   yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none
   did search or seek after them" (Ezekiel 34:6).

   Still using the pilgrimage motif, our author warns against any root of
   bitterness, or poisonous root, which might be cut as for food and
   result in widespread contamination of the people. The term comes from
   Deuteronomy 29:18, where Moses uses it figuratively to warn Israel
   against turning from God to idols. Our author has already spoken
   against an evil heart of unbelief which leads one from the living God
   (3:12). Here he repeats the warning in figurative terms.

   12:16. Watch diligently for any fornicator, not in the limited usage of
   the word alone, but as signifying any moral uncleanness. Some interpret
   this warning as against spiritual adultery, and equate it with turning
   from God. Our writer warns against sexual impurity, however, in
   [314]13:4, and it is preferable to take the warning literally here.

   The profane person is one who has no regard for what is holy. He is
   unable -- or worse, unwilling -- to distinguish between what is common
   and what is holy. Such an attitude frequently leads to immorality as
   well as other sins.

   Esau is given as an example of a profane man. Jewish tradition made him
   a fornicator as well. For one morsel of meat or food he sold his
   birthright (Genesis 25:29-34). "The rights of primogeniture were among
   the most noble, honorable, and spiritual in the ancient world"
   (Barnes). Esau not only "despised," his double portion of the
   inheritance, he scoffed at his role in the patriarchal line through
   which God's covenant promises and election purposes were to be
   fulfilled. Behind many particular sins lies a basic inability to
   distinguish between what hat is valuable and what is of little
   importance. Christians who fail to appreciate their position in the
   Lord Jesus Christ are often prone to grievous sins. The best
   preventative against sin is a constant awareness of who and what one is
   called and called to be in the Son of God, and a regular meditation on
   one's position as he stands identified with the blameless Son before
   the Father.

   12:17. The consequences of profanity involve not only the present loss
   of blessing but also the future impossibility of renewal. The disregard
   for what is holy, which leads to sin in the first place, also prevents
   true repentance -- even when the profane man sees his final end and is
   overcome with remorse. Esau also illustrates this fact (see
   [315]comments at 10:26-29).

   Ye know from the Old Testament story how that afterward when Esau
   desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected (Genesis 27:30-40).
   Three phrases in this verse are subject to more than one
   interpretation. Was Esau rejected by Isaac, by God, or by both? Did
   Esau find no place of repentance in himself or in his father or in
   both? Did he seek carefully with tears the blessing, or a place for
   repentance?

   Esau's rejection may safely be said to have been by both God and lsaac,
   since the patriarchal blessing was ultimately given by God through the
   father (see [316]comment at 11:20) When Isaac affirmed the certainty of
   Jacob's blessing, he was pointing out its divine origin (Genesis
   27:33).

   Esau found no place for repentance because there was no change of his
   father's mind regarding the blessing already given. Delitzsch sees Esau
   as "a type of the hopelessly apostate" and argues that he did not
   experience true repentance himself at all, but simply changed his mind
   about the inheritance and blessing when he realized the point to which
   his careless attitude had led. Repentance here has its most basic
   meaning of a change of mind, but it involves a change of mind that
   seeks to change the effects of the previous disposition. Esau could not
   find such a change of mind in his father Isaac, nor was he able to
   change the effects of his own former attitude (whether or not he had
   the same attitude still).

   Esau sought the blessing with tears (Genesis 27:38), but this involved
   tears for his father's change of mind. Both alternatives ought here to
   be included.

   12:18. Again the imagery changes, this time to terms based on the
   giving of the Law at Sinai. Ye who follow Jesus, the enthroned Son at
   the Father's right hand, are not come to a mountain such as Sinai.
   There ancient Israel had gathered as God's elect nation, to receive the
   details and requiremeets of the covenant which graciously bound them to
   Him. According to the accounts of Exodus (19:16, 18) and Deuteronomy
   (4:11; 5:23; 9:15), the top of Sinai burned with fire. The lower parts
   of the mountain were hidden by the blackness and darkness of the storm
   clouds which covered them. Out of the clouds came loud noises and
   bursts of fierce storm and tempest.

   12:19. When the people heard a sound as of a trumpet (Exodus 19:16-19)
   and the voice of words from God (Deuteronomy 5:22), they entreated that
   the word should not be spoken to them any more directly, but rather
   through the mediation of Moses (Exodus 20:18-19; Deuteronomy 5:23-27).

   12:20. The assembly of Israel was awed and terror-stricken by the
   thought of God's command (Exodus 19: 12-13) that if so much as a beast
   touch the mountain, it shall be stoned. The phrase thrust through with
   a dart is not in the better manuscripts or in most later versions. The
   Old Testament command has the animal stoned (apparently if it wanders
   off the mountain within distance of the people) or shot (with an arrow,
   if it remains on the mountain out of the people's reach).

   12:21. Even Moses was so overcome by the terrible or terror-inspiring
   sight as to remark, I exceedingly fear and quake. This statement is not
   reported in the Old Testament, though it is in keeping with what is
   stated there. Exodus 19:19 says that when the trumpet sound became
   louder and louder "Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice." What
   Moses said is not told. The Greek text of Exodus 19:18 says that all
   the people were driven out of their senses for fear, and Moses would
   certainly be included in that statement. Whether our author depends on
   that text or some other source for his information we do not know. What
   he writes, however, is Scripture, and as such has the absolute approval
   and endorsement of the Holy Spirit.

   [317]12:22. As fearful and terrifying as that scene was, the
   new-covenant saint has approached Clod under circumstances and in
   company far more demanding of a faithful response.

   The word translated ye are come (here and at verse 18) in its noun form
   gives the English word "proselyte," suggestive perhaps of the move of
   the Hebrews from Judaism to Christ. All Christians, however, have come
   at conversion, and remain throughout life, in the presence of the
   figures and elements which follow.

   Mount Zion is literally Zion-mountain, in contrast to Sinai-mountain.
   Zion was first a Jebusite stronghold in the Old Testament, but David
   captured it with his private army and made it his capital of united
   Israel (II Samuel 5:6-9). Since it had not formerly been a part of
   Judah or Israel, Zion was politically independent, much as Washington,
   D.C. in the United States. David brought the Ark of the Covenant to
   Zion in the next chapter. God's approval is seen in the dynastic and
   messianic promises given to David through the prophet Nathan (II Samuel
   7; see I Kings 14:21; Psalm 78:68).

   Solomon's Temple was actually on Mount Moriah, but the term Zion came
   to include that as well. In the Psalms, Zion is frequently celebrated
   as the holy city of God's choosing and the meeting place of His people
   Israel (see 120-134, especially 132-134).

   The reference here is not to physical Zion, but to its heavenly
   prototype, which is part of the city of the living God. Our author has
   spoken already of this city ( [318]11:10, [319]14-16). He mentions it
   again in [320]13:14. We have not come to an earthly city, but to the
   heavenly Jerusalem where God dwells in glory.

   A glorified Jerusalem was the subject of much Jewish speculation
   (between the testaments, including material from the Dead Sea Scrolls)
   and of some revelation (the very difficult chapters 40-48 of Ezekiel).
   The author of Hebrews adds to inspired knowledge on the topic, as do
   Paul and John (see [321]references and comments at 11:10). That is not
   to say that all these biblical passages apply to the same things in
   every detail; each must be studied in its awn context for the specific
   meaning. This verse clearly refers to the place where God dwells, to
   which Christ has opened the way by passing through the veil in His
   flesh, and to which Christians have come in their new-covenant faith in
   Him.

   Included in this same awe-inspiring scene are an innumerable company,
   literally tens of thousands or myriads, of angels (see Psalm 68:17;
   Daniel 7:10; Revelation 5:11). These angels are sent forth by God for
   the service of His saints on earth ([322]1:14), but in all their
   activities they exist for the praise of God.

   [323]12:23. The general assembly translates a word which gives the
   English "panegyric." This Greek term is used in Greek literature of a
   public festival or celebration attended by all the people. Such
   celebrations usually included the praise of great men. There is some
   controversy as to whether the festive assembly here includes only the
   angels or also those mentioned next.

   Church should be interpreted in its literal sense here of an assembly.
   It is composed of the firstborn ones (plural in the original) who are
   written or enrolled as citizens in the city of God in heaven. The
   phrase has been taken as of the angels or of first-generation
   Christians, but it seems best to think of the church of the firstborn
   ones as being the church of Christ of all times and all places on
   earth. As firstborn ones, Christians must heed the warning against
   profaneness already given concerning Esau, another firstborn (verses
   [324]16-17).

   God, the Judge of all, is present, and He will acquit or condemn each
   man. Here is a word of comfort for a suffering church, for God's
   judgments will involve a vindication of its cause (see [325]comments at
   10:30-31). That the presence of God speaks of comfort and not fear for
   His people is seen in the phrase that follows.

   The spirits of just men made perfect refers to those saints who lived
   and died before Christ but who walked according to faith during their
   lives. They are declared just because the Judge has viewed their faith
   and pronounced them so on the basis of Christ's atonement (9:15). They
   are now made perfect or complete because they have arrived at the state
   of blessed rest with the Lord which was publicly announced with the
   beginning of the gospel proclamation. And the gospel speaks essentially
   of the life, death and resurrection of the eternal Son who partook of
   flesh and blood, but now sits as eternal Priest-King at the right hand
   of God. Just as the ancient saints could not be made perfect without
   their new-covenant counterparts (11:40), so we must live in view of
   them (see comments at 12:1).

   12:24. Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant is present (see
   [326]8:6). Jesus is His saving name and associates Him with His earthly
   brethren (Matthew 1:21; [327]Hebrews 2:9-18). New here means "recent,"
   and refers to the nearness in time between these first readers and the
   covenant Jesus had inaugurated shortly before. The presence of Jesus
   speaks assurance, for He is surety of the new covenant promises (see
   [328]comments at 7:22, [329]25; also [330]Appendix IV on Christ's
   Sacrifice and the Christian).

   The blood of sprinkling is the blood of Christ. Our writer has already
   spoken of sprinkled blood in terms of purification ( [331]9:13-14;
   [332]10:22), of covenant-ratification ( [333]9:19), and of Passover (
   [334]11:28). Each figure bespeaks blessings for those bound to the Son
   who has now shed His blood on their behalf.

   Christ's blood speaks better or more powerfully than the blood
   associated with Abel, whether one thinks of Abel's own blood shed by
   Cain or the sacrificial blood he shed by faith. Christ's blood also
   speaks of better things than either blood, for Abel's sacrifice spoke
   of atonement hoped-for, and his own blood called for vengeance.
   Christ's blood, however, assures all martyrs of faith that their blood
   was not shed in vain, and it speaks of an atonement which Christ has
   already accomplished and the Father has already accepted.

   The two covenants are contrasted in this manner. The first began at
   fearful Mount Sinai, a mountain characterized by warnings and threats.
   The second began with glorious Mount Zion, populated by servant angels
   and saved men praising a holy God and His priestly Son. The first
   description closed with a voice of words which sent the people
   scurrying and left even Moses trembling. The second description closed
   with a Mediator's blood which speaks with eloquence and power of an
   accomplished atonement and the reward of faithfulness.

   The exhortation to steadfastness in the midst of affliction is now
   coming to an end. Our author has demonstrated himself in this chapter
   to be a user as well as an author of Scripture. His exhortation here is
   built around four figures. First is the spiritual athlete, striving for
   the prize. He is encouraged by the former contestants who now watch but
   especially by Jesus who is both author and finisher of faith. Second is
   the child, who meekly learns from the purposeful discipline of his
   loving father. Third is the company of pilgrims, who watch for one
   another as they move toward their destination. Fourth is the contrast
   between the Old Testament and New Testament churches, as gathered
   respectively before their covenant God.

   The first illustration called on chapter eleven, which itself drew from
   the entire Old Testament and intertestamental periods. The second
   illustration came from Proverbs representing the Writings portion of
   the Hebrew Old Testament. The third was based on Isaiah, though it drew
   from other parts of Scripture as well. It stood for the Prophets. The
   fourth came from Exodus and Deuteronomy, standing for the books of
   Moses, the Torah.

   In the final five verses of the chapter, our author looks again to the
   prophetic portion of his Scriptures, there finding words for his
   closing appeal.

   12:25. See or take heed that you do not refuse God who is speaking. The
   thought is directly related to the epistle's opening affirmation that
   God has spoken ( [335]1:1-2). How He has spoken and what He has said
   have been our author's themes throughout. Now He urges care lest the
   readers fail to respond to the final message in the Son.

   They who refused him that spake on earth refers to Israel. They heard
   God's voice from the smoking mountain ( [336]verses 18-21) but failed
   to heed it and were destroyed ( [337]3:8-4:11). If here expresses
   certainty, not indefiniteness; "since" would be a proper translation.
   Since their judgment was so sure, though pertaining to an earth-given
   revelation, punishment is much more certain for those who turn away
   from God now that He has spoken from heaven. See the opening comments
   on chapter two for a discussion of this type of argument and other
   references where it is used.

   12:26. When God spoke from Sinai, His voice shook the earth (Exodus
   19:18; Psalm 18:7; 68:8; 114:4). But we now have His promise that yet
   once more He will shake not the earth only, but also heaven. The
   promise is found in Haggai 2:6, and was given by Haggai the prophet to
   Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest at the dedication of
   the rebuilt Temple in 516 B.C. Our author applies the words to the
   final Day of the Lord (see [338]comments at 10:25).

   12:27. The words yet once more, our author explains, denote the
   removing of those things that are shaken. For if God will shake the
   earth once more, and apparently only once more, that shaking must come
   at the final shaking of the earth which will also be its removing. This
   is to be expected, he adds, for these are things that are made, and
   they are by nature temporary (see [339]1:10-12). Further, it is
   necessary that those things be shaken and removed, so that those things
   of the invisible and eternal order which cannot be shaken may remain.
   It might not be straining the point to say that the trembling of Sinai
   was an indication that the order it represented would one day pass
   away, just as the passing glory of Moses' face on that occasion is said
   to indicate the same thing (II Corinthians 3:7-14).

   12:28. Our covenant is based on a word from heaven, however, and is an
   administration of the eternal and heavenly realities ( [340]8:1, 2,
   [341]5; 9:1, [342]11, [343]24). We have, in fact, received a kingdom
   which cannot he moved or shaken or ever destroyed. It is the
   everlasting kingdom of prophecy (Daniel 7:27). We ought, therefore, to
   have grace (a regular Greek expression for giving thanks), through
   which we may serve God acceptably with reverence or pious respect and
   godly fear.

   12:29. Such reverence and respectful fear is absolutely required in
   view of the fact that our God is a consuming fire. The phrase comes
   from Deuteronomy 4:24 (see that context), but the thought is found in
   numerous passages (see a partial listing in [344]comments on 10:27.

   It is an aspect of the character of God as revealed in the Bible that
   plays little part in much present-day thinking about Him; but if we are
   to be completely "honest to God," we dare not ignore it. Reverence and
   awe before His holiness are not incompatible with grateful trust and
   love in response to His mercy (Bruce).

   A study of the Bible reveals that those men in each age who were
   closest to God and enjoyed the most intimate fellowship with Him have
   been also the most awed by His holiness. One thinks immediately of
   Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Paul or the Apostle John. The greatest example
   is our Lord, who on occasion used the intimate term "Abba," but who
   more frequently is recorded as addressing God as "Holy Father" or
   "Righteous Father." Boldness is not audacity. "God is love" must always
   be joined to "our God is a consuming fire," for holy love demands a
   fire of judgment, and that fire is holy which consumes the adversaries
   of God and His people.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER THIRTEEN

   Our author has developed his case in twelve chapters. He has broken
   into his discussion periodically with urgent exhortations or earnest
   warnings. Now he has come to the end of his literary task, and he
   closes with specific words of practical import. Throughout the epistle
   he has spoken of God's new-covenant people who have come into a
   relationship with Him based on the saving work of the Son. The
   admonitions of chapter thirteen are addressed to Christians as
   faith-pilgrims. Because they share the benefits of Christ's work, they
   must encourage and tolerate and forgive each other.

   Some critics have argued that this chapter was not an original part of
   Hebrews. They say it has no relation to the rest of the epistle, and
   that it was added by a later scribe or editor. Filson has clearly
   demonstrated the unity between this chapter and the previous twelve
   (see his book listed in the bibliography). In fact, he affirms that it
   is this final chapter which provides a key to the rest of the book. One
   does not have to agree with all Filson's conclusions to appreciate his
   basic point. It is enough here to say that the unity of Hebrews has
   been demonstrated convincingly, even from the standpoint of modern
   critical scholarship.

   13:1. Brotherly love properly exists between those sharing a common
   father (see [345]2:11). It is more than sentiment or affection; it
   involves es the practical demonstration of what is in the heart and
   mind. The Hebrew Christians had manifested brotherly love soon after
   their conversion ( [346]10:32-34) and throughout their Christian lives
   ( [347]6:10). Our author does not tell them to begin its practice,
   therefore, but to let it continue.

   13:2. Nor are they to forget hospitality. The Greek word translated
   hospitality literally means a love of strangers or travellers, and the
   King James Version tries to give this sense in its entertain strangers.
   Inns were available to travelers of the first century, but they were
   notoriously ill-kept, usually expensive, frequently bawdy and sometimes
   dangerous.

   For these reasons, Jews and Christians normally cared for their own
   brethren who might be traveling or visiting in a strange city. Paul
   mentions this practice several times in his epistles John speaks of the
   custom and corrects two abuses: that of giving fraternal hospitality
   and blessing to antichrists who denied the Christian gospel (II John
   6-11), and that of failing to extend care to worthy brethren who needed
   it (III John 5-10). Peter also urges hospitality (I Peter 4:9), which
   for Christians was grounded in the words of Christ Himself (Matthew
   25:35-36). In a book known as the Didache, an unknown Christian who
   lived shortly after the time of the apostles gave detailed instructions
   concerning the reception and treatment of traveling preachers and
   teachers. Later a Roman writer named Lucian called Christians gullible,
   saying that any tramp could find food and housing if he could convince
   them of his religion.

   Our author notes that some in the past have entertained angels without
   knowing it, referring no doubt to Abraham (Genesis 18) and Lot (Genesis
   19), and perhaps others. Because of what our author has already stated
   in 1:14 we must agree with Delitzsch that "any man whom we entertain
   without knowing any details as to him. may be even for us a very angel
   of God." Not that this is the general rule, but hospitality does
   frequently return unexpected blessings, and by it Christ is served.

   13:3. The original readers knew what it meant to remember them in bonds
   ( [348]10:34), as bound with them, and them which suffer adversity or
   literally "have it bad," as being also in the body. It is inviting to
   take the phrases as bound with them and as being in the body in the
   sense of the bond of love (Colossians 3:14) and the body of Christ (I
   Corinthians 12). Unless one assumes that Paul wrote Hebrews, however,
   he may not be sure that meaning is intended here. Even so, the point of
   the exhortation is about the same. Christians are to be so captivated
   by brotherly love that when one is bound the others sympathize as being
   themselves bound. When some are in bad circumstances the rest are
   concerned to help, being subject also to the ailments of mortality.

   13:4. The original text has no verb here and the statement may be
   translated either as an indicative (as in the King James Version) or,
   perhaps better in this context, as an imperative. Let marriage be
   respected and regarded as honorable. Let it be free from the sanctions
   and regulations of asceticism on the one hand, and the profligate and
   licentious behavior of libertinism on the other. In all may be
   interpreted as among all people or in all things. The Greek expression
   frequently means simply "altogether'' or "completely."

   Let the marriage bed and the relationship it stands for be undefiled,
   for God (this word is emphatic in the original) will judge the impure
   (uncleanness, fornication and prostitute are all of the same
   word-family with this in the Greek) and adulterers. When Scripture
   makes a distinction between fornication and adultery the former refers
   to sexual impurity in general and in terms of moral uncleanness, while
   the latter refers to extramarital sexual relations by a husband or wife
   and in terms of the marriage covenant and relationship. A proper
   respect for the institution and relationship of marriage is the best
   prevention against God's judgment for fornication or adultery.

   13:5. Again the verb must be supplied to urge that the conversation or
   turn of mind and life be without covetousness. Again there is a verbal
   link with what has gone before. Covetousness is literally a love of
   silver. Our author has urged love of brethren and love of strangers,
   but now he cautions against the love of money. Since this sin comes
   from the mind the solution must begin there as well.

   Be content with such things as ye have. Milligan accurately states the
   teaching of Scripture in saying: "Be diligent in business; do all that
   you can lawfully and consistently to improve your own condition and to
   promote the happiness of others; and then with calmness and resignation
   leave all the consequences to God."

   The basis of such trustful contentment is the word of God in such
   passages as Genesis 28:15; Deuteronomy 31:6, 8 Joshua 1:5; I Chronicles
   28:20; Isaiah 41:17; Matthew 6:25-30 and many others, that I will never
   leave thee nor forsake thee. This promise is made very emphatic in the
   original Greek by the succession of three negatives.

   13:6. Because God has given His word (and the phrase quoted here seems
   to have been common in Jewish speech, to judge from its use by the
   non-biblical writer Philo), the believer is to respond with a word of
   his own. We may boldly say in the words of Psalm 118:6, which were also
   regularly quoted during the great feasts of the Jews, the Lord is my
   helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. Both the Hebrew
   and the Greek may also be translated: "The Lord is my helper and I will
   not fear. What shall man do unto me?" In either case, the thought is
   the same. Because God speaks in promise the possessor of faith should
   speak in trust and confidence.

   13:7. As examples of faith, the readers should remember their former
   leaders who used to speak the word of God unto them. Their conversation
   or way of life (not the same word used in verse five) led them to a
   praiseworthy end, which the readers are to be considering by thorough
   and continuing contemplation. Whether this refers to death by martyrdom
   or simply a life ending in faith we can not tell. The point is that the
   faith of these leaders was not in vain. Both the author and his readers
   had heard the gospel from the apostles ( [349]2:3-4). Since we do not
   know the author, the readers, or even their location, we can not know
   the specific identity of these who had the rule or leadership in
   earlier days.

   13:8. The first leaders had died, but their faithfulness had been
   consistent The object of their faith also remains the same. Jesus
   Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever. Our author spoke of
   the eternal "sameness" of Christ in 1:12, quoting from Psalm 102:27.
   Christ is the greatest example of faithfulness and steadfastness: the
   same yesterday and today and for ever. He is the same subject of
   preaching yesterday, today and for ever. He is the same object of
   faith: yesterday, today and for ever.

   Yesterday seems to refer to our author's immediate past. That was the
   time when Jesus became lower than the angels, became partaker of flesh
   and blood, received a body in which to do the will of God, offered
   Himself as a sinless sacrifice and was subsequently raised from the
   dead and taken up into glory. Today would refer to our author's
   present. For ever would refer to his future.

   The atoning work of Christ took place in time and in human history, but
   that work has now reached its goal. God's salvation-purpose unfolded
   gradually. With the events involving Christ, which culminated in His
   position at God's right hand, the earthly work of atonement has reached
   perfection. No opportunity remains for possible failure, so far as
   Christ is concerned. He was tempted in all points during His "once for
   all" ministry, but that took place in the beginning of these last days
   and will never be repeated. The constant believer in any age may know
   that his salvation is secured in the person of the Son -- the Son at
   God's right hand in heaven -- Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and
   today and for ever.

   13:9. If the readers will hold fast to the non-changing Christ (verse
   eight), imitating the faith of their leaders who also trusted in Him
   (verse seven), they will not be carried about as in a flood with
   various doctrines or teachings. These teachings are not part of the old
   familiar gospel or the teachings which had come from the apostles and
   prophets. Instead they are strange, alien and foreign. Specifically,
   the author warns against teachings about meats or foods, which have not
   profited those occupied with them, and which draw attention from grace
   by which the heart is established and strengthened.

   At least five explanations have been offered of these teachings about
   meats. (1) Some think of a Jewish dispute over kosher food, over clean
   and unclean meats, as apparently is the case in [350]9:10. (2) Others
   think of meats offered to pagan gentile idols, as in I Corinthians 8.
   (3) Some suppose he refers to ascetic regulations of a gentile
   philosophy, as in Colossians. (4) Still others think of sacrificial
   meats of the Old Testament system, of which some were eaten by the
   priests and/or the people (5) And some have suggested a kind of Jewish
   fellowship meal, as described, for instance, by Josephus.

   The entire context of Hebrews seems to narrow the choice to a Jewish
   answer. The fellowship meal is not attested in Scripture and might not
   have been a widespread custom at all. Disputes over clean and unclean
   foods would fit the general context but not these specific verses. The
   verses following seem to indicate sacrificial meats which were eaten by
   worshippers and/or the priest who offered them. If such sacrificial
   meats are intended, the point is that the Christian's sacrifice results
   in the distribution of grace which strengthens his heart, not in meat
   which strengthens his body.

   13:10. The pagans frequently called Christians atheists because they
   had no visible gods. It is likely that the Jews pointed to the absence
   of visible sacrifices and cultic priests in their attacks on
   Christians. Our author has already affirmed that Christians have a high
   priest, though He is in heaven (8:1). Here he says we have an altar as
   well, and of its benefits those Jewish priests who used to serve the
   Mosaic tabernacle do not have a right to partake or eat. An Old
   Testament reason is given for this in the next verse.

   Some Catholic writers apply this reference to the Mass, but against
   such a view stands the once-for-all nature of Christ's sacrifice in
   Hebrews, as well as the specific point of the next vers. Various other
   authors have explained the altar as being the cross, or a heavenly
   altar, or the death of Christ. It may be best not to seek a specific
   application, leaving our author's single point to stand alone.
   Christians do have an altar and, by metonymy, a sacrifice for their
   sins On that, also see Appendices II and III.

   13:11. Under the Old Testament system, when blood of sacrificial
   animals was brought into the most holy place by the high priest as an
   offering for sin, the bodies of those beasts were burned outside the
   camp. This was true in general (Leviticus 6:30), and of the Day of
   Atonement sin-offerings in particular (Leviticus 16:27). Because the
   offering of Christ fulfills the sin-offering of the Day of Atonement,
   and because it is the only sin-offering God now accepts, our altar is
   one of which no Old Testament priest could partake even according to
   his own Law,

   13:12. In keeping with this figure, Jesus also suffered outside the
   gate of Jerusalem and therefore outside the camp of Israel, so that he
   might sanctify the people with his own blood. He not only was treated
   shamefully (12:2), but He was in the literal sense an outcast.

   13:13. The believer in Christ is to be willing therefore to go forth
   unto him outside the camp and fellowship of Israel. If this means
   bearing a reproach, the reproach is his (see [351]11:26). To be with
   Jesus the believer must leave the camp and go outside the gate, for
   that is where He went. The reproach is overshadowed, however, by the
   fact that Jesus' death not only was that of a sin-offering, but was the
   only sin offering God will ever again accept.

   13:14. The loss of fellowship in the city of the Jews is further
   softened by the fact that Christ's people are faith-pilgrims who seek
   another city which is yet to come, though they have already come to it
   by faith (see [352]comments at 12:22-24). On the other hand, the city
   which is here on earth (Jerusalem) is no continuing city at all, and
   either had been or shortly would be destroyed when our author wrote
   this epistle.

   13:15. By Christ, the high priest and mediator, Christians are urged to
   offer their sacrifice to God continually (see [353]7:25). This is not a
   sin-offering. Only Christ offers that, and He offered one sacrifice one
   time for all men of all time. The believer offers a sacrifice of
   praise, the same term used in the Greek Old Testament for the
   peace-offering of thanksgiving (Leviticus 7:12-25). The fruit of lips
   giving thanks to his name did not originate with the new covenant
   (Psalm 50:12-15, 23; 141:2; Hosea 14:2). Such praise does belong to it,
   however, and fulfills the types of thank-offerings under the old
   covenant.

   13:16. God is also well pleased with the spiritual sacrifices offered
   by His people when they do not forget to do good, and to communicate or
   to share with those in need (Amos 5 21-24; Micah 6:6-12). Communicate
   translates the verb of the "fellowship" family.

   13:17. The practical instructions continue, this time with regard to
   Christian leaders or them that have the rule. The community of faith is
   to obey them because of persuasion and to submit to their guidance. The
   leaders, on the other hand, have a charge to watch for the souls of
   those in the community, for whom they must give account. If Christians
   do submit and obey as the rulers watch and lead, the report may be with
   joy and not with grief, which would be unprofitable for those of whom a
   bad account was given.

   Dods relates that which is unprofitable to the watch for your souls
   rather than the give account, and suggests that believers are to obey
   and submit so that the watching by the leaders will be a joyful task. A
   failure to cooperate will not only cause grief to those watching, but
   will make their work unprofitable for those for whose sake it is done.

   The figure of a watchman comes from the Old Testament, particularly
   from Ezekiel (3:17-21; 33:1-9). Here it is joined to the pastoral task
   of the spiritual shepherd. While the leaders in this chapter are given
   no technical or descriptive name, several parallels with I Peter 5:1-5
   suggest those there called Elders. Even there, though, the term is
   apparently used in both a general (verse five) and a specific (verse
   one) way.

   13:18. Pray for us, the author urges, for we trust (or perhaps, are
   persuaded) that we have a good conscience and are willing or wishing to
   live honestly in all things. Some think that the author had been
   criticized or suspected of evil doing by certain of his readers.
   Whether that is the case or not we can not tell. He simply states a
   request and makes a statement of good conscience. Nor do we know whom
   the author includes in his we.

   13:19. The rather is better translated "abundantly" or "exceedingly,''
   and may modify either beseech or to do or both. He strongly requests
   their earnest prayers, that he may be restored or reunited to them the
   sooner. It is an assumption to say that the author was in prison at
   this time; he could have been on a preaching tour or some other
   mission. All the text proves is that he was not presently with his
   readers but hoped to be shortly, and that he asked for their prayers to
   that end.

   13:20. This verse and the next give the author's benediction for his
   readers and touch on the major points of his teaching throughout the
   epistle. He calls on the God of peace, a designation comforting for
   worshippers who faced persecution or even instructive discipline. As is
   usual in Scripture, God is described in terms of His mighty acts. He
   brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus. This is the only explicit
   reference in Hebrews to the resurrection of Christ, though that has
   been presupposed throughout the discussion, and was necessary if the
   sacrificial victim were to become a living high priest.

   Christ is described as that great Shepherd of the sheep. Not only do
   the church leaders watch for souls under His charge (on the analogy of
   I Peter five) but, as the great Shepherd, Christ has laid down His life
   for the sheep (see John ten). The blood of the everlasting covenant is
   related to the resurrection, as the evident sign and seal of its
   merits, and to the great Shepherd who proved His right to the title by
   shedding His blood.

   Of Moses and Israel it was said that God "brought them up out of the
   sea with the shepherd of His flock" (Isaiah 63:11, see Psalm 77:20). As
   Christ is counted worthy of more glory than Moses ( [354]Hebrews
   3:1-6), God has brought Him up from the dead and will bring up His
   flock as well.

   13:21. The prayer is that God, who has already raised Christ, will now
   make the readers perfect or equipped in very good thing for doing his
   will, and that he will be working or doing in them what is well
   pleasing to Him. All this is to be done through Jesus Christ, in whose
   name the prayer is offered.

   To whom be glory for ever and ever may apply either to God the Father
   or to the Lord Jesus, and scripturally it applies to both. Milligan
   says that "doctrinally it may refer either to God or to Christ, but
   grammatically, it refers properly to God" in this passage. Lenski
   applies it to Christ here and sees it as complementary to the
   description of Christ's exalted position in chapter one.

   13:22. Our author appeals to his readers to bear with his word of
   exhortation, meaning the entire book. He refers to it as a letter,
   although it is not in regular epistolary form. He apparently had much
   more he would have been pleased to write (see [355]5:11; [356]11:32),
   but he stops with these few words which may be read in about an hour.

   13:23. Brother Timothy had been set at liberty, a phrase which might
   refer either to release from prison or to the completion of a mission.
   With him our author will see his readers if Timothy comes shortly. This
   verse is used as an argument for the Pauline authorship of Hebrews
   because of the close relationship between Paul and Timothy. We may wish
   such matters were clearly revealed, but in fact they are not, and no
   specific relationship is given here between the author and Timothy. It
   is generally assumed, however, that this is the Timothy of Paul's
   epistles and Acts, which gives an outward time limit for the date of
   the book. Again, however, we are unable to learn much from the fact,
   for we have no information at all about an imprisonment of Timothy--if
   that is the meaning intended by the phrase here.

   13:24. The writer sends greetings to all the leaders and all the
   saints, indicating that the epistle would be read in a gathered
   assembly of the Christians to whom it was sent (see Colossians 4:16; I
   Thessalonians 5:27).

   They of Italy are simply "the Italians." The Greek words do not tell
   whether they and our author were in Italy or away from Italy at the
   time. All we can know from this verse is that he was in company with
   some Italians, wherever he was. Those who argue for a Roman destination
   of the epistle use this verse as evidence, as do those who argue for a
   Roman origin.

   13:25. The epistle closes with the familiar Christian greeting. Grace
   be with you all. Amen. A suggestive discussion entitled The Grace of
   God is available online by the author of this commentary.

   The subscript in some Bibles concerning the author, origin and
   destination of the Epistle to the Hebrews is a later addition, not part
   of the original text.
